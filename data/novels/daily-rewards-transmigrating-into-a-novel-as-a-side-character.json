      "content": "Chapter 1 - Supreme Bloodline\nThe last thing I remembered was staying up until 3 AM, furiously typing complaints in the comment section of \"The Academy's Fallen Hero\".\nA web novel that had just betrayed every reader's expectations with its terrible pacing and events. The initial plot and idea were amazing, but the author was clearly an amateur and ruined it.\n\"This is garbage! The protagonist is an idiot, the plot makes no sense, and don't even get me started on how they massacred the side characters!\" I had typed, my fingers flying across the keyboard in anger.\nAs I typed, I felt pain in my chest. A frown appeared on my face involuntarily, and my teeth clenched uncontrollably.\nI was losing my body's strength, and my left side was slowly losing control.\nThen... darkness suddenly engulfed me.\nWhen my consciousness returned, I found myself staring at a ceiling decorated with golden chandeliers. The bed beneath me was far too soft, far too luxurious for my studio apartment.\nI started to panic. I was pretty sure I had suffered from a heart attack, immediately I bolted upright, taking in the room around me, expensive looking furniture, silk curtains, and oil paintings that didn't seem familiar.\n\"What the hell—\"\n[DING!]\nA translucent blue screen flashed before my eyes, causing me to stumble backwards in shock.\n[Welcome to the Daily Reward System!]\n[Host: Adrian Blackwood]\n[Current Status: An Extra. You have no benefit except becoming a stepping stone for the Mc.]\n[Daily Login Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your first daily reward?]\nMy blood ran cold. \"Adrian Blackwood...This name is familiar...too familiar to my liking.\"\nIt belonged to a minor character in \"The Academy's Fallen Hero,\" a novel I'd just finished reading. More specifically, it belonged to a disposable extra who died in Chapter 47 during the first major academy crisis.\n\"No way... this can't be real,\" I muttered, but the system screen remained stubbornly present.\nI stumbled to the mirror across the room, and the reflection confirmed my worst fears. Gone was my average face and unkempt hair. Instead, I saw a handsome young man with a sharp jawline, silver hair and deep blue eyes, exactly as Adrian Blackwood had been described in the novel.\nMy mind raced. It seemed like I had died and transmigrated into that damn novel as someone who could only be described as an extra to be disposed of quickly.\nLuckily, I hadn't transmigrated alone. I was bound to a system which would help me escape my fate of being the protagonist's stepping stone.\n\"If I'm stuck in this world, I might as well see what this system offers. Claim daily reward.\"\n[First Daily Reward Claimed!]\n[Congratulations! You have received the Supreme Vampire Bloodline.]\nEh?\n[Initiating your transformation to becoming a vampire!]\nBefore I could process the absurd notification I had just read, pain erupted across my entire body, making my eyes dilate.\nThe pain hit me like a sledgehammer crushing very bone in my body. My muscles contracted uncontrollably as something began changing within me. It felt like fire was being pumped through my veins, rewriting my very DNA with each agonising pulse.\n\"ARGHHH!\" I screamed, collapsing onto the luxurious carpet as waves of pain wracked my body.\nMy vision went white-hot, then blood-red, then darker than the deepest night. I could hear my heartbeat slowing, becoming more powerful. Each beat sent another surge of change through my system. My canine teeth elongated slightly, my nails grew sharper, and my senses exploded with intensity!\nThe scent of everything in the room became overwhelming. But underneath it all was something else... something that made my throat burn with sudden, inexplicable thirst.\nAfter what felt like hours but was probably only minutes, the transformation finally subsided. I lay there gasping, my entire body trembling from the ordeal.\nWhen I finally managed to drag myself back to the mirror, the change was immediately apparent. My skin had taken on a pale, almost snow-like quality. My features had sharpened slightly. My silver hair now had an almost ethereal quality to it, and my blue eyes had gained flecks of crimson that seemed to swirl in the depths.\nI looked like a vampire.\n\"Supreme Vampire Bloodline...I don't know much about vampires in the Chapters I've read, all I know is that they are a very mysterious race, and extremely powerful,\" I whispered, still in shock. \"The protagonist Kyle had a Supreme Phoenix Bloodline in the novel. Supreme bloodlines are supposed to be the pinnacle!\"\nI knew the bloodline hierarchy from the novel: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Mythical, and Supreme. The protagonist's Supreme Phoenix Bloodline was what made him so overpowered, giving him limitless potential and accelerated growth. But having a Supreme bloodline didn't make you instantly invincible.\nIt was all about your rank and the traits you awakened.\nPanic set in as I remembered vampire weaknesses from every movie I'd ever seen. Bloodlines didn't just give you powers, they also had weaknesses. The stronger the bloodline the more powerful the weakness is.\nIn the case of the protagonist, I still remember it very well. It had been an infuriating weakness. Of course, with that damn plot armor the author had given him, the weakness wasn't actually a weakness.\nWith his phoenix bloodline, the protagonist had been given regeneration traits, and various other traits and his weakness?\nIt was that death was permanent.\nThe author was stupid. He had tried to create some sort of phoenixes revive from the ashes scenario but then used that as a weakness.\nI still don't get it to this day.\nShaking my head, I worried about my own weakness, unlike the protagonist I didn't have the plot Armour halo on my head.\nVampires...they had a few weaknesses I can think of.\nSunlight, garlic, running water...\nI had to try them out. I needed to understand my body\nI looked around the room and spotted an open window. The sunlight filtering through it wasn't in my direction.\nWith fear of being confined to the shadows in my heart, I moved towards the open window and cautiously extended my finger toward the morning sunlight streaming through. My pale skin touched the golden rays and... nothing happened. No burning, no pain, not even discomfort.\n\"Thank god,\" I sighed in relief. \"At least I won't be confined to the shadows.\"\nI spent the next few minutes testing other supposed vampire weaknesses. I found a small mirror.\nMy reflection was still there, just paler. I touched the silver picture frames, but there was no burning.\nWhatever kind of vampire I'd become, it wasn't bound by the traditional folklore limitations.\n\"Status,\" I said aloud, and the system responded immediately.\nThe reason I was able to check my status was because everyone in this world could. It wasn't limited only to me.\n[Host: Adrian Blackwood]\n[Bloodline: Supreme Vampire - 10%]\n[Rank: Noble]\n[Traits: Blood Control (2nd Order, Lvl.1), Supernatural Physique (1st Order, Lvl.1)]\nNew ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\n[Aspect: None]\n[Echo: None]\nMy rank was exactly as I'd expected, Noble, the lowest rank. But it was understandable, I had just awakened my bloodline after all.\nThe ranking went Noble, Elite, Transcendent, Commander, Royal, and King. In the novel, Kyle had reached Royal rank by the second year, which was considered impossible by historical standards. That was where I'd stopped reading before my untimely death.\n\"Damn it,\" I cursed myself mentally. \"If I hadn't been so busy complaining about every Chapter, I might have read further and known more about what comes next.\"\nBut then I calmed down, realising I still possessed knowledge of the crucial early timeline events that could save my life.\nI focused on examining my traits more closely.\n[Blood Control]\n[Order: 2]\n[Level: 1]\n[Details: Grants the ability to manipulate blood both within your body and external sources. Can form blood into weapons, enhance physical capabilities by accelerating blood flow, and influence the blood of others within range. Effectiveness scales with the user's rank and the target's resistance. Current range: 3 meters.]\n[Supernatural Physique]\n[Order: 1]\n[Level: 1]\n[Details: Your body has been fundamentally enhanced beyond human. Grants significantly increased physical strength, speed, agility, durability, and regenerative capabilities. Your stamina is vastly improved, and your reaction time is superhuman. All bonus attributes continue to grow stronger with rank advancement.]\nBoth traits were good, especially for someone who was supposed to be a disposable extra character. Blood Control was a second-order trait, which meant it had incredible growth potential. Most students at the academy were lucky to awaken even a first-order trait.\nNaturally, I'm still not comparable to the MC who has a third-order skill before he even enters the academy, but then again, I'm not the MC, so it doesn't matter.\nAs for the second trait. Whilst it was a first-order trait, it was incredibly powerful. It was most definitely at the pinnacle of that order.\nThe Aspect and Echo didn't bother me at 'None'. I needed to kill a beast to get those, and that wasn't an issue.\nThe thirst in my throat reminded me that I'd probably need to figure out feeding soon, but that was a problem for later.\nA gentle knock at the door interrupted my analysis.\n\"Young master, may I come in?\" Came a soft voice from behind the door.",

I looked at the handle alongside the large woodblank in my hand, puzzled.\nIt seemed like I had too much strength, my lack of control and experience didn't help me either.\nSlowly placing it on the side, I ignored it for the time being.\nI had to admit, Adrian's noble status had its perks. The massive wardrobe contained an impressive array of high-quality garments.\nA huge variety of premium shirts, tailored jackets, and perfectly fitted trousers that probably cost more than most people's monthly salaries in this world.\nI grabbed a neat white shirt and dark navy trousers slowly afraid that I might rip them in the process.\nAfter ensuring I looked presentable and had wiped away any traces of the transformation, I called out, \"You may enter.\"\nThe door opened to reveal a young maid with chestnut hair neatly arranged beautifully, wearing the standard black and white uniform of the Blackwood household staff. She stepped in with grace.\nThe moment she entered the room, I was hit by the most intoxicating scent I'd ever experienced. It was like warm honey mixed with the sweetest wine, but underneath it all was something that made every cell in my newly transformed body scream with desperate hunger. Her blood. I could practically hear it flowing through her veins, could sense the pulse of her heartbeat.\nMy hands clenched into fists so tight my nails drew blood from my palms. Every instinct I now possessed was screaming at me to lunge forward, to sink my newfound fangs into that delicate, soft neck and drink deeply. The thirst was overwhelming and terrifying in its intensity.\nI forced myself to remain statue-still, focusing on breathing steadily while fighting the monstrous urges clawing at my consciousness. The internal battle must have shown on my face because the maid's expression changed from politeness to genuine concern.\n\"Young master, did Charlotte do something wrong?\" she asked, her voice trembling slightly as she noticed my rigid posture and what was probably a rather strained expression.\nCharlotte. So that was her name. She seemed like she wanted to ask about my slightly altered appearance. The pale skin and vampire features were probably noticeable to someone who saw Adrian regularly - but thankfully refrained from commenting.\nHer silence stretched longer as I continued my internal war against vampiric instincts, and she apparently interpreted my lack of response as anger. The poor girl looked increasingly nervous, fidgeting in her place as she prepared what sounded like an apology.\n\"I'm terribly sorry if I've done something to displease you, young master. I know I should have knocked more quietly, and perhaps I was presumptuous for asking. Please forgive this lowly servant's—\"\nI shook my head, cutting off her rambling apology. The movement helped clear some of the bloodlust fogging my thoughts. \"No, Charlotte. You've done nothing wrong.\"\nMy voice came out rougher than intended, still strained from the effort of self-control. \"What is it? Do you need something?\"\nRelief flooded her face at my reassurance, though she still seemed puzzled by my behaviour. \"Yes, young master. Your fiancée has arrived and is currently waiting for you in the main living room. She specifically requested to speak with you privately.\"\nI raised an eyebrow in genuine confusion. \"Fiancée?\"\nThis was completely new information. In all my memories of reading \"The Academy's Fallen Hero,\" there had been no mention of Adrian Blackwood having a fiancée. The character had been portrayed as a lonely, mediocre student with no significant romantic connections.\nJust an expendable background character whose only purpose was to motivate the protagonist.\nCuriosity overrode my concern about bloodlust management. I needed to see who this mysterious fiancée was and understand why this detail had been omitted from the novel.\n\"I'll be down shortly,\" I told Charlotte, who curtsied and departed with visible relief.\nI took a moment to centre myself, practising the breathing techniques I remembered from meditation videos I'd watched in my previous life. The thirst was still there, a constant burning in my throat, but it was manageable now. I'd have to figure out feeding later - hopefully, there were alternatives to sucking the blood of innocent maids.\nMaking my way downstairs through corridors lined with expensive artwork and family portraits, I entered the main living room and immediately froze.\nSeated elegantly on the sofa was one of the most beautiful women I'd ever seen, in this life or my previous one. She had flowing golden hair that cascaded down her shoulders till her lower back.\nHer eyes were a striking sapphire blue. Her face were perfectly symmetrical, with high cheekbones and full lips that belonged on a classical statue. She was the true symbol of the golden ratio.\nBut her beauty wasn't what made my blood run cold.\nThis was Seraphina Goldenheart, one of the main female leads from \"The Academy's Fallen Hero.\" In the novel, she was Kyle's primary love interest.\nA brilliant noble daughter with a rare Light Magic bloodline who eventually became one of the protagonist's most trusted companions and romantic partner.\nDamn it,\nI thought grimly.\nNo wonder Adrian wanted to kill the protagonist in the original story. Kyle was literally trying to put a green hat on his head!\nThe revelation painted Adrian's antagonistic behaviour toward Kyle in an entirely different light. From his perspective, the protagonist was the villain who had swooped in to steal the woman he was supposed to marry. It was a classic case of the \"hero\" inadvertently destroying someone else's life while remaining completely oblivious to the consequences.\nSeraphina's eyes widened slightly as she took in my appearance. I could see her checking the changes. But after a moment of scrutiny, she seemed to dismiss the alterations as unimportant.\n\"Adrian. We need to talk.\"\nShe stood gracefully, her posture radiating confidence. \"I've come to inform you that I will be breaking off our engagement.\"\nAfter she had spoken, a moment of silence flooded the room.",

      "content": "Chapter 3 - Seraphina\nI could see in her expression that she was expecting a specific reaction.\nThe way she was talking to me didn't strike me as polite whatsoever. Just from that look on her eyes I realised Adrian's previous personality towards her.\nIt also fit in with the narrative in my head. I remembered that he did have some behaviours that could only be described as one thing.\nHe was a simp through and through.\nShe probably expected the same pathetic pleading that the original Adrian had apparently subjected her to before.\nHer stance suggested she was prepared to reject anything I say.\nI could tell she was fed up with the previous Adrian. I didn't complain. In fact, this was perfect.\nThe engagement had been a death sentence I hadn't even known about. Getting involved in any romantic complications with one of Kyle's destined love interests was exactly the kind of thing that would put me directly in the protagonist's crosshairs.\nThe original Adrian's jealousy toward Seraphina had probably been one of the factors that led to his eventual demise.\n\"I'll speak to my parents and have the engagement formally dissolved,\" I said calmly, meeting her gaze without a trace of the desperation she was clearly expecting.\nSeraphina blinked in surprise, her carefully prepared speech apparently derailed by my unexpected cooperation. She had obviously been braced for a fight, for emotional manipulation, for anything except my calm response.\n\"I...\" she started, then stopped, looking genuinely confused. \"You're not going to argue? Or try to convince me to reconsider?\"\nI shook my head. \"If you want to end the engagement, then it should be ended. I have no intention of keeping someone here when they don't want to.\"\nThe relief in her expression was unmistakable, though it was mixed with puzzlement. She had clearly expected this conversation to be much more difficult and unpleasant.\n\"I... thank you,\" she said finally, some of the tension leaving her shoulders. \"I was prepared for this to be much more complicated.\"\nHaving completed her goal, she stood to leave, pausing at the doorway. She seemed as if she wanted to say something, but then changed her mind and continued on her way out.\nAfter she left, I sat on the chair she had vacated. I had successfully avoided one major death flag by eliminating my romantic entanglement with Kyle's future love interest.\n...\nSeraphina stood frozen outside Adrian's door for several moments, her hand still resting on the handle she had just released. The conversation had gone nothing like she had anticipated.\nFor months, every time she had even hinted at questioning their engagement, Adrian would launch into desperate pleas. He would promise to change, to become stronger, to be worthy of her. His eyes would fill with tears as he spoke about their fathers' sacred promise, about how she was the light of his life, about how he couldn't imagine existing without her.\nShe had steeled herself for another exhausting round of emotional tantrum, prepared responses to his inevitable arguments, and had even practised maintaining her resolve in the face of his tears. Instead, he had simply... agreed.\nA strange hollowness settled in her chest, not quite disappointment, but something uncomfortably close to it. She had grown so accustomed to Adrian's desperate attention, his constant attempts to win her favour, that his sudden indifference felt almost... wrong.\nStop it,\nshe chastised herself, shaking her head firmly.\nThis is exactly what you wanted. He is probably trying to play hard-to-get.\nShe began walking down the corridor, her shoes clicking against the marble floor. The engagement had been arranged before they were born, from a promise their fathers had made to each other on what they both believed would be their deathbeds. If they survived this ordeal, their children would be bound together, uniting their noble houses.\nInitially, Seraphina hadn't minded the arrangement. Adrian had been pleasant enough as a child, and she had accepted it as simply another duty that came with her noble heritage. But as they grew older, his complete lack of ambition had become increasingly annoying.\nWhile she pushed herself to excel in combat, leadership, Adrian seemed content to drift through his classes with mediocre grades. He showed no interest in advancing his rank, no drive to prove himself worthy of their family names. Worst of all, he seemed to lack any real personality beyond his obsession with her.\nEvery conversation had revolved around the engagement, their future together, and how much he needed her. He never spoke of goals, dreams, or aspirations beyond securing her affections. It was suffocating.\nAnd yet...\nShe paused mid-step, remembering the calm confidence in his voice, the way he had looked at her without that desperate, pleading expression she had grown so tired of seeing. For just a moment, there had been something almost intriguing about this new Adrian.\nNo,\nshe thought firmly, resuming her walk.\nDon't think too much. He's probably just finally accepted reality.\nStill, as she walked away, she couldn't quite shake the image of his steady blue eyes meeting hers without flinching, without begging.\nShe pushed the thought away with discipline. She had worked too hard to break free from this engagement to start second-guessing herself now simply because Adrian had finally shown a shred of dignity.\nShe had already asked for the break off; there was no turning back now. She wasn't the type to turn back after making a decision, and never will!\n...\nA few hours had passed since Seraphina had left, and I was beginning to understand just how drastically my transformation had changed everything. My strength was completely beyond my current control.\nI had already shattered three teacups simply by picking them up, and I cracked a wooden chair by using the arm stand to stand up.\nThe worst part, however, was the constant, gnawing thirst that seemed to intensify whenever anyone came near. Every servant who passed by my room carried with them the intoxicating scent of warm blood flowing through their veins. My hearing could pick up the pulse of their heartbeats, and it took every ounce of my willpower not to...\nI shook my head violently, trying to dispel the increasingly intrusive thoughts.\nA gentle knock interrupted my struggle with self-control.\n\"Young Master Adrian?\" came Charlotte's familiar voice. \"The Madam has requested your presence for dinner. The family is gathering in the dining hall.\"\nI nodded, then realised she couldn't see me through the door. \"I'll be right there, Charlotte.\"\nʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt",

      "content": "Chapter 4 - Blackwood Family\nI approached the door carefully, making sure to barely touch the handle. At least I wouldn't have to worry about breaking that particular piece.\nThe dining hall was as grand as everything else in the Blackwood estate. A long table that could seat twenty, crystal chandeliers hanging over silver cutlery. But my attention was immediately drawn to the two figures already seated at the head of the table.\nSo this is Adrian's father, I thought, studying the imposing man with steel-grey hair and sharp, calculating eyes.\nDuke Marcus Blackwood sat with perfect posture, his presence powerful even in the simple act of reviewing some documents while waiting for dinner to be served. Everything about him screamed authority and discipline.\nAnd this must be Adrian's mother.\nDuchess Elena Blackwood was elegance personified, with flowing hazelnut hair and kind blue eyes that seemed to soften the entire atmosphere of the room. She wore a gentle smile as she arranged flowers in a small vase, humming softly to herself. Where her husband was all sharp edges and stern authority, she radiated warmth and compassion.\nIt was a wonder how the original Adrian had turned out to be such a weak-willed disappointment.\n\"Adrian, darling,\" my mother said warmly as I entered, her face lighting up with affection. \"Come, sit. The cook has prepared your favorite. Roasted duck with honey glaze.\"\nMy father looked up from his papers, giving me a measured nod. \"Son. I trust you are progressing adequately? Your bloodline should awaken soon; you need to be careful and let me know what you get. I will try to support you before the academy starts.\"\n\"Yes, Father,\" I replied, carefully pulling out my chair and sitting down with as much control as I could manage. The wood creaked ominously under what should have been normal pressure.\nDuke Marcus raised an eyebrow at the sound but said nothing.\nMy mother glanced at me then said something that made my worst fears come true.\n\"Adrian, honey. You look different, why is that?\" She asked me, tilting her head.\nI immediately responded, having thought of an answer beforehand.\n\"I'm trying out a new product on the market, it helps the skin.\" I said, trying to hide my canine whilst I spoke.\nLuckily, my response was taken positively and everything progressed.\nThe servants began bringing out the courses, and I had to admit that everything looked absolutely magnificent. The roasted duck was perfectly golden, accompanied by an array of colorful vegetables and delicate sauces that would have made my mouth water in my previous life.\nMy mother beamed with pride. \"I asked the cook to add just a touch more honey this time, the way you used to love it when you were little.\"\nI lifted a forkful of the duck to my mouth, trying to appear normal despite the looks my senses were picking up from both parents. The moment the food touched my tongue, however, my stomach lurched violently.\nThe taste was absolutely revolting. Like fermented fish that had been left to rot in the sun for decades, mixed with something that might have been spoiled milk. The texture felt slimy and wrong, and the smell that had seemed so appetizing moments before now made me feel like I was going to be sickTʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nI barely managed to swallow the bite, my face turning pale as I fought down the urge to vomit right there at the dinner table.\n\"Adrian?\" My mother's gentle voice was immediately filled with concern. \"Sweetheart, what's wrong? You look terrible.\"\n\"I...\" I set down my fork carefully, praying I wouldn't snap the delicate silver in half. \"I'm feeling quite ill, actually. Perhaps something I ate earlier. Please excuse me... enjoy your food, father, mother.\"\nI stood up slowly, still fighting my rebellious stomach.\nBoth of my parents exchanged glances. My mother's filled with worry, my father's more suspicious.\n\"Of course, darling,\" my mother said softly. \"Go rest. I'll have Charlotte bring you some tea later.\"\n\"Thank you, Mother. Father.\" I bowed slightly and made my exit as gracefully as possible, though I could feel their eyes following me all the way to the door.\nThey looked at each other, then Duke Marcus smiled.\n\"It seems like our son is getting the symptoms of his bloodline awakening. I wonder what it is. I've never had those kinds of symptoms, so it's definitely not my talent.\"\nElena nodded, though she was still worried about her only son. \"Not mine either.\"\nI had barely made it halfway up the stairs when I heard Charlotte's quick footsteps behind me.\n\"Young Master!\" she called out. \"Please wait!\"\nI paused, turning to face the maid who had served my family for her entire young life.\n\"I'm so sorry, Young Master,\" she said, wringing her hands anxiously. \"If the cooking wasn't to your liking, I can speak to the kitchen staff immediately. Perhaps the cook used different seasonings, or maybe the duck wasn't prepared properly...\"\n\"Charlotte, it's not...\" I started, then stopped. How could I possibly explain that human food now tasted like rotting garbage because I'd been transformed into a vampire?\n\"It's not anyone's fault. I think I might be coming down with something. The food looked and smelled wonderful. It's just my stomach that's the problem.\"\nThe kind maid looked only slightly reassured. \"Shall I bring you some broth? Or perhaps some plain bread? Sometimes simple foods are easier when you're feeling poorly.\"\nNothing you could bring me would help, I thought grimly. Unless you give me your blood, I won't be satisfied.\n\"That's very thoughtful, Charlotte, but I think I just need to rest for now. Perhaps tomorrow I'll feel better.\"\nAs I continued up to my room, my mind raced. If I couldn't eat normal food, what exactly was I supposed to do? Just drink blood? The thirst that had been gnawing at me all day suddenly felt much more urgent and terrifying.\nI was going to have to figure out how to feed myself... and it needed to be soon.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "content": "Chapter 5 - Blood Thirst\nInside my room, the thirst had evolved from a dull ache into something resembling lava coursing through my veins. Every minute that passed made it worse, and no amount of water or attempting to distract myself could alleviate the burning sensation in my throat.\nI paced back and forth across the luxurious carpet, my enhanced hearing picking up every sound in the manor, the servants cleaning up after dinner, even the breathing of the guards patrolling the grounds. But underneath it all, I could hear something else that made the thirst spike violently: heartbeats. Dozens of them, pumping blood through warm, living bodies just floors away from me.\nThe rational part of my mind kept circling back to the obvious solution, tell my parents about my vampire awakening.\nDuke Marcus Blackwood was one of the most powerful nobles in the kingdom, with power and resources that could easily help me navigate this new existence. My mother's gentle nature would ensure I received nothing but support and understanding.\nBut I couldn't bring myself to do it.\nNot yet.\nI knew from my knowledge of the novel that my very existence had already altered the timeline significantly. Breaking off the engagement with Seraphina, my sudden personality change - these were all ripples that would spread outward in ways I couldn't predict. But telling my parents about becoming a vampire? That would be like throwing a boulder into a still pond.\nThe Duke would immediately begin making contingency plans. He'd start researching vampire physiology, possibly even reaching out to his noble friends. My mother would worry constantly, insisting I get the best early development.\nTheir entire political strategy would shift to accommodate having a son with a supreme bloodline, which could have massive implications for the kingdom's power structure.\nI needed to maintain some semblance of the original timeline, at least until I could gain enough strength and system rewards to handle the chaos that would inevitably follow. The academy's entrance exam was in just a few days, and there were several crucial early events I needed to navigate successfully before I could afford to completely derail the story.\nBut as another wave of thirst crashed over me, making my fangs extend involuntarily, I realised I was rapidly approaching the point where I wouldn't have a choice.\nAfter what felt like hours of internal struggle, my body made the decision for me. The thirst had become so intense that I could barely think straight, and my senses were picking up the scent of blood from every living thing in the manor with agonising clarity.\nThere was only one solution that wouldn't completely expose my secret: a midnight hunt.\nI remembered reading about the Whispering Woods in the novel, a forest located just outside the city limits that was home to various magical beasts. Most were Noble rank, making them perfect training grounds for academy students. More importantly, their blood might be able to satisfy this impossible thirst without requiring me to take the blood of any humans.\nThe forest was only about ten minutes away if I used my speed, and the original Adrian had never shown any interest in beast hunting, so no one would expect me to venture there.\nI moved to my wardrobe and selected the darkest, most common, practical clothing I could find. The original Adrian's wardrobe was filled with expensive but delicate noble attire, but I managed to find a set of dark leather pants and a simple black hooded robe that would allow for easier movement.\nAs I dressed, I caught sight of myself in the mirror again. My pale skin seemed to glow slightly in the moonlight streaming through the window, and my eyes had taken on a more pronounced crimson tint. The thirst was literally changing my appearance, making me look more like a vampire with each passing hour.\nI couldn't wait any longer.\nMoving to the window, I tested my new physical capabilities by carefully opening the heavy glass panels. They moved like they were made of paper under my strength. The drop to the ground was at least twenty feet, but my instincts told me it would be manageable.\nI slipped out into the cool night air, landing silently on the manicured grass below. My supernatural physique absorbed the impact effortlessly, and I found myself moving through the shadows with a grace I'd never possessed as a human in my previous life.The source of thɪs content is ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nThe guards patrolling the estate grounds spotted me walking, but they didn't question it. After all, the previous Adrian used to go out at night, too. They didn't dare question me, how could they as mere guards?\nWithin minutes, I had cleared the estate boundaries and was sprinting through the darkened streets toward the Whispering Woods. My speed was intoxicating; I was moving faster than any horse, yet I felt like I could maintain this pace for hours.\nThe city walls loomed ahead of me, but I had anticipated this obstacle. I knew from the novel that there were several gaps in the older sections where the previous Mc would sneak out for unauthorised beast-hunting expeditions that improved his power rapidly.\nAs I approached the forest's edge, I smiled. The blood wasn't the only reason I was going to this forest; there was another reason that made me come here specifically.\nThere were actually two opportunities in this forest. Surprisingly, for an ordinary forest that had existed for decades, it had quite the hidden treasures waiting to be discovered.\nI remembered reading that Kyle would eventually gain a powerful artifact buried deep within these woods. He'd stumble upon it while fighting an Earth Golem, discovering some superior-ranked item that would boost his power quite decently. Naturally, I wasn't stupid enough to steal an item that the main character himself was destined to find, that would be asking for trouble and would definitely alter too much of the timeline.\nInstead, I was going after an item that another background character had encountered in the novel.\nI remembered this particular scene very well for two reasons. First, because the damn writer thought he was being clever and unique. He had given a genuinely powerful item to some random background character, not one of Kyle's future companions, not someone important to the plot, just some nobody academy student who had wandered into the wrong part of the forest.",

      "content": "Chapter 6 - Fighting a Noble-Rank Beast!\nThe writer was essentially trying to make his world feel more realistic by saying, \"Look, I'm giving powerful items to random people too! Not everything revolves around the main character!\" It was his attempt at showing that opportunities existed for everyone, not just the protagonist.\nThe second reason I remembered it so clearly was because of how absurdly wasteful it felt as a reader.\nThis background character, I think his name was Marcus or Martin or something equally forgettable, had found this incredible artifact, used it for maybe two Chapters to show off during some minor academy competition, and then just... disappeared from the story entirely.\nNaturally, I might be wrong and that character could return later in the story, but I couldn't tell since I'd died before finishing the novel. Knowing that writer and the massive backlash he'd received from readers about his plot choices, it was most definitely just a throwaway background character who was meant to grab the item and then vanish like he'd gone out for milk and never came back.\nThe item in question was called the \"Crimson Moon Pendant\"\nA blood-red crystal that gave regeneration, allowing the user to absorb their opponent's spilt blood to use as life force. For a vampire like me, it would be absolutely perfect.\nThe ability to store blood inside that pendant was very useful. I could use it to attack using my blood control skill, or I could also use it to enhance my regeneration.\nI could remember the exact location from the novel too. The background character had been fleeing from a pack of Wolves when he'd stumbled into a hidden cave. The pendant had been sitting there for who knows how long, just waiting for someone to claim it.\nThe best part? According to the timeline, that background character wouldn't stumble upon it for another few weeks. I had a perfect window to claim it for myself without disrupting any major plot points.\nI entered the Whispering Woods, my senses immediately picking up nothing nearby.\nThe Wolves' territory was about two miles into the forest, and the hidden cave was just beyond their hunting grounds. I'd need to be careful not to alert the entire pack, but with my knowledge and new skill, it shouldn't be too difficult.\nAfter all, that background character had managed to survive whilst only having a single first order trait which he had gotten by reaching elite rank.\nAs I moved deeper into the woods, following the mental map I'd constructed from the novel's descriptions, I couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement.\nThis was exactly the kind of advantage that made transmigrating into a novel worthwhile, foreknowledge that could turn a background character's lucky find into my own stepping stone to survival.\nThe thirst in my throat reminded me that I'd need to feed along the way, but that would just be killing two birds with one stone. By the time I returned to the manor, I'd be fed, armed with a powerful artefact, and one step closer to changing my fate in this world.\n...\nI encountered the first beast, and it was actually a very common one that I recognised immediately from the novel's countless descriptions.\nThe creature resembled a sloth, but scaled up to the size of a small bear. Its matted brown fur hung in thick clumps, and its oversized claws gleamed menacingly in the moonlight as it hung from a massive tree. Despite its intimidating appearance and the low growl rumbling from its throat, I wasn't particularly worried.\nI already had a few items that made sure I stayed alive, despite my inexperience with my talent and newfound power. Adrian had been quite spoiled. In the storage ring on my finger, I had many potions, and I've already worn some defensive items that made sure I would stay alive in an encounter with a noble rank beast.\nSecondly, I knew a lot about the beasts inside this forest. So, to be armed with so much knowledge, items and still do nothing was definitely idiotic.\n\"I refuse to be like the characters I hate.\"\nThe beast in front of me was called Lazarus Sloth.\nA Noble-rank magical beast known for its deceptively slow movements and surprising bursts of speed when threatened. In the novel, these creatures had been used as training dummies for first-year academy students, dangerous enough to provide a challenge but predictable enough that casualties were rare.\nMore importantly, I had a second-order trait, and I knew exactly what that meant in terms of power scaling.\nHaving a second-order trait meant I was literally one in several million. Throughout the entire novel, the only people I could recall possessing traits of similar order or higher were Kyle and his eventual companions, the main cast, who would go on to reshape the world. Apart from them, no beast, no student, and none of the known figures in the capital had awakened anything beyond first-order traits at the elite rank, let alone Noble rank.\nTo put this in perspective: very few were lucky to awaken any trait at all during the Noble rank. The vast majority had to wait until they reached Elite rank before their bloodline manifested any abilities. Those rare few who did awaken traits at the Noble rank typically got one first-order trait at best.\nMy father, Duke Marcus Blackwood, who in the original timeline would eventually die under Kyle's hand while trying to avenge my death, had possessed a second-order trait.\nBut he had only awakened it when he reached Royal rank, making him one of the most feared combatants in the kingdom.\nThe fact that I had awakened Blood Control as a second-order trait while still at Noble rank meant my potential was absolutely monstrous. In raw talent terms, I was only second to the protagonist, his team and the main villains.\nThe Lazarus Sloth finally noticed my presence and began its slow descent from the tree, its movements slow as it sized me up. Its small, beady eyes glowed, and I could see its muscles tensing beneath that deceptively sluggish exterior.Follow current novels on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nI flexed my fingers experimentally, feeling the Blood Control trait responding to my will. I could sense the creature's life force, the steady rhythm of its heartbeat, the warm flow of blood through its veins.\nMy vampire nature was practically salivating at the prospect of feeding, and the burning thirst in my throat intensified.\n\"Alright,\" I murmured, settling into a combat stance that felt somewhat unfamiliar, but I had to make due for now. \"Let's see what a second-order trait can do against you.\"\nThe beast's eyes narrowed, and suddenly its lazy facade dropped entirely. With explosive speed that would have caught most Noble-rank fighters off guard, it launched itself directly at me, claws extended and ready to tear me apart.",

      "content": "Chapter 7 - Crimson Moon Pendant\nI didn't dare try to use the sword in my storage ring. Despite my enhanced physical strength, I had absolutely no combat training or sword skills whatsoever. Fighting toe-to-toe with a Lazarus Sloth without any tactical advantage would be suicide, regardless of how powerful my bloodline was.\nSo I decided to use what I had just been bestowed, the power of blood manipulation.\nI locked eyes with the creature as it launched itself toward me, its massive claws gleaming under the moonlight.\nWithout wasting a second, I channeled my mana into my Blood Control trait and focused it on one specific target, its eyes.\nThe result was brutal.\nBlood vessels burst like tiny explosions, and crimson liquid splattered across the forest floor as the sloth's eyes ruptured from the inside out.\nThe beast let out a horrific shriek of pain and confusion, stumbling mid-leap and crashing head-first into the ground with a thunderous impact.\nBlood continued to erupt from various points on its body as I maintained my focus, targeting major blood vessels to keep it disoriented and weakened. The creature thrashed wildly, but it was essentially fighting blind and growing weaker by the second.\nImmediately, I summoned my sword from the storage ring.\nA well-crafted blade that had belonged to the original Adrian. While the sloth was stunned and bleeding, I ran toward it and drove the weapon deep into its neck, severing the major arteries and ending its suffering quickly.\nI had actually killed the damn beast. Quite easily too, I had underestimated my power but it was fine.\nA delayed kill was better than dying for being arrogant.\nThe rush of victory was intoxicating, made even more satisfying by how efficiently my Blood Control had turned what should have been a dangerous fight for someone with no experience into a one-sided execution.\nIn the novel, once you killed a magical beast, there was always a chance it would drop an \"aspect\" or a \"echo.\"\nThe echo was an item, whilst the skill was an aspect.\nAspects were different from traits in that they came from external sources rather than your bloodline, making them generally less powerful but still useful supplements to your natural abilities.\nUnfortunately, when I searched the sloth's remains, I found nothing. No glowing orbs, just a dead magical beast.\nWell, I had expected as much. Lazarus Sloths weren't exactly known for dropping valuable loot, and my luck probably wasn't good enough to get something on my first kill.\nI looked down at the blood pooling around the sloth's body. While the idea of drinking sloth blood wasn't particularly appealing, I had to admit it smelled... decent. Not appetizing exactly, but not revolting either.\nMy thirst was still burning in my throat, and I needed to know how beast blood would affect my vampire physiology.\nI walked toward the creature's body and, feeling slightly ridiculous, extended my canines and bit into its neck where the major artery existed.\nThe taste was surprisingly tolerable, not great, but not the disgusting mess I had feared either. It was like eating bland food that nonetheless satisfied some deep hunger. The burning thirst in my throat began to subside almost immediately, replaced by a warm, satisfied feeling that spread through my entire body.\nClearly, beast blood wasn't as rich or satisfying as other blood would probably be, but it was adequate for my needs. At least now my immediate thirst was fulfilled, though I made a mental note to monitor how long this satisfaction would last before the urge returned.\nAfter wiping the blood from my mouth, cleaning my sword, and storing some blood in a large vial I had brought from the manor, I continued deeper into the forest.\nI was following the path that the background character had used in the novel. The hidden cave with the Crimson Moon Pendant was still waiting, and now that I'd successfully tested my combat abilities, I felt much more confident about reaching it.\nThe section of the forest I was heading to, were home to wolves, after understanding my current strength, I realised they posed little threat to someone of my current power.\nWith my strength and the success of my Blood Control against the sloth, I no longer feared encountering them.\nThe moonlight filtered through the canopy above, creating an almost ethereal atmosphere as I moved silently between the trees.\nMy vampire nature seemed perfectly suited to this environment, the darkness felt comfortable rather than threatening, and my senses picked up the details of my surroundings.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nAccording to my memory of the novel, I should encounter the wolf pack territory in about another half-mile, and the hidden cave would be just beyond that.\nThe Crimson Moon Pendant would soon be mine, and with it, a significant advantage in the challenges that lay ahead.\nSoon, I arrived at the location where I was meant to encounter the wolves. But they weren't there. After a quick moment of thinking, it made sense.\nThe wolves were hunting in this area a few weeks from now. As for now? They were probably somewhere else entirely, perhaps hunting in different territories.\nI placed my palm on my face in shame. It was unlike me to think so stupidly, but I gave myself the benefit of the doubt. I'm still getting used to everything going on, the transmigration, the vampire transformation, navigating a world I'd only read about. The fate of my character had also made things worse. Had anyone been in my position, they would have also made some silly mistakes because of such sudden, drastic changes.\nI continued forward, making my way towards the hidden cave. Everything went smoothly - no obstructions, no unexpected encounters, nothing.\nUntil I stood outside of it.\nI was initially happy about arriving there without any trouble, but something felt wrong. Not encountering a single wolf in the entire area didn't seem promising at all. In fact, it was deeply unsettling. Whenever such unnatural silence occurred in magical forests, it typically meant one thing: there was a predator in the area.\nSomething powerful enough that even the wolves had fled or been killed.\nI hoped desperately that whatever predator had claimed this territory wasn't inside the cave I was about to enter. But hope alone wouldn't keep me alive; I needed to stay vigilant and prepared for the worst-case scenario.",

      "content": "Chapter 8 - Elite-Ranked Serpant!\nI drew my sword slowly, holding it in front of me in a defensive position. My senses were on high alert, scanning for movement or any signs that might indicate danger.\nThe cave itself was exactly as described in the novel.\nA narrow opening partially concealed by hanging moss and fallen leaves, with weird writings carved into the stone archway above the entrance.\nBut the absolute silence was deafening. No rustling leaves, not even the sound of wind moving through the trees. It was as if the entire area was holding its breath, waiting for something terrible to happen.\nMy nose was picking up something else, too. It was metallic, like old blood, but mixed with something else I couldn't identify.\nWhatever had driven the wolves away might very well be waiting for me inside that cave. But the Crimson Moon Pendant was too valuable to abandon now, especially when I'd come this far and taken these risks.\nI thought about returning to the manor to familiarise myself with my strength, get more training in, and get more comfortable, but I couldn't do it. If I couldn't even survive with such powerful traits, how could I possibly survive what's coming next?\nI took a deep breath, steeling myself for what might come, and stepped carefully through the gap between the moss-covered stones.\nThe moment I crossed the threshold, the temperature dropped noticeably. My eyes that gave me night vision adjusted immediately, revealing a narrow tunnel that descended deeper into the earth than the novel had described.\nI continued, my sword still in front of me. I walked slowly, holding my breath.\nIf there was anything inside this cave, I didn't want to alert it to my presence.\nThe vial of blood was on my waist, ready to be used at a moment's notice. I had collected the blood so that I could use it as a weapon if needed - my Blood Control trait should work on external blood sources as well as what was flowing through living creatures.\nSoon, I arrived at where the background character had found the pendant. I remembered the location really well because of how distinctive the area was.\nThe pendant was resting between two rocks near a small underground pond inside the cave, exactly as described in the novel. The water reflected the ceiling, creating an almost ethereal atmosphere.\nBut there was an issue. My instincts had indeed been right. There was a beast in front of me. An Elite-ranked beast, too.\nThe beast was a serpent, a silver serpent with scales so translucent that I could see the water's reflection. Its body had a beauty that only made it more terrifying.\nI gulped inaudibly.\nThankfully, the serpent was sleeping, coiled near the water's edge with a large bulge in its midsection, clearly digesting one of its recent prey.\nThe serpent was about three meters long, which wasn't small by any measure. An Elite-ranked magical beast was an entire tier above my current Noble rank, meaning it would be a considerable challenge considering my current experience. I might get seriously injured or die in the process if I had to fight it.\nI took a moment to assess my options. The pendant was a considerable distance away from the serpent's resting position. In theory, I could grab the pendant and leave without confronting the beast at all.\nBut that all depended on how sensitive the serpent's senses were while sleeping.\nI decided to take the lower-risk approach, attempting to retrieve the pendant without awakening the creature.\nI began moving toward the two rocks, each step slow and silent. I made sure to not trip on rocks, break twigs or make any random sound that would awaken the serpent.\nThe serpent was about ten meters away from my current position. It wasn't too far, but not dangerously close either. Its breathing was slow and controlled, suggesting it was in deep sleep.\nAs I carefully manoeuvred between the two rocks where the pendant lay, the space proved tighter than I had anticipated. The Crimson Moon Pendant was wedged firmly between the stones, and despite my best efforts to extract it silently, it scraped against both rocks with a clink.\nThe sound echoed through the cave like a death knell.\nThe serpent's eyes bolted open immediately, twin orbs of silver that fixed on me.\nHISS!\nIts massive head rose from its coiled position, and I could see its forked tongue flicking out to taste the air, analysing my scent and threat level.\nFor a frozen moment, we stared at each other across the cave. Then the serpent's body began to uncoil and rise, as it inspected me.Follow current novels on ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nI gripped my sword tightly and reached for the vial of blood at my waist.\nWith the Crimson Moon Pendant now in my hand, I was no longer worried. With such a powerful item that enhances my regeneration and allows me to convert blood into usable life force, I no longer feared the serpent.\nDespite my new confidence, I didn't let that get to my head. I knew overconfidence could still get me killed.\nI placed the pendant around my neck and smiled at the serpent that was slowly slithering towards me. It thinks I'm weak prey, I could tell from the gleam in its silver eyes, the way it moved with confidence rather than caution.\nNot today.\nI opened the vial in my hand. The crimson liquid rose from the container in a flowing stream and was absorbed into my pendant. I had done that because the pendant allowed me to convert blood into pure life force that would enhance my combat power.\nI activated the pendant's power, and immediately the blood within it evaporated and transformed into raw energy that flooded through my body. Suddenly, I felt much more powerful, my muscles felt denser, my reflexes sharper, and my overall power significantly boosted.\nWithout wasting time, I activated my Blood Control trait with a new strategy in mind.",

      "content": "Chapter 9 - My First Aspect!\nEveryone knew that blood was constantly circulating through the body, maintaining a careful pressure balance. So I decided to drastically increase the flow rate within the serpent's circulatory system.\nNaturally, I increased it by a large margin, if I only made a small adjustment and it proved counterproductive, I'd probably die because I dug my own grave.\nAs I spent my mana into my trait, I could feel the blood pressure inside the serpent increasing exponentially. I could feel it through my connection to the trait, the way the blood vessels strained against the unnatural pressure, the way the vessels began to rupture under the stress. I continued pouring my mana into the attack, and they finally broke.\nThe snake that had been midway through attacking me suddenly dropped to the ground, writhing in agony. Blood began flowing from its mouth, nose, and eyes as internal bleeding wreaked havoc on its system.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nI had damaged it severely from the inside, but the attack had cost me dearly, around forty percent of my overall mana reserves.\nI took a step back to reassess the situation. The serpent was badly wounded but still alive and dangerous. I still had another vial of blood with me, and while I could use my mana to create blood weapons directly, that would be wasteful when I had readily available blood.\nI opened the second vial and used my Blood Control to shape the crimson liquid into a solid sledgehammer. The blood took form under my manipulation, forming a weapon that was both dense and deadly.\nThe pendant continued reinforcing me with converted life force, making me feel stronger and more vital with each passing second.\nThe serpent was struggling to rise, its movements now sluggish and uncoordinated due to the internal damage. This was my chance to finish it before it could recover or attempt any desperate counterattacks.\nTime to see how effective a blood-forged weapon could be against Elite-ranked scales.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nThe sledgehammer slammed into the serpent's head with devastating power. The serpent had tried to dodge at the last second, but its internal injuries had made it too slow and unsteady.\nMy supernatural physique trait, coupled with the pendant's life force enhancement, had pushed my base physical power to what felt like Elite rank levels without even using my Blood Control ability.\nThe blood weapon struck true, and the impact was catastrophic to say the least.\nThe serpent's head collapsed against the cave floor with a sickening crunch. Its skull cracked like an eggshell, spider-web fractures spreading across the beautiful silver scales.\nThe creature was clearly dying, but I could still see fierce unwillingness burning in its eyes. Even with mortal wounds, it kept trying to slither toward me, driven by pure instinct.\n\"Rest,\" I muttered softly, raising the sledgehammer one final time in the air before bringing it down to end the serpent's suffering.\nAs its life finally faded, my eyes widened in amazement. A glowing orange orb materialized above the serpent's corpse.\nThe orange color indicated an Elite-rank drop, either an aspect or an echo. Either would be absolutely incredible, far beyond what I had any right to expect from my first real combat against a higher-ranked opponent.\nI quickly approached the orb and grabbed it, feeling the warm energy flow into my body as the system processed the reward.\n[Aspect: Serpent Scales]\n[Rank: Elite]\n[Type: Passive]\n[Details: Grants complete poison resistance against toxins of Elite rank and below. Your body naturally neutralizes venoms, acids, and other harmful substances that would normally cause severe damage or death.]\nThe aspect was incredibly valuable. Poison resistance against Elite rank and below meant I could now fight venomous creatures without fear of their most dangerous tool, venom.\nThis would be invaluable in the academy's dangerous training exercises and the various crises that would unfold throughout the story.\nIt was an excellent first aspect. Practical, defensive, and with broad applications. A few of the academy's combat scenarios involved creatures that relied heavily on poison or toxic abilities, so this would give me a significant advantage over my peers.\nI felt the aspect integrate with my body, a warm tingling sensation spreading through my skin as my cellular structure adapted to process and neutralize toxins.\nThe change was subtle but profound. I could sense that my blood itself had become resistant to foreign contamination.\nWith the Crimson Moon Pendant around my neck and the Serpent Scales aspect now part of my abilities, I had gained two powerful advantages in a single night.\nI cut open the snake's main blood vessel and stored a huge portion of blood in the pendant. I kept storing until the pendant could no longer carry any more.\nThe pendant had carried around two litres of blood, which wasn't bad at all.\n[Crimson Moon Pendant]\n[Grade: Superior]\n[Details: Stores up to two litres of blood. The blood can be ignited and used to improve the user's overall combat power. The effect of improvement depends on the rank of the blood. The highest rank is royal-rank blood.]\nTime to head home and see what tomorrow's daily login reward would bring.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nAs I headed back home, I couldn't help but ponder on a few things. How did I transmigrate into this novel, is there a reason behind it?\nThe pondering left me with nothing but more questions. Hence, I decided to stop worrying about the future that would reveal itself soon enough.\nFor now, I had my own survival to worry about. Just because I had a supreme ranked bloodline didn't mean that I was automatically protected, no.\nI knew that it was very easy to die in this world. In fact, even the protagonist Kyle would have died several times over, had the author not activated his special skill: Plot Armor.\nSo despite my bloodline, skills and new aspect. I knew that I couldn't get cocky, not even a little.\nArriving back at the estate, the guards greeted me politely. I returned the greeting with a soft nod.\nThe previous Adrian would mostly ignore them. But a nod wouldn't hurt or seem unusual.\nI walked inside and found my father and mother both seated in the living room, sharing what appeared to be evening tea.\nI greeted them, and decided to open up a sensitive topic with my father.\nI needed to tell him about breaking off the engagement.",

      "content": "Chapter 10 - Breaking Off the Engagement\nThe concept of family time felt strange when I knew I was no longer the same person they'd raised.\n\"Father,\" I began carefully, \"I need to discuss something important with you. It concerns my engagement to Seraphina Rosewood.\"\nDuke Marcus immediately set down his papers, giving me his full attention. My mother's teacup paused halfway to her lips, her expression changing to one of curiosity.\n\"She requested that the engagement be dissolved. And I agreed to her request. I believe that we should both go our separate ways.\"\nI took a breath, trying to keep my voice steady as I continued. \"While I understand and respect the decision you made with your best friend long ago, I don't think I'm compatible with Seraphina. We have different personalities, different ways of thinking, and we just don't fit together. I'm sorry, Father. I really tried, but it's impossible. I hope you could understand my wishes.\"\nMy voice quivered slightly as I spoke, and I could tell that my father had mistaken that tremor for emotional stress when in reality it was fear of rejection.\nIf Duke Marcus decided that I should still be with Seraphina despite everything, I would be in deep trouble with the protagonist when I entered the academy. Kyle's protective instincts toward his future love interests were high, and having any romantic connection to them was essentially painting a target on my back.\nI didn't want anything to tie me to the protagonist. Nothing at all. I just wanted to go through the academy, survive everything that would befall me because of Kyle's presence, and rely on my daily rewards to grow stronger quietly in the background.\nI wasn't power hungry. I didn't have ambitions to become the strongest man in the world, and I most certainly didn't have any heroic aspirations to save the kingdom or defeat ancient evils.\nIn fact, I would have skipped out on the whole Academy arc entirely if I'd been able to. But I knew that my father and mother would never allow that. The Blackwood family had too much pride and political standing to let their heir avoid the kingdom's most prestigious institution.\nMy father's expression remained unreadable as he processed my words, while my mother looked between us with growing concern. The weight of their response would determine whether I could successfully distance myself from the main plot or whether I'd be forced into unwanted proximity with the story's central conflicts.\nDuke Marcus finally leaned back in his chair, his steel-grey eyes studying me with the intensity of a man who had navigated decades of political intrigue.\n\"Tell me, Adrian,\" he said slowly, \"is this truly what you want? Or are you simply running from the responsibility because it's become difficult because of her legendary bloodline? Do you think you are not worthy enough?\"\nHe continued, his tone becoming more serious. \"Adrian, you understand that Seraphina possesses a legendary bloodline connected to the ancient warrior Valkyrie, don't you? Her awakening will make her one of the most formidable close-range combatants of her generation.\"\nI knew exactly what he was referring to. In the novel, Seraphina would awaken a powerful offensive talent that transformed her into a devastating warrior, capable of manifesting spectral weapons and enhancing her physical power to shocking levels. She would become one of Kyle's most valuable allies in the later arcs.\nI paused and looked at him, then shook my head firmly. \"No, Father, this is not about avoiding responsibility or worthiness. It's just a matter of preference. Neither of us want each other.\"\nMy father's eyes narrowed slightly. \"But you wanted this engagement before. You always wanted to consummate it and get married, but we held it off because of your age. You complained constantly about the delay. What changed?\"\nDamn that original Adrian. What a complete simp. Even before he was properly introduced in the novel, he was acting like a desperate fool.\n\"I... I grew up, Father,\" I said, trying to keep the frustration out of my voice.\n\"But that was just a few days ago,\" he replied skeptically.\n\"...\" I was trapped. How could I explain such a drastic personality change in such a short time?\n\"I-I was blinded,\" I stammered. \"I woke up to reality, and I realized that I should focus on myself and preparation for the academy.\"\nMy father leaned forward, clearly thinking I was lying or trying to manipulate the situation. \"Really? Then let's set up daily training sessions. I will train with you every day until the academy starts, from now on.\"\nI paused, weighing my options. Although it would be grueling work, I couldn't complain. Learning from a powerful warrior like my father would help boost my combat experience significantly. The only issue was my newfound vampire powers - I'd have to find a way to hide or explain them.\nFor now, I had no choice but to accept.\n\"Yes, Father. I would welcome the training,\" I said, nodding with what I hoped appeared to be genuine determination.\nSeeing my apparent resolve, my father sighed and leaned back. \"Very well. I will speak to Duke Rosewood tomorrow. If you're both saying you don't want this engagement, then we cannot force it upon you.\"\nHe fixed me with a stern look. \"Also, tomorrow morning is your first lesson. Prepare yourself. I won't go easy on you just because you're my son.\"\nMy mother, who had been quietly observing our exchange, finally spoke up. \"Marcus, perhaps we should—\"The most update n0vels are published on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n\"The decision is made, Elena,\" my father said gently but firmly. \"If Adrian is serious about focusing on his growth, then he'll prove it through his actions.\"\nI felt a mixture of relief and apprehension. I'd successfully avoided the engagement trap, but now I'd committed myself to intensive training with one of the kingdom's most skilled warriors while hiding the fact that I was now a vampire with supernatural abilities.\nThis was going to be complicated.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "content": "Chapter 11 - Rare Bloodline\nInside my room, I contemplated several ways I could explain the power I had gained. After weighing the options carefully, I settled on two strategies that should work together effectively.\nFirst, I was going to announce my bloodline awakening tomorrow. The timing would be perfect, my father had mentioned that he was expecting my awakening soon. This would provide a natural explanation for any power I displayed during training.\nI wasn't foolish enough to believe that I would be able to hide my strength during training from my father. A commander-level warrior.\nSecond, I would show my father the Crimson Moon Pendant. The pendant was a powerful treasure that any experienced warrior would recognize immediately. My father had sacrificed himself in the original timeline just to avenge my death, he was incredibly protective and wouldn't steal from his own son.\nBesides, it was a soul-bound item, which meant it was permanently linked to me and unusable by anyone else.\nThese two revelations should solve my immediate problems.\nThe pendant was actually a Superior grade item, which made it incredibly valuable. The ranking system for magical items went: Mortal, Enhanced, Rare, Superior, Epic, and presumably higher tiers that I didn't know about yet.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on\nHaving a Superior grade item at my current level was extraordinary. Even in the kingdom's treasury there was only two items at the superior-grade, and they were national treasures.\nThe pendant's true power wasn't just in its life force conversion ability. What made it truly remarkable was its growth, it could process blood from Noble rank all the way up to Royal rank creatures.\nIn theory, if I somehow obtained Royal-rank blood, I could enhance my body so dramatically that I might be able to kill a Commander-level beast while still at Noble rank myself. That would mean jumping three major power stages in effective combat ability.\nOf course, that was purely theoretical. Royal-rank blood wasn't exactly something I could acquire, and the pendant's enhancement effect probably had limits I hadn't discovered yet.\nBut even with just Elite-rank blood like what I'd collected from the serpent, the boost would be substantial enough to explain high performance during training without raising too many questions.\nI decided to shower and get some sleep. Tomorrow would be a long day, starting with revealing my \"awakening\" to my parents and then beginning intensive combat training with one of the kingdom's most skilled warriors.\nAt least now I had a plan that should keep me alive, whilst growing stronger without completely derailing the timeline or drawing unwanted attention from the protagonist or his crew.\n...\nThe next day arrived, and after waking up I felt incredibly thirsty. I had barely slept, around five hours when I used to need nine to ten back on Earth. My vampire physiology was clearly operating on different requirements than a human body.\nDespite my low sleeping hours, I felt energised.\nThe first thing I did was drink blood instead of water from the pendant. The crimson liquid immediately quenched both my thirst and what I realized was actually hunger, it seemed like I apparently didn't distinguish between the two sensations, clearly I needed to get used to my new body some more.\nAfter satisfying my needs, I went and washed up out of habit. I didn't actually need to anymore; my vampire body didn't require the basic maintenance that human physiology demanded. But old routines died hard.\nAs I was about to open my door to head downstairs, I heard a polite knock.\nI opened it to find Charlotte standing respectfully in the hallway.\n\"Young Master, breakfast has been prepared and is waiting for you in the dining hall. His Grace the Duke and Her Grace the Duchess are already seated and have requested your presence when you are ready.\" She said with a curtsy.\n\"Thank you, Charlotte. I'm heading down, now.\"\nCharlotte seemed conflicted, I can tell from her eyes that I was clearly being too nice to her. Basic courtesy like 'thank you' was something that Adrian probably didn't do.\nI headed downstairs to find my parents seated at their usual places, my mother arranging fresh flowers while my father reviewed what appeared to be correspondence from other noble houses.\nWhen I entered, I deliberately avoided sitting down and instead remained standing near my chair.\n\"Good morning, Father, Mother,\" I greeted them. \"I need to speak with you both about something important before we eat.\"\nMy mother looked up with immediate concern. \"Adrian, darling, you look pale again. Are you still feeling unwell?\"\n\"Actually, that's related to what I need to tell you,\" I said, taking a deep breath. \"My bloodline has awakened.\"\nBoth of my parents' faces immediately lit up with excitement and relief.\n\"What rank is your bloodline, son?\"my father asked eagerly, setting down his papers entirely.\nSeeing me not responding, my mother immediately spoke. \"You don't have to worry, no matter what rank it is, we will still love you the same,\"\n\"It's a Rare bloodline,\" I announced, watching their expressions carefully.\n\"Oh, thank God!\" my mother exclaimed, clasping her hands together. \"We were so worried when you seemed ill yesterday!\"\nMy father's chest swelled with obvious pride.\nA Rare-ranked bloodline was genuinely impressive, Duke Marcus himself possessed a Rare bloodline, which had been part of what made him such a formidable force in the city.\n\"Tell us about it,\" he said, leaning forward with intense interest.\nI can see from my father's eyes that he was proud. He was proud that his only son was going to be as strong if not stronger than him.\nMy expression remained the same outwardly, but inwardly I smiled bitterly.",

I've awakened a first-order trait that improved my body.\"\nMy father immediately burst into delighted laughter.\n\"That's my son! A combat-oriented Rare bloodline with a first-order trait awakening at Noble rank!\" He stood up and clapped me on the shoulder with obvious pride.\n\"We need to announce this properly,\" he continued enthusiastically. \"The other noble houses should know that the Blackwood family has produced another Rare bloodline inheritor. We should hold a celebration to—\"\n\"Father, wait,\" I interrupted quickly. \"I'd prefer to keep this quiet for now. At least until after I enter the academy.\nI want to surprise everyone with my capabilities rather than having them expect it beforehand.\nI'm sure you knew about it, but many noble inheritors snicker and make fun of me behind my back in their own groups. \"\nMy father paused, considering my words.\nIn the end he agreed to my request and decided to hold on exposing my talent.\nAfter breakfast was finished and the servants had cleared the table, Marcus was even more eager to begin training than he had been the night before.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nHis son had the potential to become as strong as him, possibly stronger since he had awakened a powerful first order trait.\nWith two Rare bloodlines in the family, House Blackwood would become significantly more powerful in the kingdom's political landscape.\nWhile Adrian hadn't awakened a Legendary bloodline like Seraphina's, Rare was still genuinely impressive. And having a higher-tier bloodline didn't necessarily guarantee superior strength.\nAspects, echoes, trairs, and experience all played crucial roles in determining real combat effectiveness.\n\"Very well,\" Duke Marcus said, his eyes glinting with anticipation. \"But now I'm even more excited to see what you can do in training. With your new improves body, we can push your development much harder than I originally planned.\"\nI nodded, feeling somewhat excited. With my father's experience, I should learn to control my power more and utilize it better.\nTo survive the upcoming obstacles I needed to learn how to effectively use my abilities. Otherwise, my death would be gruesome, and I'd already experienced dying once. I had no intention of repeating that experience so soon.\n...\nOutside in the courtyard, I stood before my father under the scorching sun. The training grounds were spacious and well-maintained, with various practice weapons arranged along the walls and training dummies positioned at regular intervals.\nWe weren't alone. Several of the estate's guards and father's subordinates who trained here regularly were also present, working through their own exercises in designated areas.\nThey maintained a respectful distance but I could sense their curiosity about the Duke's sudden decision to personally train his son.\nMy father began my training with dynamic stretches and warm-ups, clearly taking into account the previous Adrian's leisurely habit of avoiding physical exertion. He was being careful not to push too hard from the beginning, gradually working up my flexibility and getting my blood flowing to avoid overtraining me.\nI can tell he was getting me into the zone. I smiled inwardly, this new father of mine was really thoughtful.\n\"Your body may feel different now that your bloodline has awakened,\" he explained as we moved through the stretches, \"but you still need to build proper muscle memory and technique. Havign raw power without control could be a weapon against you, not with you,\"\nI nodded my head, agreeing with his words.\nThen he handed me a training sword and began teaching me the fundamentals of swordsmanship.\nHonestly, the instruction was invaluable. My father possessed a Rare trait called Knight's Valor, and his swordsmanship was genuinely top-notch.\nHe was considered the strongest swordsman not just in the city of Luminara, but in the entire Kingdom of Eldrathia. Learning from him was an incredible opportunity that most people could only dream of.\nIn about half an hour, he managed to teach me the absolute basics of proper swordsmanship.\nWhether it was stances, grip, basic cuts, defensive positions, and footwork. He had taught me all.\nI felt surprisingly good about my learning speed. It wasn't genius or elite-level progression, but I was absorbing the lessons at a decent pace, which was encouraging. My vampire body and trait were definitely helping.\nSwordsmanship wasn't going to be my main focus anyway. The primary reason I was learning was because it would be helpful for general combat situations, and because of a sword that I was going to take for myself soon enough.\nThe sword was actually a powerful artefact at the Enhanced Rank inside the academy's weapon hall.\nWhen students enter the academy, they are given the opportunity of entering the weapon hall and selecting an item.\nNaturally things weren't as simple as selecting the item you would like, if they were, a powerful sword like the one I was planning to take for myself wouldn't be there waiting.\nThere was a certain mechanism that I was planning to exploit, but that was for later. For now, I needed to focus on my training.\nDuring the training, I decided to not tell my dad about the pendant. Simply because he had already bought the story of awakening my bloodline, he wasn't suspicious at all.\nMy father stepped back after demonstrating a basic combination sequence.\n\"Not bad for your first lesson,\" he said with approval. \"Your natural coordination is definitely better than when we first started. Your swordsmanship has also improved, let's see how you handle some light sparring.\"​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "content": "Chapter 13 - Sparring the Duke\n\"Now, let's see how you handle some light sparring,\" my father said, raising his training sword into a defensive stance.\n\"Remember, this is just to assess your current capabilities. Don't worry about winning, focus on applying what we just practiced.\" My father reassured me, I can see that he didn't want me to lose motivation.\nI nodded, gripping my sword and trying to mirror the stance he'd taught me earlier.\nAround the courtyard, I noticed several guards had paused their own training to watch. It wasn't every day they got to see the Duke personally spar with his son, especially since the previous Adrian had been notorious for avoiding any form of physical exertion.\n\"Begin when you're ready,\" my father instructed me, his voice taking on a stronger tone.\nI could tell from his face that he wasn't going to go easy on me.\nI took a deep breath and launched into my first attack, a simple overhead strike that he'd demonstrated earlier.\nThe training sword whistled through the air with far more force than I'd intended. My father's eyes widened in surprise as he deflected the blow, the impact sending vibrations up both our blades that were clearly much stronger than he'd expected from a complete beginner.\n\"Interesting,\" he murmured, resetting his stance.\n\"Again.\"\nThis time I tried a horizontal slash, but my speed made the movement blur faster than any Noble-rank awakener should have been capable of. My father blocked the sword strike with relative ease, but I wasn't disheartened.\nSeveral guards had now stopped their training entirely, staring at us with undisguised amazement.\n\"Young Master... his awakened bloodline must've really improved his physical condition,\" one of them whispered to another. \"I've never seen a fresh awakener move like that.\"\nDespite their low whispers, my ears were able to perceive it loud and clear.\n\"That's no ordinary bloodline,\" another guard murmured back. \"Look at the Duke's face, even he's impressed.\"\nI wasn't worried by their speculation over my bloodline, I knew that the guards and servants that served my father were very loyal. They had shown their loyalty when they fought alongside my father to their death.\nMy father's expression had long since changed, the huge smile that had formed from our first exchange did not leave his face at all. He began moving more seriously, testing my reactions with quick feints and probing attacks.\nDespite my crude technique and obvious inexperience, my body was responding with supernatural reflexes. When he thrust toward my chest, I twisted away at the last second. When he swept low at my legs, I leaped back with explosive power that carried me twice as far as a noble-ranked awakener could have managed.\nMy counterattacks were equally shocking. Each swing of my blade carried enough force to dent the training posts if it connected. When I attempted the combination sequence my father had shown me albeit with terrible form, the speed was so intense that the wooden sword actually began to splinter from the air resistance.\n\"Adrian!\" my father called out, stepping back smoothly and raising his hand in the universal signal to pause the sparring.\nHis breathing was slightly elevated, though more from excitement than exertion.\n\"Your power output is extraordinary, but you need to learn control before anything else. Once you master proper regulation of your strength and speed, your combat effectiveness will skyrocket significantly.\"\nHe lowered his sword completely, his gaze sweeping over me with new understanding. \"Based on what I've observed here, you should have the physical capability to fight on equal footing with pseudo-Elite level opponents. Your raw strength are simply that impressive.\"\nThe gathered guards exchanged meaningful looks, clearly recognizing the significance of the Duke's assessment.\nPseudo-Elite was a designation reserved for those who possessed near Elite-level power while still technically remaining at Noble rank, an extremely rare occurrence that typically indicated exceptional bloodline potential.\nMarcus had deliberately kept the specific details of Adrian's bloodline classification private, but he made no effort to hide the fact that his son had successfully awakened.\nWord would spread through appropriate channels that House Blackwood had produced another combat-capable heir, but the true extent of my abilities would remain within the family for now.\nI wasn't worried about news of my awakening spreading either. Based on the original timeline, Adrian should have awakened today or tomorrow anyway. This was perfectly within the expected schedule.\nAfter the sparring ended, I approached my father with questions that had been weighing on my mind. I wanted to seek the advice of someone with experience, and my father was my best bet.\n\"Father, do you have any advice on how to improve my coordination and adapt to this new body? The power feels... overwhelming sometimes.\"\n\"I'm worried I might hurt someone accidentally or break something important.\"\nI lied through my teeth, I wasn't worried that I would hurt someone or break something important. What I was worried about was my safety, I worried that I would die because I simply wasn't able to control my power.\nNot only was it a pathetic death, but it was something that is totally avoidable.\nUnlike Kyle, the protagonist, I didn't have plot armour, so in this dangerous world, a random monster could potentially enter the city and kill me.\nAnd no, this wasn't far fetched. In fact, this did happen and the reason was more cliché than you might realise.\nThe author had made Kyle fall into the 'saving the damsel in distress' scenario by allowing a powerful beast to appear in the city, the beast killed tens of people and some were elite-ranked!\nKyle appeared at the perfect moment and saved one of the heroines. The girl would then fall in love with him instantly, and follow him like she was glued to him.Thɪs\nI'm sure that my action have already started to change things, so I must not think solely based on the original timeline, but think beyond that.\nMy father nodded thoughtfully, clearly having not expected this question. His lazy son wasn't just satisfied with the training, he wanted to go beyond that.\n\"That's a very mature concern, Adrian. Power without control is dangerous to both yourself and others.\" My father said, before gesturing for me to sit on one of the benches positioned around the training yard.\n\"When I first awakened my bloodline, I had similar issues. I accidentally broke three swords in my first week and put a hole through a stone wall during practice.\"",

Spend time each morning focusing on your breathing and consciously feeling every muscle in your body. Learn to sense exactly how much force you're applying to everything, from opening doors to picking up a cup.\" My father continued explaining.\nHe stood and demonstrated a slow, controlled sword movement. \"Practice all your techniques at quarter-speed first. Don't worry about power you've got plenty of it. Instead, focus entirely on accuracy and control. Only increase your speed when you can perform the movement perfectly at the slower pace.\"\n\"Also, I recommend practicing daily tasks with your new strength. Eat meals normally, write letters, handle delicate objects. These mundane activities will teach you finer control, when you are able to do so, you will have gained control over your new power,\" he added with a slight smile,\n\"Finally, sparring with opponents, like myself or the guards in our estate will help you learn to regulate your output based on your opponent's capabilities. You'll need to fight differently against a fellow Noble-rank opponent versus an Elite-rank enemy.\"\nI listened with attention, his advice was genuinely helpful. The approach to building control rather than just raw power made perfect sense, and I could already see how these exercises would help me avoid dangerous accidents while maximizing my combat effectiveness.Follow current novᴇls on Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\n\"Thank you, Father. This is exactly what I needed to know.\"\nAfter the training, my father told me to come inside and eat. I shook my head, saying my body felt strong now and I wasn't feeling hungry, I would eat another time.\nHe glanced at me with a slight frown before nodding. Probably wondering about my sudden change in eating habits, but accepting it as part of my bloodline awakening.\nI followed my father inside, then excused myself to my room.\nWhen I arrived, Charlotte was cleaning. She had already removed the bloodstains from the floor without asking any questions and fixed the door handle that I'd accidentally damaged with my new strength.\nI didn't overly thank her, I couldn't completely change my personality in a single day. I needed to gradually shift her perception of me rather than shocking her with sudden kindness.\n\"Young Master,\" she greeted me immediately upon spotting me, giving a small curtsy. \"I've finished tidying your room. Is there anything you need?\"\n\"No, that's fine,\" I replied with a reserved tone, a tad bit warmer than the original Adrian's usual dismissiveness or what I imagined it would be with his maid.\nShe nodded and gathered her cleaning supplies. \"I'll be downstairs if you need anything, Young Master.\"\nAfter she left, I closed the door and finally allowed myself to relax.\nThe training had gone better than expected, and my father's advice would be invaluable for controlling my new abilities. But I still had the daily login reward to claim, and I needed to plan my next moves carefully.\nThe academy entrance was approaching, and with it, all the dangers that would come from being near the protagonist's story.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nStaring at the floating screen before me, I allowed myself a small smile.\n[01:04:20]\nWith an hour and four minutes to spare, I decided to practice what my father had taught me to further improve my control over my body.\n...\nAn hour and a few minutes passed. My control had improved significantly.\nI could now handle delicate and fragile objects without breaking them, though it still required conscious focus. I wanted to reach the level where this control became instinctive, without needing to concentrate on every movement. Based on my estimation, I believed that would take three to four days of consistent practice.\n[00:00:10]\nThe countdown timer in the floating screen flashed before my eyes.\nI watched with anticipation. I knew I wouldn't receive something as overpowered as my previous Supreme Vampire bloodline.\nThe system had made it clear, that was a special first-time reward. Future daily logins could contain anything.\nStill, I hoped for something useful.\n[Daily Login Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your daily reward?]\n[Yes | No]\nMy hand hovered over the screen before pressing yes.\n[Congratulations! You have received the Enhanced Magical Item: Two Faces]\nMy eyebrow raised involuntarily.\nAn Enhanced magical item was genuinely powerful. It wasn't earth-shattering, but it certainly wasn't weak and would help me at least until the Transcendent rank, depending on its utility.\n[Two Faces]\n[Grade: Enhanced]\n[Details: Allows the user to permanently store one alternate facial appearance within the mask. Once worn, you can seamlessly switch between your original face and the stored face at will. The alternate face can only be set once and cannot be changed afterward.]\nReading through the item details, I felt genuinely elated. This mask wasn't a sword or a combat item, but for someone like me, an extra trying to survive in the background, this was more precious, it was invaluable.\nWith this mask, I could remain completely low-key. I could distance myself from all the chaos surrounding Kyle and his crew, avoiding the attention of third-rate villains and dangerous plot developments entirely.\nI had initially thought the item would only be helpful until Transcendent rank, but I was wrong. This item could serve me for a very long time! Its strategic value was immense.\nEven though its limitation was somewhat disheartening.\nStill, having only one alternate face to be chosen and stored permanently was more than enough for my purposes.\nI could create a completely different identity.\nA mask that could grant me true anonymity in a world where my face was tied to a doomed fate? This was exactly what I needed.",

      "content": "Chapter 15 - The Four Ducal Houses\nStaring at the mask in my hand, it felt warm to the touch. It was a simple but elegant white piece of equipment. It had no kind of artistic design, just a basic mask, which made it appeal more to me.\nWith the mask secured safely in my storage ring, I pondered my next steps. The first thing I wanted to do was explore the city of Luminara in greater depth. I had casually passed through it when heading toward the forest, but I hadn't been focused on observing my surroundings then.\nNow, I wanted to truly see it.\nThe author had left readers like me with what we called a \"white background\", with no real sense of how the city functioned, how it looked, or how it felt to actually live there.\nI left my room and headed outside, nodding to the guards as I passed through the estate gates.\nWalking through the city of Luminara whilst focusing on the details for the first time, I couldn't help but feel impressed. Towering structures reached toward the sky, not quite skyscrapers in the modern sense, but buildings that stretched impossibly high.\nThe Kingdom of Eldrathia wasn't ruled by a single absolute power. In the novel, the multiple great houses vied for influence and control, creating a complex web of political agendas.\nI observed the various family crests and banners displayed throughout the city as I walked.\nAt the very apex of this hierarchy sat the Royal House. King Aldric himself possessed the legendary Tiger bloodline, which granted him immense power and the rare ability to shapeshift between human and tiger forms. He had reached the highest rank I've seen stated in the novel, the king rank itself.\nKin Aldric was a very powerful character, and a noble one too.\nThe royal banners displayed throughout the city bore the golden tiger rampant, and I could see why, even in the novel, no one had dared challenge the king's authority directly. His bloodline was simply too powerful, too intimidating for open rebellion.\nBelow the crown, four Great Ducal Houses controlled the kingdom's major regions and forces.\nMy own family, House Blackwood, held considerable sway through our Knight bloodline. The black sword and silver shield on our family crest could be seen on some adventurer uniforms and official buildings throughout this quarter of the city.\nAccording to the original timeline, Adrian should have awakened an Uncommon Knight bloodline, essentially a diluted version of Duke Marcus's Rare-rank abilities, which would have made him a decently influential character had he not been used as a stepping stone for Kyle by the author.\nThe system's intervention had completely altered that reality, blessing me instead with the Supreme Vampire bloodline.\nMy cover story about enhanced physical capabilities wasn't fabricated out of thin air. I had chosen it for a very specific reason - I wanted my awakening to appear identical to what the original Adrian should have experienced.\nHad I revealed my Blood Control trait, it would have launched me down a completely different path. The other Great Houses would react with suspicion and wariness to my awakening a bloodline so drastically different from my father's Knight heritage. While bloodline anomalies weren't unheard of in this world, they always drew unwanted attention and political complications.\nMore importantly, my awakening was a controllable variable. I had the power to manage what information spread about my abilities and how others perceived my potential. It would be foolish to willingly alter the timeline so dramatically when I could avoid it entirely.\nBy keeping my public awakening identical to the original Adrian's expected Knight variant, the timeline should remain relatively stable and predictable. The future events I remembered from the novel should still unfold roughly as expected, giving me the crucial advantage of foreknowledge that I desperately needed.\nAs I walked through the market district, I passed beneath all the banners of all the ducal houses.\nBlackwood House.\nSeraphina's Rosewood house.\nIronhide House.\nStormwind House.\nEach one of these ducal houses represented the second most powerful factions in the city. Of course, smaller factions existed in the city, but they were mostly either under our ducal houses or were too weak to make any significant changes.\nWalking through a busy commercial street, I observed how the different houses' influences shaped even basic aspects of city life.\nFor example, our Blackwood House were known for its exceptional guard services. Many businesses and malls hired our guards to protect their businesses from theft.\nThe other houses also had their own services that they provided, which added to the city.\nThe common smaller clans and citizens seemed largely content with this arrangement. Each great house provided specific services and protections, creating a system where competition between noble families actually benefited the general population. It was more sophisticated than the typical \"evil nobles oppressing peasants\" dynamic you'd expect from a web novel setting.\nI paused near a fountain in the central plaza, watching children play. The normalcy of it struck me; these people had no idea that within a few months, their peaceful city would become a battleground for protagonist-level conflicts involving evil, political conspiracies, and bloodline awakeners capable of levelling entire districts.\nFor now, though, Luminara thrived as a centre of innovation and stability. The Great Houses maintained their careful balance, trade flowed freely through enchanted marketplaces, and citizens lived their lives without fear of the catastrophes that Kyle's presence would eventually attract.\nI needed to remember this peaceful moment, because I knew it wouldn't last.",

      "content": "Chapter 16 - Sweetest Blood.\nAfter walking around the city and appreciating the peace and bustle for a while, I decided to head back.\nWhile walking through the dense crowd, I let my guard down, admiring the bustling marketplace around me. The various scents of street food, perfumes, and the general liveliness of the city filled my senses.\nThen it hit me.\nMy vampire instincts roared to life, my fangs threatening to extend as I felt a sudden, strong craving consuming my rationality.\nThe reason was the overwhelming smell of the sweetest blood I'd ever encountered crashing into my nostrils like an overflowing ocean. The scent was so rich, so intoxicating, that it made every other blood I'd smelt before seem like sewage water in comparison.\nMy vampire bloodline reacted violently to their proximity. The scent of their blood was intoxicating beyond description, calling to every instinct I possessed. I could practically taste the power flowing through their veins, sweet and overwhelming in a way that made my throat dry with sudden, desperate thirst.\nThis wasn't ordinary blood. This was the blood of someone with an extraordinary bloodline, and my vampire nature recognized it as the finest delicacy imaginable.\nWhen did I start thinking of blood as tasty? My bloodline is affecting me far more than I'd realized.\nI found myself turning my head frantically, searching through the crowd for the source of that incredible aroma. My powerful senses locked onto the direction where I thought it was coming from, and I began moving almost unconsciously toward it.\nLost in my search for that tantalizing scent that was coming ever so closely, I bumped directly into someone's shoulder.\nOur shoulders rebounded against each other with surprising force. I could feel that the person I'd collided with was no weakling. After all, my body was enhanced, and only someone with considerable strength would be able to make my shoulder rebound like that.\nThe moment our bodies made contact, that sweet blood scent exploded in intensity. It was coming from them.\nI clenched my jaw, fighting the urge to bare my fangs at him. My hands trembled as I forced myself to maintain control, to appear normal despite every fibre of my being screaming at me to feed.\nI turned to face the person that bumped into me. But the words died in my throat as my eyes landed on his face.\nThe moment I saw him, something moved within me.\nThe person looked at me with mildly curious eyes, though not overly interested. Just a natural reaction someone might have when a stranger stares at them unexpectedly after bumping into them.\nI recognized him immediately. How could I not?\nThose pitch-black eyes that seemed to absorb light itself, the black hair tied back with two strands framing his face. His features belonged in magazines, and I could practically see the hidden protagonist halo above his head.\nKyle Morrison. The main character himself.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nI stared for a second longer than socially acceptable, fighting both my shock at meeting him and the overwhelming urge to sink my fangs into his neck. I had realised that the sweet scent was coming from him.\nBut this was wrong.\nHe wasn't supposed to be here yet. According to the novel's timeline, Kyle should arrive in the city tomorrow morning, not today. He was meant to come early to prepare for the academy's examination.\nMy actions had already begun altering the story's flow.\nWhen I killed the Elite-ranked serpent in the Whispering Woods, I'd disrupted the local ecosystem. The creature had been an apex predator whose presence kept other magical beasts away from that territory. With the serpent dead, various monsters had migrated back into the area, including the wolf packs that had originally fled.\nKyle had been traveling toward Luminara with his sick sister, following the same forest routes described in the novel. But the sudden drop of magical beasts in the area had allowed him to take shorter, more direct paths to arrive at the city. What should have been a long journey had become relatively straightforward, causing him to arrive half a day earlier than planned.\n\"Is something wrong?\" Kyle's voice snapped me out of my daze. He'd clearly noticed that my reaction wasn't normal for a simple shoulder bump between strangers.\nI swallowed hard, fighting the burning sensation in my throat. His voice alone made my vampire instincts flare again, as if even the sound carried traces of that intoxicating life force.\nRegaining my composure, I shook my head quickly. \"Sorry for bumping into you. I was just feeling unwell.\"\n\"Brother, what's wrong? Is this another meanie?\" A teenage girl's voice suddenly reached my ears. I forced my gaze downward to find a small figure tugging at Kyle's sleeve.\nEmily Morrison. Kyle's younger sister.\nShe wore a simple pink dress with her hair arranged in neat ponytails. Despite their modest circumstances, Kyle had kept her well dressed. She was the light of Kyle's world, the only family he had left after their parents died in a beast attack on their village.\nEmily was Kyle's weakness and motivation. Whatever she wanted, he would move mountains to provide. She represented everything good and innocent that he fought to protect, and harming her was the fastest way to transform the noble protagonist into a merciless force of destruction.\nThe sight of her innocent face looking up at me with curious eyes made my stomach twist. She had just called me a \"meanie,\" which definitely wasn't creating a good first impression with Kyle.\nWithout waiting for either Kyle or Emily to speak further, I turned and walked away. I wanted absolutely nothing to do with Kyle or his sister. The overwhelming scent of his blood was making it difficult to think clearly, and I needed distance before I did something irreversibly stupid.\nI could have easily used my family's resources to help them find proper lodging. A few words to the right people, some coin exchanged, and Kyle would have developed a positive opinion of me.\nBut I deliberately chose not to.\nHaving Kyle think well of me wasn't something I wanted. Good impressions led to friendship, friendship led to involvement in his adventures, and involvement in protagonist adventures led to death flags and plot complications I couldn't predict or control.\nMore importantly, being near him was dangerous for obvious reasons. Unlike the other characters, I had no plot armour to save my ass when the overpowered enemy arrives to fight the mc. The way my vampire bloodline reacted to his presence was terrifying. If I spent extended time around him, I might lose control entirely.\nI wanted to blend into the background and have nothing to do with the main character or anyone in his circle.\nI felt Kyle's gaze following me for several seconds as I disappeared into the crowd, but he made no attempt to pursue me. After a moment, I heard his attention move back to more pressing concerns.\n\"What was that about, brother?\" Emily's voice drifted after me.",

      "content": "Chapter 17 - The Orphanage\n\"Not sure, but it doesn't matter,\" Kyle replied, his tone shifting to worry. \"We need to find a place to stay tonight, and I need to get you looked at. You're running a fever.\"\nI quickened my pace, putting distance between myself and the protagonist's problems. Emily's illness would lead to Kyle seeking medical help, which would put him in contact with academy-connected healers, which would eventually result in his early admission.\nAs I walked back to the mansion, I couldn't help but ponder my interaction with Kyle. Was it really wise to just leave him and his sister?\nI truly believed it was. My encounter with him had proven that I'd already changed my fate, already altered the timeline. The previous death flag hanging over my head was no longer there, which meant I didn't need to worry about the protagonist coming for my life.\nFor a brief moment, I felt at peace. Ever since I woke up in this world, I'd felt tense about everything. Despite this peace, I pondered my purpose.\nWhy did I awaken in this world? Why were my memories intact? And why did I have the system?\nUnfortunately, those questions only added to my anxiety about this world, making my brief moment of peace shatter once again.\n\"Only time will tell,\" I muttered to myself, before drinking my daily portion of blood to quench the burning thirst that Kyle's presence had intensified tenfold.\n..\nThe next day arrived. I started my morning routine by quenching my thirst with the blood stored in my pendant. As I felt the dwindling supply, I decided I'd need to go hunting again today to replenish it.\nThe blood should have lasted me about a week. However, Kyle's appearance yesterday had made me lose control completely. The overwhelming scent of his supreme bloodline had triggered such intense cravings that I'd consumed far more than usual just to suppress the urge to attack him.\nOnce again, I skipped breakfast, citing my bloodline's effect on my appetite.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nMy father was free today, so he decided to continue my training. We worked through the sword techniques he'd taught me, focusing on control rather than raw power.\nAfter we finished, he praised my improved control and memorization of the techniques.\n\"You're learning faster than I expected, Adrian. Your muscle memory is developing well,\" he said, genuine pride in his voice.\nI accepted the compliment, thanking him for taking the time to train me personally. The praise felt good, even though I knew my vampire physiology was giving me unfair advantages in physical learning.\nAfter training ended, I decided to rest briefly before attempting something I'd been considering since yesterday.\nI was going to visit the orphanage.\n[Daily Reward Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your reward?] [Yes | No]\nI pressed yes, I would be foolish not to.\n[Congratulations! You have received the Mortal Magical Item: Health Potion]\nStaring at the reward, I felt somewhat down. A mortal magical item wasn't great, it was a very common item, I could practically find it in any shop.\nAfter receiving my reward, I made my way toward the outskirts of the city, where the forgotten corners of Luminara existed. The city life faded as I moved from the prosperous central districts to the neglected periphery.\nThe area reminded me of the slums of Rocinha in Rio de Janeiro from my previous life. Ramshackle buildings leaned against each other for support, their walls stained with age and neglect.\nNarrow alleyways reeked of trash smell. Children with hollow cheeks and torn clothing darted between shadows, while adults huddled in doorways with vacant expressions.\nThe living conditions were appalling. Cracked streets, broken streetlights, and the general air of abandonment made it clear that the city's prosperity didn't extend to everyone.\nYet somewhere in this forgotten district stood an orphanage that would play a crucial role in the story's development.\nI found the building easily enough. It was larger than the surrounding structures but in equally poor condition. Faded paint peeled from wooden walls, and several roof tiles had fallen into the overgrown garden. A weathered sign hung crooked by the entrance: \"Saint Helena's Home for Children.\"\nThe iron gate creaked as I pushed it open and stepped into the courtyard.\nDespite the rundown surroundings, the space had been maintained as well as possible. Someone had attempted to create a playground with whatever materials they could scavenge. A makeshift seesaw constructed from a plank and a rock sat beside a small sandbox filled with dirt rather than sand.\nChildren's laughter filled the air.\nA group of kids, probably ranging from five to twelve years old, were playing together near the entrance. Their clothes were patched and faded, clearly hand-me-downs that had seen better days, but they'd been washed and mended.\nThe children themselves looked thin but not starving, suggesting the orphanage staff were doing their best with limited resources.\n\"Tag, you're it!\" a girl with pigtails called out, giggling as she dodged between her friends.\nThe children seemed genuinely happy despite their circumstances. They created their own games, shared whatever toys they had, and found joy in simple pleasures that wealthy children might take for granted.\nBut those playing children weren't what caught my attention.\nIn the corner of the garden, away from the laughter and games, stood a single boy on a rundown swing. The swing's chains were rusted and one of the wooden seats had a crack running through its center, but it still functioned.\nThe boy looked to be around eight or nine years old, though malnutrition might have made him appear younger than his actual age.\nHis clothes were different from the other children, not just worn, but torn in places. Mud stains covered his shirt and pants, as if he'd been pushed down or forced to sit on the ground.\nWhat struck me most was his hair. It was an unusual silver-white color, almost ethereal in the afternoon sunlight just like mine. But rather than making him appear special, it seemed to mark him as different in a way that made others uncomfortable.\nThe boy sat motionless on the swing, his small hands gripping the chains as he stared at the ground. Even from across the garden, I could see the sadness radiating from his hunched shoulders and downcast expression.",

      "content": "Chapter 18 - The Winter Beast\nNone of the other children approached him. In fact, they seemed to actively avoid the corner where he sat, as if an invisible barrier existed around him.\n\"Don't go near the demon boy,\" I heard one child whisper to another as they ran past. \"Older sister Martha says his hair means he's cursed.\"\nThe silver-haired boy's shoulders tensed at the words, but he didn't look up or react outwardly. He simply continued staring at the dirt beneath his feet, as if he'd heard such comments countless times before.\nAn older boy, probably in his teen, noticed me watching and walked over with a serious expression.\n\"Are you here to adopt someone, mister?\" he asked hopefully. \"Just don't pick Kael. Nobody wants him anyway.\"\n\"Why not?\" I asked, though I already knew the answer.\nThe boy glanced toward the silver-haired child and lowered his voice.\n\"Because he's weird. His hair isn't normal, and strange things happen around him sometimes. The sisters say it's probably a curse from his parents. That's why they abandoned him here.\"\nThe rejected child with unusual features and mysterious powers, ostracized by those who should have protected him.\n\"What kind of strange things?\" I inquired gently.\n\"Sometimes when he gets really upset, the air gets cold around him,\" the boy explained. \"And once, when Marcus pushed him into the mud, Marcus's hand got all frostbitten even though it was summer. The sisters made Kael stay in his room for three days after that.\"\nHearing their words, I couldn't stop my heart from racing.\nKael. The Winter Beast.\nI had come here solely for him. In the original timeline, this orphanage would cause quite the commotion within the next month or so.\nKyle would be walking through the city when he discovered the entire orphanage engulfed in flames. Being the protagonist, Kyle would save the day, ensuring not a single orphan died in the blaze.\nThe cause of the fire would remain unknown at the time. Later in the novel, Kyle would face the truth when he encountered Kael again.\nKael would become a member of a dangerous organization that worked to destroy the royal family.\nTheir name was \"Daybreak.\"\nThe name held deep significance. They believed they signified the beginning of a new era, the moment when light breaks through the darkness of corruption. Their sole mission was to overthrow what they saw as the evil royal system controlling Luminara.\nKael would become one of the main antagonists in the novel in the first Arc. His powerful control over ice earned him the fearsome title of The Winter Beast. Wherever he went, the wrath of winter followed in his wake.\nWhat made him truly dangerous wasn't just his power, but his intelligence. Even Kyle struggled against him because Kael never fought face to face. He was a master strategist who used psychological warfare, distractions, and his subordinates' sacrifices to achieve his goals while remaining safely in the shadows.\nThe most shocking part? He had risen to such terrifying power in barely a year after leaving this orphanage.\nStaring at him now, I was genuinely shocked. The child before me looked far too young. In the novel, Kael had been roughly the same age as Kyle and myself, which meant one disturbing thing.\nMalnutrition had caused severe stunted growth. However, after his bloodline awakening, he would experience rapid physical development. Still, his height would remain on the shorter side throughout the story.\nDespite his diminutive stature, even giant magical beasts would learn to fear The Winter Beast.\nI wasn't here to recruit him. That would have been monumentally stupid.\nNot only would I be removing a villain crucial to Kyle's character development, but I would also eliminate one of my best potential connections to the Daybreak organization.\nI wanted to use Kael as my gateway to them.\nThe fire incident would occur in approximately one month, which I suspected was the exact timeframe when Kael would first encounter Daybreak recruiters. They would likely approach him during his most vulnerable moment, when he had lost all his patience.\nThat's why I had come early. I wanted to scout the area and familiarize myself with Kael's current situation. I had no intention of speaking to him personally, as that would inevitably affect his later actions and decisions.\nAny interference now would be catastrophic for my long-term plans. I needed to observe from a distance, gather intelligence, and prepare for when I could implement my strategy.\nFor now, watching was sufficient.\nI studied Kael's body language as he sat alone on that broken swing. The way he held himself spoke of someone who had learned to make himself as small and unnoticeable as possible. His silver hair caught the sunlight, making him stand out despite his obvious desire to blend into the background.\nThe other children continued their games, but I noticed how they unconsciously gave his corner of the garden a wide berth. It wasn't just fear of his supposed curse. Children had an instinctive ability to sense when someone was different, dangerous, or marked by forces beyond their understanding.\n\"Sister Martha! Sister Martha!\" A young girl came running toward the orphanage building, her voice filled with excitement. \"There's a fancy man here! Maybe he wants to adopt someone!\"\nAn elderly woman in simple robes emerged from the building, wiping her hands on her apron. She had kind eyes but looked exhausted by the constant struggle of caring for so many children with insufficient resources.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\n\"Now, now, children,\" she called out gently. \"Don't bother the gentleman. He might just be visiting.\"\nHer gaze found me across the garden, and she began walking over with a polite but cautious expression. I could see her mentally calculating whether I represented an opportunity for the orphanage or just another disappointment.\n\"Good afternoon, sir,\" she said as she approached. \"I'm Sister Martha. Are you perhaps interested in learning about our children?\"\nI glanced once more toward Kael, who hadn't moved from his swing despite all the commotion. If anything, he seemed to be trying to make himself even smaller, as if hoping to disappear entirely.\n\"Just looking around,\" I replied carefully. \"I've heard good things about the work you do here.\"",

She was the only person who died in the orphanage fire, the only person whose body was found mutilated.\nOf course, I knew it was Kael's doing. Martha must have really done something unforgivable for him to personally ensure her death, unlike the others whom he had simply left to the flames.\nThe reason didn't particularly interest me. She might have treated him badly, crossed some invisible line, or committed some cruelty that pushed him past his breaking point. Either way, the reason wasn't mentioned and that wasn't why I was interested in her.\nThe reason I cared about Martha was because I knew she would be perfect for the role I was about to give her.\nI took out a badge from my pocket and showed it to her once we were alone in her small office. We were away from the children's ears and eyes. I needed this conversation to remain absolutely secret. Kael could not know about this under any circumstances.\nThe moment she saw the badge of being a platinum citizen which were only given to those with status, her entire demeanour shifted. Her back straightened, her casual tone disappeared, and genuine respect replaced her polite but distant courtesy.\nI could have showed her my blackwood family crest, but that wouldn't be ideal. If anything went wrong, and things were accelerated in the timeline and Kael somehow found out about it, I would be putting myself and my family in danger.\nI had to be very careful. I was so careful to the point that I had even temporarily dyed my hair black. My white hair was very rare and I would be easily recognisable after some basic descriptions.\n\"May I know whom I'm speaking with, sir?\" she asked, her voice much more deferential now.\nAdrian had never involved himself with charity work or the impoverished districts of Luminara. My anonymity here was a valuable asset. It was difficult for Martha to recognise me when I had put some effort into hiding my identity.\nI could have used the mask, but that wasn't ideal. I wanted to save it for a better cause later on, for now this was sufficient enough. Nobody here has the capability to figure me out.\nI responded with a cold tone. \"No, you cannot.\"\nShe nodded immediately, understanding her position in this power dynamic without needing further explanation.\nI placed several golden coins on her desk, watching as her eyes immediately fixed on them with unmistakable avarice. The way her pupils dilated and her breathing quickened confirmed what I had suspected. This woman was driven by greed above all else, which made her perfect for manipulation.\n\"I have one job for you, and one job only,\" I began, my voice remaining steady and mighty. \"If you do it correctly, I can promise you a comfortable life. I will ensure you can leave this place without having to resort to stealing donations meant for the children.\"\nHer eyes widened in shock at my casual mention of her hidden embezzlement. To be honest, it had been an educated guess rather than concrete knowledge. Such details weren't part of the novel's plot, but they weren't difficult to deduce either.\nI could see the way she looked at money with desperate hunger. Her clothing was slightly too fine for someone supposed to be living in poverty while caring for orphans. The small luxuries in her office, the quality of her shoes, they were all signs of someone skimming funds meant for necessities.\n\"I would never—\" she started to protest.\nI cut her off, raising my hand to stop her lies before they could fully form, I had no time to waste.\n\"Save it. I'm not here to judge you or drag you to court. You don't need to worry about legal consequences. Like I said, I'm here to offer you employment. Once you accept, any mistakes on your part will result in consequences you definitely don't want to discover.\"\nThe threat hung in the air between us, unspoken but perfectly clear. My power and family's influence could certainly make people disappear if necessary.\n\"May I ask what the job entails?\" Martha asked, her curiosity overriding her previous fear of being dragged to punishment.\nMoney to live comfortably without constantly worrying about maintaining appearances? If the task was within her capabilities, she would certainly accept and ensure she didn't disappoint her mysterious benefactor.\nFinally, a chance to live lavishly without constantly dealing with those demanding children and their endless needs. Especially that silver-haired freak whose very presence always set her teeth on edge.\n\"You can learn the details, but once you do, you will be committed to accepting the mission,\" I explained carefully. \"It's neither difficult nor particularly dangerous. Simple information gathering within this orphanage. You won't need to travel anywhere or take any physical risks. I want you to observe one specific child. Once I tell you the name, you must accept the assignment. If you refuse after learning the details...\"\nI let the sentence trail off meaningfully, allowing her imagination to fill in the unpleasant possibilities.\nShe raised her eyebrow, clearly puzzled by the request. Why would a platinum citizen pay her substantial money to watch some random orphan and report back? These children were nothing but pathetic charity cases with nothing to offer and everything to take.\nI could see the confusion written across her face, but from her perspective, the mission seemed remarkably simple. Watch a child and occasionally send reports? For the kind of money I was offering, she'd probably watch paint dry if asked.\n\"I accept.\" Martha nodded after a quick thought.\n\"The child's name is Kael,\" I said, watching her reaction carefully. \"The silver-haired boy you clearly despise.\"ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nHer expression soured immediately at the mention of his name, confirming my suspicions about their relationship.\n\"That cursed little demon?\" she spat before catching herself and attempting to look more professional. \"I mean, yes, I know which child you're referring to, sir.\"\n\"Perfect. Your job is straightforward. I want detailed reports on his daily activities, his interactions with other children, any unusual incidents involving his... abilities, and most importantly, any visitors or strangers who show interest in him specifically.\"\nMartha nodded slowly, processing the requirements. \"How often would you want these reports?\"\n\"Daily, unless something significant occurs. In that case, you contact me immediately.\" I placed a small communication crystal on the desk beside the coins. \"This will allow you to reach me directly if needed.\"\nHer eyes lingered on the gold coins, and I could practically see her calculating how much comfort that money could buy her.\n\"There's one more thing,\" I added, my tone becoming even more serious. \"Under no circumstances should Kael or any of the other children become aware that he's being watched. If he discovers your surveillance, the deal is off and you'll face consequences far worse than losing this opportunity.\"\n\"I understand completely, sir,\" she replied eagerly. \"He'll never suspect anything. That boy barely acknowledges my existence anyway.\"\nThat was exactly what I was counting on. Martha's natural dislike of Kael would make her observations seem completely normal. She already avoided him when possible and treated him with obvious disdain. Nothing about her behaviour would change enough to raise suspicions.\n\"Excellent. Your first payment.\" I gestured to the coins on the desk. \"You'll receive the same amount each month as long as your reports remain useful and accurate. The way you treat him should remain the same, any more or any less and you will lose a lot.\nYou will not get in my good books if you treat him well, or treat badly, you will not get on my bad books. Is that understood? Stay the same.\"\n\"Yes, Sir. I will make sure of that.\" She nodded.\nMartha's hand moved toward the money almost involuntarily before she caught herself and maintained her composure.\n\"When do I start?\"\n\"Immediately.",

      "content": "Chapter 20 - Hunting in the Forest\nThis arrangement would give me detailed intelligence on Kael's situation leading up to the fire incident.\nMore importantly, it would alert me if Daybreak operatives made contact with him earlier than expected, allowing me to adjust my plans accordingly.\nMartha was disposable, which made her perfect for this role. When the time came, her death would serve as additional motivation for Kael's transformation into the Winter Beast.\nI didn't care about a woman that ate the money of orphans without any consciousness.\nEverything was falling into place exactly as I needed it to.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n***\nAs I walked away from the orphanage, I felt some hesitation. Was it really the correct choice to let the kid stay bullied? Was it really the right decision to let him walk the path of villainy?\nI pondered these questions as I made my way toward the forest.\nThe more I thought about it, the more conflicted I became. In the end, I shook the thoughts away with some coldness.\nIt was essential that Kael interact with the people of Daybreak. It was his fate.\nWhy would I change it? If anyone was to blame, it would be the damn author of \"The Academy's Fallen Hero.\"\nI was just trying to survive in this place. If Kael didn't follow the footsteps of his original timeline, then I would alter a canonical event and disrupt the entire story progression.\nTimeline changes were not in my favor at all. They created uncertainty, and uncertainty killed people like me who relied on foreknowledge for survival.\nUntil I could benefit from my knowledge of future events inside this novel, I would not change anything if it could be avoided.\nI reached the forest entrance with my mind made up.\nI steeled myself and walked in, preparing for another hunting trip to refill my blood reserves and gain some additional combat experience.\nI remained careful, even at the periphery of the forest. Some predators at Elite rank or higher could potentially wander into the outer areas. It had happened in the novel before, and overconfidence would get me killed.\nThe familiar scents of earth, vegetation, and magical beast musk filled my senses as I moved deeper into the woods.\nMy vampire abilities made me naturally suited for this environment. I was able to hear, smell and see things that others couldn't at longer distances.\nAfter about twenty minutes of careful tracking, I caught the scent of blood and heard the sounds of conflict ahead.\nMoving silently through the underbrush, I discovered two Noble-rank creatures engaged in a dispute. A Thornback Boar and a Wolf circled each other in a small clearing, both already wounded from their fighting.\nPerfect.\nInjured prey would be easier to handle, and fighting two opponents would give me valuable experience managing multiple threats simultaneously.\nThe Thornback Boar was a massive creature, easily twice the size of a normal pig, with razor-sharp spines protruding from its back and shoulders. Dark blood oozed from several gashes where the wolf had managed to score hits with its claws.\nThe Wolf was leaner but no less dangerous. Its dark fur blended with the background, making its exact position difficult to track with normal vision at sundown.\nSeveral of the boar's spines had pierced its body, leaving bloody wounds that slowed its movements.\nBoth beasts were so focused on each other that they hadn't noticed my approach.\nDrawing my sword quietly, I activated my Blood Control trait, focusing on the blood already spilled around the clearing.\nThe crimson liquid responded to my will, rising from the ground and forest floor to form a floating reservoir that I could weaponize at a moment's notice.\nThe two beasts did notice my interference, and focused on each other.\nThe Shadow Wolf struck first, lunging at the boar's throat with incredible speed. The boar countered by lowering its head and charging, its tusks aimed at the wolf's exposed belly.\nThat was my opening.\nI burst from the treeline and immediately targeted the wolf with my blood manipulation. The creature's own spilled blood formed into sharp projectiles that launched directly at its eyes and throat.\nSurprised but alert, the wolf twisted in mid-air, trying to avoid both the boar's charge and my blood spears.\nIt managed to dodge the tusks but couldn't escape my attack. One blood spike pierced its left eye, sending it crashing to the ground with a howl of pain and rage.\nThe second blood spike followed suit, finding purchase on its thick hide.\nThe Thornback Boar, startled by my sudden appearance, spun toward me with surprising agility for such a massive creature. Its small eyes burned with fury as it identified me as a new threat.\nI can see that it no longer felt threatened from the wolf. Instead, it saw me as a threat, the third-party that had joined to clean both of them up.\nI didn't give it time to charge. Using my high speed, I darted to the side while simultaneously manipulating the boar's own blood through its wounds.\nThe beast's blood pressure spiked dramatically as I forced circulation to accelerate beyond sustainable levels.\nBlood erupted from the creature's spines and existing cuts as its cardiovascular system overloaded. The boar staggered, confusion replacing anger as internal blood wreaked havoc its body.\nThe Wolf, despite its wounded eye and body, attempted to capitalize on the boar's distress before death. It leaped toward the larger creature's back, claws extended to tear into the spine-covered hide.\nI intercepted its trajectory with a blood-formed whip that wrapped around the wolf's hind legs and slammed it into a nearby tree trunk.\nROAR!Google seaʀᴄh Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nThe impact produced a sickening crack as several ribs broke under the force.\nWith both creatures severely injured and disoriented. It was time to finish this efficiently.\nI rushed the boar first, using my strength to drive my sword deep between its ribs while simultaneously bursting every major blood vessel in its head through concentrated blood manipulation. The massive creature collapsed instantly, its brain starved of oxygen as its circulatory system failed completely.\nBeing stronger than both monsters made it really use for me to manipulate their blood to their liking. I just had to expend a decent portion of mana to ensure a good kill.\nThe Wolf struggled to rise, its breathing labored from broken ribs and blood loss. I approached carefully, knowing that wounded predators were often the most dangerous.\nAs expected, the wolf gathered its remaining strength for a desperate final attack. It launched itself at me with surprising speed, jaws open to tear out my throat.\nI caught it mid-leap with my reflexes, one hand gripping its muzzle while the other grabbed its neck. My vampire strength made the wolf's struggles futile as I slowly increased pressure on its blood vessels.\nThe creature's struggles grew weaker as oxygen failed to reach its brain. Within seconds, it went limp in my grasp.\nI set the wolf's body down gently and surveyed the clearing. Two Noble-rank magical beasts eliminated with minimal effort and no injuries to myself.\nMy combination of blood manipulation, enhanced physical body, and basic strategy had proven devastatingly effective. The vampire bloodline was truly living up to its Supreme classification.\nNow I just needed to collect their blood and search for any useful drops before continuing my hunt for stronger prey.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nThe blood of two noble rank beasts would certainly not be enough to feed me.",

      "content": "Chapter 21 - A Change\nAfter collecting the blood of the two beasts in a vial, I made my way deeper into the forest. I had brought with me two empty vials and my pendant for storage.\nOverall, I would be able to store a total of three litres of blood, which would be enough to sustain me for several days at my normal consumption rate, unless I encountered Kyle once again.\nI cursed the author for such a weakness. I constantly needed blood to maintain my rationality and control, but after remembering some of the weaknesses other characters faced in the novel, I stopped complaining.\nSeraphina's Valkyrie bloodline made her physically incapable of retreating from any fight, even when retreat was the logical choice. Kyle had to knock her out many times so they could retreat and escape their predicament.\nIt was simply blood instead of regular food. Instead of hunting for meat, I had to hunt for blood. When viewed that way, it wasn't too terrible of a trade-off.\nAround two hundred meters deeper into the forest, I encountered a pack of wolves.\nThere were three of them, and fortunately no alpha accompanied the group. I spotted them before they noticed my presence, giving me the crucial advantage of surprise. They were feasting on the carcass of a Thornback Boar, clearly having ganged up on the poor creature and torn it apart while it was still alive.\nThe pack consisted of two regular Forest Wolves and what appeared to be a slightly larger Dire Wolf variant. All three were Noble-rank beasts, but their coordinated pack tactics would make them more dangerous than the previous two creatures I'd faced individually.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ\nAfter scanning the surrounding area to ensure no other threats lurked nearby, I decided to emerge from cover. I wanted to get this fight finished quickly and efficiently.\nThree wolves wouldn't pose too much of a challenge, especially with my current abilities. I was unable to launch a surprise attack due to the distance and terrain. Nonetheless, it wasn't a big deal, they were easy targets.\nI stepped into the clearing with my sword drawn, immediately catching the attention of the feeding pack. All three wolves raised their blood-stained muzzles from their meal, ears flattening against their skulls as they assessed this new threat.\nThe largest wolf, the Dire Wolf variant, let out a low growl that rumbled through the forest. Its companions flanked it on either side, adopting an aggressive formation that spoke of pack hunting experience.\nWithout waiting for them to coordinate their attack, I activated my Blood Control trait and targeted the fresh blood covering their muzzles and paws from their recent kill. The crimson liquid responded to my will, forming thin tendrils that snaked toward their eyes and nostrils.\nThe wolves reacted with alarm as blood began obscuring their vision and blocking their airways. The Dire Wolf shook its head violently, trying to clear the blood from its eyes, while its packmates pawed at their faces in confusion.\nI capitalized on their disorientation by charging the nearest Forest Wolf. I arrived there within a few seconds. My sword sliced cleanly through its neck before it could react, dropping it instantly to the forest floor.\nThud!\nThe second Forest Wolf, partially blinded but still dangerous, leapt toward where it had last seen me. I sidestepped its clumsy attack and grabbed its hind leg with my supernatural strength, using the creature's own momentum to slam it against a tree trunk.\nThe impact stunned the wolf, giving me the opening I needed to drive my blade through its heart.\nWith two wolves down, there was only one left to go.\nThe Dire Wolf had managed to clear most of the blood from its eyes and was circling me warily. This one was smarter than its fallen packmates, recognizing that a direct assault would likely end in death.\nIt began feinting attacks, darting forward only to retreat when I moved to counter. The creature was trying to tire me out or force me into making a mistake.\nI decided to end its cautious strategy immediately.\nFocusing my Blood Control on the creature's circulatory system, I began applying pressure to its major arteries. The wolf's eyes widened as it felt its blood flow being constricted, causing dizziness and weakness to spread through its body.\nThe wolf fought through the discomfort and launched a desperate final attack as it felt its immanent death, its jaws aimed at my throat.\nI caught its head with both hands, my vampire strength easily overpowering the weakened wolf and with a powerful twist, I snapped its neck cleanly, ending its suffering.\nThree wolves eliminated in under two minutes. My combat efficiency was improving with each encounter, the effort I've poured into training was bearing fruit.\nI collected blood samples from all three creatures, filling my second vial completely. The Dire Wolf's blood had a slightly different scent than regular wolf blood.\nAfter securing my blood samples from the wolves and the boar and cleaning my sword, I decided to head back. Five litres of various beast blood should sustain me for at least a week under normal circumstances.\nThere was no need to put myself under risk for no reason. As long as I played it safe, I was bound to survive this world.\nMy current power level was well off, and even if the academy started today, I would have a very good base. I was in no hurry to increase my strength by risking my life.\n\"Slow and Steady wins the race,\" I muttered to myself, a small smile forming on my face as I made my way back to the city.\nAs I made my way back, I suddenly heard a scream coming from the north. I wasn't far from returning back to the city, around a hundred or so meters.\nThe sound was that of a young woman.\n\"HE...LP!\"\nHer voice was distant and slightly muffled in my ears. She was around a hundred meters away or so, despite the distance, I could hear the panic and fear in her voice.\nWanting to check out what was happening I darted in the direction where the scream came from. It didn't take me long to arrive at the location.\nI looked at the scene in front of me with a huge frown on my face.\nBefore me stood a woman; she appeared to be in her early twenties. The woman wasn't the reason for my frown, it was what was next to her shivering body.\nA large bear, which I immediately recognised as an elite-ranked beast, lay dead on the floor. Yet again, that wasn't the reason.\nThe reason was... Kyle.\nKyle had saved the woman by killing the elite-ranked boar. I could see his chest rising and falling in hangered breaths, the fight wasn't easy it seemed.\nHow... this has never appeared in the novel. Would such a scene be left out in the novel, or is this another change in the timeline?\nI thought to myself, the frown remaining on my face.",

      "content": "Chapter 22 - Engagement Officially Broken\n\"Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?\" Kyle said, checking on the woman beside him.\nThe woman shook her head excessively.\n\"No, no! I'm fine. Are you okay? It looked like you took a strong hit earlier, you were bleeding! You need to go to a healer.\"\nKyle shook his head. \"I'm fine. Don't worry about me. You should head back now, it's not safe here.\"\nKyle didn't ask the woman what she was doing in the forest or probe for details. He simply reassured her and urged her to get to safety, his natural heroic instincts on full display.\nShe nodded quickly. \"Yes, thank you so much for saving me. I don't know what would have happened if you hadn't arrived.\"ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\n\"Just be more careful next time,\" Kyle replied, his tone gentle but firm. \"These woods are dangerous, especially for someone traveling alone.\"\nI watched the exchange with growing concern. My position was decently far from them, but luckily my vampire senses allowed me to observe from a distance where even Kyle couldn't detect my presence. Still, I couldn't help but wonder about this scene.\nDid I forget this insignificant encounter from the novel, or had I really changed the plotline so drastically?\nThe woman gathered herself and began walking back toward the city, occasionally glancing over her shoulder at Kyle with obvious gratitude. Kyle remained in place, watching to ensure she made it safely away from the immediate area before he would move.\nThis was classic protagonist behaviour.\nSelfless, protective, always putting others' safety before his own concerns. But the timing and location didn't match anything I remembered from the original story.\nIn the novel, Kyle's early encounters had been carefully documented because they established his character and reputation. A scene where he saved a woman from an Elite-ranked bear should have been memorable, especially since it demonstrated his combat capabilities before entering the academy.\nYet I had no recollection of it whatsoever.\nMy actions were creating ripple effects throughout the timeline, changing minor encounters. The serpent I'd killed, the ecosystem disruption, Kyle's earlier arrival in the city, all of it was cascading into unexpected consequences.\nThis woman's presence in the forest, the bear's location, Kyle's decision to venture this deep into the woods, none of it aligned with my knowledge of the original timeline.\nI needed to retreat before Kyle finished his heroic duties and potentially sensed my presence. Getting involved in this altered scene would only create more unpredictable changes.\nAs I began to carefully back away through the underbrush, I couldn't shake the unsettling realization that my careful plans to preserve the timeline were failing. Every action I took, no matter how small, seemed to generate new variables I couldn't account for.\nThe question was: how many more changes could the story absorb before it became completely unrecognizable?\n...\nBack in the mansion, Adrian found a familiar figure sitting in the living room with his parents.\nSeraphina Rosewood and her family had come to visit.\nLooking at the family seated together, it reminded me of their power dynamics from the novel. House Rosewood currently held equal status with the other ducal families, but Seraphina's awakening of a Legendary Valkyrie bloodline would fundamentally alter that balance.\nOnce her abilities became publicly known, their house would be elevated above the others in terms of pure potential. Each duke family possessed Rare-rank bloodlines that had remained stable for generations, but a Legendary bloodline was on an entirely different level.\nThis elevation would create massive political ripples. Later in the novel, House Stormwind would begin secretly targeting the Rosewoods, orchestrating daily assassination attempts against Seraphina to prevent her from reaching her full potential and disrupting the established power structure.\nOf course, Kyle would eventually save her from these attempts, uncover Stormwind's involvement, and systematically destroy their house in retaliation. But that was still months away from happening.\nBut after witnessing what had happened in the forest, I began to doubt the way I was structuring things, or maybe I was too paranoid.\nMy father's voice interrupted my thoughts. \"Adrian, sit down.\"\nI nodded and greeted the Rosewood family politely but with reserve, unlike the bootlicker, old Adrian. My demeanour was neither overly warm nor cold, exactly what would be expected from someone who had recently ended an engagement with their daughter.\nDuke Edmund Rosewood was an imposing man with dark brown hair and green eyes that seemed to assess everything around him. Duchess Lyanna Rosewood possessed an elegant beauty that Seraphina had clearly inherited, along with the same demeanour that marked true nobility.\nAnd then there was Seraphina herself, sitting with perfect posture and that familiar mask of indifference she wore in formal settings.\nThe tension in the room was visible as both families navigated the delicate social situation created by our broken engagement.\nThe conversation began with the typical pleasantries expected in such formal meetings, but everyone present knew the real purpose of this visit.\nDuke Edmund cleared his throat, his expression serious but not unkind. \"Marcus, I believe we need to address the matter that brought us here today.\"\nMy father nodded. \"Indeed. The engagement between our children.\"\n\"Both Seraphina and Adrian have expressed their desire to dissolve the arrangement,\" Duke Edmund continued, glancing between his daughter and me. \"While this wasn't the outcome we had hoped for, we must respect their wishes.\"\nDuchess Lyanna spoke up, her voice gentle. \"We believe that forcing an unwanted marriage would only breed resentment and unhappiness for both families.\"\nMy mother, Elena, nodded in agreement. \"A marriage is built on mutual respect and affection.\"\nSeraphina maintained her composed expression throughout the discussion, though I caught her shooting me a brief, curious glance. She was probably still puzzled by my complete change in attitude from our last conversation.\n\"Very well,\" my father said with a heavy sigh. \"Let it be officially recorded that the engagement between Adrian Blackwood and Seraphina Rosewood is hereby dissolved by mutual consent of both parties and their families.\"\nDuke Edmund echoed the sentiment with his own weary sigh. \"Though I must say, Marcus, I had hoped this alliance would bring our houses closer together through the rope of kinship. The promise we made to each other all those years ago...\"\n\"When we thought we might not survive the war,\" my father finished, understanding in his voice. \"We swore that if we both lived, our children would unite our families.\"\nBoth men looked older in that moment, remembering their shared history and the dreams they'd held for their children's future.\n\"Perhaps it's for the best,\" Duke Edmund said finally. \"Arranged marriages based on old promises don't always lead to happiness, no matter how well-intentioned. Either way, we are still a family, and I will always have your back, just like the old times.\"\nMarcus nodded. \"Like wise, Edmund....Likewise.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 23 - Elite Rank, Increased Bloodline Purity\nThe formal dissolution of the engagement had been handled with the dignity and grace expected of noble houses, but I could see the disappointment in both fathers' eyes. They had genuinely believed this union would benefit everyone involved.\nLittle did they know that breaking this engagement had probably saved both Houses from a great deal of future suffering.\nAfter the engagement was officially broken, the Rosewood family left and I was left with my parents in the living room.\n\"Hopefully this is for the best,\" my father sighed.\nThe tense atmosphere in the living room was awkward.\nFeeling the heavy silence, I decided to excuse myself. \"I'll be in my room if you need me.\"\n...\nIn my room, I took out some paper and started writing down all the important and unimportant events I remembered from the novel. I felt like there hadn't been any need before because of my enhanced memory that came with my vampire transformation. But after seeing Kyle in that forest scene that didn't match my recollections, I wanted to make sure whether the plotline was really changing or if I was somehow losing certain memories about the book.\nBoth options were valid possibilities, and creating a written record was a good way to verify what I actually knew versus what I thought I knew.\nI started with the immediate future events that should happen within the next few weeks, then moved on to the academy arc timeline. The entrance examinations, the ranking tournaments, the various crises that would unfold throughout the first semester, documenting everything I could recall with as much detail as possible.\nAfter writing several pages of events that should be happening soon, I folded the papers carefully and secured them on me. This written timeline would serve as my reference point for detecting future changes.\n\"This world is so troublesome... especially...\" I paused, thinking about the future events and the ripple effects my actions were creating. \"Sigh, forget it. There's no need to worry about this now. It's not the time.\"\nI sat down on my bed and started meditating, trying to center myself and focus on what I could control. The urge to gain more power to deal with whatever was coming grew stronger with each passing day.\nThe uncertainty was the most dangerous part. In the original story, I'd known exactly when and how Adrian would die. Now, with the timeline shifting in unpredictable ways, that knowledge was becoming less reliable.\nI needed to be stronger, faster, and more prepared for scenarios I couldn't foresee. The daily login system was helpful, but it wasn't enough on its own, especially with today's daily reward of a Mortal-Rank healing potion.\n...\nShing!\nSlash!\nThe Elite-rank beast before me dropped to the floor with a heavy thud, its lifeblood pooling beneath its massive body.\nOnce again, I felt my body growing stronger. Every time I killed a beast, I felt my soul power increase, that familiar sensation of energy flowing into me and strengthening my core.\nIn this world, this was how people progressed. Through claiming the soul power of defeated enemies and using that accumulated energy to reach the next rank. It was a brutal but effective system that rewarded those willing to face danger head-on.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nThe soul system had also accounted for cheats, people were unable to cheat the system by making their stronger relatives give them near-dead monsters to get stronger with.\nNearly two weeks had passed since the engagement was broken. In that time, I'd gained complete control over my enhanced body, and now I could easily dispatch normal Elite-rank beasts without breaking a sweat. My daily training with my father had paid dividends, and my combat instincts had sharpened considerably.\nMy daily login rewards had been a mixed bag during this period. Sometimes good, mostly disappointing.\nI'd been receiving primarily Mortal-grade items like health potions, mana recovery, and basic utility items that, while somewhat useful, weren't anything special. The system seemed to enjoy giving me mundane supplies rather than the powerful artifacts I craved.\nHowever, three items had stood out as genuinely beneficial additions to my arsenal. They were all Enhanced-grade equipment, which wasn't the highest tier available but still represented a significant improvement over Mortal-grade gear.\n[Swift Step Boots]\n[Grade: Enhanced]\n[Details: Increases the wearer's agility by 5% when equipped. The enchanted leather adapts to the user's foot shape for maximum comfort during extended combat or travel.]\n[Mana Flow Bracelet]\n[Grade: Enhanced]\n[Details: Increases the wearer's total mana capacity by 5%. The silver band contains micro-crystals that help regulate magical energy flow throughout the body.]\n[Razor Edge Sword]\n[Grade: Enhanced]\n[Details: This blade possesses supernatural sharpness capable of cutting through steel like butter. While it provides no stat bonuses, its cutting power makes it effective against Elite-rank monster hides and Armor.]\nThe sword had quickly become my preferred weapon. Its ability to slice through Elite-rank defences with minimal effort had saved me considerable time and energy during my earlier hunts. Combined with my Blood Control abilities, it made me a nightmare against most opponents in the elite-rank.\nBut today was special. Today brought the advancement I'd been working toward for the past two weeks.\nI smiled as I saw the notifications I'd finally been waiting for.\n[You've reached Elite Rank!]\n[Your bloodline purity has increased by 5%]\n[Your existing traits have levelled up!]\n[You have gained a new trait: Blood Enhancement (1st Order)]\nWhen advancing in rank, two things could potentially happen. Either you gained a completely new trait, or your existing traits simply levelled up through the increase of your bloodline purity. I wasn't surprised that I'd experienced both benefits simultaneously.\nThis was one of the major perks of possessing a Supreme-tier bloodline. You were fundamentally different from other awakeners.\nWhilst traits could be levelled up through ranking advancement, they could also be improved through consistent usage and mastery. The more you exercised a particular ability, the stronger and more refined it became. This dual progression system rewarded both natural talent and dedicated practice.\nMy updated status screen displayed my new capabilities.",

      "content": "Chapter 24 - Blood Enhancement, Academy Entrance Exam\n[Host: Adrian Blackwood]\n[Bloodline: Supreme Vampire - 15%]\n[Rank: Elite]\n[Traits: Blood Control (2nd Order, Lvl.2), Supernatural Physique (1st Order, Lvl.3), Blood Enhancement (1st Order, Lvl.1)]\n[Aspect: Serpent Scales (Elite)]\n[Echo: None]\nDespite my killing of a few elite-ranked beasts after the serpent, I didn't receive any new aspect or echo, which wasn't great but it was expected.\nI had levelled up my Supernatural Physique trait once before this recent advancement through the intensive combat training and physical conditioning. Blood Control was proving harder to level up, but I could feel myself approaching the threshold for another improvement. Higher-order abilities required more effort and experience to advance, which made sense given their superior power.\nExcited about my new trait, I focused on examining its capabilities.\n[Blood Enhancement]\n[Order: 1]\n[Level: 1]\n[Details: Allows the user to infuse weapons with blood energy, increasing their cutting power, durability, and effectiveness against defences.]\nThe description was concise but promising. This trait appeared to have excellent practical applications and seemed relatively straightforward to level up through regular use. Blood Enhancement could be practiced with any weapon and any available blood source.\nI could already envision how this would synergize with my other abilities. My Blood Control could gather and manipulate blood from defeated enemies, which I could then use a portion of to enhance my weapons mid-combat. The combination would make me significantly more dangerous against heavily armoured opponents or creatures with natural resistances.\nTesting the new ability immediately, I drew some blood from my pendant and focused on channelling it into my Razor Edge Sword. The crimson liquid flowed along the blade's surface.\nThe sword's weight remained the same, but I could feel its lethality had increased substantially. The blood enhancement created a resonance between my vampire nature and the weapon, amplifying both its physical sharpness and its effectiveness against defences.\nI slowly passed the enhanced blade at a nearby tree trunk. The sword sliced through the thick wood like it was paper, leaving a clean cut that showed no resistance whatsoever. Even more impressive, the blood enhancement seemed to prevent the blade from dulling or chipping despite the impact.\nThis was exactly the kind of versatile ability that would serve me well in the dangerous times ahead. Whether facing magical beasts, or the various threats that would emerge during the academy arc, having weapons that could cut through stronger defence would be invaluable.\nMy smile widened as I contemplated the possibilities. Elite rank brought new challenges, but it also provided the tools necessary to face them. With my enhanced abilities, improved equipment, and growing combat experience, I was becoming someone who could stand on equal footing with the story's major characters.\nThe question was whether that would be enough when the real chaos began.\nFor now, though, I was content to savour this moment of advancement. Every step forward was a step away from the helpless fate that had originally awaited Adrian Blackwood.\nI cleaned my blade and began making my way back to the city.\nThe academy entrance exams were only a day away.\n...\nMy body felt much stronger than before. Level 3 Supernatural Physique trait had enhanced not just my overall body, but also refined my control over it. My senses were sharper than ever, but what was really a game changer was my new ability to limit their intensity.\nI'd previously struggled with the overwhelming flood of sensory information, hearing conversations from rooms away, smelling every individual scent in a crowded marketplace, feeling the vibrations of footsteps through the floor. It had been genuinely troublesome to deal with on a daily basis.\nBut with my trait at level 3, I gained the ability to dial down my senses to comfortable levels. I could adjust my hearing, smell, and other enhanced perceptions to my liking rather than being constantly bombarded with information. The relief was immense, like finally being able to turn down the volume on the world around me.\nArriving at the main hall, I found my parents waiting for me with expectant expressions.\n\"Adrian, how are you feeling? The entrance exam is tomorrow,\" my father asked, a proud smile spreading across his face.\nDuring the past two weeks, I had accompanied my father on several hunting expeditions deeper into the forest. I'd used that time strategically, knowing that with him as my bodyguard, I could face stronger opponents and gain more soul power without the usual risks of encountering wandering beasts.\nIt had proven to be the correct decision, though not without its complications. We'd actually encountered a Transcendent-rank beast during one of our hunts. We weren't even particularly deep into the forest when the creature appeared, a massive Lion that could have easily killed dozens of Elite-rank awakeners.\nFortunately, my father had handled the threat with the skill and power befitting his rank. He'd gained an echo from the victory and had been relatively pleased with the outcome.\nBut I wasn't happy about it at all. The implications were deeply troubling.\nFor a Transcendent beast to appear so close to the city was extremely unusual and concerning. It could have been an anomaly, perhaps a solitary predator that had wandered too far from its normal territory.\nBut was it really that simple?Thɪs ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nIn this world, there were barely any moments of pure coincidence. Everything had underlying reasons and motivations. That beast must have had a purpose for venturing so close to human civilization, and that possibility worried me considerably.\nTranscendent-rank creatures were intelligent enough to understand territorial boundaries and the dangers of approaching major population centres. They didn't simply wander into areas where they might face organized resistance from multiple high-rank awakeners unless something was driving them.\n\"I'm feeling confident about tomorrow,\" I replied to my father's question, pushing my concerns about the beast encounter to the back of my mind. \"The training these past weeks has been really good.\"\nMy mother stepped forward with her warm smile. \"We're so proud of how hard you've been working, darling. Your awakening has truly transformed you.\"\nShe wasn't wrong. T\nhe difference between the original Adrian and my current self was staggering. Two weeks ago, I'd been a newly awakened Noble-rank. Now I was an Elite-rank combatant with abilities that could surprise even the academy instructors.\n\"The academy will be a new challenge,\" my father said thoughtfully. \"But I have complete confidence in your abilities. Just remember to stay focused and don't let your guard down around the other students. Some of them come from families with... complicated relationships with ours.\"\nI nodded, understanding the political subtext. The academy would be filled with children from rival houses, each carrying their family's ambitions and grudges. Navigating those social dynamics would be just as important as excelling in combat training.\n\"I'll be careful, Father. And I'll make sure to represent our family well.\"\nMy parents beamed at my words, clearly pleased with my attitude.\nTomorrow would mark the beginning of the academy arc, the most dangerous period in the original timeline for Adrian. But unlike the doomed Adrian Blackwood from the novel, I was prepared for what was coming.\nThe question was whether my preparations would be enough when the real chaos began.",

You have received: Guardian's Last Stand]\n[Guardian's Last Stand]\n[Grade: Rare]\n[Details: Creates an impenetrable barrier that blocks all attacks from Transcendent-rank beings or below for exactly 10 seconds. Once activated, the shield cannot be dismissed early and will automatically disappear after the time limit. Single use only.]\nThɪs\nStaring at my reward, I felt a surge of genuine satisfaction. This was a life-saving measure of the highest order! Ten seconds might not sound like much, but in combat situations, those precious moments could mean the difference between life and death.\nI could think of countless scenarios where this shield would be invaluable. Against Transcendent-rank threats, Elite-rank awakeners were essentially helpless, but this shield would level the playing field, at least temporarily.\nThe timing couldn't have been better either. Today was the entrance examination.\nHaving an emergency escape option hidden in my arsenal provided an extra layer of security that could prove crucial.\nMore importantly, given my recent encounter with that Transcendent beast in the forest, this shield felt good to have. If whatever was driving high-rank creatures toward the city continued to escalate, I might need exactly this kind of protection sooner than expected.\nI carefully stored the shield's activation crystal in my storage ring, making sure to position it where I could access it instantly if needed. Unlike my other equipment, this was purely a defensive emergency measure, not something to rely on regularly, but rather a final trump card for dire situations.\nTen seconds of invulnerability. It was a small window, but in the hands of someone who knew what was coming, it could change everything.\n\"Take care, sweetie. I know you will do well,\" My mom said, before giving me a kiss on my forehead.\nI nodded, allowing a small smile to cross my face. \"Thanks, Mom.\"\nMy father extended his arm for what appeared to be a fist bump. \"Show them what you've got.\"\nI returned the gesture with the same smile, though inwardly I was thinking something quite different.\nSorry, Dad, but I'll have to pass on showing them what I've got. The last thing I wanted was to stand out or draw unnecessary attention during the academy entrance process.\nI climbed into the elegant wagon that would transport me to the academy. The vehicle was pulled by a tamed Elite-rank transportation beast, a creature specifically bred for endurance and speed rather than combat. The interior was luxurious and extremely comfortable, with cushioned seats and crystals that served as air conditioners that would make the long journey pleasant.\nThe academy was quite far from our estate, approximately three hours by beast-drawn transport. This gave me plenty of time to review my notes about what to expect during the entrance examination and prepare myself for the challenges ahead.\nAs the wagon began moving, I settled back into the plush seating and watched the familiar sights of Luminara fade into the distance.\n...\nAs the wagon moved steadily along the road toward the academy, I began to recount the events of the past two weeks.\nMartha had been providing me with constant updates on Kael, the future Winter Beast. So far, nothing appeared unusual in her reports. His daily routine remained unchanged, the same isolation, the same mistreatment from the other children, the same growing resentment that would eventually fuel his transformation into one of the story's most dangerous antagonists.\nHis loneliness and building hatred seemed to be progressing exactly as I remembered from the novel. The silver-haired boy continued sitting alone on that broken swing, enduring the whispered taunts about being cursed, slowly accumulating the emotional damage that would make him receptive to Daybreak's ideology.\nWhile I felt genuinely bad for the kid's suffering, it had to be done. He could endure the mistreatment for a while longer. I needed a reliable connection to the Daybreak organization, and Kael represented my best opportunity to gain that access. His future recruitment by the anti-royal faction was too valuable a resource for me to interfere with, out of misplaced sympathy.\nFor the past two weeks, I hadn't encountered Kyle again after that unexpected forest incident. Nothing had occurred since then that made me particularly worried about timeline disruptions.\nHowever, the upcoming entrance examination would serve as a crucial test. It would reveal whether the story's foundation remained intact or if my actions had caused more significant alterations than I'd realized.\nThe academy's entrance process was well-documented in the original novel. The specific tests, the notable student performances, the social dynamics that would emerge - all of it had been carefully detailed. If these elements proceeded as expected, it would confirm that the core timeline remained stable despite minor variations.\nBut if major deviations appeared during the exam, it would mean my interference had created unpredictable ripple effects that could make my future knowledge unreliable.\nThe examination would determine whether the plot was changing dramatically, how extensive any alterations might be, or if there were any significant changes at all. This assessment was crucial for planning my survival strategy going forward.\nI settled back into the comfortable wagon seating and closed my eyes to rest. The three-hour journey would give me time to mentally prepare for whatever awaited me at the academy.\nToday would answer many of my questions about how much this world had diverged from the story I thought I knew.\n...\nI slowly opened my eyes as I felt the wagon stop moving.\n\"It seems like we arrived\" I muttered to myself as I heard the wagon driver's voice.\n\"Young master, we've arrived at the academy.\" The driver's voice came as he knocked gently on the luxurious cabin I was staying in.\n\"Alright,\" I responded, before organising myself and taking a deep breath.\nI stood up and opened the door to the wagon, and the sight before me was nothing short of amazing.",

      "content": "Chapter 26 - The Academy\nArriving at the academy location, I stood up and opened the door of my wagon. The sight before me was truly amazing.\nI could see hundreds of awakeners gathered outside the academy gates, all waiting for the announcement of the entrance examination procedures.\n\"Look at the size of this place!\" a young woman exclaimed to her companion. \"I heard the training grounds alone are larger than most noble estates!\"\n\"The rumors say they have magical beasts contained within the academy for practical combat training,\" another voice added with obvious excitement.\n\"Real Noble and Elite-rank creatures that students get to fight! Some also say that it you have enough strength, you could tame some of those beasts!\"\nMy ears picked up dozens of conversations happening simultaneously throughout the crowd.\n\"I've been preparing for this my entire life. If I don't pass, my family will disown me.\" a nervous-sounding boy was muttering.\n\"Don't worry about it,\" his friend replied giving him a pat on the back. \"The acceptance rate isn't that bad if you're actually talented. They're looking for potential, not just current strength.\"\n\"Easy for you to say, you awakened a Rare bloodline. Some of us are working with common talents and hoping for the best.\"\nThe scents hitting my nostrils were equally diverse. The metallic tang of weapons and armor mixed with various perfumes, and blood. Each awakener carried their own unique scent profile based on their abilities and heritage.\nAll kinds of blood scents made my hand twitch slightly. Luckily, I had drank my fill just earlier in the wagon. So, I wasn't particularly worried about losing control.\nThen I heard my family name mentioned in hushed tones nearby.\n\"Look at the family crest, it's one of the four ducal houses.\"\n\"Is that a Blackwood carriage?\" someone whispered.\n\"Which heir is it? I heard the Blackwood heir was supposed to be pretty weak. I heard that he never trained, and he was always out playing and somurging his family wealth.\" A young noble whispered to his friend.\nEven if he believed he was stronger than Adrian. He didn't dare say that outloud, lest Adrian heard it and snitched on him. His family would definitely disown him to avoid damages.\n\"Doesn't matter how weak he is,\" another voice whispered with obvious envy. \"Ducal families get automatic consideration. He'll probably pass even if he's never seen a sword before which is not fair to the rest of us who actually had to earn our way here.\"\nHis friend chuckled before replying. \"When was anything fair in this world?\"\nHearing their words, I scoffed inwardly. Not only were they born in noble families, they had good talents. Yet, they still complained about unfairness.Googlᴇ search ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nIn his eyes, they were shameless through and through. Unlike him, they didn't have a death halo over their heads. Nor did they know about what kind of chaos was going to come.\nIgnorance is bliss.\nI could sense eyes turning toward me as I stepped down from the wagon, though most people were trying to be discrete about their staring. The eyes of expectations and assumptions pressed down on me from all directions.\n\"Thank you,\" I told the driver quietly. \"Please return home and inform my parents that I arrived safely.\"\n\"Of course, Young Master,\" he replied with a respectful bow before preparing to depart.\nAs the heir of one of the four ducal families in Luminara, I didn't need to wait in the general crowd. I'd already been provided with a referral letter that would grant me direct access once registration officially began. The letter would allow me to enter with the first batch and compete in the examination without the usual preliminary screenings of background checks.\nBased on the timeline I wrote down, the first batch would consist primarily of nobles and a select number of exceptional common awakeners who had already proven themselves through preliminary testing. This arrangement meant I wouldn't encounter Kyle during my examinations, since he would be placed in the third batch with other unsponsored applicants.\nThat timing worked perfectly for my plans to avoid unnecessary interaction with the protagonist.\nTurning my attention to the academy building itself, I was struck by its magnificence. The structure was incredibly large, sprawling across what must have been several square miles of carefully maintained grounds. Open fields surrounded the main complex, providing ample space for outdoor training and combat exercises.\nThe architecture reminded me strongly of Hogwarts from my previous life, but with significant differences that marked it as distinct. The entire complex was constructed from gleaming white quartz and stone, giving it an elegant and pure appearance that spoke of both power and nobility.\nTowering turrets reached toward the sky. Elaborate buttresses supported the main structure while creating an aesthetic that was both imposing and beautiful.\nMassive gates stood open at the main entrance, flanked by guards in armor who woukd soon check credentials and direct applicants to their appropriate areas. The gates themselves were works of art, crafted from what appeared to be enchanted metal. The metal was said to withstand Transcendent rank attacks.\nA voice suddenly erupted across the area outside the academy, cutting through hundreds of conversations between future students.\nTurning my head towards the direction of the voice, I could see a man floating in the air on what appeared to be a platform made entirely of compressed wind. His robes billowed softly as he hovered above the crowd, clearly a high-ranking academy official with the power to back up his authority.\n\"Silence! The registration will begin shortly. But before that, I will remind everyone here about the rules.\"\nThe moment his voice rang out, I could no longer hear a single person talking. The entire crowd of hundreds fell into immediate, respectful silence. Even the most confident noble heirs seemed to understand that this was not someone to cross.\nThe floating man continued, his voice carrying easily across the vast gathering. \"Once you are rejected, you will leave the premises immediately. Any argument with the assessor will not only lead to your immediate removal by force, but it will result in your permanent ban from this facility. You will never have the chance to enter this place again!\"\nHis tone was deadly serious, and I could feel the tension ripple through the crowd. For many of these awakeners, this represented their only opportunity to join the kingdom's most prestigious institution.\nTo change their lives and the lives of their families to the better. Without entering this academy, they could at best become small time adventurers that waited for their inevitable deaths.\nThe academy didn't only offer a guaranteed job after graduation, but it granted you connections and skills to survive this world.\n\"Some of you might be thinking: 'What if the assessors are biased? What if I'm wronged?'\nWell, the answer is simple, it's high unlikely. Each assessor carries a device that records their every action during the examination process. Every decision will be documented, and any bias or error will be corrected after careful review. So if you are truly wronged, you will receive justice later.\"\nThat was reassuring, though I suspected the review process probably took weeks and rarely overturned initial decisions.",

No one dared risk their academy chances by speaking out of turn.\nThe official raised his hand, and magical energy began gathering around him. \"Now, with that being said, let the registration begin!\"\nAs his words echoed across the grounds, several gates opened simultaneously around the academy perimeter. Academy staff emerged from each entrance, carrying clipboards and what appeared to be magical evaluation devices.\n\"First batch, nobles and sponsored applicants. Proceed to the eastern gate!\" the floating man announced.\n\"Second batch, preliminary qualifiers, to the southern gate! Third batch - general applicants - to the western gate!\"\nThe term 'general' was used for people that were either without any social status, any awakener parents or from outside Luminara.\nThe crowd began moving in an orderly fashion, though I could feel the underlying excitement and nervousness as hundreds of young awakeners headed toward their respective examination areas.\nI made my way toward the eastern gate, my referral letter ready in hand. Around me, other noble heirs moved with varying degrees of confidence.\nSome carried themselves with obvious arrogance, clearly expecting their family names to guarantee admission. Others seemed genuinely nervous, understanding that family connections could only let them in and that didn't guarantee they would stay.\nAs I walked towards the eastern gate, a familiar smell of blood suddenly erupted in my nostrils.\nI smiled softly before turning my head toward the direction of that intoxicating scent.\nAfter meeting him twice, I had already become intimately familiar with Kyle's blood smell. My vampire senses could detect him easily now. I had also gained control over my senses, whilst his blood still enticed me, I was able to stop myself by drinking a lot of blood before hand, which I had done to avoid this exact scenario.\nHe's here.\nKyle stood with his younger sister near the western gate where the general applicants were gathering. Emily was close to his age at around fourteen, but despite this, she still acted like a young girl of ten.\nThe reason was her stunted growth and development. Her chronic illness had kept her isolated from normal social interactions, confined to their home where she was constantly treated as a fragile child who needed protection from the world. This overprotective environment had prevented her from maturing emotionally at the same rate as her peers.\nHowever, I could already see signs of change from our first encounter weeks ago. Her healing process should have started by now, based on the timeline I remembered, and I could observe her physical growth from this distance. I knew that as her health improved, her personality would begin shifting toward something more age-appropriate and mature.\nDespite my control, the sweet scent of Kyle's extraordinary bloodline made my throat burn slightly with that familiar thirst, but I maintained my composure and control.\nI took one last look at the siblings before continuing toward my designated gate. Kyle was exactly where he belonged according to the original timeline, in the third batch with the other unsponsored applicants who would need to prove themselves through merit alone.\nThat separation was perfect for my plans. The less interaction I had with the protagonist during these crucial early academy days, the better my chances of avoiding unwanted plot complications.\n..\nEntering through the eastern gate, I spotted a familiar silhouette ahead of me.\nSeraphina walked with a confident and icy stride that silently harboured internal respect from everyone around her. The aura she projected was so intimidating that other nobles instinctively gave her a wide berth, none daring to approach or attempt casual conversation.\nAnd those that did have the courage didn't do it for their own agendas.\nAlthough I knew that nobles received preferential treatment during the examination process and would likely gain admission, the novel hadn't provided specific details about what that treatment actually entailed.\nI walked steadily forward until I reached where the other nobles had gathered in front of an academy staff member.\nThe man stood in complete silence, offering no explanation or greeting. Despite the obvious questions burning in everyone's minds, no one dared speak. The man's aura was too suffocating, and the fact he didn't retrieve it meant that no body was allowed to talk. The tension stretched for what felt like ten minutes.\nFinally, he addressed the group. \"Now that everyone is here, you will all sign this document.\"\nLetters materialized out of thin air around the man, floating gracefully through the space before each one selected a target and drifted toward a different student. Mine settled gently into my outstretched palm.\nThe document contained standard academy enrolment agreements - legal acknowledgments that we would become students of the institution, along with various liability clauses and penalty structures for rule violations. Nothing unusual or concerning, just the typical bureaucratic requirements for such a large organization.\nI signed the papers without hesitation, knowing there were no hidden agendas or dangerous clauses buried in the legal text.\nOnce everyone had completed their signatures, the man gestured for us to follow him. \"Come. I will show you the facilities.\"ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nAlthough I already knew the academy's layout from reading the novel, I was curious to experience it first-hand. Reading descriptions was entirely different from actually seeing and walking through the spaces.\nWe passed through the main entrance into a grand foyer that took my breath away. Chandeliers hung from vaulted ceilings that stretched high. Tapestries depicting legendary battles and magical achievements adorned the walls, while enchanted portraits of former academy leaders watched our group with moving eyes.\n\"The academy spans over five square kilometres,\" our guide announced as we walked. \"The campus is divided into seven distinct sections, each serving specific educational and residential purposes.\"\nWe entered the first area through massive oak doors that were adorned with magical spells that protected them from breaches.\n\"Section A houses our lecture halls,\" the man explained, gesturing to the corridors branching off in multiple directions.\nThrough open doorways, I glimpsed amphitheatre-style classrooms with tiered seating that could accommodate hundreds of students. Magical blackboards floated in mid-air, automatically writing and erasing complex formulas and diagrams. Professor podiums were elevated on platforms that could rise or lower based on the instructor's preferences, while crystal orbs projected three-dimensional images to illustrate difficult concepts.\nOne classroom we passed was actively demonstrating elemental manipulation techniques. Floating spheres of fire, ice, and lightning danced through the air in perfect synchronization, controlled by invisible magical forces that responded to voice commands from the teaching assistant.\n\"Impressive facilities,\" I heard one noble mutter to his companion. \"My private tutors never had equipment like this.\"\nWe moved through a secure checkpoint staffed by guards in enhanced Armor before entering the next area.\n\"Section B contains professor offices and administrative spaces,\" our guide noted. \"Students are not permitted in this area without explicit invitation or emergency circumstances.\"\nThrough reinforced glass windows, I could see elegant offices filled with magical research materials, floating books that organized themselves, and communication crystals that pulsed with incoming messages from around the kingdom.\nThe transition to Section C required passing through another security barrier that scanned each of us with pale blue light.\n\"Section C houses our laboratories and research facilities,\" the guide continued. \"Access requires professor supervision due to the dangerous nature of experimental magical research conducted here.\"\nThe laboratory spaces were absolutely incredible.\nAlchemical equipment bubbled and steamed behind protective barriers, while containment units held samples of rare magical materials that glowed with inner energy.

      "content": "Chapter 28 - The Academy's Facilities (2)\nSection D opened into a massive arena that drew gasps of amazement from our entire group.\n\"The arena serves multiple purposes,\" our guide explained with obvious pride. \"Students may reserve time to settle personal disputes through formal combat, though such conflicts must be approved by faculty supervisors. Additionally, monthly ranking competitions are held here, where the top one hundred students can earn substantial rewards based on their performance.\"\nThe fighting space was enormous, easily large enough to accommodate aerial combat or large-scale magical battles. Protective barriers shimmered around the perimeter, designed to contain even Transcendent-level magical attacks. Tiered seating surrounded the arena floor, capable of holding thousands of spectators during major events.\nMagical scoring systems tracked combat statistics in real-time, displaying them on floating displays visible throughout the venue. The arena floor itself could transform to simulate different combat environments. I watched as sections shifted between rocky terrain, swampland, and open plains in a matter of seconds.\nSection E felt more familiar and comfortable after the intimidating grandeur of the previous areas.\n\"The dormitories,\" our guide announced as we entered a more residential district within the academy grounds.\nThe buildings were elegant but practical, constructed from the same white stone as the main campus but with warmer architectural touches. Gardens and courtyards provided peaceful spaces for study and relaxation, while enchanted walkways ensured safe passage during any weather conditions.\nEach dormitory building housed students from different year levels.\nSection F bustled with activity as we entered what could only be described as an elaborate shopping district.\n\"The mall operates on a point system,\" our guide explained. \"Students receive monthly point allocations based on their academic performance, combat rankings, and contribution to academy projects. These points can be exchanged for equipment, supplies, recreational activities, and various services. You will learn more about this during your first class, you don't have to worry about it now.\"\nThe variety of available goods was staggering. Weapon shops displayed enchanted swords, staffs, and armor that glowed with magical properties. Restaurants served cuisine from across the kingdom, while entertainment venues provided spaces for students to relax and socialize.\nI noticed point values displayed prominently next to every item and service. The system clearly incentivized academic excellence and competitive achievement.\nFinally, we arrived at Section G, housed within an enormous square building that dominated the horizon.The most update n0vels are published on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n\"Our training facilities,\" the guide announced with satisfaction.\nCombat training areas stretched far beyond what should have been possible.\nWeapons training halls echoed with the sounds of clashing steel and shouted instructions. Magic practice chambers contained residual energy from countless spells.\nAdvanced simulation rooms used illusion magic to create completely realistic combat scenarios against virtual opponents that responded with genuine intelligence and adaptation.\n\"Questions?\" our guide asked as we completed the tour.\nThe academy was even more impressive than the novel had suggested, and I was beginning to understand why it produced such exceptional graduates.\nNow came the real test.\n...\nOne of the nobles raised his hand, breaking the respectful silence that had followed our tour. \"Excuse me, sir. How are students placed into classes? Will we be grouped with others of similar... backgrounds?\"\nThe guide's expression remained neutral as he responded. \"All nobles and sponsored students will initially be placed in the top-tier classes based on your demonstrated potential and family standings. However, you will only remain there if you perform according to the minimum academic and combat standards. Failure to meet these requirements will result in immediate reassignment to lower-ranked classes.\"\nHis words carried an unmistakable warning. Noble blood might open doors, but it wouldn't keep them open without genuine merit.\n\"Classes are organized by demonstrated ability rather than social status,\" he continued. \"The academy recognizes talent regardless of its origin.\"\nI absorbed this information carefully, cross-referencing it with my knowledge from the novel. The class system was indeed merit-based, creating a competitive environment where even noble heirs could find themselves demoted if they became complacent.\nIn the original timeline, Kyle would rise immediately through the rankings. He never bothered hiding his strength or playing political games, his raw talent and determination would place him directly into the highest-ranked class within the first day of enrolment.\nThis year, there were two elite-level classes, and I hoped to be placed in the second one. Despite being an elite class with excellent resources and instruction, the second class rarely encountered the dangerous situations that seemed to follow Kyle wherever he went. The protagonist's presence had a way of attracting trouble that I wanted no part of.\nAlthough I hoped for that placement, I knew things rarely went according to plan in this world. Even if I ended up in Kyle's class, I had strategies for managing the situation. I would focus on building my strength quietly while cultivating relationships with the right people, those who could provide opportunities without drawing unwanted attention.\nWhile I wanted to maintain distance from the protagonist, that didn't mean I was willing to sacrifice my education for the sake of avoiding him. The difference in treatment and resources between elite classes and lower-tier ones was substantial. Elite classes received superior instruction, access to advanced training facilities, and opportunities that could determine my entire future.\nI wasn't about to waste those advantages just to hide from potential complications. I couldn't hide forever, I knew that.\n\"Here are your dormitory assignments,\" the guide announced, producing a stack of enchanted cards that began floating toward their intended recipients.\nMy card was elegant and practical, it would serve as both identification and room key. The dormitory number and basic access permissions were etched in flowing script that glowed softly when touched.\nThroughout the tour, I had felt Seraphina's eyes on me.\nHer gaze carried a mixture of curiosity and wariness, probably still processing my unexpected behaviour during our engagement dissolution. However, I paid her attention no heed, focusing instead on gathering information and preparing for whatever challenges lay ahead.",

      "content": "Chapter 29 - My Item\nWith the tour concluded, we were about to receive our first benefit as students of the Academy of Luminara.\nThe guide gestured for us to follow him toward a massive set of ornate doors. \"The Weapon Hall,\" he announced with the first hint of genuine enthusiasm I'd heard from him all day.\n\"The Weapon Hall represents one of the academy's greatest treasures,\" he explained as we approached the entrance. \"Every new student receives the opportunity to enter and claim a single weapon. This tradition has continued for over three centuries.\"\nThe doors themselves were works of art, crafted from enchanted metal. Despite it's ordinary looks, I knew it had hidden runes covering every surface,.\n\"Once you enter the treasury,\" the guide continued, his tone becoming more serious, \"you will find countless items scattered throughout. However, you may only claim one. Choose carefully, as this decision cannot be undone.\"\nHe paused, allowing the weight of his words to settle over our group. Several nobles shifted nervously, clearly feeling the pressure of making the right choice.\n\"The probability of discovering a Rare weapon is approximately once every few decades, the last one has occurred a year ago,\" he added. \"Ninety-nine point nine percent of students emerge with Enhanced-grade equipment. But remember, it is often said that the weapon chooses the wielder rather than the reverse. Trust your instincts.\"\nOne by one, the nobles and wealthy merchant children began entering the treasury. Each student disappeared through the glowing doorway for several minutes before emerging with their chosen weapon.\nThe first few students came out carrying Enhanced-grade swords, staffs, and defensive equipment. Their expressions showed a mixture of satisfaction and disappointment, pleased to have received quality weapons, but clearly hoping they might have been among the lucky few to discover something rarer.\n\"Enhanced blade, better than nothing, but I was hoping for more.\" one noble muttered to his companion.\n\"At least it's well-crafted, enhanced weapons from the academy's treasury are still superior to most equipment money can buy.\" his friend replied, examining his own newly acquired bow.\n\"My father always said that skills matters more than gear anyway,\" another student added.\nAs more students completed their selections, the familiar pattern emerged. Enhanced weapons dominated the results, just as the guide had predicted. Swords, axes, magical staves, protective shields, all of excellent quality, but nothing truly exceptional.\nThe waiting nobles began whispering among themselves about probability and luck, their initial excitement dampening as they realized how unlikely it was for any of them to find something special.\nSoon came Seraphina's turn.\nUnlike the other nobles who whispered that she would emerge with an Enhanced weapon just like everyone else, I knew that assessment was completely wrong. My knowledge of the original timeline told me exactly what would happen next.ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ\nSeraphina would discover a Rare weapon, specifically, a battle axe that complemented her Valkyrie bloodline perfectly. The weapon would recognize her legendary bloodline and bond with her immediately.\nShe stepped through the doorway with her confident stride, disappearing into the treasury's mysterious interior.\nMinutes passed. The waiting students grew restless, some checking timepieces and wondering if something had gone wrong. But I knew she was simply taking time to locate the specific weapon that was meant for her.\nWhen Seraphina finally emerged, she carried a magnificent double-bladed battle axe that gleamed with inner light. The weapon's design was both elegant and deadly.\nThe guide's cold, demeanour immediately changed, his eyes widened with genuine surprise and respect as he examined the weapon.\n\"Congratulations,\" he said warmly, his previous aloofness completely absent. \"A Rare weapon chooses its wielder perhaps once in a generation. This is truly exceptional.\"\nThe other students stared in amazement and obvious envy. Seraphina had accomplished what they'd all hoped for but knew was nearly impossible.\n\"You are clearly destined for greatness.\"\nSeraphina accepted the praise with gracious composure, though I caught a hint of satisfaction in her expression. She understood the significance of what had just occurred.\nSoon it was my turn.\nI stepped through the doorway and immediately understood why the guide had called this place a treasury. To say it was simply a weapon storage room would have been a massive understatement.\nI found myself standing in what could only be described as an ocean of weapons. Instead of water filling a vast pool, countless armaments floated and drifted in slow, hypnotic patterns. Swords, spears, bows, shields, staffs, and exotic weapons I couldn't even identify moved through the air like schools of metallic fish.\nI walked carefully through the floating arsenal, searching for the specific landmarks I remembered from the novel. The first sign would be a weapon displayed on a larger podium, elevated above the general collection. The second indicator would be pillars, specifically, I needed to locate one decorated with a shield, flail, and club.\nAfter several minutes of careful exploration, I spotted four distinct pillars rising from the weapon-sea. Each supported different arrangements of ceremonial equipment, but only one matched my target description.\n\"There it is.\" I muttered to myself. The pillar adorned with a shield, flail, and club, exactly as described in the original story.\nOn the pillar's apex, partially hidden beneath other items that had drifted against it over time, I found what I was looking for.\nThe item appeared completely unremarkable at first glance. It looked rusty and thoroughly ordinary, easily overlooked among the more visually impressive weapons surrounding it. But I knew it was anything but ordinary.\nThis was arguably one of the most powerful artifacts in the entire treasury.\nUnfortunately, my system couldn't provide information about items it hadn't given me directly through the daily reward. The floating interface remained stubbornly blank when I focused on the pendant.\nBut it didn't matter. I remembered it from the novel's detailed descriptions.\nThe item was called The Typhoon Pendant.\nIt was a Rare-grade artifact that contained immense wind elemental power. Once per day, it could release a concentrated hurricane force in a straight line, dealing devastating damage to anything in its path. Most importantly, its power scaled with the wielder's rank, charging from ambient mana to grow stronger over time.\nThis pendant would serve me well.\nI reached out and grasped the seemingly worthless trinket, feeling it warm to my touch as it recognized my claim.\nTime to see how the guide would react to my \"lucky\" discovery.",

      "content": "Chapter 30 - Typhoon Pendant\nI carefully extracted the pendant from its hiding place among the other artifacts, feeling its weight settle into my palm. The metal was warm to the touch, though it showed no outward signs of the incredible power contained within.\nMaking my way back through the floating weapon display, I emerged from the treasury with the unremarkable-looking pendant clutched in my hand.\nThe guide barely glanced at my selection before making his assessment. \"Enhanced grade,\" he said dismissively, his tone completely different from the warm congratulations he'd offered Seraphina. \"Low quality, but functional. It should serve you adequately during your studies. Although, I don't believe anyone would get a lower quality than yours.\"\nThe nobles around me wanted to snicker and laugh but they didn't dare to. I was the heir of the blackwood family after all. Their emotions were hidden well, and had I been a normal human, I would have probably failed to catch it, but I wasn't.\nThe guide's casual dismissal was exactly what I'd expected and hoped for. The pendant's true nature remained completely hidden, appearing as nothing more than a weathered piece of Enhanced-grade jewellery to anyone who examined it.\nBut I knew what they didn't.\nThis item was indeed currently operating at the level of the weakest Enhanced-grade equipment, but that weakness was actually part of an elaborate protective mechanism designed to conceal its true potential from unworthy users.\nTo unlock the Typhoon Pendant's real power, I would need to perform a specific activation ritual - dropping my blood onto its surface while channelling mana through the dormant enchantments.\nThe previous student who had claimed this pendant in the original timeline had also dismissed it as worthless trash, until a lucky accident during combat had revealed its devastating capabilities.\nThe pendant wasn't just any Rare-ranked item.\nIt was something far more valuable, a growth-type artifact that would become increasingly powerful as my own abilities developed, it had the potential to become a superior ranked item If I took care of it well and advanced it properly.\nBut the academy staff didn't need to know that, and I had no intention of enlightening them.\nAs I stepped aside to allow the next student their turn in the treasury, I noticed Seraphina's gaze had shifted away from me entirely. Where she had previously shown at least mild curiosity about my changed behaviour, now she seemed to have written me off completely.\nIt was as if this specific encounter had determined whether she wanted to give me any further attention, and apparently the answer was a definitive no. My selection of what appeared to be inferior equipment had clearly confirmed whatever low opinion she'd formed about my potential.\nI didn't care in the slightest. In fact, her disinterest was better for my long-term plans. The less attention I received from major characters, the lower my chances of getting dragged into dangerous plot developments.\nThere were plenty of fish in the sea, and I didn't need to dwell on Seraphina or worry about impressing anyone with flashy displays of power. My goals were survival and steady growth, not winning popularity contests or romantic attention from future heroines.\nThe pendant felt reassuring in my pocket as I watched the remaining students complete their weapon selections. Soon enough, I would activate its true capabilities and add another powerful tool to my growing arsenal.\nFor now, though, I was content to let everyone believe I'd made a poor choice. Underestimation was often the greatest advantage an intelligent person could possess.\nThe next phase of academy life was about to begin, and I intended to navigate it with all the cunning and preparation I could muster.\n...\nAfter the tour had ended, the guide informed us that the academy year would officially start tomorrow and we are free to do what we please.\nThen he simply left us standing there. The nobles looked around confused, clearly expecting more guidance or instruction about what to do next. Seraphina simply turned and walked away without a word, her new battle axe secured across her back.\nI didn't bother waiting around with the confused crowd either. I headed toward the dormitories in Section E, finally checking the room assignment on my access card.\nThe dormitory building was impressive even by academy standards. Each floor was dedicated to different year levels, with first-year Elite class students housed on the third floor. My room number indicated a corner unit, which typically meant more space and better amenities.\nI inserted my access card into the door's enchanted lock, watching as magical runes flared to life before the mechanism clicked open.\nThe room that greeted me was far more spacious and well-appointed than I'd expected. This wasn't just student housing, it was practically a luxury apartment designed for serious academic and combat training.\nThe main living area featured comfortable seating arranged around a magical fireplace that could be controlled with simple voice commands.\nThe kitchen was fully equipped with the items I would need for self-cooking except for the food.\nThe bedroom contained a large, comfortable bed with linens that adjusted temperature automatically based on the occupant's preferences. A spacious wardrobe provided ample storage for uniforms, casual clothing, and formal wear. A study desk was positioned near the window, complete with magical lighting that adapted to reading requirements.\nBut the most impressive feature was the dedicated training room.\nThe space was larger than some entire student apartments I'd seen elsewhere. Enchanted walls and flooring could absorb and dissipate magical energy safely, while protective barriers prevented damage to the rest of the room during intense practice sessions.\nA combat dummy occupied one corner, its construction clearly designed to withstand Elite-rank attacks without sustaining damage. The target's surface showed no signs of scratches or marks from previous occupants.\nWeight training equipment lined another wall, featuring dumbbells ranging from thirty kilograms up to one hundred kilograms. For most students, this would represent a comprehensive strength training setup capable of challenging them throughout their entire academy career.\nI decided to test the equipment immediately, curious about how my enhanced vampire physiology would compare to standard student expectations.\nStarting with the fifty-kilogram dumbbells, I found them too light. My enhanced strength made the weight feel almost negligible, like lifting empty containers rather than serious training equipment.\nMoving up to the seventy-kilogram weights produced similar results. I could curl them easily with one hand, feeling no resistance.\nEven the maximum one-hundred-kilogram dumbbells felt disappointingly light. I performed several sets of various exercises, but none provided the challenging resistance I needed for effective strength training.\nUnlike other students who relied on normal human physiology, my Supreme Vampire bloodline had improved my physical capabilities immensely. What represented serious training equipment for Elite-rank awakeners was essentially too light for my enhanced body.\nI would need to train in the training facilities in section G.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nFor now, though, the combat dummy would serve my needs better than the weight equipment. Testing my sword techniques and magical abilities against a target that could withstand Elite-rank punishment would provide good experience that would help me increase the level of my traits.",

      "content": "Chapter 31 - First Change\nHe should be starting his examination soon, I thought to myself, before leaving my dormitory and proceeding toward the area where the third batch examinations would be held.\nAs students of the academy, whether first years or upperclassmen, we had the privilege of observing new student examinations. This wasn't just entertainment, second year students needed to witness the tests and identify promising freshmen for their teams.\nThe academy's second and third years weren't focused on individual power but rather team coordination and synergy. The strongest teams that could complete the highest-ranked quests and missions received superior resources and opportunities. Success in the upper years was all about teamwork and the ability to create effective groups that competed against each other for prestige and rewards.\nSo second and third year students always attended examinations, scouting for hidden talent they could recruit for the following academic year. It was a crucial part of the academy's social and academic ecosystem.\nI made my way toward the examination grounds with my mind troubled by the possible events that could unfold. I knew for certain that I couldn't keep expecting the timeline to remain stable, and that things would inevitably start moving in directions I couldn't predict or control.\nBut I wanted to know exactly where and when things went off track, to prepare accordingly.\nThe examination area was a large outdoor arena adjacent to the main academy buildings. Tiered seating accommodated hundreds of spectators, while the central fighting space provided ample room for combat demonstrations.\nI found a seat in the spectator section and settled in to observe.\nThe current examination phase involved individual duels. Kyle had already completed the initial aptitude testing, where applicants needed to demonstrate at least Uncommon-rank bloodline capabilities to qualify for advancement. Based on what I could observe, he had passed that requirement with flying colours and now faced the combat evaluation portion.\nOf course, the fact that his bloodline was supreme-ranked remained hidden. The testing wasn't advanced enough to pinpoint how high the bloodline was. It was all based on what the person himself showed.\nAs for the combat evaluation portion, the format was straightforward, students would fight against an academy instructor to demonstrate their combat skills, tactical thinking, and potential for growth.\n\"Good. So far nothing has changed,\" I muttered under my breath, feeling a sense of relief.\nMy eyes scanned the waiting area until I located Kyle standing with his sister Emily, patiently awaiting his turn to be called. He appeared calm and focused, while Emily watched the ongoing duels with obvious fascination and nervous energy.\nSoon his name would be announced, and I knew exactly how this encounter was supposed to unfold.\nKyle would face Professor Sylvia Ashworth in combat, and he would perform exceptionally well despite being outmatched in terms of raw power and experience. Sylvia was one of the strongest instructors in the academy, coming from a distinguished noble family and possessing remarkable talent. At the young age of twenty, she had already reached Commander rank, breaking the previous record for youngest person to achieve that level.\nShe would recognize Kyle's extraordinary potential during their duel and recommend his immediate acceptance into the top-tier classes. More importantly, they would develop an excellent mentor-student relationship that would prove crucial to his development throughout the academy arc.\nProfessor Sylvia was described in the novel as breathtakingly beautiful, with flowing white hair and striking eyes that could captivate anyone who looked into them.\nAs Kyle's name was finally called out across the arena, I leaned forward in anticipation.\nBut my eyes widened in shock at what I saw.\nThe instructor stepping forward to conduct his examination was not Professor Sylvia Ashworth.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\n\"Wait,\" I muttered aloud unconsciously, the word escaping before I could stop myself.\nSeveral surrounding students turned to look at me in confusion, clearly wondering why I'd reacted so strongly to what appeared to be a routine examination procedure.\nBut this wasn't routine at all. This was a massive deviation from the established timeline.\nStanding in the arena was a completely different instructor - a middle-aged man with graying hair and stern features that I didn't recognize from the novel's character descriptions. He carried himself with obvious authority and competence, but he wasn't the person who was supposed to be here.\nProfessor Sylvia Ashworth was nowhere to be seen.\nThis change had enormous implications for Kyle's development and the entire academy arc. Sylvia wasn't just any instructor, she played a crucial role in the protagonist's growth, providing guidance and support that would prove essential during several major crisis events.\nWithout her influence and mentorship, Kyle's path through the academy could be completely different from what I remembered. The relationships he would form, the training he would receive, the allies he would gain, all of it could change based on this single substitution.\nMy mind raced as I tried to understand what could have caused this alteration. Had my actions somehow affected Professor Sylvia's schedule or availability? Was this a temporary change, or had something more significant occurred to remove her from her teaching duties entirely?\nKyle stepped into the arena, apparently unaware that anything was amiss. He began his pre-combat preparations, stretching and warming up while the instructor explained the duel parameters.\nI watched with growing anxiety as one of the most important scenes in the early academy timeline began to unfold in completely unexpected ways.",

      "content": "Chapter 32: Fire Wings, Victor.\nI stood there feeling a mix of emotions swirling through my chest.\nThe scene before me represented a cascade of changes that I hadn’t anticipated. Was what I felt fear of the unknown? Or was it perhaps relief that Adrian’s fate had most certainly changed.\nTo say that I didn’t feel anxious would be a complete lie.\nKyle stepped into the arena, and his instructor was somebody I didn’t recognize from the novel at all. That wasn’t a good sign by any measure.\nAn unknown instructor meant unknown results. Unknown ambitions, and relationships that could form.\nThe consequences of this small scene could ripple through the entire academy storyline.\nI took a deep breath, shaking my head in frustration.\nWhat was wrong with me?\nWhy was I always fearing the unknown like it was my greatest enemy? It was something I’d only developed after arriving in this world and learning about its predetermined plot. Back on Earth, I’d never been this paralyzed by uncertainty.\nI’d always lived with the unknown in my previous life. I’d built a happy and sustainable existence despite not knowing what each day would bring. I’d achieved my dream job through persistence and adaptability. I’d had countless relationships, even if none worked out in the end, and I’d never let fear of uncertain outcomes prevent me from trying.\nYet here I was, worried every time something deviated from a story I’d read.\nAs I watched Kyle prepare for his fight, while the unfamiliar instructor explained the duel parameters, something moved inside me.\nFor the first time since arriving in this world, I felt the need to embrace the unknown rather than resist it.\nIt had been foolish of me to believe that I could steer the plot exactly the way I wanted\nNo matter how small my changes had seemed, they were still changes, and they were compounding in ways I couldn’t predict or control. The butterfly effect was real, and I’d been the butterfly.\nFrom this moment on, I knew things would be fundamentally different from the novel I remembered.\nAnd maybe that wasn’t entirely a bad thing.\nI took another deep breath, feeling some of the tension leave my shoulders as I made a conscious decision.\n\"Bring it on,\" I whispered to myself.\nIt was completely out of character for me, yes. The cautious person I’d become since transmigrating would never have embraced uncertainty so willingly. But I really needed someone to push me forward, even if that someone was myself.\nI’d spent so much time trying to avoid changing the story that I’d forgotten something crucial: I was already part of the story now. My very existence here meant the narrative was different from what I’d read.\nInstead of fighting that reality, perhaps it was time to work with it.\nKyle began his combat stance as the unknown instructor drew his weapon.\nWhatever happened in this duel, whatever relationships formed or failed to form, whatever opportunities arose or disappeared, I would adapt and overcome.\nI’d done it before in my previous life. I could do it again in this one.\nThe unknown was no longer my enemy. It was simply the next Chapter.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n...\nThe fight began, and Kyle immediately proved why he was considered the dark horse of this examination cycle. His Supreme Phoenix bloodline was absolutely no joke.\nI watched in a mixture of awe and envy as he activated what I knew was his third-order trait. Small, brilliant fire wings materialized on his back, their flames dancing with an ethereal beauty that made the entire arena seem dimmer by comparison.\nEveryone around me gasped audibly as they witnessed Kyle rise slightly off the ground, his feet hovering just above the arena surface.\n\"H-He can fly at Elite rank! Only Royal-rank awakeners are supposed to be capable of flight!\" one of the newer students exclaimed, his voice cracking with disbelief.\nA second-year student sitting nearby shook his head, though his expression was equally amazed. \"This must be a second-order skill. This is absolutely insane considering he’s just a freshman applicant. But look carefully, he isn’t truly flying. He’s levitating slightly above the surface, using the wings for enhanced mobility rather than sustained aerial combat. Still, the speed boost is immense.\"\nThe older student was partially right about its function. It didn’t just grant him increased agility, but regeneration and certain control over fire.\nMy eyes followe Kyle as he darted across the arena with supernatural agility, his fire wings providing both lift and propulsion that allowed him to change direction instantly and move in ways that no freshman could.\nThe unknown instructor was clearly impressed by Kyle’s mobility, but he was able to keep up with it.\nKyle’s sword work was impressive too, but what really stood out was how seamlessly he integrated his levitation advantages with his ground-based combat techniques. He would hover just out of reach of the instructor’s attacks, then dive down with devastating overhead strikes before launching himself skyward again.\nThird-order trait,\nI thought inwardly, feeling that familiar pang of envy.\nAt Elite rank, no less.\nMy own Blood Control was second-order, which was already extraordinary for anyone, no matter the rank. But Kyle’s third-order flight ability was really too much.\nThe instructor, despite being caught off-guard by Kyle’s unexpected capabilities, began adapting his strategy. He started using ranged attacks and area-of-effect techniques to limit Kyle’s mobility options, forcing the young phoenix blood bearer to engage more directly.\nBut Kyle rose to the challenge, demonstrating the intelligence and adaptability that made him such a formidable protagonist. His fire wings began producing controlled bursts of flame that he used both defensively and offensively, creating barriers of heat while simultaneously launching projectile attacks.\nThe crowd was completely captivated. This wasn’t just a normal examination anymore - it was a genuine display of a once in a life time talent that would be talked about for decades to come.\n...\nAfer multiple bouts, the instructor finally stopped the fight and marked Kyle as passed.\nEmily jumped in joy before rushing into the arena and giving her brother a congratulatory hug. Kyle smiled warmly at his sister, clearly pleased that she’d witnessed his successful passing.\nBut the instructor, who should have walked away by now to prepare for the next applicant, remained standing there.\nA frown appeared on my face as I watched him approach the siblings with a broad smile plastered across his face. He looked genuinely happy for them, which struck me as unusual for some reason.\nI sat there watching as they spoke for nearly two minutes. This wasn’t normal protocol at all. Even Professor Sylvia, who had been Kyle’s biggest supporter in the original timeline, had only spoken with him briefly during his examination.\nTheir meaningful conversations had taken place later, inside the academy proper.\nThis extended interaction felt wrong somehow.\nI felt a bad premonition rising in my chest.\nI turned toward the first student on my right. From his uniform, I could tell he was a second year, which meant he would have knowledge about the academy’s faculty.\n\"Hey, do you know who that instructor is?\" I asked, keeping my tone casual despite my growing concern.\nThe student immediately stiffened when he noticed who was speaking to him. I could feel his anxiety at being addressed by the son of a duke, his posture becoming more formal as he struggled to respond appropriately.\n\"I... do,\" he stammered. \"The instructor’s name is Victor Castellane. His title is ’The Wiseman.’ He was traditionally a second-year teacher, although I heard rumors that he changed assignments this year and is now teaching first years.\"\n\"I see. Thank you,\" I replied politely, not wanting to make the nervous student any more uncomfortable.\nI glanced back toward the arena to find the trio finally separating. Victor Castellane gave Kyle and Emily one final nod before they left the examination area, while he waited for his next applicant.\nBut something about that entire interaction had set off alarm bells in my mind.\nVictor Castellane. The Wiseman. A second-year instructor who had specifically requested reassignment to work with first years this particular academic cycle.\nI had never heard of the man in the original novel. Which prompted the feeling of needing to find out more about this man and why he’d shown such immediate interest in Kyle.\nWhatever was happening, it represented another significant deviation from the original timeline.\nThe unknown was proving more challenging than I’d anticipated.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "content": "Chapter 33: Pushing Myself\nBefore leaving the arena, I looked back at the older students as they flocked to Kyle’s position like vultures fighting over fresh carrion. Second and third years were already positioning themselves to make recruitment offers, recognizing the incredible potential they’d just witnessed.\nThen I turned and made my way out of the examination grounds.\nHeading toward the main gate, my thoughts focused on my next plans. With this new change in the timeline, I had to improvise rather than rely on predetermined knowledge.\nWhile reaching Elite rank this early would place me among the top students, that wasn’t enough anymore. Just like Kyle had the ability to reach Royal rank within two years in the original story, there was nothing stopping me from achieving the same progression myself.\nI made my way toward the forest beyond the academy grounds. The reason for my confidence wasn’t baseless optimism. I had something with me that could help me survive even Transcendent-rank threats if necessary.\nGlancing down at the Crimson Moon Pendant hanging around my neck, now filled with precious Transcendent-rank blood that I’d carefully stored within its matrix.\nWhen I’d been hunting with my father and he’d encountered that unexpected Transcendent beast, I hadn’t wasted the opportunity. While he’d been focused on harvesting the creature’s valuable hide and core, I had discreetly collected every drop of blood I could manage.\nMy father had been somewhat confused about my interest in the beast’s blood, but I’d made a plausible excuse about wanting to conduct some experimental research on high-rank biological materials. The academy encouraged such scholarly pursuits, so he’d accepted my explanation without pressing for details.\nAfter extraction, I was able to extract around ten litres of blood, with some being stored inside the pendant and others in vials inside my storage ring.\nI couldn’t exactly tell him I was a vampire who needed blood to maintain my rationality, after all.\nThe Transcendent blood would serve multiple purposes. Not only could I convert it into raw life force enhancement through my pendant’s abilities, but the sheer quality of the blood would provide exponentially more power than the Elite-rank beast blood I’d been subsisting on.\nMore importantly, if I encountered any genuine threats during my training expedition, I could use the blood to temporarily boost my capabilities far beyond my current Elite rank limitations and escape.\nThe forest ahead represented both opportunity and danger, but with my current resources and abilities, I felt confident about pushing my boundaries further than ever before.\n...\nArriving in the forest, I was spotted by a few hunters who looked at me as if I had a death wish.\n\"What is a young man like him doing in these woods? He’s trying to get himself killed,\" one of them muttered to his companions, shaking his head in obvious concern.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the\nClearly they had no clue about my identity. I wasn’t wearing my academy uniform or any identifying markers that would reveal my noble status.\nI proceeded without paying them any attention. These small adventurer teams were bound to be nothing but cannon fodder when the real crises appeared in the coming months. I quickly assessed their capabilities through my enhanced senses. They were mostly Common-rank bloodline awakeners, with their leader possessing what felt like an average Uncommon-rank ability.\nThey were all at the elite-rank which was by no means impressive considering their age.\nTheir equipment was standard adventurer stock, and their experience was probably the only thing that had kept them alive this long in dangerous territory.\nA few minutes deeper into the woods, I heard the pained wailing of a wolf echoing through the trees. Unlike when I’d first entered this world and would have found a different route to avoid potential trouble, this time I headed directly toward the sound.\nBased on the tone and proximity, it was probably a Noble-rank wolf in distress. The wailing was unusual though, not the typical hunting call or territorial display I’d expect. Something interesting must have happened.\nI retrieved the Two Faces mask from my storage ring and put it on, activating the alternate appearance I’d stored within it. The face that materialized was actually my own from my previous world.\nAverage brown eyes and black hair with a decently slim facial structure. I was by no means magazine-cover handsome, but I’d been somewhat above average in my original life.\nThis disguise would allow me to act without worrying about my actions being traced back to Adrian Blackwood.\nI arrived at the source of the disturbance and found a large bear, clearly Elite-rank based on its size and the energy radiating from its form. The creature was in the process of ripping apart a wolf that had probably been the source of the earlier wailing.\nNext to the first wolf’s mangled corpse lay two more wolves, both Noble-rank based on their size and the residual mana signatures. It seemed like the bear had massacred an entire small pack.\nThe bear’s head turned as it sensed my approach, and our eyes met across the blood-soaked clearing.\nIts gaze was intelligent and calculating, not the mindless aggression I might have expected from a beast in feeding frenzy. This creature was assessing me as a potential threat, trying to determine whether I was prey, predator, or something to be ignored.\nI drew my Razor Edge Sword slowly, analysing the situation more carefully. The bear was definitely Elite-rank, but it showed signs of recent light injury, possibly from its fight with the wolf pack. Dark blood matted its fur in several places, and its breathing was slightly laboured.\nAfter assessing the threats Infront of me, my eyes traced the entire area around me. I was searching for any hidden threat, just in case the bear wasn’t alone or the wolves had backup.\nAfter making sure that there was no threats left unidentified I walked into the clearing with my sword unsheated.\nSensing my approach, the bear locked eyes with me almost immediately, stopping its rampage on the poor, dead corpse of the wolf.\nThud!\nThe corpse dropped from its mouth and onto the forest floor.\nI could feel its death intent locking onto me, and I smiled.\n\"Bring it on, big guy.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 34: Level 3 Trait.\nThe bear roared with fury before charging directly at me.\nI could feel its anger and wrath radiating from its massive form. My provocative words had clearly hurt its pride, even if it couldn’t understand the human tongue, it had definitely felt the challenge in my tone.\nThere was absolutely no need to use Transcendent blood to deal with this small fry.\nI immediately activated my Blood Control trait, focusing on the bear’s circulatory system. The creature’s charge faltered slightly as I seized control of its blood flow, preventing circulation to its heart and other vital organs.\nThe effect of my trait was instantaneous. The bear’s powerful muscles began to weaken as oxygen failed to reach them, its stability deteriorating rapidly as its brain was starved of blood.\nI stepped into close range while the creature struggled against my blood manipulation, raising my Razor Edge Sword for a finishing strike.\nWhoosh!\nThe only sound I heard was my blade cutting cleanly through the air, followed by the wet impact of steel meeting flesh and bone.\nThud.\nThe bear collapsed to the forest floor, its massive body hitting the ground with enough force to shake nearby trees. Blood pooled beneath its still body as life left its eyes.\nThe bear was dead. It couldn’t be more dead than that.\nI stood over the creature’s corpse, breathing calmly as I assessed the brief combat. The entire encounter had lasted less than ten seconds from start to finish. My Blood Control trait had once again proven it was devastatingly effective against Elite-rank opponents.\nThe combination of my vampire abilities and enhanced equipment was making me far more dangerous than my official rank suggested. An Elite-rank awakener with second-order traits could easily overwhelm opponents who relied purely on physical strength and basic magical abilities.\nI wiped my blade clean on the bear’s fur before sheathing it, then began the process of collecting blood samples from both the bear and the wolf corpses. Elite-rank blood ha become my daily meal in the past week, and the bear’s blood would replenish my reserves nicely, and the variety would give me options for different enhancement combinations.\nAs I worked, I reflected on how much my confidence had grown since arriving in this world.\nGlancing behind my back, I could sense some movement in the distance. Probably the adventurer team I’d encountered earlier, drawn by the sounds of combat. They would arrive to find nothing but beast corpses and bloodstains, with no sign of whoever had been responsible for the carnage.\n...\nI continued ahead, walking and killing any beast that I came across without discrimination.\nIt had been about an hour since my encounter with the bear, and I’d killed approximately ten Elite-rank creatures along with plenty of Noble-rank beasts. I’d absorbed all of their soul power and felt my strength rising slowly but steadily.\nOf course, I stored the elite beasts blood, this came without question.\nMy vials were all maxed out.\nI had nearly thirty litres of blood with me.\nThe more beasts one killed, the more soul power they absorbed. Soul power was the fundamental force used to enhance every aspect of one’s physical and magical capabilities. Whether it was mana capacity, raw strength, agility, or vitality - everything increased through the accumulation of defeated enemies’ essence.\nI remembered the author explaining this system in detail during one of the novel’s exposition sections. The soul power that came from defeated enemies was only a small portion of the defeated creature’s total soul power reserves. When a being was killed, it became a source of evolutionary energy for the victor, transferring a fragment of its accumulated power to strengthen the winner.\nThe amount of soul power gained depended heavily on the rank difference and bloodline quality of the defeated enemy. Higher-rank opponents or creatures with superior bloodlines provided more soul power than weaker ones. This was why challenging stronger enemies was always more rewarding than grinding against inferior opponents.\nHowever, there was an important limitation to this system that prevented endless farming of weak creatures.\nOnce too much soul power of the same type and rank had been absorbed, one’s spiritual core began developing immunity to that specific power source. After reaching a certain threshold, it became impossible to acquire additional benefits from similar enemies, forcing living beings to constantly seek out stronger and more diverse opponents to continue their growth.\nThis meant I couldn’t just farm Elite-rank forest beasts forever. Eventually, my soul would stop accepting their power entirely, and I’d need to challenge Transcendent-rank creatures or find completely different types of enemies to maintain my progression.\nI was already beginning to feel the diminishing returns from the recent kills. The first few Elite-rank bears and wolves had provided substantial power increases, but the most recent creatures had offered noticeably less benefit. My physiology was adapting to their soul signatures, building resistance that would soon make hunting them pointless in regards to soul power, although the opportunity to gain echoes or aspects was still valid.\nThe world system was designed to encourage risk-taking and constant advancement. Safety meant stagnation, while danger meant growth.\nI paused in a small clearing, assessing my current condition. My mana reserves felt fuller than before, my physical strength had increased, and my reflexes seemed sharper. The accumulated soul power was definitely making a difference in my overall capabilities.\nSomething flashed across my retina making me smile brighter.\nMy blood control trait has levelled up. Finally.\n[Host: Adrian Blackwood]\n[Bloodline: Supreme Vampire - 15%]\n[Rank: Elite]\nGooglᴇ search No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n[Traits: Blood Control (2nd Order, Lvl.3), Supernatural Physique (1st Order, Lvl.3), Blood Enhancement(1st Order, Lvl.1)]\n[Aspect: Serpent Scales(Elite)]\n[Memory: None]\nThe new blood control trait increased my range.\n[Blood Control] [Order: 2] [Level: 3]\n[Details: Grants the ability to manipulate blood both within your body and external sources.

Effectiveness scales with the user’s rank and the target’s resistance. Current range: 10 meters.]\nThe range had increased from the previous 5 meters to 10 meters. I could also feel my blood attacks were much more powerful and they formed faster, the level up had increased my strength. However, I didn’t get too excited. This wasn’t the harvest of this one training session, it was the accumulation of my countless fights for the past weeks.\nI needed to find stronger prey soon.\nPerhaps it was time to venture deeper into the forest, With my current power and accumulated blood reserves, I felt confident about taking calculated risks against more dangerous opponents in the elite rank.\nThe unknown timeline meant I needed every advantage I could gain, and that meant pushing beyond my comfort zone into threatening territory.",

      "content": "Chapter 35: A Worthy Opponent [1]\nI kept pushing deeper into the forest. The Elite-rank beasts I’d fought so far were only in their initial stages, nowhere near the more powerful Elite-rankers that dwelled in the forest’s depths. They possessed only Common-rank bloodlines and presented no real challenge.\nI dove deeper into the wilderness, seeking worthier opponents.\nA few minutes later, I encountered a stronger adversary. While it was still technically Elite rank, this creature possessed an Uncommon bloodline, and its aura indicated it was significantly more formidable than my previous opponents.\nThe beast was a massive wolf, larger than any I’d seen before, with menacing dark fur and eyes that glowed with intelligent malice. Its bloodline grade was apparent to me, it was easy to tell by looking at those sharper claws that gleamed like metal, and aura that marked it as a true apex predator rather than common forest wildlife.\nIt circled me warily, recognizing that I wasn’t ordinary prey. This creature had survived long enough to reach this strength by being cautious and calculating rather than rushing blindly into combat.\nStill, I was too strong for it.\nThe moment it lunged forward with supernatural speed, I activated my Blood Control trait. The wolf’s enhanced agility meant nothing when its own circulatory system became my weapon.\nI didn’t just disrupt its blood flow this time, I weaponized it. The creature’s blood clotted within its veins. Its impressive speed faltered as its internal system became a mess, my control wreaked havoc inside its body.\nThe wolf’s eyes widened in confusion and pain as it realized something was fundamentally wrong. It tried to retreat, but I pressed my advantage. I didn’t need to use my blood enhancement trait to strengthen my sword.\nMy sword made its way and in no time, the strike landed, ending the wolf’s suffering quickly and silently.\nAnother Elite-rank creature defeated, this one providing slightly more soul power due to its superior bloodline. But even this stronger opponent had fallen within moments of engaging me.\nI was beginning to understand just how much my combination of traits, equipment and recent training outclassed conventional Elite-rank fighters. My second-order Blood Control trait, enhanced physique, and all other factors created a synergy that made me far more dangerous than my official rank suggested.\nTo say that I didn’t feel a tinge of arrogance appearing in my heart would be a lie. With my current strength, I believed that I could fight Kyle Morrison on equal grounds.\nI no longer felt fear just by thinking about his name and powers.\nAs I delved deeper into the forest, I wondered what it would take to find a truly challenging opponent at my current level without overburdening myself.\n.....\nMy answer came a few minutes later. I was about two miles away from the city now, starting to truly wander into dangerous territories. Only about a mile away from the place where my father and I had encountered that Transcendent-rank beast.\nBut it didn’t matter, this would be my last fight of the day. The beast before me possessed a Rare bloodline!\nA Rare bloodline, and it was certainly no weakling within the Elite rank. In fact, it was very robust in its current tier. If given a year or so, it would certainly reach Transcendent rank. A smile erupted across my face as I felt the huge rewards already coming my way.\nThe soul power and blood that I would collect from this creature was making me salivate with anticipation.\nI wanted to drink its blood, not just store it in a vial. I wanted to taste the blood of a beast with a Rare bloodline for the first time. I’d never experienced anything of that quality before.\nThis time I didn’t wait for the beast to attack first.\nThe creature before me was a panther, sleek and deadly, with matte-black fur that seemed to repel light. Two black jewels served as eyes that stared deep into my soul.\nThe panther did not back down from my aggressive approach. Instead, it met my charge head-on without fear.\nConfidence radiated from its body like heat.\nWe clashed in the middle of the forest clearing. My sword met its razor-sharp claws in a shower of sparks, and I clearly outperformed it in the initial exchange.\nThe impact sent the panther sliding backward ten full steps while I remained firmly planted in our clash position, barely moved by the collision.\nThe panther’s jewelled eyes widened in shock before anger erupted in its heart. Throughout its entire existence within the Elite rank, it had never been pushed back in direct combat. It had always prevailed against other Elite-rank opponents, yet somehow the human before it had accomplished what no other creature in this forest could manage.\nIts pride, honed through killing hundreds of beasts throughout its violent life, was cracked. The panther desperately wanted to regain confidence in its abilities and prove its superiority.\nI had no intention of fulfilling its desire to restore that confidence.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nI activated my Blood Enhancement trait, channelling crimson energy into both my blade and my Swift Step Boots. The familiar warmth of enhanced blood flowed through my equipment, dramatically increasing both of their affects.\nThe increase in my speed and attacking power was immediately noticeable to me.\nI deliberately chose not to use my Blood Control ability this time. I wanted to test my pure offensive capabilities without relying on the second-order skill that had made my previous fights so one-sided\nAnother reason was because I wanted to keep my blood control trait a hidden card in the academy. So, I wanted to understand where I currently stood in the academy hierarchy without my blood control trait.\nThe beast before me would serve as an excellent testing subject. It had a rare bloodline and it was on the higher scale in the elite rank.\nMy blood-enhanced blade clashed directly with the panther’s claws once again.",

      "content": "Chapter 36: A Worthy Opponent [2]\nThe results were of our clash was extremely satisfying to me.\nThe sword cut through its natural weapons with some resistance, but it still managed to penetrate the creature’s defenses.\nCrack!\nI could hear its steel-like claws fracture under my enhanced attack, in my peripheral vision dark fragments splintered onto the forest floor. The panther’s most formidable natural weapons had been damaged in a single exchange.\nI didn’t pause to admire the damage I had done.\nContinuing my aggressive assault, I pressed forward with a series of rapid strikes designed to overwhelm the creature’s defences.\nThe panther attempted to retreat and reassess its dire situation, but my speed made disengagement impossible. My blood-boosted boots increased my agility by nearly 8%, allowing me to match its high speed step for step, keeping it trapped within striking range.\nEach clash of weapon against claw resulted in further damage to the beast’s primary weapons. Its Rare bloodline provided exceptional durability and regenerative capabilities, but the rate of damage was exceeding its ability to heal.\nThe panther’s fighting style began changing from aggressive offense to desperate defence as it realized the severity of its situation. It started using hit-and-run tactics, attempting to strike from unexpected angles before retreating to safer distances. But my reflexes and combat experience made these tactics ineffective.\nI could predict its movements and counter-attack before it could escape, forcing it into longer engagements that favoured me.\nThe creature’s breathing became laboured as the extended combat took its toll. Small injuries slowly accumulated across its body, each wound representing a successful penetration of its natural defences.\nDesperation began creeping into the panther’s jewelled eyes as it realized that its usual dominance over Elite-rank opponents meant nothing against me. For the first time in its lifetime, it was experiencing what it felt like to be outmatched.\nNot by rank, not by age but by skill and potential.\nI could sense its growing panic as it attempted increasingly desperate manoeuvres. Wild swipes with damaged claws, reckless leaps that left it vulnerable to counter-attacks, and frantic attempts to flee the engagement entirely.\nNone of these tactics succeeded against my assault. My blood-enhanced equipment provided the edge I needed to dismantle its defences while my vampire body kept me fresh and focused throughout the prolonged combat.\nThe panther’s Rare bloodline was impressive, but it wasn’t enough to overcome my versatile arsenal of traits. I hadn’t even used my most powerful trait, yet it was already on the edge of death.\nAs I prepared for what would likely be the finishing sequence of attacks, I felt satisfied with my current power. Fighting without my Blood Control trait had forced me to rely on my skill and physical power.\nWhether it was timing, positioning, striking, I had to focus on all aspects that I had been training since I arrived in this world.\nTraining under my duke father was the correct move.\nI thought to myself, a smile appearing on my face. Whilst it was certainly not easy, it had truly helped out a ton.\nI no longer heavily relied on my second order skill to fight, like I had previously done during my first fight against that elite-ranked serpent.\nThe panther backed against a large tree, its escape routes finally exhausted. Its jewelled eyes still held defiance, but I could see the resignation beginning to set in.\nTime to end this and claim my prize.\nWith no place left for it to escape to, the panther had no choice but to sacrifice its second claw to stop my attack that was approaching it rapidly.\nI read its intention and changed the direction of my sword at the last second. It was a technique that had taken considerable time to learn from my father.\nThe technique allowed me to change the direction of my strike at the last moment, whilst maintaining momentum.\nMy father called it the \"phantom strike.\"\nWHOOSH!\nIts claws met empty air while my sword met its heart.\nThe panther’s eyes glistened as life slowly left its body. The intelligence that had burned so fiercely in those dark orbs gradually faded, replaced by the vacant stare of death.\nI retracted my sword from its body and watched as the powerful creature breathed its last.\nThe feeling of the soul power assimilating with my body was euphoric, I felt my strength increase once again.\nA glowing orange orb materialized above the panther’s corpse.\nThe orange colour indicated an Elite-rank drop, either an aspect or an echo. Either would be useful for my development.\nThe orb marked my second aspect, with the serpent scales being the first one.\nI wonder if it’s a passive skill or an active one.\nI thought to myself as I approached the orb and grasped it.\nThe feeling of warm energy flowed into my body as the system processed the reward.\n[Aspect: Silent Predator]\n[Rank: Elite]\n[Type: Active]\n[Details: Grants the ability to camouflage with the surroundings for one minute. Your presence becomes nearly non-existent. Your breath, scent, and visibility are all reduced to imperceptible levels for nearby enemies. Attacking or being attacked during activation cancels the aspect. Duration: 60 seconds.]\nMy eyes lit up with excitement as I read the aspect’s description. This was an incredible acquisition, exactly the kind of stealth ability that would serve me well in the dangerous times ahead.\nThe ability to become nearly invisible for a full minute was invaluable for someone trying to survive in a world full of plot-driven chaos.\nCombined with my existing abilities, this aspect would make me significantly more versatile in combat situations.\nI could already think of the various ways I could use the new aspect.\nThe timing couldn’t have been better. With the academy timeline already deviating from what I expected, having additional options for staying alive and avoiding unwanted attention would prove crucial.\nI felt the aspect integrate with my spiritual core, adding its power to my growing arsenal of abilities.\nWalking towards the panther and I thrust my fangs on its neck. I no longer felt revulsion at the action that had once seemed disgusting. I was starting to accept my nature - I was no longer human.\nI was a vampire.\nGulp!\n\"Ahh,\" I couldn’t help but let out a soft moan as the blood tasted far better than I had imagined.\nThe blood was on an entirely different tier from what I was accustomed to, and it felt amazing. It was like a starved person finally receiving food and drink after days of deprivation.\nWhen I regained control over my body, I realized that I had drained the panther completely dry of its blood.\nThe rich, intoxicating taste had overwhelmed my self-control entirely.\nI discarded one of the blood vials I’d been carrying and stored whatever remained from the panther, which was only about half a vial’s worth.\nI sighed in regret. I could have saved some of that precious Rare bloodline blood for later consumption instead of losing myself to the feeding frenzy. But the blood I had just consumed made the loss feel entirely worth it.\nAs I prepared to head back to the academy, I suddenly felt a terrible premonition wash over me.\n\"SHIT!\" I cursed out loud as my instincts proved devastatingly correct.\nImmediately without any hesitation, I used the transcendent blood stored in my Crimson Moon pendant for defence. The life force wrapped around my body like a mother embracing its child.\nMy action proved decisive as I was suddenly attacked by something I hadn’t sensed approaching until the last second.\nDespite pouring my power into defence, my body flew through the air like a broken kite, slamming into the nearby trees with bone-jarring force.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ\nBOOM!",

The monstrosity measured two meters in height, its exoskeleton gleaming with an unnatural metallic shine.\nAt such a size, it was absolutely disgusting to look at. Its eyes reflected my image in thousands of tiny fragments, while its antennae twitched.\nI struggled to my feet, my eyes locked on the nightmare insect before me.\nAnts were incredibly powerful creatures.\nTheir only weakness in my previous world had been their diminutive size. But pound for pound, ants ranked easily within the top five strongest creatures on Earth. They could lift objects many times their own body weight and possessed incredible durability.\nFurthermore, ants were remarkably intelligent and possessed sophisticated communication abilities. The thought of encountering an entire ant colony filled with Transcendent-rank beasts like this one made me shiver with dread.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nJust where had this monster come from?\nMy body’s regeneration was already working to repair the damage from that devastating initial attack. I slowly backed away while reaching into my storage ring to retrieve a mortal-grade healing potion.\nThe ant seemed genuinely surprised that I had survived its assault. Its eyes tracked my movements with, clearly reassessing the threat I represented.\nI had only survived because I’d desperately channelled massive amounts of mana at the moment of impact, including converting some of the precious Transcendent-rank blood stored in my Crimson Moon Pendant into emergency life force enhancement.\nThat desperate gambit had saved my life, but it had also depleted a significant portion of my most valuable resources. I couldn’t afford many more exchanges like that one.\nThe healing potion would help with the immediate damage, but facing a Transcendent-rank opponent with my current Elite-rank abilities was essentially suicide without some kind of miracle or escape plan.\nI needed to think fast before this intelligent predator decided to finish what it had started.\nMy left hand moved slowly toward the Guardian’s Last Stand activation crystal, knowing it might be one of the few options I had to survive this encounter.\n[Guardian’s Last Stand]\n[Grade: Rare]\n[Details: Creates an impenetrable barrier that blocks all attacks from Transcendent-rank beings or below for exactly 10 seconds. Once activated, the shield cannot be dismissed early and will automatically disappear after the time limit. Single use only.]\nThe ant’s antennae continued twitching as it analysed my movements, clearly preparing for its next attack.\nWith the sword in my right hand, I immediately activated my skills. I needed to escape, and I needed to be fast!\nMy boots gained blood enhancement, increasing their agility boost effect. I also accelerated my blood flow, which increased my overall power respectively.\nI would’ve loved to fight this ant, but I knew it was far too powerful for the current me. I wasn’t even well-grounded in the Elite rank yet, and this ant didn’t seem like a weakling among Transcendent-rank creatures.\nI had one singular thought: escape.\nBurning through the Transcendent blood in my pendant, my capabilities increased exponentially once again, though still not to the point where I could face the ant in direct combat.\nWithout hesitation, I used my Blood Control skill and attempted to slow down the movement of blood inside the ant before taking off at maximum speed.\nThe skill consumed a considerable amount of mana from my reserves, but it helped create the delay I desperately needed.\nAs I launched myself forward, I activated my newly acquired aspect, Silent Predator. I needed to escape, and this stealth ability would hopefully help me lose my pursuer.\nSQUEAK!\nIn mere seconds, I had covered more than one hundred meters from my earlier position. I ran in different directions, zigzagging to avoid being an easy target for any attacks.\nTwo hundred meters away, I glanced back to find the ant only ten meters away from my current position. Despite my attempt at slowing at down, It had caught up with ease.\nI cursed inwardly. Those antennae were able to locate me despite my stealth! I had been matched against a creature that made my new aspect almost completely useless!\nWithin the next second, I felt the ant’s attack approaching me once again with the same devastating force as before. Without hesitation, I activated Guardian’s Last Stand and stopped running.\nSince it had no intention of letting me escape, I was going to deal as much damage as I could during the ten seconds I would be invulnerable.\nThe massive ant’s strike landed against my shimmering barrier and was completely repelled. The creature’s eyes widened in what might have been surprise as its devastating attack accomplished absolutely nothing.\nThe golden barrier surrounding me pulsed with energy, completely negating the Transcendent-rank force that should have pulverized my body.\nI had ten seconds of absolute protection. Time to make them count.\nI immediately began channelling blood enhancement into my sword while simultaneously converting more Transcendent blood from my pendant. If I was going to damage this monster, I needed every possible advantage working in my favour.\nThe ant backed away slightly, its antennae twitching rapidly as it tried to understand what was happening. Its eyes was analysing this unexpected development with a strange glint.\nWith less than ten seconds remaining, I launched myself forward with impressive speed, my blood-empowered blade aimed at what I hoped were vulnerable joints in its armor.\nTime to see if ten seconds could change everything.",

      "content": "Chapter 38: First Life or Death Fight [2]\nAppearing directly before the ant, I swung my sword with all the power I could muster while simultaneously attempting to stun it using my Blood Control trait.\nThe stun was executed perfectly, causing the creature’s massive body to freeze momentarily. I found the small window of opportunity I desperately needed, my Razor Edge sword met head-on with one of its leg joints, the weakest point I could find in its armour.\nCrack!\nThe sound of fracturing rang out like music to my ears. Dark fluid leaked from the damaged joint as the ant’s left foreleg buckled slightly under its own weight.\nBefore I could land my second attack, the ant recovered from the stun and immediately retaliated with a sweeping strike from its undamaged limbs.\nOne of its legs was now heavily damaged, compromising its mobility and balance. Without fearing for my life thanks to the protective barrier, I pressed my advantage. I had seven seconds of invulnerability remaining.\nThis time I went straight for its head, aiming to disable its sensory capabilities or strike a vital area.\nI attempted to stun it once again using my Blood Control, but the intelligent creature seemed to anticipate my strategy. Somehow it was able to counter my blood manipulation, either through superior willpower or some defensive ability I hadn’t encountered before.\nNot discouraged by my failed stun attempt, I resorted to another method as I closed the distance for my next attack. Multiple vials filled with blood started to materialize in my hands, and one by one I threw them high into the air above the ant’s position.\nThe ant seemed to dismiss this as a mere distraction attempt, but it failed to realize that while the empty bottles dropped harmlessly to the ground, the blood itself was forming into deadly projectiles above its head.Google seaʀᴄh NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nUsing my Blood Control trait, I shaped the airborne crimson liquid into five razor-sharp spears, each one aimed at different vulnerable points on the creature’s body.\nAs I appeared before the ant once again, it took on a defensive stance, clearly recognizing that my golden barrier would protect me from any counterattacks it might attempt.\nI launched all five blood spears simultaneously from various angles, creating an assault that would be difficult to defend against completely.\nThe ant’s eyes tracked the incoming projectiles with frightening power. Its damaged leg didn’t prevent it from attempting to deflect the blood weapons with its remaining limbs.\nCrack! Clink!\nIt successfully deflected three of the spears with impressive high speed movement, but two found their marks, piercing through gaps in its Armor and drawing more of that dark fluid.\nTaking advantage of the momentary distraction, I leaped high into the air, using my agility to position myself above the creature. For a split second, my eyes locked with its alien gaze.\nI landed directly on the ant’s thorax and immediately started to work. My hands became a blur as I attacked its neck area with every ounce of power I possessed, seeking to sever something vital.\nThe ant covered its neck and the top of its head with its remaining functional limbs, successfully protecting those areas but at the cost of further injuring both defensive appendages as my sword carved through them.\nSpotting that the creature’s head was now completely exposed due to its defensive positioning, I immediately switched targets and redirected my assault.\nMy sword strike landed perfectly on its left eye, the blade slicing deep into the optical cluster before cutting through one of its antennae in the same motion.\nSQUEAK!\nThe ant released a terrible, high-pitched sound of agony that seemed to shake the very air around us. The creature began thrashing wildly, using its massive body to try and dislodge me from my advantageous position.\nThe violent movement succeeded in throwing me clear, sending me tumbling across the forest floor as the wounded ant writhed in pain and fury.\nI rolled to my feet and quickly assessed my situation. The golden barrier around me flickered ominously, I had only one second left before my invulnerability would expire completely.\nThe ant’s remaining eye fixed on me with pure, undiluted hatred. Its killing intent was so intense I could feel every hair on my body standing on end. The creature was no longer just hunting, it was absolutely hell-bent on my destruction.\nOne antenna was gone, one eye was destroyed, multiple limbs were damaged, and dark fluid leaked from several wounds. But it was still very much a Transcendent-rank threat, and now it was enraged beyond reason.\nThe golden light around me began to fade as Guardian’s Last Stand reached its time limit. In moments, I would be completely vulnerable to this wounded, furious monster that wanted nothing more than to tear me apart.\nI needed a new plan, and I needed it immediately.\nThe ant’s remaining antenna twitched erratically as it prepared for what would likely be its most devastating attack yet. Its damaged legs moved as it gathered itself for a crushing attack.\nAs the protective barrier disappeared entirely, leaving me exposed and vulnerable, I realized this was the moment that would determine whether I lived or died.\nThe ant’s killing intent washed over me like a physical force, weighing me down.\nTime seemed to slow as the creature prepared to launch itself at me with everything it had left.",

      "content": "Chapter 39: First Life or Death Fight [3]\nThe golden barrier that had protected me from the ant’s deadly grip shimmered before vanishing completely.\nGuardian’s Last Stand had officially become a relic of the past. No longer usable, but it had served its purpose well.\nMy body was still enhanced by my own Blood Control trait and the Crimson Moon Pendant’s life force conversion. But whether these enhancements would keep me alive for the next few seconds, that was an entirely different matter.\nThe ant dashed toward me with incredible speed despite numerous injuries.\n’Fast!’\nI tried to dodge, but I was unable to fully escape the powerful attack.\nThe strike grazed my shoulder and I felt it dislocate immediately. Sharp pain shot through my body as the joint popped out of place.\nI grunted in agony while quickly regaining my balance and creating some distance between myself and the ant.\nKeeping my eyes locked on the ant, I attempted to force my shoulder back into place. The creature wasn’t going to wait patiently while I dealt with my injuries.\nAfter a few desperate attempts while the ant prepared its next assault, I finally managed to relocate the joint.\nClick.\nI rotated my shoulder to test its functionality before scrambling up the nearest tree. I hoped that the ant’s injured limbs would prevent it from climbing after me.\nAs I watched from above, the ant seemed to have no intention of climbing. Instead, it charged directly at the tree and split it in half with one brutal attack.\nI felt the massive oak falling and my body plummeted with it. I quickly leaped onto another tree, but the ant attacked that one too. In short order, four trees had fallen under its relentles, quick assault.\nAs I jumped to the fifth tree, the ant anticipated my movement and the short distance between the two trees didn’t provide me enough time to avoid its strike.\nI landed on the new tree just as it was falling and got caught by the ant’s attack.\nThe impact threw my body like a broken kite once again. I had crossed my arms defensively before taking the hit to lessen the damage, but it still hurt like hell.\nI stood up almost immediately to find the ant pursuing me relentlessly. I tried to dodge, but my speed wasn’t sufficient.\nBoom!\nThe attack landed squarely against my crossed arms.\nCrack!\n\"Argh!\" I couldn’t help but roar in pain as I felt my arm bones fracture under the terrible force.\nThe ant didn’t wait for me to recover. It attacked again immediately, the second strike breaking my other arm and sending waves of agony throughout my entire body.\nEverything was spiraling downhill rapidly.\nMy body flew through the air like a kite and slammed into another tree trunk.\nFortunately, I ended up about twenty meters away from the ant. I forced myself to get up despite the overwhelming pain.\nMy enhanced regeneration was working fast, but it couldn’t keep pace with the accumulating, high damage I was receiving.\nStanding up on unsteady legs, I abandoned any thought of fighting and took off running in the opposite direction. I poured every remaining drop of mana into enhancing my movement speed. All I could think about was to escape.\nIf I slowed down or looked back, I might die.\nI convinced myself, just to run even a little bit faster.\nAfter nearly five minutes of desperate flight, I found myself in an completely unknown part of the forest. I had delved deeper into the wilderness in my attempt to escape the relentless pursuit of my enemy.\nI had no idea where I was.\nI glanced back to find that accursed ant still behind me, its damaged limbs moving with terrifying determination.\nI cursed out loud this time. I had hoped that a powerful Transcendent beast would emerge in this deeper territory and engage the ant while I escaped.\nA Transcendent-rank creature wouldn’t worry about an Elite-rank like me and would focus entirely on the injured ant that represented a more significant threat and reward.\nTo my terrible luck, this didn’t happen.\nThe sword in my hand was shaking uncontrollably. My arms were healing at a rapid pace, but they were still not suitable for proper combat with a creature like the ant. I needed to keep delaying the inevitable, otherwise I was dead.\nI cursed it out loud, my fighting spirit refusing to bow down despite the hopeless situation.\n\"You’re so hell-bent on dying, huh?\" I spat, my voice shaking slightly.\nWhether it was fear, excitement, or pure adrenaline, I couldn’t tell. But I knew one thing for certain.\nI wasn’t going to go down without a fight.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nI charged fearlessly towards the ant.\nThe creature seemed genuinely surprised by my sudden courage, but then shrieked in what sounded almost like pure delight.\nIn its remaining eye, this was clearly my last stand. I was being suicidal, that’s what it thought.\nAs if wanting to crush my spirit and any remaining hope for survival, the ant charged toward me at the same time.\nSeeing it charge, my face paled further. I had gambled on the fact that the ant would wait for my attack, allowing me to control the engagement and perform an escaping manoeuvre at the right time, but it didn’t.\nMy mind started working so frantically, so fast that dozens of thoughts flashed through my consciousness in less than a second.\nWas this the phenomenon of life flashing before your eyes that everyone spoke of? I hadn’t experienced it in my previous death, but it seemed like it was catching up with me this time around.\nThis wasn’t a fight between Kyle and a beast that overpowered him, where plot armor and protagonist luck would somehow create a miraculous victory.\nThis was just a side character completely out of place. This world wasn’t originally mine, and my existence here wasn’t supposed to be part of the story.\nTo say that I didn’t lose hope would be a complete lie. How could I not feel despair?\nI was completely overpowered by the ant, heavily injured, with no life-saving items or skills remaining, trapped in a barren part of the forest with no backup plan.\nAs we both approached each other in what would likely be our final collision, I couldn’t help but feel bitter about my situation.\nWhere was the protagonist who always saved everyone in distress when they needed him most?\nA small part of me actually wanted Kyle to appear, to rescue me from this impossible situation. But a larger part of me rejected that desire, because I knew I wouldn’t recover from it psychologically.\nI would always feel inferior to him afterward, no matter what I accomplished, and I would always be in his debt.\nThe distance between the ant and myself closed rapidly. Its damaged but still deadly body bore down on me with murderous intent, while I rushed forward with nothing but desperate determination and a damaged sword.\nThis was it.\nThe moment that would determine whether Adrian Blackwood’s second chance at life would end in these unknown woods, or whether somehow, against all odds, I would find a way to survive.\nThe ant’s remaining eye glinted with anticipation of victory as we hurtled toward our final confrontation.\nTime seemed to slow as death approached.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

This was my last resort, either I live or die.\nBlood Control activated, my most powerful trait that I had been using to boost my overall capabilities throughout this desperate fight.\nI pushed every remaining drop of mana into the ability. After this, I would be completely drained.\nI took out nearly ten liters worth of blood vials from my storage ring. They all crashed to the forest floor, breaking and letting blood spread across the earth.\nThe ant was no longer oblivious to my Blood Control ability and kept its remaining eye focused on my movements.\nBut who cared if it was watching? My next attack would be the last, and it was going to be everything I had.\nI controlled all of the spilled blood and began forming approximately ten spears. I could feel myself starting to lose control over them.\nI wasn’t proficient enough to manage so many projectiles simultaneously at my current trait level.\nStill, I forced myself to create a shield as well, hoping to mitigate some of the damage I was inevitably going to take.\nBy now, I was face to face with the ant, close enough to see my reflection in its alien compound eye.\nWhoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!\nThe blood spears behind me flew at rapid speed toward the creature. It was a direct assault, I couldn’t control each one individually with the precision I needed.\nThe ant didn’t stop its charge, believing that it could kill me and then dodge the projectiles, or perhaps thinking it could eliminate me and destroy my blood constructs once I was no longer controlling them. Either way, it was hell-bent on finishing me off.\nThe shield materialized on my left side. After being attacked so many times, I knew the creature favored its right limbs and consistently attacked from that direction.\nAnd indeed, the ant struck me from my left hand side. My blood shield held for a few precious milliseconds before shattering, allowing the attack to continue its deadly approach.\nMy sword thrust deep into the ant’s torso with all the force I could muster.\nShit!\nAlthough the blade penetrated, the ant wasn’t critically injured. I had clearly missed the vital organs I’d been aiming for as I watched its attack still approaching me.\nI left my sword embedded in its body and moved my half-broken arms to defend once again, knowing that two shattered arms were better than a crushed skull.\nCrack!\nOnce again my arms broke with sickening sounds, and I flew through the air like the countless times before.\nDespite my terrible condition, a smirk emerged on my face as I watched my blood spears streak toward the wounded ant.\nClink! Clink!\nMy smug smirk faded instantly, as I witnessed another ant suddenly appear before the one I’d been fighting and block the attacks that might have killed my original opponent.\nI stared in shock and disbelief.\nNo, there was no way. Had I ventured directly into ant territory?\nSensing the transcendent aura emerging from the second ant, a bitter, hopeless smile emerged on my face.\n\"Hahaha.\" I let out a hysterical chuckle.\nI was dead.\nSomeone clearly wanted me dead. Otherwise, how could I possibly be this unlucky?\n\"Damn it!\" I shouted with all my remaining energy. I no longer cared if other beasts heard me.\nWhy would it matter when two Transcendent beasts stood before me while I was in such a miserable state?\nMy arms were broken and my ankle ligaments were torn from the accumulated damage throughout the prolonged fight.\nSlowly the ant approached my prone form. I lay on the forest floor, trying to get up but finding it incredibly difficult.\nThe damned ant approached me slowly, clearly enjoying itself and savoring their victory.\nI turned my gaze to face them as they drew near before speaking.\n\"You filthy wretches... go to hell,\" I spat, maintaining a defiant grin despite everything.\nThe ant I’d been fighting seemed angered by my curse, as if it somehow understood my words.\nMy original enemy approached me slowly while the other simply waited at the side, content to watch.\nI’m dead... aren’t I? Was this it? Is this the end? Damn it, it’s so fucking hard to survive in this world.\nWhen all hope was lost, I suddenly felt the energy around us crackle with otherworldly power.\nBefore my eyes, a small crack in space appeared and rapidly expanded into a large circular portal. The gate glowed bright red, the color of fresh blood.\nI stared at the gate before my eyes locked with the ant that seemed to understand my current thoughts.\nI smirked before saying, \"...Come after me if you dare, bastard.\"\nI forced my broken body to stand and used every last bit of remaining energy to leap toward the mysterious portal.\nI could see the ant dashing toward me, trying to catch me before I could escape, but it was too late.\nI couldn’t care less if the portal was dangerous or not. I was dead anyway.\nBetter to take my chances with the unknown than face certain death at the hands of these dirty ants.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n...\nThe two ants glanced at each other before beginning some form of communication through rapid antenna movements and subtle body language.\nAfter what appeared to be an argument, the injured ant that had been fighting Adrian made its decision. Without waiting for its companion’s agreement, it leapt into the blood-red portal.\nWatching his wounded friend disappear into the unknown gateway, the second ant felt conflicted. He turned to look in the direction of their colony, then back at the slowly pulsing portal. The thought of informing the colony before pursuing crossed his mind.\nBut before he could make up his mind, the portal suddenly began shrinking at an alarming rate. Put under immediate pressure, the ant decided to follow his companion rather than risk losing them forever.\nThe gateway closed just as he squeezed through, and the forest returned to its usual peaceful silence.\nInside the unknown realm...\nThe ant that had just entered found itself in a completely new environment. It appeared to be some form of jungle, but unlike anything from the natural world it knew.\nThe breeze carried an unnatural chill that seemed to seep into the very soul. The sky above was pitch black, choked with dense fog so thick it reduced visibility to a meter or so. Strange, otherworldly sounds echoed from the murky depths, the sounds were so chilling the ant regretted his action.\nThe ant’s antennas twitched frantically, trying to locate its injured companion in this nightmarish landscape. The familiar scents and sounds of home were completely absent, replaced by an atmosphere of dread.\nBut before the creature could receive any meaningful sensory input or begin to understand where it had found itself...\nA massive silhouette emerged from the impenetrable fog.\nThe shape was impossibly large, moving through the mist. Details were obscured by the darkness, but the presence radiated power that dwarfed Transcendent-rank beings completely.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by\nStomp!\nThe ant was crushed into paste instantaneously. Just like that, a Transcendent beast was eliminated by the casual footstep of whatever dwelled in this mysterious realm.\nThe enormous silhouette paused briefly, as if noticing the insignificant creature it had accidentally stepped on, before continuing its journey deeper into the fog-shrouded jungle.",

      "content": "Chapter 41: Unkown Realm\nUpon entering the red gate, I found myself in an unknown place that I had no recognition of.\nIn fact, in the story, no such gate had ever appeared, even to Kyle himself. I had no clue where it had taken me or what it represented.\nThe sky was dark, with clouds lazily drifting across a blood-red moon that dominated the heavens.\nI couldn’t help but get lost in its haunting beauty.\nA perfect, crimson full-moon glowing against the dark sky. The sight was both mesmerizing and deeply unsettling.\nI looked around frantically, afraid that powerful monsters lurking within this place or the possibility of the ant having followed me through the portal. But no such threats appeared in my immediate vicinity.\nI stood before an ancient temple, with a long stone staircase leading up to the structure at the summit. Around me stretched a dense jungle filled with massive trees whose canopies disappeared into the darkness above.\nI didn’t venture into the jungle. That would have been foolish in my current injured state and to be honest, even if I had been at my top condition, I still wouldn’t have done so.\nWithout knowing the dangers that lurked within that jungle, I wouldn’t venture there.\nAfter a moment of hesitation, I decided to climb the stairs and seek shelter within the old temple. Staying exposed in this alien landscape seemed far more dangerous than whatever might await me inside.\nThe climb demanded tremendous effort. Each step felt progressively harder, as if some invisible force was weighing down on my very soul.\nBut I continued upward, driven by necessity and the lack of alternatives.\nI let out a heavy breath as I finally reached the summit. The temple entrance was massive and ominous, easily three times my height and carved from some dark stone that seemed to absorb light.\nFour towering pillars supported the structure, each one covered in intricate carvings that hurt to look at directly. The symbols seemed to shift and writhe in my peripheral vision.\nArriving at the entrance, I decided to push against the enormous gate.\nCreak!\nThe wooden doors groaned as they slowly opened inward, the sound echoing through the empty air like a death knell. Unlike what I had expected, there was no immediate chamber beyond the threshold.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nInstead, a long hallway stretched into darkness, leading to another door barely visible in the distance. Torches lined the walls, their flames burning with the same unnatural red light as the moon above.\nThe corridor seemed to stretch far longer than the temple’s exterior dimensions should have allowed.\nI hesitated at the threshold, my survival instincts warring with my need for shelter. Whatever lay beyond that distant door, I was about to find out.\nTaking a deep breath, I stepped into the hallway and began walking toward whatever awaited me in the heart of this mysterious temple.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nWalking through the hallway, I arrived before the door at the end. It was the only thing in the entire corridor that I could possibly explore.\nGlancing at my arms that were healing but still not in good shape, I decided to sit down for some rest.\nI didn’t know what awaited me behind that door, so I needed to at least have functional hands before entering. The pain was still significant, and attempting to fight anything with broken limbs would be foolish.\nI wasn’t too concerned about immediate danger because if there was something that would have killed me, it would have been at the entrance to this temple, not hidden behind that door. Greater threats usually guarded the perimeter, while the inner sanctums contained treasures or trials.\nBesides, there was nowhere else I could go. The portal had vanished completely, the fog-shrouded jungle was clearly a death trap, and only this mysterious chamber seemed to offer any possibility of survival or advancement.\nI hoped that I would encounter some powerful relic, ideally Superior rank or perhaps even Epic grade equipment.\nThe mysterious nature of this realm suggested I might encounter the remnants of some powerful being who had long since died and left their treasury behind. Such discoveries were rare but not unheard of in worlds where magic and powerful bloodlines shaped reality.\nAn hour passed, and my injuries were finally healed thanks to my vampiric regeneration enhanced by strategic use of my Blood Control trait.\nI had sped up blood flow to my injured areas, ensuring they healed faster than normal. The technique worked wonders.\nIt was basically applied medical science, but sometimes you overlooked the obvious solutions when under stress.\nDuring that hour of recovery, I had also taken the opportunity to assess my current condition more thoroughly. My mana reserves were recovering, though still not at full capacity. My enhanced armor was mostly damage but still intact, and most importantly, I was alive when by all rights I should have been dead.\nI stood up and faced the ornate door, taking a deep breath to centre myself.\nWhatever lay beyond this threshold would determine whether my desperate gamble had been worth the risk.\nTime to see what secrets this ancient place held.\n...\nMy hands touched the door, and before I could push it open, the massive portal began moving on its own accord, as if it possessed a will of its own.\nBefore me stood a peerless figure, wearing a pure white dress that was slightly revealing, barely covering her pale skin. The garment was just modest enough to maintain propriety by covering her\nMy hands touched the door, and before I could push it open, the massive portal began moving on its own accord, as if it possessed a will of its own.\nBefore me stood a peerless figure, wearing a pure white dress that was slightly revealing, barely covering her pale skin. The garment was just modest enough to maintain propriety by covering her private parts while accentuating her otherworldly beauty.\nFurthermore, she possessed long, silky white hair that flowed down her back, glistening beautifully despite the countless chains that held her captive like some dangerous beast.\nThe figure was restrained by nearly a hundred ethereal chains that glowed with suppressive magic, and despite her clearly miserable imprisonment, she still appeared incredibly elegant and regal.\nI had never seen a woman as beautiful as her in either of my lifetimes. She was undeniably what anyone would define as physical perfection, with proportions that made rational thought temporarily freeze in awe.\nI stared at her in stunned silence, simply admiring her existence.\nI snapped out of my daze as the chained beauty suddenly opened her eyelids, revealing the magnificent eyes that had been concealed within.\nShe possessed a pair of utterly charming eyes, enchanting violet jewels that enhanced her already impossible beauty even further.\nShe stared at me in contemplative silence before speaking in a clear voice. \"You...How can you possess the untainted bloodline of the vampires? I don’t sense a single speck of impurity within your blood.\"\nI froze completely in place. The woman before me had somehow determined my exact bloodline simply by looking at me.\nShe was a figure that began to terrify me greatly!\nNobody, and I mean absolutely nobody possessed the ability to analyse other people’s bloodlines through casual observation... unless...",

      "content": "Chapter 42: Another Vampire.\nTo test my theory, I activated my bloodline abilities and focused on her figure.\nMy eyes widened in disbelief. \"You... you are a vampire too.\"\nAfter a moment of contemplative silence, the woman spoke again. \"Vampire? I suppose you are correct.\"\nThe revelation made me pause immediately. I stood before a powerful vampire, but why was she bound in chains like a dangerous prisoner?\nBefore I could voice my confusion, the vampire beat me to it. \"You are wondering why I’m chained, aren’t you? It seems like you aren’t part of any clan... and your bloodline purity is so remarkable... What’s your name?\"\n\"Adrian,\" I responded in a calm voice.\n\"I see... Adrian. That’s a pleasant name. It rolls off my tongue quite well.\" The beautiful vampire smiled warmly. \"You must have countless questions, but I will allow you three. Think of them carefully.\"\nThree questions? I had nearly a hundred burning questions in my head, yet she was only willing to answer three?\nI took a deep breath and organized my thoughts.\nMy first question would address the most immediate concern, how I had arrived here.\n\"I was transported here through a red blood gate. What is it exactly, and will I be able to get back?\"\nShe stared at me for a moment before letting out a small chuckle that made my heart race involuntarily. \"That’s two questions already.\"\nSeeing the obvious disappointment on my face, she laughed melodiously before adding, \"don’t worry, I was just joking. I’ll count this as a single question just because you are handsome.\"\nHer compliment made my cheeks redden. Had it been anyone but this woman before me, I would’ve been able to deflect it easily. But something about her made me...tense.\n\"As for the red gate, it’s a manifestation of this realm’s power. Due to its highly unstable existence, such portals appear across various realms attempting to stabilize the dimensional structure. Think of it as a way to discharge excess magical energy. This leads to your second part, whether you can get back. Well, you can get back by simply using your magical energy, you aren’t part of this world, so using any sort of mana will warp you back to where you came from.\"\nDamn...doesn’t that mean..Theortically, nobody outside this realm can help her? unless their power is beyond this realm’s...\nI processed this information carefully before the obvious follow-up occurred to me. \"Why is it unstable?\"\n\"Is that your second question?\" she asked with raised eyebrows.\nI immediately shook my head, remembering the strict three-question limit. \"No, no.\"\nMy hasty response made her chuckle again, filling my ears with that melodious voice.\n\"Why were you imprisoned?\" The second question escaped my lips, though I wasn’t certain if it was too sensitive a topic.\nShe paused for several seconds, as if carefully weighing her response, before speaking. \"Because I was weak.\"\n\"That’s it?\" I asked, hoping for more details. I wanted to know who had imprisoned her, and more specifics about the circumstances, but the knowing smile on her face indicated she was finished answering that particular question.\nI sighed before asking what might be the most important question of all.\n\"What’s your name?\"\nHer beautiful eyebrows lifted in genuine surprise. \"That’s your final question?\"\nI nodded firmly. Knowing her name would allow me to look for clues and have something to go by once I return to my realm.\n\"Well then... my name is Carmilla, the Vampire Queen.\"\nThe title hit me a punch to the gut.\nThe beauty before me was not just any vampire, but the queen. The implications were staggering, I was speaking with vampire queen who possessed power beyond my comprehension.\nYet here she was, chained and imprisoned in this mysterious realm.\nWhat kind of force could capture and contain a Vampire Queen?Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nHer voice once again interrupted my thoughts.\n\"Your three questions are now up. May I ask you for a favour?\" Carmilla said, staring at me with eyes that glinted slightly in the dim light.\n\"I will help within the limits of my ability,\" I replied cautiously.\nCarmilla nodded her head gracefully. \"I’m hungry... can you feed me?\"\n\"Feed you?\" I muttered before my eyes widened in realisation. She wanted my blood.\nI paused for several seconds, not responding immediately as I thought through the possible implications. I was an Elite-ranked vampire, and while my blood possessed very high purity, it was nowhere near powerful enough to free her from those magical restraints. While Carmilla seemed like a reasonable person so far, I didn’t know her complete background, and accidentally freeing a potentially dangerous prisoner would be incredibly foolish.\nEspecially when she could squash me like a bug.\nAfter thinking it through carefully, I decided to proceed. She had answered my questions when she had no obligation to do so, so providing her with sustenance after who knows how long she’d been starved seemed like a fair exchange.\nI walked toward her slowly before asking, \"How are we going to do this?\"\nShe smiled warmly before replying, \"The good old way.\" She tilted her head slightly, revealing her slender, pale neck that made me gulp involuntarily.\nThe graceful curve of her throat was mesmerizing, and I found myself momentarily distracted by her otherworldly beauty even in this strange situation.\nI approached carefully, positioning myself near her restrained form. The chains clinked softly as she adjusted her position to make the feeding more accessible.\n\"Don’t worry,\" she said softly, noticing my hesitation. \"I won’t take more than I need.\"\nI extended my wrist toward her, but she shook her head gently.\n\"Your neck would be...better,\" she explained with that same hypnotic smile.\nI hesitated for just a moment longer before moving closer.\nI sat down, bringing myself to eye level with the most beautiful being I’d ever encountered.\nUp close, she looked even more stunning than before. Every detail of her face was perfect, from her delicate skin to those enchanting violet eyes.\nI tilted my head and offered her my neck.",

      "content": "Chapter 43: Succulent Blood, Enticing Offer.\nCarmilla licked her lips seductively before saying, \"If you’ll excuse me.\"\nHer fangs pierced my neck with surprising gentleness.\n\"Ah...\" I let out an unexpected moan.\nSurprisingly, the process didn’t hurt at all. I was actually enjoying the sensation more than anything.\nAfter about a minute of the most pleasurable feeling I’d ever experienced, even better than any intimate encounter from my previous life, she withdrew her fangs.\nShe licked the blood that had dripped onto her lips before saying, \"You taste delicious.\"\nI looked at her with hazy eyes, still processing the incredible sensation.\nAfter that blood-sharing session, and having stared at her elegant neck for so long, I couldn’t help but voice my inner desire.\n\"Can I?\"\nShe smiled knowingly at my words. \"You want a taste of my blood?\"\nI nodded eagerly.\nHonestly, had I not known about her immense power and her ability to crush me like an insect despite being restrained, I would have already leapt onto her neck and devoured her blood without permission.The source of thɪs content is NovᴇlFirenᴇt\n\"Eat,\" she whispered into my ear, her breath sending shivers down my spine.\nAs soon as those words registered in my brain, I bit into her neck with the hunger of a starved wolf.\n\"Ahh! You’re being so aggressive,\" she said in a strangely affectionate tone that made my heart race.\nI wasn’t sure whether my senses were dulled due to the intense pleasure I was experiencing, or whether she was genuinely making those sounds of enjoyment.\nEither way, I continued feeding on her blood for about a minute before she gently signalled for me to stop.\nSystem notifications flashed across my vision, but I completely ignored them, too invested in the incredible taste of her blood.\nHer blood was absolutely succulent, so delicious and sweet that I felt genuine sadness when she told me to stop.\nThe blood from that Elite-ranked beast with a rare bloodline now seemed like sewage water in comparison. In fact, it was even worse than that, there was simply no comparison possible.\nI wondered how I would ever be able to drink other blood after experiencing this incredible taste.\nAfter I reluctantly withdrew, Carmilla looked at me with genuine shock written across her beautiful face.\n\"You... How?\"\n\"How? What?\" I answered in confusion, wondering if I had done something wrong during the feeding.\nHer violet eyes were wide with what appeared to be amazement and disbelief, as if something unexpected had just occurred.\n\"You... took one of my bloodline traits.\"\nMy eyes widened in shock. I had absorbed one of her bloodline traits? That had never happened before. I’d consumed blood from countless creatures, and I’d never taken the traits of others.\nRemembering the system notifications I’d ignored, I quickly checked them.\n[Your Supreme Vampire bloodline is increasing...]\n[Your Supreme Vampire bloodline is increasing...]\n[You have gained the second-order trait: Blood Trail]\n[Host: Adrian Blackwood]\n[Bloodline: Supreme Vampire - 20%]\n[Rank: Elite]\n[Traits: Blood Control (2nd Order, Lvl.3), Supernatural Physique (1st Order, Lvl.3), Blood Enhancement (1st Order, Lvl.1), Blood Trail (2nd Order, Lvl.1)]\n[Aspect: Serpent Scales (Elite), Silent Predator (Elite)]\n[Echo: None]\nI stared at my updated status in amazement. My bloodline percentage had increased to 20% - a significant jump that should have been impossible.\nIt had to be understood that increasing bloodline percentage was unheard of except through rank advancement, which only provided tiny incremental increases. Even Kyle himself had never gained such an opportunity in the novel, at least not in the portions I’d read up to, and he had already reached Royal rank by that point.\n[Blood Trail]\n[Order: 2]\n[Level: 1]\n[Details: Track individuals you have previously fed from or tasted the blood of. Can sense their general direction and approximate distance up to 10 kilometers for 24 hours after contact. Trail becomes fainter over time. Cannot pinpoint exact location, only general vicinity.]\nThe trait was incredibly useful for tracking purposes.\nCarmilla stared at me for several moments before speaking thoughtfully. \"It seems like this is fate. Out of everything you could have gained, you received this specific trait.\"\nI stared back, understanding her words but not wanting to delve too deeply into the implications of what she meant by \"fate.\"\nCarmilla continued studying me before making her proposition. \"How about this... I know you are not a normal vampire, not at all. So I want to make a deal with you.\"\n\"A deal? What kind?\" I asked, though I had a growing suspicion about what she might propose.\n\"Save me from this place. Not now, but when you are strong enough to do so without putting yourself in mortal danger. In return, I will give you something that will make you incredibly more powerful.\"\nHer violet eyes held a serious intensity that made it clear this wasn’t a casual request. Whatever she was offering must be extraordinarily valuable to warrant such a commitment.\nA Vampire Queen’s gratitude and whatever gift she was promising could certainly be life-changing even to my current self. But it also meant binding myself to a future obligation that could prove extremely dangerous.\nI needed to consider this carefully.\nWhat exactly was she offering, and what would rescuing her actually entail?\nAfter some time of pondering, I said. \"Alright, Lady Carmilla. As you know, your enemies are extremely powerful to be able to detain somebody as powerful as you. Meanwhile, I’m just a poor person at the Elite rank.\nI’ve barely survived a fight with a Transcendent-rank creature a while ago. So, to be blatantly honest, unless what you will provide me truly entices me and helps me get more powerful, it will be difficult for me to accept your previous proposal.\"\nCarmilla’s smile remained on her face despite my initial rejection of her offer.\n\"Firstly, you don’t have to call me Lady. You can just call me Carmilla. Secondly, why don’t you just witness the benefits yourself?\"\nCarmilla closed her eyes before blood started flowing from them slowly.\nI looked in horror and shock as I watched the crimson liquid emerging from her eyes gradually form into a perfect sphere.\nOnce the blood drop finished forming, it had taken the shape of a beautiful teardrop that was fascinating to observe.\nCarmilla opened her eyes once again, showing no sign of the blood that had been leaking from them moments before.\n\"What is this?\" I asked, staring at the teardrop made from blood.\n\"Drink it and you will find out.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 44: Legendary Rank Item\nStill remembering the incredible taste of her blood, I licked my lips slightly and consumed it both for the flavour and curiosity about what it might grant me.\nA system notification flashed across my vision once more.\n[Echo: Stone Armor]\n[Rank: Transcendent]\n[Type: Active]\n[Details: Deploys body Armor that covers the entire body except the head. The Armor possesses the defence capabilities of Transcendent-rank beings. Once completely broken, the echo will no longer exist.]\nI stared at the system notification in absolute shock. Carmilla had just gifted me an echo? This was an ability that defied the normal system in an unprecedented way.\nShe was able to bypass the restriction of killing a beast to gain echoes or aspects and simply given me one through that blood drop.\nSeeing the shock etched across my face, Carmilla smiled before calmly saying, \"Relax. I know what you are thinking. There are limits to this trait of mine. I won’t go into details, but know that this isn’t something I can casually do, and nor is it something that others can access like yourself.\"\nI stared at her in a daze before nodding in understanding. The fact that she even shared this information with me was enough. After all, nobody shared their weaknesses with others, even Kyle, the great hero, himself.\n\"This is just an appetizer. Once you accept my proposal, I will give you a Legendary-rank item. Although, I would need to lock its abilities for you to use it safely. A Legendary-rank item has sentience, and if you aren’t strong enough, it will take over your mind. So I will keep its abilities locked behind rank barriers you need to break before unlocking the next ability.\"\nI nodded my head, processing the implications.\nKyle had only possessed an Epic-ranked item after more than a year of growth, but now I was being offered a Legendary-rank item which was exponentially more valuable, even if its abilities were sealed behind progression barriers.\n\"So...What do you think?\"\nI stood there for a moment. The offer was incredibly enticing, and I couldn’t force myself to reject such an opportunity.\nThe Transcendent-rank defensive echo alone was worth more than most people would see in their entire lives. Combined with the promise of a Legendary item, this deal could change everything about my survival prospects.\nThe echo had just given me the power of a transcendent beast, at least the defensive power of a transcendent beast.\n\"I accept,\" I said finally. \"But I want to know more about what I’ll be facing when the time comes to rescue you.\"\nCarmilla shook her head. \"Some things are better left unknown for now. Lest you get yourself into trouble without understanding the consequences. These beings... even saying their names is taboo.\"\nThese beings...it’s just like I had thought. It’s not a single entity, she is enemies with multiple.\nAfter a moment of silence, I sighed in resignation.\n\"Fine. Where is the legendary-rank item you mentioned?\"\n\"It will be with you in a few moments.\"\nA few moments?\nI thought to myself before something unprecedented occurred right before my very eyes.\nCarmilla’s eyes began bleeding once again, but this time blood poured out like rain from storm clouds. The crimson liquid flowed without stopping.\nI stood there looking at the sigh in disbelief. I wanted to ask if she was truly alright, if something had gone wrong, but I didn’t dare interrupt what was clearly an important and delicate process.\nAfter about a minute of continuous bleeding, seven drops the size of small gems had formed and begun floating in the air before me.\nFinally, Carmilla opened her eyes, though unlike the previous time, they were still bleeding slightly.\nClearly, this had taken a significant toll on her. Still, the fact that she was able to create a legendary-rank item while bound by so many chains made of powerful suppression runes definitely made her grow in my estimation.\nJust how powerful was the Vampire Queen before me?\nCarmilla’s gaze landed on my neck before she spoke in a slightly haggard tone. \"Give me your pendant. I don’t have a vessel to house your legendary item.\"\nI nodded, though my mind was racing.\nI pondered which item to give her, the Typhoon Pendant or the Crimson Moon Pendant.\nAs if answering my inner turmoil, she said, \"Give me the Superior-ranked item. The vessel needs to be strong enough to contain the power I’m about to bestow upon it.\"\nI took out the Crimson Moon Pendant, and before I could hand it to her, it flew from my hands and positioned itself in the centre of the seven blood gems that began circling around it.\nOne by one, the gems fused with the pendant in brilliant flashes of crimson light. The aura emanating from the pendant grew exponentially stronger with each fusion.\nTen minutes later, a transformed pendant rested in my hands. It now contained seven blood-red gems embedded in its surface, one glowing brilliantly while the other six appeared dormant, as if sleeping.\nThe power radiating from the artifact was incredible, far beyond anything I’d even imagined.\nI looked at Carmilla still chained. Her breath was slightly haggard and a small tired smile still on her beautiful face.\nCarmilla spoke in a soft tone. \"I’ve instilled inside this item an Overlord-rank secret sword art.\"\nMy eyes widened in shock.\nAn Overlord-rank sword art? In the novel, the highest rank I’d heard someone achieved was King rank.\nGaining an Overlord-rank sword art was something I hadn’t dared to dream of. The sword art inside this item was basically an art created by an Overlord-rank entity.\nOverlord was apparently a rank even higher than King rank itself, and I had no idea how much more powerful it was.\nSo I asked the question on my mind, \"Is the Overlord rank directly above King rank?\"\nCarmilla shook her head. \"No, it’s two ranks above King rank. Anyway, back to what I was saying - I’ve split the sword art into seven stages. At each rank progression from Elite to Overlord, you will gain access to a secret technique. The power grows exponentially as you advance through it. Also, the item will be permanently bound to you once you drop a single drop of your blood on it.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 45: Sky’s Secret\nI nodded before asking an important question. \"What if someone recognizes that I have a legendary-rank item and tries to steal it or even kill me for it?\"\nCarmilla smiled reassuringly. \"The legendary-rank item I created naturally has defensive mechanisms to prevent such situations. The aura will always be concealed, no matter what detection methods are used.\nAlso, you will need to consume each secret art once it becomes available. You see the gem that’s glowing? That means you’re able to absorb that technique and receive it directly into your mind, as for the those that aren’t glowing, it means you are not able to and you are not ready to consume it yet.\"\nI looked at her in confusion. Why did she need to go through all this complexity? She could have just stored these techniques in a storage ring or something similar.\nI voiced my inner question.\nHer response was reasonable. \"No storage ring you possess could contain such powerful technique, and neither could your mind handle them directly. Otherwise, I would have just instilled everything into your brain immediately. A powerful vessel was required to safely contain and regulate the transfer.\"\nI nodded in understanding before asking, \"So I won’t get any direct boosts to my physical capabilities or anything like that?\"\nCarmilla shook her head. \"You won’t receive stat increases. But you will gain access to the secret arts each time you rank up, and you can absorb one right now. Each secret art will massively increase your combat effectiveness, even if it doesn’t necessarily boost your base statistics.\"\nI nodded, beginning to grasp the incredible value of what she was offering. Combat techniques at each level could make me far more dangerous than my rank would suggest.\nLooking at the pendant with its single glowing gem, I grabbed it with my right hand before shoving it into my mouth.\n...\nLooking at the pendant with its single glowing gem, I carefully extracted the luminous drop and placed it on my tongue.\nGulp!\nInformation suddenly flooded into my brain all at once. I frowned briefly at the sudden sharp pain before it was regulated and became manageable.\nI began to comprehend the vast amount of knowledge flowing through my consciousness.\nThe sword art I had just received was called Sky’s Secret Sword Art.\nThe name certainly sounded powerful, and I didn’t expect anything less from an Overlord-rank technique.\nThe first technique taught me the foundational form within the secret art.\n[Sky’s Secret Sword Art]\n[First Secret Art — Null Strike]\n[\nDescription: Though deceptively simple, this form establishes the core principle of negating opposing forces rather than overpowering them.]\nThe concept was fascinating, rather than using brute force, the technique focused on eliminating resistance entirely. It was an elegant approach that could make even a relatively weak strike devastatingly effective.\nCarmilla, observing my amazement, explained further. \"You will be able to use the form you consumed, but only after proper training. You won’t be able to execute it simply by possessing the knowledge, you’ll need to practice the form extensively to master it. However, you now have the foundation of the technique. You just need to train consistently to perfect it over time.\"\nI nodded in understanding. This made perfect sense, theoretical knowledge was vastly different from practical application, especially for something as complex as an Overlord-rank sword art, even if it was broken down into smaller stages.\n\"How long does it typically take to master the first form?\" I asked, curious about the learning curve.\n\"That depends entirely on your dedication and natural aptitude,\" Carmilla replied. \"Some might achieve basic proficiency in months, while true mastery could take years or decades. But remember, even partial mastery of an Overlord-rank technique will make you far more formidable beyond your current rank.\"Thɪs updatᴇd by No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nI nodded my head in understanding.\nThe pendant no longer displayed seven blood gems, but only six, and they were all dormant now.\nI looked at Carmilla before asking, \"Is there anything else you could give me, you know to help you. Like some powerful items, or anything of that sort? Maybe some of your blood for later use?\"\nCarmilla shook her head firmly. \"I don’t have anything else to offer you, do you think my enemies would leave me with powerful items? As for my blood... I know what you’re thinking, and you would be committing suicide if you attempted such a thing.\nMy blood isn’t like that of people at your rank, it has some sentience and fights back against foreign hosts. Once you leave my proximity, it could very well destroy you from the inside if you dared to consume it, or tear you apart from the outside if you tried to weaponize it.\"\nI stared at her in shock. \"Do you mean that your blood could have practically killed me if you hadn’t controlled it when I...drank your blood earlier?\"\n\"Yes,\" Carmilla nodded a smile on her face.\nI gulped, feeling a chill of retroactive fear. I had almost died without even realizing the danger I was in.\n\"Alright, I should get going now. I will return once I’m strong enough to actually help you,\" I said, preparing to leave this mysterious realm.\nCarmilla nodded, maintaining that beautiful smile. \"Take care and... see you soon.\"\nI nodded in response before channelling my mana as she had instructed earlier.\n\"See you soon,\" I muttered.\nThe realm immediately responded to my intent, forming a red portal that would transport me back to my own world.\nAs I stepped through the gateway, I caught one last glimpse of Carmilla watching me with those captivating violet eyes.\nBack in her prison, Carmilla stared at the fading red gate with a melancholic smile gracing her beautiful features, the hundred chains still holding her captive.\n\"When was the last time I was able to speak to someone like this? He is an interesting one... I like him,\" she murmured to herself, licking her lips as if savouring the lingering taste of Adrian’s blood.\nThe portal closed completely, leaving her alone once more in that eternal imprisonment, but now with something she hadn’t possessed in ages, hope.",

      "content": "Chapter 46: Petty Vampire\nI appeared back in the exact location where I had originally been fighting the ant.\nI quickly assessed my situation and didn’t find any trace of it nearby.\nI was no longer consumed by the raw anger I had felt initially, but I was most certainly petty and wouldn’t let that ant escape if it was still alive somewhere.\nI had luckily kept a portion of its blood stored in my pendant, and my new Blood Trail trait would help me locate it.\nI drank the ant’s blood, hoping to activate my tracking ability.\nSuddenly I felt an intense pull indicating the creature was somewhere to the north of my current position.\nA smirk formed on my face, and without delay I began moving toward the north.\nI was absolutely hellbent on killing that ant before leaving this forest.\nI didn’t think too deeply about why it was positioned to the north. Either it had simply ignored the portal and remained in this realm, or it had entered and activated its mana to return just as I had.\nEither way, it was going to die by my hands.\nAfter several minutes of tracking, I luckily spotted the ant from a distance, and it spotted me simultaneously.\nIt turned to face me with obvious anger etched across its face. After all, I was alive when I was meant to be dead. The creature was still heavily injured from our previous encounter, yet despite its weakened state, it held the same murderous rage toward me.\nAfter we faced off in the forest clearing, I spoke mockingly. \"I must admit, your courage is the only admirable thing about you. Other than that, you’re just a piece of shit.\"\nI looked around the area before adding, \"I don’t see that friend of yours. Where is he?\"\nThe ant seemed to become even more enraged after hearing about its companion, though I didn’t understand why the mention triggered such a strong reaction.\nI didn’t particularly care about its emotional state. Using my Blood Control, I shaped some of its stored blood into a spear.\n\"Are you ready to die by your own blood?\" I smirked before charging directly toward the wounded creature.\nI activated my new Stone Armor echo, feeling the Transcendent-rank defensive capabilities envelop my body like an impenetrable shell, and pushed forward with complete confidence.\nUnlike me, the ant was still heavily injured from our previous battle and lacked any defensive abilities to match my new protection.\nThe moment I charged forward, the ant responded with fury, launching itself at me with the intent to kill.\nBut this time, everything was different.\nIts massive claws struck my Stone Armor with enough force to shatter boulders, yet the Transcendent-rank defence held firm. The impact still hit me, but it was not life threatening at all, it was like the attack of a powerful elite-rank beast.\nThe ant’s compound eye widened in shock and confusion as its most powerful attacks accomplished absolutely nothing. I could see the creature’s growing shock as it realized I was once again immune to its attacks.\n\"My turn,\" I said coldly, drawing my sword.\nI decided this was the perfect opportunity to test my newly acquired secret art. While I was still a complete novice with barely any proficiency in the technique, the foundational knowledge was there, waiting to be applied.\nChannelling my mana into the blade as the Sky’s Secret Sword Art had instructed, I felt the weapon begin to resonate with otherworldly power. The Null Strike technique was designed to eliminate resistance rather than overpower it.\nThe ant attacked again with fury, its damaged claws seeking any weakness in my defence. But instead of simply blocking or dodging, I raised my sword and attempted to execute the first form.\n\"First Form - Null Strike!\" I declared, pouring my mana into the technique.\nThe blade seemed to cut through reality itself as it met the ant’s attacking claw. For a brief moment, the very air around my sword seemed to vanish, creating a void-like cutting edge that negated the resistance of matter along its path.\nThe result was extraordinary. My relatively simple defensive movement became something far more devastating as the Null Strike technique activated. The ant’s steel-like claw, which had previously been nearly indestructible, was severely damaged and large cobwebs appeared on its surface.\nEven though my execution was clumsy and imperfect, the inherent power of an Overlord-rank sword art was undeniable, even if it was only a form I could use at the elite-rank. The sheer quality of the technique compensated for my lack of experience, creating effects that should have been impossible at my current skill level.\nThe ant shrieked in agony and disbelief as it lost another limb, dark fluid spurting from the clean cut. It stumbled backward, trying to process how its natural weapons had been so easily destroyed.\nBut I wasn’t finished. While the creature was reeling from the loss of its claw, I activated my Blood Control trait to manipulate the blood spear I had prepared earlier.\nThe weapon, formed from the ant’s own blood, streaked through the air. The creature, distracted by pain and shock, failed to notice the projectile until it was too late.\nThe blood spear struck the ant directly in its thorax, punching through the damaged sections of its chitinous Armor, creating a devastating effect. The impact created a critical wound that penetrated deep into the creature’s vital organs, causing massive internal damage.\nDark fluid poured from the wound as the ant’s breathing became labored and irregular. Its remaining limbs trembled as it struggled to maintain its fighting stance despite the mortal injury.\nYet even facing certain death, the creature refused to surrender. Its eye burned with undiminished hatred as it prepared for one final assault.\nThe ant gathered its remaining strength and launched itself forward in a suicidal charge, determined to take me down with it. Its once sharp claws that had become dull, sought to inflict as much damage as possible.\nI met its charge head-on.\nI channelled my mana and performed the first form of the Sky’s Secret Art, negating the incoming attack. Some of the damage still made it through but my Stone Armor absorbed the impact.\nWithout hesitation, I countered with a strike of my own.\nMy counterattack was swift and merciless. Using another imperfect but devastating Null Strike, I drove my blade deep into the ant’s head, piercing through its remaining eye and into its brain.\nThe massive creature shuddered once before collapsing to the forest floor, its body finally succumbing to the accumulated damage. Its limbs twitched briefly before going completely still.\nI stood over its corpse, victorious. The fight had been a complete reversal of our previous encounter, this time, I had been the predator while it had been the helpless prey.\nAfter making sure the ant was truly dead, I crouched near its corpse and began withdrawing its blood into my collection vials. The blood accumulated to about five litres, more than enough to quench my thirst for several days while also serving as a valuable reserve for emergency situations.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nI used my sword to dissect the ant’s body. Although the exoskeleton was still remarkably tough, it wasn’t nearly as impenetrable as it had seemed during our first encounter.\nAfter carefully harvesting the undamaged portions that could be sold for significant profit, Transcendent-rank beast materials were incredibly valuable on the market, I secured everything in my storage ring and prepared to leave.\nThe eastern horizon was already showing the first hints of dawn, painting the sky in soft shades of pink and gold.\nI desperately needed rest before my first official day at the academy began.\nThe walk back to the city was quick. I bumped into a few elite-rank beasts that I disposed of quickly, and efficiently.\nAs I approached the city gates, I reflected on everything that had transpired. In the span of a single night, I had nearly died, discovered a Vampire Queen, gained Transcendent-rank defensive echo, acquired an Overlord-rank sword art, and successfully taken revenge on the creature that had almost killed me.\nThe guards at the gate nodded respectfully as I passed, recognizing me despite my slightly dishevelled appearance.\nBy the time I reached the academy dormitories, the sun was beginning to rise properly. Other students would be waking soon to prepare for their first day of classes.\nI made my way quietly to my room, already planning to grab a few hours of rest before the day officially began.",

      "content": "Chapter 47: First Academic Class\nRing Ring!\nI lazily reached out to the alarm and shut it down. I had slept for only about two hours, but it was enough to completely restore my energy, both mentally and physically. My vampire physiology was proving increasingly useful for situations like this.\nAfter taking care of my morning routine and feeding, I made my way to Section A where the lectures would be held.\nHundreds of students moved alongside me through the academy corridors, all heading toward their respective classrooms. I had already checked my name and class assignment, I was placed in the second Elite class, exactly as I had hoped initially.\nKyle was not with me, which meant he had been assigned to the first Elite class as expected.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nI didn’t particularly care about the separation. Whether I was with him or not didn’t really matter for my new goals. I was going to focus on my own strength development and survival plans without worrying about Kyle or his group unless they directly affected my well-being.\nAs I made my way through the bustling corridors, I unexpectedly crossed paths with Victor Castellane.\nThe instructor had a broad smile on his face as he walked through the hallways, radiating contentment.\nA few students across all year groups greeted him as they passed him, clearly he had some influence in the academy.\nOur eyes met briefly as we passed each other. Victor’s expression remained pleasant, though I caught a flicker of interest in his gaze.\nI maintained a respectful but neutral expression and continued toward my classroom, not wanting to draw any unnecessary attention from the mysterious instructor who had replaced Professor Sylvia in Kyle’s examination.\n...\nI arrived at my class a minute before it started. There were about twenty students already seated throughout the room. I spotted an available seat somewhere in the middle near the window and walked toward it, settling down just as the bell chimed.\nI felt several gazes follow my movement, but I paid them no heed. As the heir of the Blackwood family, I was accustomed to attention, though much of it was likely due to the poor reputation the original Adrian had cultivated before I transmigrated into his body.\nThe instructor wasn’t present yet, and I had no particular expectations. In the novel, the teacher of this second Elite class hadn’t been mentioned at all, making them essentially a background character.\nWhen the instructor finally walked in, my eyebrow raised in surprise.\n\"Good morning, everyone.\"\nA soft, feminine voice filled the classroom.\nSylvia Ashworth walked gracefully to her podium, every bit as breathtakingly beautiful as described in the novel. Her flowing white hair caught the morning light streaming through the windows, while her striking blue eyes seemed to captivate everyone who looked into them.\nAlthough after encountering Carmilla, Sylvia’s beauty seemed a few notches lower in comparison. But her appearance wasn’t what concerned me, what made me frown was the realization that Sylvia was supposed to be teaching Kyle’s class, not mine.\nI pondered the implications of this change. If Sylvia was here with us, then who could possibly be instructing Kyle now? This was another significant deviation from the original timeline that could have far-reaching consequences.\nNot that I was afraid of the consequences, but it was important to note and take precautions.\n\"I am Professor Sylvia Ashworth,\" she continued with a warm smile that made several male students sit up straighter. \"I’ll be your personal instructor for this academic year. I know many of you are eager to begin, so let’s start by understanding what separates Elite-class students from the rest.\"\nHer voice carried natural leadership mixed with genuine enthusiasm for teaching. It was easy to see why students in the novel had responded so positively to her instruction. She had a gift for making complex concepts accessible while maintaining the respect necessary for effective classroom management.\nAround me, my classmates were already hanging on her every word, clearly impressed by both her knowledge and beauty.\nSylvia then went on to explain our curriculum, which would revolve around understanding various threats we might face, their weaknesses, and methods we could use to improve our personal strength. She also informed us about optional modules we could participate in, ranging from blacksmithing to alchemy.\nI was particularly interested in both blacksmithing and alchemy, so I decided to put my name down for them. Blacksmithing would help me understand and perhaps one day improve magical items, reducing my reliance on the system while giving me the ability to create or repair equipment as needed. Alchemy could prove invaluable for creating potions and understanding the properties of various materials I might encounter.\nWhen Sylvia collected the sign-up sheets and saw my name on both modules, she looked at me with obvious surprise. Being from a noble family herself, she was undoubtedly aware of the rumours surrounding the original Adrian, his obsessive pursuit of Seraphina Rosewood and his complete lack of interest in training or academic pursuits.\n’Maybe he changed,’\nSylvia thought to herself.\nDespite not showing any outward emotion towards me, I could still detect some disdain in her expression.\nHer opinion of Adrian as someone who only cared about chasing women rather than developing himself was clearly deeply ingrained.\nI felt her judging gaze but chose not to say anything in response. There was no point in trying to defend the original Adrian’s reputation or explain my sudden change in priorities. Actions would speak louder than words, and over time my performance would demonstrate that I was no longer the same person she thought she knew.\nLet her think what she wanted for now. I had more important concerns than managing a professor’s preconceptions about my character.\nThe class continued with Sylvia outlining our weekly schedule and explaining the practical combat assessments we would face throughout the semester. Her teaching style was engaging and thorough, making it clear why she had been so effective as Kyle’s mentor in the original timeline.\nWhatever changes had led to her being assigned to our class instead, I would make the most of having access to her expertise.",

      "content": "Chapter 48: Marcus and Elen\nAnother key change I noticed was the appearance of a character who was meant to be in Kyle’s class according to the original timeline.\nThis character wasn’t part of Kyle’s main group, but his significance to the broader world couldn’t be underestimated.\nSitting near the front of the classroom was the heir of the Ironhold family, one of the four Great Ducal Houses in Luminara. He had long dark brown hair and sharp hazelnut eyes that seemed to assess everything carefully. Even at our young age, he was remarkably built and muscular, standing nearly 1.9 meters tall, an impressive physical presence that made him stand out.\nHouse Ironhold controlled the mountain districts to the north, their territory marked by banners displaying a brown bear rampant on an earthen field. Their Earth Bear bloodline offered tremendous defensive capabilities and unmatched endurance, making them formidable in prolonged conflicts.\nAs far as I could recall from the novel, they never crossed paths with the protagonist significantly and consistently avoided major political troubles. Their family philosophy seemed to be \"steady as stone, strong as mountain\".\nA doctrine of patience and durability over flashy displays of power.\nThey built things to last and avoided unnecessary conflicts. Throughout Luminara, their influence was evident in the city’s infrastructure: the most durable bridges, the strongest defensive walls, and the most reliable public works all bore the subtle marks of Ironhold craftsmanship and engineering expertise.\nHis presence in this class instead of Kyle’s represented another significant deviation from the established timeline.\nI observed him discreetly as Sylvia continued her lecture. He took careful notes of important events, embodying the patient, thorough nature his family was known for. His very presence suggested that the social dynamics of both elite classes would be fundamentally different from what I had expected.\nThis was yet another variable I would need to account for as I navigated this increasingly unpredictable version of the academy storyline.\nA few more students caught my eye, individuals I knew from the novel had good potential and would make valuable allies in the challenges ahead.\nI decided to approach one of them during the brief break Sylvia had given us to review our course materials.\nElen Brightwater sat right ahead of me, her distinctive clear blue hair and eyes were the same striking shade, an unnatural coloration she had gained after awakening her water-element bloodline.\nShe came from a noble family, like most students in this Elite class, though they were positioned at the lower end of the aristocratic hierarchy. Not much had been detailed about the Brightwater family in the novel, but Elen herself had been described as one of the top-performing students who would play a crucial role in defending the city during a major crisis in our second year.\nI stood up and made my way over to her desk, noting how she stiffened slightly as she saw me approach. Her reputation for excellence in theory was well-deserved, based on the neat organization of her notes and the thoughtful questions she’d been asking during Sylvia’s lecture.\n\"Elen,\" I said, keeping my tone casual and friendly. \"I noticed you were taking detailed notes about the practical applications section. Are you planning to sign up for any of the optional modules?\"\nShe looked up at me with hidden wariness, her blue eyes assessing my intentions carefully. \"Adrian,\" she replied with polite but distant formality. \"I... yes, I was considering the alchemy module. I thought It would complement my water abilities well.\"\nI could sense her discomfort immediately. Like other nobles, she was clearly familiar with the original Adrian’s reputation for pursuing females relentlessly.\n\"That’s a smart choice,\" I said, pulling up a nearby chair but maintaining a respectful distance. \"I was thinking about alchemy as well, along with blacksmithing. Practical skills seem more valuable than just theory, don’t you think?\"\nElen’s eyebrows raised slightly in surprise. \"Blacksmithing? That’s... unexpected. I wouldn’t have thought you’d be interested in such hands-on work.\"\n\"Why not?\" I asked.\n\"N-Nothing. It was just a feeling.\"\nI nodded before saying. \"The reason I picked it was similar to yours, I wanted to make my own sword that I felt comfortable and resonated with.\"\nShe studied my face for a moment, clearly trying to determine if this was some elaborate approach disguised as casual conversation. \"I suppose that’s... cool.\"\n\"What made you interested in alchemy specifically?\" I asked, trying to steer this conversation to her.\nElen relaxed slightly, her passion for the subject overriding her previous wariness of me. \"Water manipulation has so many applications beyond just combat. Purification, healing solutions, even enhancement potions - alchemy would let me explore those possibilities properly.\"\n\"That’s fascinating,\" I said, and I meant it. \"I hadn’t considered the purification applications. Would that work on contaminated water sources?\"\n\"Theoretically, yes,\" she said, becoming more animated. \"Though it would depend on the type and level of contamination. Some magical pollutants require very specific counter-agents.\"\n\"You’ve clearly thought this through thoroughly,\" I observed. \"Have you done any preliminary research on the academy’s alchemy facilities?\"\nElen nodded enthusiastically. \"They have one of the most advanced laboratories in the kingdom. Access to rare ingredients, proper safety equipment, even some experimental techniques that aren’t taught elsewhere.\"\n\"Would you... mind if I asked you about the coursework sometimes?\" I asked carefully. \"I’m genuinely interested in learning, but I suspect I’m starting from a much lower knowledge base than most students here.\"\nShe hesitated, still clearly uncertain about my motives. \"I... suppose that would be acceptable. As long as you’re serious about actually learning.\"\n\"I am,\" I assured her. \"Thank you, Elen. I appreciate your willingness to help.\"\nAs I returned to my seat, I caught her watching me with a puzzled expression, as if trying to reconcile this conversation with whatever she’d heard about Adrian’s previous behaviour.\nIt was a start, at least.\nShortly after, Sylvia took control of the classroom and began explaining the academy’s point system.\n\"As members of an Elite class, you will each be given 100,000 points which will serve as your currency within the academy,\" Sylvia announced. \"Each class receives a monthly allocation based on their performance, so maintaining your position in this Elite class should be your priority, if you do bad in your upcoming team based examination, you could very well drop this semester.\"\nJust as she finished speaking, we heard a chime from our student identification cards.ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n[100,000 Points has been credited to your account]",

      "content": "Chapter 49: Point System\nWe all understood the significance of these points. They could be used to purchase items, secret arts, training materials, and various other resources that would enhance our capabilities throughout our academy career.\nI remembered this system well from the novel. It was designed to force students to compete and fight for high rankings, not just individually but as unified classes. There would be numerous class-based activities that required everyone’s participation, and the failure of a single student could drag the entire class down in the rankings.\n\"The class that demonstrates the greatest overall strength by the end of the semester will receive a special prize,\" Sylvia continued. \"To be considered the strongest class, you must excel in all team-based activities as a collective unit. If you struggle in group exercises, don’t be discouraged, there are still individual-based examinations where you can prove your worth and gain prizes, although they don’t carry as much weight as the team activities.\"\nEveryone looked excited by the prospect, and I had to admit I felt some anticipation as well. 100,000 points was a substantial starting amount that opened up many possibilities.\nUnlike the obvious applications of these points, purchasing equipment, basic secret arts, or standard academy resources.\nI had a different use in mind for mine. The academy’s point system was more flexible than most students realized, and there were certain opportunities that could only be accessed through creative application of these credits.\nMy knowledge of future events would allow me to make strategic investments that other students couldn’t even imagine.\n\"Alright everyone, this marks the end of our class. We didn’t go through much this lesson, mostly because it’s your first lesson and we needed to set the basics down and get to know each other. From the next lessons onward, we will be going into more practical teaching which will happen in section G.\nYou can familiarise yourself with the training ground before our next lesson. Does any of you have any questions?\"\nElen raise her hand and sylvia gestured for her to speak.\n\"Instructor Sylvia, when will we start our extra modules? and will failing or passing them get us any punishments or rewards?\"\nThe other students nodded including myself, it was certainly a good question.\n\"Thank you for your question, student Elen. As for the start date, it will most likely start next week, as for the the failing and passing, you would have been told by your module teacher, but since we still have some time before the end of the class, I will answer your question.\"\nThe students nodded gratefully, Sylvia’s easy going demeanour was really refreshing.\n\"Passing the module will earn you points, exceling in the module will earn you even more points which you already know the use of. Furthermore, it will help you rank higher compared to those who don’t take extra modules. As for the ranking, you already know that ranking high is highly encouraged and being in the top 10 would get you benefits such as enhanced rank magical items, or secret arts.\"\nEveryone immediately grasped the benefit of participating in optional modules. Students could use these extra points to gain advantages over fellow classmates with similar combat abilities, and they could compensate for weaknesses in academics or combat performance compared to others of equivalent rank.\n\"Additionally,\" Sylvia continued, \"the academy views module participation as evidence of serious commitment to personal development. This can influence recommendation letters and future opportunities beyond graduation to adventurer guilds.\"\n\"Any other questions before we conclude?\" Sylvia asked, scanning the classroom with those striking blue eyes.\nI looked around and nobody seemed to have any questions.\n\"Well, you are free to go. See you in a few hours.\" Sylvia said, concluding the end of the lesson officially.\nAs everyone started to get up and leave, Elen walked to my table. \"Hey, want to grab some lunch?\"\nIt seemed like Elen had opened up a little to me, since I was the only person she spoke to in the first day, she found it easier to come to me.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nMy smile faded slightly before I returned it.\nThis was where one of the weaknesses of being a vampire showed itself in social interactions. I couldn’t eat normal food without it tasting absolutely revolting. I thought about what excuse I could use, and in the end decided to go with her but act like none of the food appealed to me.\n\"Sure,\" I replied, gathering the study materials I was handed earlier.\nWe made our way to Section F, the academy’s commercial district.\nMany students were already out and about, enthusiastically using their newly acquired points to purchase secret arts, dormitory essentials, and various other items from the academy shops.\nBut I knew they would regret this spending spree soon enough. I remembered this detail well from the novel. Most of them assumed they would receive this generous 100,000 point salary monthly, but reality would prove otherwise. They would only earn substantial points by performing well in team examinations, and most students failed those assessments miserably initially.\nI didn’t bother explaining this to the other students we passed, however. But I did share this insight with Elen as we walked.\n\"You know,\" I said carefully, \"I have a feeling that 100,000 points might not be a monthly guarantee. It seems more likely that future point allocations will depend heavily on our performance in those team examinations Sylvia mentioned.\"\nElen paused mid-step, her blue eyes widening as she processed this possibility. \"That... actually makes a lot of sense. The academy wouldn’t just hand out that much currency regularly without some kind of merit-based system.\"\nShe nodded thoughtfully. \"You’re probably right. I was actually considering spending a good portion of my points on some advanced alchemy texts, but maybe I should be more conservative with my purchases.\"\n\"I think that’s wise,\" I agreed. \"Better to save most of our points until we understand the system better.\"\n\"Thank you for that insight,\" she said with genuine gratitude. \"I would have made a costly mistake otherwise.\"\nAs we walked I felt her initial barrier slightly melt, her impression of me was getting better and that was good.\nWe continued toward the dining area, each having their own thoughts.",

      "content": "Chapter 50: Tier 1 Blacksmith.\nInside the commercial district, there were many restaurants offering various cuisines from across the kingdom. Elen picked a cosy establishment that specialized in regional dishes, and we found a quiet table near the window.\nWhen the server approached to take our orders, I gave my prepared excuse. \"It seems like I’m still feeling a bit off from yesterday’s travel,\" I said, placing a hand on my stomach with a slight grimace. \"I think I’ll just have some water for now. Please, go ahead and order whatever you’d like, Elen.\"\nShe looked at me with mild concern. \"Are you sure? You should probably eat something, even if it’s just light.\"\n\"I’ll be fine,\" I assured her with a dismissive wave. \"I’d rather not risk making myself feel worse. Besides, I’m more interested in hearing about your thoughts on the academy so far.\"\nElen ordered a simple meal while I settled back in my chair with a glass of water, grateful that I’d managed to avoid the awkward situation of having to pretend food tasted good when it would likely make me nauseous.\nI started talking to her about various things inside the academy.\nThis gave us something productive to discuss while she ate, and I could focus on building a friendship without having to remain in awkward silence.\nTime passed pleasantly as we spoke about our observations of the academy’s facilities, and our expectations for the coming semester. Elen proved to be an engaging conversationalist with thoughtful insights about our new environment despite being somewhat of an introvert.\nAs the time for our next class with Sylvia approached, Elen and I left the restaurant and made our way back to Section A. There were still many students walking around, exploring the place they had always dreamed of attending, the institution where they would reside for the next few years.\nOnce I arrived inside the classroom and settled into my seat, I noticed that my daily reward system cooldown had finally ended.\n[Daily Reward Available!]\n[Would You Like To Claim Your Reward?] [Yes | No]\nI mentally selected yes, curious about what today would bring.\n[Congratulations! You have received the knowledge of a Tier 1 Blacksmith.]\nFollow current novᴇls on NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nA Tier 1 blacksmith?\nI thought to myself in bewilderment. The system had never given me pure knowledge before, all previous rewards had been physical items or my bloodline.\nI felt the comprehensive knowledge of a Tier 1 blacksmith suddenly appear in my mind, complete with techniques, material properties, and crafting processes.\nA Tier 1 blacksmith was without doubt the beginning of the true journey in blacksmithing. Tier 1 blacksmiths were capable of creating Mortal-grade items, which was actually quite respectable since it could provide them with an excellent living in this world. Not everyone could achieve Tier 1 status after all.\nTypically within the academy, students would only reach Tier 1 blacksmith level during their second year, and if they were really talented, they would do so usually by the end of the second or third semester of their first year. Of course, these students also usually had prior experience in the field.\nThe current best blacksmith in the kingdom was Tier 4, capable of creating Superior-rank items, which was incredibly valuable. He held the status equivalent to a Royal-rank warrior, the second highest position after the king himself.\nTier 2 blacksmiths were considered prodigies, while Tier 3 were regarded as true masters of their craft.\nHaving this knowledge would give me a significant advantage in the upcoming blacksmithing module, allowing me to focus on practical application of the skill rather than struggling with basic theory like other beginners.\nSylvia entered the classroom and gestured for us to follow her. \"In this lesson, we’ll be moving to Section G for practical training,\" she announced.\nWe made our way to the massive building that housed the academy’s training equipment.\nSylvia led us inside to a section filled with various training dummies and practice equipment. The dummies were clearly built to withstand significant punishment, their surfaces showing some soft scuff marks and battle damage from countless training sessions. Nonetheless, the dummies were highly functional, as there is always constant check ups that take place every day.\n\"Your first lesson will be combat assessment,\" Sylvia explained, positioning herself where she could observe all of us. \"I want each of you to demonstrate your current strongest combat skill. For those with defensive or support abilities, don’t worry, you can show me those at another time. But for now, I want to evaluate your offensive capabilities.\"\nShe gestured toward the training dummies. \"These particular dummies can withstand attacks from Transcendent-rank individuals, so don’t hold back. There are stronger ones available, but those are reserved for more advanced students and they won’t be needed currently.\"\nOne by one, she began calling students forward to demonstrate their abilities.\n\"Elen, you’re first,\" Sylvia called out randomly.\nElen stepped forward confidently, raising her hands as she began channelling her water-based bloodline. She closed her eyes briefly to focus as she gathered moisture, forming it into a large, dense sphere of water that rotated with increasing speed.\nWith a focused expression, she launched the water ball at the training dummy. The attack struck with impressive force, the pressurized water creating a significant impact that would have been devastating against a living opponent.\nSylvia nodded approvingly at the impact. \"Good power and control, Elen. I can see you’ve practiced this technique extensively. However, try varying the density and pressure of your water attacks. A more concentrated, high-pressure stream might penetrate Armor better than a large sphere. Also, consider the strategic applications, water can be used to create slippery surfaces or obscure vision as well as direct damage.\"\nElen absorbed the advice eagerly, her eyes lighting up with understanding. \"Thank you, Professor Sylvia. I will make sure to look into them.\"\n\"Excellent attitude,\" Sylvia replied with a warm smile. \"That kind of openness to learning will serve you well.\"\nSylvia called out the other students one by one and gave them advice and soon it was my turn.\n\"Adrian Blackwood. Please step forward.\"",

The casual conversations died down as my classmates turned their attention toward me with obvious curiosity.\n\"Please perform your strongest strike. Don’t hold back, I want to see your true capabilities,\" Sylvia instructed, her tone professional despite whatever preconceptions she might have held about my character.\nAlthough Sylvia clearly had a poor impression of me based on the original Adrian’s reputation, that didn’t prevent her from doing her job as an educator and genuinely working to help me improve.\nThis was one of the traits that made me respect her as a person in my previous life. She helped all the students she could and made sure they achieved the highest possible achievement.\nI nodded my head in acknowledgment at her words.\nNaturally, I was going to perform a genuinely powerful strike. While I wasn’t planning to reveal my absolute strongest techniques, I decided to significantly surpass Marcus Ironhold and the other students in the class.\nI couldn’t allow my previous reputation as a lovesick simp to continue defining how others saw me. That would be terrible for my new plans inside the academy.\nEven now, I could hear my classmates whispering to each other about how I was likely going to embarrass myself in spectacular fashion.\n\"This should be entertaining,\" one murmured quietly.\n\"I heard he never trained seriously before coming here,\" another noble added with an equally low whisper.\n\"Probably going to swing the sword like he’s chopping wood,\" a third voice chimed in.\nOf course, they were speaking incredibly quietly, and the only reason I could hear them was due to my enhanced vampire senses. Otherwise, their conversations would have been completely inaudible.\nI took a deep breath and selected one of the training swords from the available rack. Students weren’t permitted to use personal magical weapons in the training room, this policy ensured that variables remained controlled and that improvement came from enhanced skill, technique, or personal power rather than superior equipment. It was also for the safety of the equipment in the training room.\nI gripped the standard blade and settled into a proper combat stance, drawing upon both my recent training with my father and the knowledge I gained from the Sky’s Secret Sword Art.\nThe knowledge of the\n{Null Strike}\nform had improved my overall my swordsmanship too. It wasn’t just knowledge of that specific stance, but also positioning, footwork and various other things.\nThen, activating my\n{Blood Control}\ntrait, I accelerated my blood flow, pushing my physical capabilities beyond the normal enhancement provided by my\n{Supernatural Physique}\ntrait.\nThe sensation was incredible and familiar, I felt my power grow exponentially as my enhanced circulation supercharged every muscle fibber in my body.\nFrom the corner of my eye, I caught the look of genuine bewilderment spreading across Sylvia’s face.\nShe was clearly shocked by my sudden power increase. Being a Commander Rank awakener herself, she was naturally extremely sensitive to mana fluctuations and could definitely sense my physical enhancement, though she couldn’t determine the exact mechanism behind it. She most likely assumed it was some kind of temporary buff trait that I possessed.\nThe whispers from my classmates had completely stopped as I prepared to strike.\nI took a single step forward and burst toward the training dummy with explosive speed, closing the distance in a fraction of a second before delivering a devastating sword strike.\nI deliberately avoided activating my\n{Null Strike}\ntechnique, keeping that as a hidden trump card for situations that truly demanded it. Even without revealing one of my most powerful ability, I knew my current attack would overwhelm the majority of the other students in my class, if not all of them.The training sword connected with the dummy’s reinforced surface with a thunderous impact that echoed throughout the entire training hall.\nAfter the strike landed, numbers began appearing on the magical display screen that measured impact force and damage potential.\nThe highest score before my attempt had been 6,000 points, achieved by Marcus Ironhold with his Earth Bear bloodline.\nI stared at the screen as the numbers continued climbing higher and higher before finally settling on a final result.\n[9,242]\nThe moment that number appeared, shocked murmurs erupted from my classmates like an explosion of disbelief.\n\"His attack power... it’s over 9,000!\" one student exclaimed, his voice cracking with amazement.\n\"That’s impossible,\" another whispered, staring at the display as if it might be malfunctioning.\n\"How did Adrian Blackwood, of all people, achieve that kind of power? Even when he dashed towards the dummy, I barely saw a blur.\" a third voice added, clearly struggling to reconcile this demonstration with my previous reputation.\nExpressions of pure shock painted across every face in the room, including Elen’s. Her blue eyes were wide with surprise as she processed what she’d just witnessed.\nMarcus Ironhold, whose previous score I had demolished, was staring at me with a mixture of respect and wariness. His Earth Bear bloodline was renowned for physical power, but he specialized more in defense than offense.\nHe didn’t seem overly concerned about my attack power since tanking was his specialty, but there was definitely newfound respect in his gaze.\nThe aura radiating from my combat state was clearly affecting everyone present. My classmates instinctively took small steps backward, their bodies responding to the killing intent I had unconsciously released during my attack. I immediately retracted it and cursed inwardly.\nThe events from yesterday seemed to have affected me more than I’d realized. I needed to be more careful about controlling my predatory instincts.\nEven students who had been dismissive or mocking moments before were now looking at me with cautious respect. The social dynamics of the classroom had shifted dramatically in the span of a single demonstration.\nSylvia herself appeared to be revaluating everything she thought she knew about my power and potential. Her striking blue eyes studied me with interest and curiosity.",

      "content": "Chapter 52: Emmet Cole\n\"Adrian,\" she said slowly, her voice carrying a note of genuine surprise, \"that was...impressive. Your power enhancement technique is quite remarkable. I haven’t seen anything quite like it before.\"\nShe paused, clearly processing what she’d witnessed a moment earlier. It seemed like the killing intent I had unconsciously released was still fresh in her mind.\n\"Whilst it was really good, I noticed your technique could use slight refinement. The attack was almost flawless for a finishing strike, the only improvement I could current think of would be adding more unpredictability to your attacking position. Another thing to consider is resource management. That level of enhancement must consume considerable energy, so learning to manage your reserves effectively will be crucial for extended fights.\"\nI nodded respectfully, appreciating her analysis.\nAs I walked back to re-join my classmates, I could feel their eyes tracking my every movement.\nMeanwhile, Sylvia’s thoughts were racing as she watched me return to the group.\nThat killing intent... it wasn’t the harmless aura of someone who had only trained against practice dummies. There was genuine lethality in it, the kind that only came from life-or-death combat.\nThe student before me must have killed many beasts to develop that kind of predatory presence.\nHis power output was also far beyond what a typical Elite-rank awakener should be capable of. Even with enhancement techniques, reaching over 9,000 points requires either exceptional bloodline quality or traits.\nAdrian Blackwood... what exactly have you been doing? The rumours do not fit this demonstration at all. Either those reports were wrong, or something fundamental has changed about this young man.\nShe made a mental note to keep a closer eye on Adrian during future training sessions. Students with that level of combat capability and killing intent needed careful observation.\nOnce I returned to my previous position, Elen kept staring at me strangely until I turned toward her and sighed. \"What’s wrong? You keep staring at me, is there something on my face?\"\nShe shook her head immediately. I noticed a faint blush creeping across her cheeks, probably from embarrassment at being caught despite trying to be discreet about her staring.\n\"I-I just... didn’t expect you to be so powerful. That attack of yours was really impressive. You must’ve really trained hard to reach that stage.\"\nI smiled before responding, \"Thanks. Your water attack was powerful too. You should be really proud of it.\"\nElen’s face lit up with a happy smile at my compliment. \"Thank you! I’ve been working on that technique for weeks. But seriously, where did that strength come from? I mean...\" she paused, seeming to struggle with how to phrase her question tactfully.\n\"You mean considering my previous reputation?\" I asked with an understanding chuckle. \"Let’s just say I’ve been doing a lot of private training recently. Sometimes people change when they realize they need to take things more seriously.\"\nShe nodded, accepting my explanation without pressing for more details.\n\"Well, it’s definitely working, keep it up. That score was incredible. You are probably the strongest person in terms of attack power in the class\" Elen said, before I saw her eyes wander to the students that hadn’t tested yet, as if speculating if they could break it.\nAround us, other students were still stealing glances in my direction, clearly trying to process the disconnect between Adrian’s former reputation and what they’d just witnessed. The social dynamics of our class had definitely shifted after that demonstration.\n.....\nA few more students came forward after me, achieving scores around 2,000-4000 points. But after my performance, those numbers seemed considerably less impressive to the watching crowd.\nI casually observed each demonstration until one particular student stepped forward, ready to perform his strike.\nThe person before me was one of the characters I specifically wanted to befriend. After all, he was destined to become a more developed third-rate villain who would eventually die at Kyle’s hands. I felt he was one of the few people with genuine personality depth, he didn’t deserve to die simply because the protagonist had a habit of collecting enemies like trading cards.\nI wasn’t going to let the author’s plot kill such a talented character.\nEmmet Cole possessed a bloodline that allowed him to control fire. His primary weakness was his fiery temper, which would lead him into several conflicts with Kyle that would eventually develop into a deadly hatred between them.\nEmmet had black hair with red streaks running through it like extensions. He was of average height and looks, and nothing particularly stood out at first glance.\nThe temperature around us began to rise noticeably as a fireball started forming in Emmet’s outstretched hand. The sphere of flame grew steadily until it reached the size of a large basketball, crackling with intense heat that made nearby students step back to avoid its radiating heat.\nEmmet drew back his arm and hurled the fireball with explosive force. It struck the training dummy and engulfed it in flames before gradually dissipating, leaving scorch marks across the reinforced surface.\nThe display screen flickered before showing his score.\n[7,903]\n\"Tsk,\" Emmet grunted as he saw the number, his competitive nature clearly frustrated that his score fell significantly short of mine. His jaw clenched as he stared at the display with obvious annoyance.\nOur eyes met across the training area, and I simply gave him a respectful nod. I knew that trying to console him about how impressive his score was, or offering empty platitudes, would only anger him further. The way to reach someone like Emmet was to acknowledge his feelings without belittling his competitive drive.\nHis eyes studied me for a moment before he returned the nod, a grudging respect flickering in his expression.\nSylvia gave Emmet an advice, before announcing the end of the lesson.\n\"Alright everyone. This is the end of today’s session. Your assignment is to train and improve your scores. The next time you perform this attack in class, you’ll need to demonstrate that you’ve worked on the advice I’ve given you. I expect to see an increase of at least 100 points in the scores of those below the top 5. As for the top 5 highest scorers, 50 points will be sufficient.\"\nWith the lesson concluded, everyone was free to leave and do as they pleased. Students began filing out of the training hall, chattering about their performances and planning their practice sessions.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nAs I turned to leave with the rest, Sylvia’s voice entered my ears.\n\"Adrian. Wait, I need to have a word with you.\"\nThe way she said it made the remaining students in earshot pause momentarily, sensing something significant in her request. Elen shot me a questioning look, but I waved her on to indicate she should go ahead without me.\nEmmet Cole and Marcus Ironhold both stared at me for a second longer before leaving.\nAs the training hall emptied, leaving just Sylvia and myself in the vast space, the atmosphere grew noticeably tense. Her striking blue eyes held an intensity I hadn’t seen during the regular lesson.\nI wasn’t sure why she wanted me behind, but knowing her personality it must’ve been something important.\nI remained where I was, waiting for her to speak.",

So, you will receive 50,000 points for holding the new record and an additional 10,000 points for every month you in hold of that record.\"\nRight...I remember Kyle getting the same reward for breaking the record,\nI thought to myself, recalling how the protagonist had achieved this feat in the original timeline.\nI kept my expression neutral despite my satisfaction at the extra reward. \"Thank you, Instructor Sylvia. I appreciate the recognition.\"\nSylvia studied my face carefully, as if searching for something in my reaction. \"That’s quite a substantial reward, Adrian. You should use it carefully, don’t spend it meaninglessly.\"\nIt seems like she’s still somewhat concerned that I might waste it on courting Seraphina,\nI thought with amusement before replying calmly, \"I won’t. The points will certainly be useful for my training and development.\"\nSylvia’s eyes narrowed slightly, as if trying to gauge my true intentions, before she nodded slowly.\n\"Good. You have a lot of potential, Adrian. But remember, there have been many people like you with such potential before. Some were able to become great warriors, benefiting their kingdom and making their families proud, while others...\" She paused, her expression darkening. \"Others lost themselves to temptation and became the most wretched of creatures.\"\nI nodded in understanding, sensing the emotion behind her words.\n\"The previous holder of this record,\" she continued, her voice taking on a more sombre tone, \"was once considered the academy’s brightest star. He had a brilliant mind, exceptional combat abilities and bloodline, beloved by instructors and students alike. He graduated with honours and was expected to serve the kingdom with distinction.\"\nHer blue eyes grew distant. \"Instead, he disappeared shortly after graduation. For years, no one knew what became of him. Then reports began surfacing, whispers of an organization operating against the crown, led by someone whose methods were as brilliant as they were ruthless.\"\nShe was speaking about one of the high ranking members behind the Daybreak organization, the very group that would eventually recruit Kael and orchestrate numerous attacks against the royal family.\n\"Power without purpose becomes destruction, Adrian. Talent without wisdom becomes catastrophe.\" She said whilst giving me an intense stare. \"Your score today exceeded even his first attempt by a decent margin.\"\nThen, I understood. Sylvia wasn’t just offering congratulations, she was issuing a warning. I could see the intent behind her eyes.\n\"I understand, Professor. I won’t let talent corrupt my judgment.\"\nSylvia nodded slowly, though her eyes that remained watchful became softer. \"See that you don’t. The kingdom has already paid too high a price for one gifted student’s fall from grace.\"\nAfter giving me advising me, Sylvia mentioned that she would report my new record and my reward would be issued shortly.\nI thanked her before taking my leave.\nThe place I was heading to was a popular hub for students, essentially an offline forum similar to a guild board with missions, but designed specifically for academy life.\nStudents were able to ask questions, trade items, offer services, and engage in various other exchanges. My reason for going was that I had decided to start selling some of the daily rewards I’d accumulated over the past two weeks that I had no practical use for.\nOne item was an Enhanced-rank spear that served no purpose for me since I specialized in swords. I also had about ten Mortal-grade items of various types that I didn’t need. I wanted to convert them into points while most students didn’t yet fully understand the true value and scarcity of academy points.\nI arrived at the student hub, a bustling area with notice boards covered in colourful postings. Students moved between different sections, some looking for training partners, others seeking specific items or offering their services.\nI wrote up my offer carefully, making sure not to list specific prices but instead using compelling language like \"rare opportunity,\" \"below market value,\" and \"serious inquiries only.\" This was basic sales psychology, not revealing the exact price until potential buyers saw the items face-to-face, this made them more psychologically invested in the transaction, especially if it truly was a good deal.\nIt was a tactic I remembered real estate agents using back on Earth, and it translated well to such a market where demand existed.\nAfter posting my notice on the trading board, and telling the attendant about my mission and giving them the code for my communication crystal. I left to attend to other matters, confident that interested students would seek me out soon enough.Follow current novels on NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nThe students would be able to contact me through the attendant that would connect them with me directly, we would then choose a date and place and meet up.\nIt was the only effective way of communication, the students couldn’t simply walk up to my dormitory or lesson. They didn’t know when I would be there or not.\nThinking about this issue, I wished that mobile phones would have existed in this world. It would be really cool to have.\nIt wasn’t that this world wasn’t advanced, it was advanced in other things. They even had skyscrapers, it was just that their advancement was in magic, not technology.\nAs I walked, I thought about the possibility of introducing technology to this world. Although I didn’t know how mobile phones were made exactly, I had watched some videos on the topic, and believed that with enough magic and some materials, I would be able to create a prototype alongside some intelligent minds.\nI didn’t need to be the one doing everything, I had some of the knowledge, others would be able to do it for me.\nThe possibilities were truly endless. Another world’s memories were something not even the protagonist had, only I had it and I wanted to make sure to fully utilise it to gain as many advantages as I possibly could.\nWhilst my family had been very supportive of me, giving me a lot of golden coins as pocket money, gifts and various other things that young masters from different families had. Still, I wanted to have my own thing going on. I didn’t want to rely on them forever.",

I immediately lowered the volume by reducing my mana input and spoke urgently.\n\"Don’t do anything. Make sure no child leaves that place. I’m coming over now!\"\n\"O-Okay,\" she stammered. I could feel her shock and terror even through the crystal’s connection.\nI pocketed the communication device and immediately made my way toward the orphanage. My mind raced as I cursed my terrible timing. I had been planning to visit the orphanage today anyway, intending to retrieve Kael before things escalated beyond control.\nThe changes to the story had forced me to alter my original plan of using him to infiltrate the Daybreak organization. Instead, I had decided to take responsibility for Kael myself, guiding his development into the formidable power he was destined to become while keeping him away from the villainous path.\nBut it seemed like I was late.\nThe fact that Kael had killed one of the orphanage children meant his bloodline had most likely awakened. Without that catalyst, I doubted he would have been capable of such violence, despite his accumulated resentment.\nI took the nearest carriage and my way towards the slum district that was quite far.\nAn hour or so had passed, and I reached the outskirts of the slum district. I paid the driver of the carriage before leaving and making my way in. The living conditions remained as appalling as ever, cracked streets, broken streetlights, and the persistent stench of poverty and neglect.\nI paid those details no attention and made my way directly to the orphanage. Fortunately, it appeared that news of the incident hadn’t spread beyond the building’s walls yet.\nInside the orphanage, I could hear the terrified crying of other children echoing through the corridors. Their voices carried fragments of panicked shouting:\n\"Monster!\"\n\"He killed Tommy!\"\n\"His eyes were glowing like ice!\"\n\"The demon finally showed his true nature! Tommy was always right, Aunt Martha should’ve listened to him.\"\nThe situation was spiralling toward complete chaos. If word of this incident reached the authorities before I could contain it, Kael would be arrested or worse. The entire timeline would collapse into something completely unpredictable and unfavourable.\nI needed to act fast before this high-stakes situation exploded beyond my ability to control.\n...\nI went inside and looked around the area. The only thing I could see was terrified children crying and clinging to each other. I couldn’t find Kael or the deceased child named Tommy anywhere in the courtyard that led to the living room, or the living room itself.\n\"Where is he?\" I asked with a cold tone.\nMartha stammered, clearly confused whether I meant Kael or Tommy. \"W-Who? Kael or Tommy?\"\n\"Kael, obviously!\"\nWhy the hell would I care about Tommy? That child was already dead, I needed to worry about the ticking time bomb that was Kael.\n\"I-I don’t know...I couldn’t stop him. He stood over Tommy’s body for a few minutes before leaving nearly an hour ago,\" she said, her voice shaking.\nI frowned deeply. \"Where is the body?\"\n\"I-In their dormitory room.\"\nI walked toward the area where the children usually slept and pushed open the door. Inside, I found Tommy’s small body lying motionless on the floor. An icicle protruded from his chest - the poor child had been unlucky enough to be struck in a vital area.\nKael wouldn’t be in tune with his newly awakened bloodline enough to aim precisely at the heart.\nBlood had seeped across the wooden floor around Tommy’s body. I closed the child’s terrified eyes while gritting my teeth in frustration. To say I didn’t blame myself for this death would be a lie. But there was no time to mourn this child’s demise - I needed to find Kael before this situation spiralled further out of control.\nI searched the room until I spotted a dark stain on the wall away from Tommy’s body.\nI approached the bloodstain and activated my\n{Blood Control}\ntrait. The blood separated from the wall’s surface, it was a substantial amount, around five mL. The blood seemed different from Tommy’s, and I found myself wanting to taste it, which confirmed it belonged to Kael.\nI consumed the blood sample and immediately activated my\n{Blood Trail}\ntrait.\nMy head snapped toward the south as the tracking ability locked onto Kael’s location.\nShit. He’s heading towards the forest.\nTime to end this before it got worse.\nI quickly held the kid’s body in my arms and made my way out of the room, the kids that saw tommy’s body held in my arms started crying even more.\n\"Relax, he’s not dead. He’s still alive, i’m going to take him to the hopsital now. He needs immediate treatment.\" I said to the children, whilst looking at Martha sternly.\nThe look on her face meant that she herself wasn’t convinced, immediately she nodded her head and said. \"See? He is still alive.\"\nThe kids weren’t stupid, they immediately started to cry even more, the older children saying. \"You can’t lie to us! We aren’t kids anymore! Y-You are just trying to hide the fact that he died from us.\" The kid wept between words, and i didn’t have time to babysit but it was important to convince them before leaving, lest things went out of control and one of them escaped.\nI controlled the blood flow of the kid in my arms and led them towards his throat. The kid’s body instinctively made a gurgling sound because of nerves that were still alive.\nMartha and the students looked visible shocked, every kid stopped crying as they stared at the scene in disbelief.\nSigning in relief inwardly, I took the chance to get out, I had to catch up to Kael. \"I don’t have time, I have to go. Now!\" I said and rushed out of the orphanage.\nThe kids now believing that Tommy was alive, immediately rushed after me but Martha luckily held them off.\n\"What do you think you are doing! Get back here, now!\" She shouted with all the power she could muster and the kids froze.\nHer voice scared them all.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nWithout question, they all returned back to the living room. In the courtyard, I stored tommy’s body in my storage ring after checking that there was no kid looking and left the area.",

      "content": "Chapter 55: Catching the Winter Beast\nI left the courtyard and darted out. There were slum kids and men throughout the area who looked at me with strange gazes, some of these men even had clearly malicious intent, obviously wanting to rob what appeared to be a well-dressed noble.\nBefore I could get into a useless, time-wasting fight with them, I increased my speed dramatically and became a blur streaking through the narrow streets.\nImmediately, those with ill intentions backed away in fear and gulped audibly, clearly recognizing that they would have committed the worst mistake of their lives if they had approached me.\nI continued making my way toward the forest at a higher speed.\nWithin about five minutes of pursuit, I felt like I was in Kael’s vicinity. During my journey, I had tried to think of ways I could use to approach him safely.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nI couldn’t reveal that I knew him from the orphanage, that would immediately put him on guard and potentially trigger a violent defensive response. I needed a plausible way to introduce myself that wouldn’t seem threatening to a traumatized child who had just awakened dangerous powers.\nThe approach would be crucial. Kael was likely in a highly unstable emotional state, probably terrified of what he’d done and expecting punishment or rejection from anyone who discovered his actions. If I handled this wrong, he might attack me or flee deeper into dangerous territory.\nI slowed my pace as I drew closer to his location, at the current difference of power between us, I didn’t even need to use my silent predator aspect to mask my presence from Kael. I needed to observe his current state before deciding how to make contact.\nThrough the trees ahead, I could sense his general direction\nI spent a few minutes searching the vicinity, since my skill didn’t allow me to pinpoint his exact location. I hoped the trait would improve to provide more precise location data at higher levels, but for now it was sufficient, since my target was a kid that has barely awakened.\nFinally, I found him.\nKael was sitting inside a large tree that had a hollow cavity big enough to shelter a small person. He looked incredibly frustrated and devastated about what had transpired.\nI could hear him muttering various things to himself in a broken voice.\n\"It’s their fault... T-They forced me to do it. He beat me until I was almost dead... I’m not a monster, they are,\" Kael whispered, his voice cracking with emotion.\n\"M-My life is ruined... I can’t return to the city anymore. Martha has probably reported me already...\"\nI watched him with an unconsciously soft expression. His situation was truly a heart-breaking sight to behold. I found myself blaming my own inaction for allowing the situation to deteriorate to this point. I could have certainly intervened when I first visited the orphanage weeks ago.\nHis silver hair was dishevelled and dirty, his small frame hunched over in the hollow tree trunk. Despite his newly awakened powers, he looked like exactly what he was - a scared, traumatized teenager who had lashed out in desperation and now faced the terrible consequences of that moment.\nThe weight of what he’d done was clearly crushing him. This was the pivotal moment that would determine whether he became the vengeful Winter Beast of the original timeline, or something entirely different.\nI needed to approach this very carefully. One wrong word could push him further down the dark path, while the right approach might save both Kael and countless future victims whilst also benefitting him. I watched him from a concealed position for nearly an hour, considering multiple approaches but finding none that would create the powerful, meaningful first impression I wanted.\nThen I heard a soft grumbling sound from the north, it was barely audible, but my senses picked it up clearly.\nA koala-like beast emerged. Its claws gleamed wickedly sharp, though the creature was only Noble rank with a Common-grade bloodline. If Kael had developed any real control over his newly awakened ice powers, he should be able to handle it easily, especially considering his bloodline was rumoured to be Legendary rank like Seraphina’s.\nI held back, ready to intervene if necessary but curious to see how this would unfold.\nKael spotted the approaching beast and immediately stood up, his cold eyes betraying the trembling in his hands. This was clearly his first encounter with a magical creature, and I could see the mixture of rage, fear, and desperation building within him, demanding release.\nHe activated his ice manipulation trait, forming an icicle identical to the one that had killed Tommy. The projectile materialized with jagged, uneven edges, a clear sign of his inexperience and lack of control.\nKael launched the ice spear toward the koala, but his aim was completely off. The icicle sailed wide, striking a tree trunk several feet away from his target.\nThis confirmed my suspicion that Tommy’s death had been accidental rather than deliberate. Kael’s control over his abilities was so poor that he couldn’t hit a slow-moving target at close range. The fatal strike at the orphanage had been a tragic result of uncontrolled power rather than murderous intent.\nThe koala, now aware of the threat that Kael possessed, began advancing more aggressively towards him.\nKael’s eyes widened in terror as the beast charged at him. He immediately stumbled backward and formed another icicle, hurling it desperately at the approaching creature. The koala easily dodged the poorly aimed projectile.\nPanic started to set in his currently fragile mind. Kael formed yet another ice spear, but the koala had closed the distance significantly. His third attempt finally connected, though it struck the beast’s shoulder rather than any vital area, hardly a debilitating blow.\nStill, despite being none threatening, it had hurt the koala which groaned in pain and irritation.\nThe koala started clawing at the embedded ice fragment. Blood began flowing from the wound as it worked to dislodge the projectile. During this brief respite, Kael had gained some distance by running frantically through the trees.\nI repositioned myself as well, following their movement while getting closer to the action. The koala, now wounded and thoroughly enraged, resumed its pursuit with more aggression.",

      "content": "Chapter 56: Adoption [1]\nKael was clearly exhausting himself from repeatedly forming ice attacks that barely hit. His inexperience showed in how wastefully he was expending his mana reserves.\nAt this rate, he would be completely drained before he could land a decisive blow.\nThɪs Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nThe reason I thought that was because as a new awakener, he had no control over his mana, lots of would be wasted during the formation and release of those icicles.\nThe wounded koala was gaining ground, its natural forest mobility giving it an advantage over the stumbling Kael.\nI moved closer, preparing to intervene in case anything happened.\nKael, sensing the escalating danger, desperately formed two more icicles. He threw one toward the approaching koala while gripping the other like a dagger, though his stance was completely amateurish.\nI could see he had no confidence in his abilities whatsoever.\nThe thrown icicle missed its mark as the koala dodged it. Kael’s attacks weren’t only inaccurate, but they were very predictable.\nThis time the beast closed the remaining distance rapidly. Kael’s face visibly drained of colour as he realized his desperate situation.\nThe koala struck with its razor-sharp claws. Kael attempted to defend himself with his remaining icicle, and while the ice weapon held firm against the initial impact, his body couldn’t withstand the force. He was sent flying backward, crashing hard into a tree trunk.\nHis head struck first with a sickening thud. I watched as his consciousness began to waver, his eyes growing hazy and unfocused. Blood trickled from where his skull had connected with the bark. His thoughts were clearly becoming scattered and incoherent from the head trauma.\nThe koala, emboldened by its successful attack, began stalking toward the dazed Kael for what would likely be a killing blow.\nThis is it.\nIn one fluid motion, I launched myself from my position on the try and landed directly between the koala and Kael just as the beast prepared to strike the defenceless boy.\nThe koala skidded to a halt, suddenly confronted by this new threat that had appeared from nowhere. Its small eyes darted between me and its original prey, trying to assess this unexpected development.\n\"Stay back,\" I commanded, with cold eyes and a tone that made the beast hesitate momentarily.\nBehind me, I could hear Kael’s laboured breathing and confused mumbling as he struggled to process what was happening through his concussion. His ice powers had completely destabilized, small frost patterns appearing and disappearing randomly around his trembling hands.\nThe koala, after a moment’s consideration, decided to still attack. It bared its teeth and prepared to attack this interloper who had dared interfere with its hunt.\nI drew my sword in a single smooth motion, the blade catching what little sunlight filtered through the forest canopy.\n\"Wrong choice,\" I said quietly.\nThe beast lunged forward with surprising speed, its claws extended to tear through whatever stood in its path. But it was facing an Elite-rank awakener that had killed a transcendent beast before.\nI sidestepped the sluggish attack with minimal effort. My counterattack was swift, a single cut across its throat that ended the threat permanently.\nThe koala collapsed with barely a sound, its life ending before it hit the forest floor.\nI turned toward Kael, only to find him unconscious. His breathing was shallow and irregular, and blood continued trickling from the head wound where he’d struck the tree.\nI quickly assessed his condition. The bleeding needed to be stopped immediately, and there were likely signs of concussion that required attention.\nActivating my Blood Control trait, I carefully manipulated his circulation to halt the bleeding from his scalp wound. Then I guided his blood flow to promote healing in the damaged tissue, encouraging his body’s natural recovery processes.\nThe technique was delicate work, too much manipulation could cause more harm than good, but the controlled enhancement of circulation would help reduce swelling and accelerate the healing of minor injuries.\nOnce I was satisfied that his condition had stabilized, I carefully lifted Kael’s small form into my arms. He was lighter than I’d expected, clearly malnourished from his time at the orphanage.\nI began walking back toward the city. Although my original plan had been to use Kael as a gateway to Dawn Break, I was satisfied that I had now officially taken him under my protection.\nI couldn’t simply return him to the orphanage after what had happened with Tommy, but I also couldn’t reveal my true connection to those events.\nAs I passed the city guards at the gate, they nodded respectfully at me before stopping to ask a few routine questions about the unconscious boy in my arms.\n\"Young Master Blackwood, what happened to the child?\" one guard inquired.\nI didn’t bother telling them that the person in my hands wasn’t actually a child, but a malnourished teen, almost the same age as me.\n\"I found him injured in the forest, apparently attacked by a magical beast. He needs medical attention,\" I replied calmly.\nAfter my brief explanation, they let me pass without pursuing the matter further. Their questions weren’t born from genuine concern but from following standard procedures, and my answers were sufficient to satisfy their requirements.\nThey had asked me whether I wanted to take care of the child myself or not. My answer was the former, I wasn’t going to let them take the Winter Beast from my hands.\nSoon I arrived at the Blackwood estate. I couldn’t bring Kael to the academy dormitories, that would raise too many questions and complications now.\nI handed Kael to the guards stationed outside the manor. They looked concerned at the sight of what appeared to be an injured child.\n\"What happened, Young Master?\" one asked with obvious worry.\n\"Take care of him well, and inform me immediately when he wakes up,\" I instructed without revealing too much detail. The guards had no business knowing about what had happened to him, and it was of no use for them.\nThe guard nodded and carefully took Kael from my arms, understanding that his young master expected competent care without unnecessary questions.\nSince I was already at the estate, I decided to visit my parents. There were several matters I needed to address with them regarding Kael.\nI made my way toward the main house, preparing to face whatever questions they might have about my unexpected arrival and the injured person I’d brought home.",

You have to be punctual at the academy, what if you... wait, your power...\"\nMy mother was by no means weak - she was Transcendent rank, so she could easily sense that I had solidified my position at Elite rank.\nI chuckled softly at the barrage of questions and concerns before saying, \"You fired off multiple questions at once, Mother. Which one would you like me to answer first?\"\nBefore she could respond, I heard my father’s footsteps coming down the stairs. He had sensed my arrival as well.\nHe greeted me warmly before commenting on my stabilized Elite rank status. I nodded and explained that I’d had a fortuitus encounter in the forest while hunting that had pushed my abilities to solidify at this level.\nMy father looked pleased but cautioned me to be more careful in the future. I assured him he didn’t need to worry.\nWe settled into the living room, and my father’s expression grew more serious as he addressed the matter I knew was coming.\n\"The guards informed me about an unconscious boy you brought back,\" he said, his tone measured but clearly expecting a full explanation. \"They said he appeared to be injured and malnourished. What exactly happened out there, Adrian?\"\nI had prepared for this question during my walk back to the estate.\n\"I found him in the forest, seemingly attacked by a beast. He was unconscious and bleeding from a head wound. I couldn’t just leave a child to die in the wilderness.\"\nMy mother’s expression softened with concern. \"The poor thing. Is he badly hurt?\"\n\"He should recover with proper care,\" I said. \"Though he’ll need time and attention. He appears to have been living rough for some time.\"\nMy father nodded his head. He didn’t seem to have any issue with me taking responsibility over Kael.\n\"Alright. We will take care of him until he wakes up. Then we’ll need to determine what’s best for him.\"\nAfter my dad finished speaking, my communication crystal began ringing. I excused my self before answering it.\n\"Young Master,\" came the voice of one of our estate healers, \"the boy you brought in has awakened. His wounds have been treated and he appears to be in stable condition, though he seems quite distressed and confused about his surroundings.\"\n\"I see,\" I replied. \"How is his overall condition?\"\n\"The head injury has healed completely. He’s physically well, but he appears frightened and won’t speak to any of us. He keeps asking where he is and looking around as if expecting danger.\"\nMy parents exchanged glances, clearly picking up on the conversation despite only hearing my side.\n\"I’ll be there shortly,\" I said, ending the communication.\nMy father raised an eyebrow. \"The boy is awake already?\"\nI nodded my head before standing up. \"He must be tougher than he appeared, I should go see him. He’ll probably be more comfortable seeing a familiar face.\"\nMy mother looked concerned. \"The poor child must be terrified waking up in a strange place. Be gentle with him, Adrian.\"\n\"Of course, Mother,\" I replied, making my way toward the room where Kael was being cared for.Follow current novᴇls on ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nArriving at the room where Kael was temporarily residing, I knocked on the door three times. Kael answered shortly after with a cautious tone.\n\"Come in.\"\nInside, Kael was still in bed, covered by a white blanket. The room was one of our guest chambers, it was really well-appointed but not overly luxurious like our main rooms, with warm lighting and comfortable furnishings.\nWalking inside, I took a seat in the chair beside his bed.\nSeeing Kael looking visibly tense, I offered a warm smile. Despite being roughly my age, the effects of malnutrition were clearly evident in his smaller, more fragile frame.\n\"How are you feeling?\" I asked calmly.\n\"I’m alright, thank you,\" Kael replied, though his voice carried underlying uncertainty.\n\"May I ask... where am I?\" His silver eyes met mine directly, and I could see his shoulders remained rigid with tension.\n\"You are currently residing in the house of the Blackwood’s,\" I explained calmly. \"I was training in the forest when I found you injured in the forest. Then, I brought you here for treatment. Our healers have taken care of your wounds.\"\nKael’s eyes widened slightly at the mention of the noble family name. Even orphans knew of the four Great Ducal Houses.\n\"The Blackwood...\" he repeated quietly, processing this information. \"Why would you help me? I’m nobody important.\"\nHis tone carried years of being told he was unwanted, that his existence was a burden. The pain in those few words revealed just how deeply the orphanage’s treatment had affected him.\n\"Everyone deserves help when they’re hurt. You don’t need to be ’important’ for your life to have value.\"\n\"What’s your name? Also, do you have family that I can take you to?\" I asked, despite knowing the answer would be no. I couldn’t reveal that I already knew details about his background.\nI could still see the wariness in his silver eyes as he studied my face, trying to determine my true intentions.\nKael shook his head slowly. \"My name is Kael. As for the second question...I don’t have anyone left in this world. My family died during a beast attack years ago.\"\nKael’s voice had a flat tone, as if he had accepted this painful reality long ago. There was no self-pity in his words, just a truthful statement that revealed the depth of his isolation.\n\"I see. In that case, would you like to stay here? At least until you decide what you want to do next.\" I said gently.\nKael’s eyes widened with surprise and suspicion. \"Stay here? In a duke’s house? Why would you offer that to someone like me?\" His hands moved uncomfortably under the blanket.\nThe question revealed his deep-seated belief that he was unworthy of kindness or consideration. Years of being called a cursed demon child had clearly taken their toll on his self-perception.\n\"Because you need somewhere safe to recover, whilst you are well now, you might still be injured and because fate has brought us together. Since I brought you here, I will naturally make sure you are well before leaving. I don’t like to start things without finishing them, that’s how I am.\" I said, with a soft but firm tone.\nKael stared at me for a long moment, clearly trying to process this unexpected offer. One of his hands gripped the blanket tightly whilst the other remained hidden under.\nI could see him wrestling with conflicting internal emotions. After a few seconds of contemplation, Kael quietly said. \"I... I don’t have anything to offer in return, I can’t pay you back for this kindness.\"\n\"I’m not asking you to, sometimes people help others simply because it’s the right thing to do.\"\nHe remained silent for several more seconds, his internal struggle visible on his face. The orphanage had taught him that everything came with a price, that kindness was always conditional.\nFinally, he nodded slowly. \"If... if you’re certain it won’t be a burden, I would be grateful to stay. At least until I can figure out what to do.\"\nHis acceptance was cautious and hesitant, but it was acceptance nonetheless. The first step in steering him away from the dark future that had awaited him was complete.",

      "content": "Chapter 58: Adoption [3]\nAfter talking to Kael for a while, I decided it was time for me to leave and return to the academy. Kael was now secured within the estate, and it would be extremely difficult for him to leave willingly, especially with what I have in preparation for him.\n\"Alright. I’ll let you rest for now. I’ll send someone to show you around the estate so you can become familiar with your new surroundings.\"\nKael nodded quietly, still processing everything that had happened.\nI moved toward the door, gripping the handle before stopping abruptly. Without turning around, I spoke in a calm but pointed tone.\n\"One more thing, Kael. I expect you to dismiss that icicle you’re hiding behind the blanket before your guide arrives.\"\nThe temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees as Kael’s eyes dilated in shock. His breathing became shallow and rapid. He was clearly stunned that I had detected his concealed weapon despite his efforts to hide it under the blanket.\n\"How did you...I’m sorry.\" he began, his voice barely a whisper.\nI turned to face him slowly, my expression remaining neutral but my eyes holding an intensity that hadn’t been there moments before. \"If I wanted to hurt you, that icicle wouldn’t be able to stop me.\"\nTo demonstrate my point, I activated my Blood Control trait. Kael’s eyes widened in terror as he felt his body reject his control. His hidden icicle immediately lost cohesion and melted as his concentration shattered under the sudden weakness that overwhelmed his body.\nThe sensation lasted only a split second, but it was enough to convey the vast difference in our power levels. When I released the effect, Kael gasped, his face pale with the realization of how helpless he had just been.\nI smiled at him gently, my expression warm and reassuring rather than intimidating. \"I’m not showing you this to frighten you, Kael. I want you to understand that you’re safe here. You don’t need to hide weapons or prepare to defend yourself.\"\nKael stared at me, his silver eyes understanding. The demonstration hadn’t been meant to terrify him, but to show him that his defensive instincts, while understandable given his past, were unnecessary here.\n\"You’ve probably lived in a world where kindness came with conditions, where you had to always be ready to protect yourself. But that’s not the case anymore. Trust takes time to build, and I don’t expect it immediately. Rest well.\"\nI left the room, closing the door softly behind me.\n***\nI approached one of the senior guards stationed near the guest quarters and gestured for him to step aside for a private conversation. The guard was an awakener at the peak of the elite rank, approaching transcendent rank.\n\"I need you to handle something important. The boy I brought back, his name is Kael. I want you to show him around the estate today, help him become familiar with the grounds and facilities.\"\nThe guard nodded attentively. \"Of course, Young Master. Anything specific you’d like me to focus on?\"ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n\"Treat him with respect and make him feel welcome. He’s been through difficult circumstances, so be patient if he seems withdrawn or suspicious. Also, invite him to observe the morning training session with the other guards. If he shows interest in participating, that’s fine, but don’t pressure him if he declines.\"\nThe guard’s expression showed understanding of the situation. \"I understand, Young Master. We’ll make sure he feels comfortable and safe.\"\n\"He’s under my personal protection now,\" I added, making sure my instructions were clear. \"Anyone who treats him poorly will answer to me directly.\"\n\"Understood completely, sir. The staff will be informed of his status.\"\nI patted the guard on his shoulder in appreciation. \"I’m counting on you to handle this well.\"\nAfter ensuring Kael would be properly cared for, I made my way back to the main estate building to see my dad.\n***\nI found him in his study, reviewing documents by lamplight. The room smelled of leather-bound books and the faint aroma of the tea he preferred for evening reading.\n\"Father,\" I said, knocking gently on the doorframe. \"Do you have a moment? I’d like to discuss the boy I brought back in more detail.\"\nHe looked up from his papers, his expression curious but patient. \"Of course, Adrian. Come in and sit down.\nI entered the study and took the chair across from his desk, preparing to explain what I had discovered during my conversation with Kael.\n\"Father, there are some important things you should know about the boy,\" I began carefully. \"First, he’s not actually a child. He’s roughly my age, but severe malnutrition has caused significant stunted growth.\"\nMy father’s eyebrows raised, but he remained silent, waiting for me to continue.\n\"More importantly,\" I said, watching his expression closely, \"he’s awakened a bloodline. Based on what I observed, it appears to be either Rare or Legendary rank.\"\nMy father’s reaction was expected. He shot up from his chair, his hands slamming down on the desk as his face filled with shock.\n\"You said what!\" he exclaimed, his voice carrying a mixture of disbelief and alarm.\nThe implications of bringing someone with a rare or possibly a legendary bloodline hit him instantly. A Legendary bloodline awakener was incredibly rare, perhaps one in millions. The only person to awaken such a bloodline was Seraphina in recent time, other than that only the king had such a bloodline. Most ducal families inherited Rare bloodlines and that represented extraordinary potential and political significance.\n\"Are you absolutely certain about this assessment?\" he demanded, leaning forward intently. \"A Legendary bloodline... Adrian, do you understand what this means for our family?\"\nHis mind was clearly racing. Harbouring someone with such potential could either be seen as an incredible opportunity or a dangerous threat, depending on whether other noble families found out.\nI had expected this reaction from him, hence why I wanted him to understand that Kael’s bloodline should remain hidden.\n\"...Sigh. We need to be careful, this kid you brought is a double-edged sword.\"\nWith a smile on my face, I said. \"Not if we...\"",

His bloodline is related to manipulation of Ice.\nWe can train him as a normal guard in front of everyone, while you handle his bloodline development privately when you’re available.\"\nMy father contemplated this for several moments before asking, \"You’re planning to keep him here for some time, aren’t you?\"\nI nodded my head before saying. \"I considered asking you to adopt him, but I know that would be difficult and attract unwanted attention. Therefore, Kael won’t stay here long, Father. I plan for him to accompany me to the academy.\"\nMy father raised an eyebrow skeptically. \"Adrian, the academy has officially closed enrollment. No new students are to be accepted regardless of their potential.\"\nA playful smile played across my face. \"Who said he’s joining as a student?\"\nMy father’s eyes widened with understanding. \"You mean...\"\n\"Yes. He’ll be joining as my personal servant. But before that arrangement, I want him to develop better control over his abilities and emotional state. Father, can you help me with this?\"\nMy father leaned back in his chair, clearly impressed despite himself. The plan addressed multiple concerns simultaneously: it provided Kael with protection and training, gave our family access to a potentially powerful ally, avoided the political complications of formal adoption, and circumvented academy enrollment restrictions through a legitimate loophole.\n\"A servant position would allow him access to academy facilities and training while maintaining a low profile,\" he mused aloud.\n\"No one questions the background of noble attendants too closely. As long as he is lowkey, everything would work perfectly.\"\nI remained silent, allowing my father to work through the plan himself.\n\"This period of training here also gives me time to properly assess his character and development before making any long-term commitments,\" he continued thoughtfully. \"If he proves trustworthy and capable, there are future opportunities. If not...\"\n\"If not, he remains a well-trained guard with useful abilities,\" I finished.\nMy father studied my face carefully. \"You’ve thought this through quite thoroughly, haven’t you?\"​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\"Just a little,\" I replied modestly.\nMy father looked me in the eyes for a moment before leaning back in his seat with obvious relief.\n\"Haha... well done, son. You’re really making me proud. It seems like you’ve finally gotten your head straight. To think that you’ve only been at the academy for two days, yet you already identified such a loophole... you really are something.\"\nHe paused, his expression softening. \"I wonder how Elena will react when she hears about this. She’s been constantly worrying about you, whether you’re feeling lonely, eating properly... you know, basic motherly instincts.\"\nMy mother’s concerns were not to be understated, whilst I’ve changed over the past two weeks from the original Adrian and his ways. The possibility of returning to being lazy still remained in Elena’s head.\nOf course the possibility was actually null since I wasn’t the original Adrian.\nShe had probably spent sleepless nights wondering if her son would manage to function independently at the academy, given his previous track record of poor decision-making and obsessive behaviour.\n\"She doesn’t need to worry anymore, I’m managing fine at the academy. In fact, you can tell her that her son has officially broken the record for the strongest attack recorded in a first lesson.\"\nMy father’s face transformed with heart felt shock and pride. His mouth opened slightly as he processed what I’d just said.\n\"You... you broke the academy record? Adrian, that’s...\" He struggled to find words, clearly overwhelmed by the news. \"The previous record holder was...\"\n\"I know who held it before. Professor Sylvia made sure to emphasize the significance.\"\nMy father’s expression grew serious for a moment, understanding the weight of that comparison, before breaking into a wide grin. He crossed the room in quick strides and pulled me into a firm embrace.\n\"That’s my son. I knew you had potential, you just needed to get your head straight. This news... Elena needs to hear this immediately.\"\nHe released me and quickly grabbed his communication crystal, channeling mana into it. \"Elena, come to my study right now. You need to hear something about Adrian.\"\nWithin seconds, hurried footsteps echoed through the corridors. The door burst open and my mother rushed in, her face filled with worry.\n\"What happened? Is he hurt!?\" she asked breathlessly, her mother instincts in full panic mode.\nBefore my father could speak, she spotted me and immediately enveloped me in a crushing hug against her chest, nearly lifting me off the ground despite my enhanced physique.\n\"Oh sweetheart, you’re safe! When Marcus called me like that, I thought something terrible had happened!\"\n\"Elena...Adrian broke the academy’s attack record for new students.\"\nShe released me slightly, holding me at arm’s length to look at my face. \"He did what?\"ᴛhis ᴜpdated by N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n\"The strongest recorded attack by any student in their first combat demonstration. Our son is officially the most promising first-year student the academy has ever seen.\"\nMy mother’s eyes filled with tears as she pulled me back into another fierce hug. \"I’m so proud of you, Adrian. So incredibly proud.\"​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nI smiled through the endless stream of hugs and compliments from my parents. Then, I stayed with them for a while as they peppered me with questions about friends I’d made, connections I’d established, and various other aspects of academy life.\nSensing that their questions had no end and they were completely immersed in their parental pride, I coughed politely before saying, \"Mother, Father, I need to get back to the academy. I should get some sleep since it’s getting late.\"\n\"Oh! You’re absolutely right, honey. I’m so sorry,\" my mother immediately panicked, worried that she might negatively impact my academy performance by keeping me up late by her barrage of questions.\nI laughed off her concern. \"Don’t worry about it.\"\nBefore bidding them farewell, I addressed a practical matter.\n\"Father, would it be possible for one of our carriages to remain with me at the academy? It would make travel more efficient, especially for situations like today.\"\nMy father nodded without hesitation. \"Of course. I’ll instruct your driver to stay stationed near the academy grounds. You don’t need to worry about any of the arrangements, I’ll sort everything out.\"\n\"Thank you, Father. That will be very helpful.\"",

There were still some hours left before my next reward became available.\nOn my way through the academy corridors, students from various years looked at me and whispered among themselves.\n\"Look, it’s Adrian Blackwood, he is one of the most promising students among the first years,\" one second-year student said to his companion.\n\"I can’t believe he broke the record only for it to be shattered the very next lesson,\" another replied with obvious sympathy.\n\"That’s so unfortunate,\" a third voice chimed in. \"He didn’t even have time to celebrate his achievement.\"\n\"I heard the new record holder nearly scored 10,000 points,\" someone else added with a mixture of awe and envy.\n\"Man, I’d be devastated if that happened to me. Finally accomplishing something amazing only to have it overshadowed immediately.\"\nSome students looked at me with pity, others with curiosity about how I was handling the situation. A few seemed almost smug, enjoying the drama of watching someone’s moment of glory get eclipsed so quickly.\nI wasn’t worried about their reactions. In fact, a smile formed on my face as I processed what this meant.\nIt seems like Kyle is even stronger than he was in the novel... interesting.\nWhen I had broken the record, I had deliberately chosen a score that exceeded Kyle’s performance from his lesson in the original timeline. The novel had explicitly stated that Kyle hadn’t held back during his demonstration, which meant this version of Kyle was already surpassing his original capabilities.\nEven though he was the main character, I wasn’t going to let him claim the semester reward without a fight. The record wasn’t just for a single lesson, it was tracked throughout the entire first semester. Kyle and I would be competing for some time before our records were officially finalized and that particular competition closed.\nToday’s lesson with Instructor Sylvia focused on footwork fundamentals, the foundation of all combat movement. She had arranged coloured markers across the training floor in basic and complex patterns, creating obstacle courses that would test our agility, balance, and spatial awareness.\n\"Proper footwork separates competent fighters from exceptional ones,\" Sylvia explained as we gathered around the training area. \"Raw power means nothing if you can’t position yourself effectively or maintain balance under pressure.\"\nShe demonstrated several basic patterns, lateral movement, forward advances, defensive retreats, and pivoting techniques. Her movements were fluid and graceful, each step calculated to maintain optimal positioning while conserving energy.\n\"Your assignment is to navigate these courses while maintaining good form eventually making it part of your muscle memory. Don’t worry about the speed, it will come naturally once your muscle memory develops proper technique,\" she instructed before allowing us to start practising whilst she watched from the side-lines.\nStudents began attempting the courses one by one. Most struggled with the transitions between different movements, their steps becoming clumsy or hesitant when switching from lateral movement to pivoting manoeuvres.\nWhilst they were considered ’elite’, it wasn’t because of their skills, but because of their potential. Sure, they had some skill, but it wasn’t enough with what Instructor Sylvia was testing them with. This was the reason they were coming here after all, to learn. Had they been taught everything before they entered the academy, then what would have been the use of the academy?\nWhen my turn came, I stepped onto the marked course with confidence. The foundational knowledge from the Sky’s Secret Sword Art had improved more than just my swordsmanship, it had enhanced my understanding of positioning, balance, and efficient movement patterns.\nI began with the basic lateral movement sequence, my feet finding the optimal placement points instinctively. The agility and dexterity from my\n{Supernatural Physique}\nTrait combined with the knowledge I’d absorbed created seamless execution.\nThe basic obstacles was completed like a breeze.\nMoving into the more complex patterns, I maintained perfect form while transitioning between different movement types. My footwork remained light and controlled, each step serving a specific purpose in maintaining good positioning.\nThe advanced sequence required rapid direction changes while maintaining defensive postures to defend sudden attacks. I flowed through the movements without hesitation, my body allowing me to adjust instantly to each new requirement the obstacle created to challenge me.\nFrom the corner of my eyes, I could see that sylvia watched my performance with growing interest. My record breaking feat of strength from the previous day had made her lay her eyes on me, she no longer believed that I was someone with limited training experience.\nWhen I completed the full course sequence, the training hall had grown noticeably quieter. Other students had stopped their own practice to watch my own demonstration to try and comprehended something that would help them tackle the course better.\n\"Where did you learn footwork like that? That was incredible, your transitions were flawless.\" Elen once I finished. Not to be smug, but I could see that she admired my footwork.\n\"I learnt it from my father.\"\nElen showed a look of understanding before nodding her head. \"That makes sense, the duke is one of the strongest awakeners in the city.\"\nMarcus Ironhold, who had been working through his own obstacles, had also paused to study my technique with a calm expression.\nEmmet Cole’s reaction was more complex. While he clearly respected the skill I’d displayed, I could see the competitive fire burning in his eyes. He was already mentally planning how to improve his own performance to match or overcome what he’d witnessed.\nAnd for the first time since I’ve entered the academy, I heard Marcus’s voice.\nMarcus looked at me and with a measure tone he said. \"Your fundamentals are solid. Your weight distribution and balance control are particularly impressive.\"\n\"Thanks, yours is impressive too.\" I nodded my head curtly.\nWithout continuing the conversation, he simply left and trained through the obstacle himself. It seemed like Marcus was a man with few words, and he spoke his mind when he had something to say.\nSylvia approached with a thoughtful expression.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\n\"Adrian, that demonstration was well done,\" she said. \"Your footwork integration with combat positioning was remarkable. Your assignment will be more challenging than the rest. Wait for me after this lesson ends, I need to speak to you.\"\nI nodded my head and said. \"Alright, Instructor Sylvia.\"\nInstructor Sylvia then returned back to giving pointers to the other students, including Elen that was highly motivated by my own performance. Still, motivation wasn’t enough to overcome the obstacles, and she failed many times.\nHer movements became increasingly erratic as she tried to force improvements through sheer willpower rather than proper technique. I could see her face reddening with embarrassment as other students moved past her in their practice.\nWhen she missed a particularly simple pivot transition for the third consecutive time, her shoulders sagged in defeat and her eyes were starting to glisten. Noticing that she was on the verge of crying from embarrassment, I decided to step in and help her a little.\nI approached her position on the course. \"Elen, mind if I make a suggestion?\"\nShe looked up at me with a mixture of gratitude and hope. \"I’m making a complete fool of myself, aren’t I? This looked so easy when you done it.\"\n\"You’re overthinking the transitions. Watch your foot placement, you’re trying to move too quickly between positions instead of letting each step flow naturally into the next.\"\nI demonstrated the pivot sequence at quarter speed, emphasizing how each foot placement created the foundation for the subsequent movement.\n\"The key is maintaining your centre of gravity. Don’t rush the transition, let your body find its balance point before initiating the next movement.\"\nElen nodded, wiping away her frustration. \"It makes more sense when you break it down like that.\"\n\"Just like Instructor Sylvia said, speed comes with practice. Focus on accuracy first.\"\nShe attempted the sequence again, this time following my advice about pacing and balance. While still imperfect, her execution showed marked improvement.\n\"Much better. Your foundation is decent, just keep practising.\"\nWhilst I advised Elen on how to tackle the obstacle, I felt other students stop their practise just to listen and learn. However, that didn’t stop me from helping Elen out.\nThe time of the lesson passed by quickly, as my classmates started to get the hang of things, especially after my explanations and Sylvia’s own pointers.",

      "content": "Chapter 61: Attempting the record\nOnce the class ended, I approached Instructor Sylvia who had asked me to wait after the lesson had ended.\nWith a serious expression she began. \"Adrian, I need to inform you of a development regarding your record.\"\n\"Is it regarding my record being broken?\" I said, having heard the news from the students in the corridors.\n\"Yes, it seems like the news has already reached you. Another student from the first Elite class broke your attack record yesterday. His score was 9,701 points.\"\nI nodded calmly. \"I see. So the monthly payments are suspended until I reclaim the record?\"\n\"Exactly. You’ll no longer receive the 10,000 monthly bonus until you can break the current record and hold the top position again.\" She paused, studying my reaction. \"However, you did already receive the initial 50,000 point reward for breaking the record in the first place, so that remains yours even if the record was broken after.\"\n\"Understood. When will I have the opportunity to attempt breaking the new record?\"\nSylvia considered the question for a moment before saying. \"Well, technically you are able to do so now. You are allowed to attempt breaking the record that somebody else has placed, Twice a week.\"\nHearing this news, I smirked inwardly. This rule wasn’t mentioned in the original novel, and while I was working within the academy system’s boundaries, I needed to take advantage of this opportunity while it existed.\nIn the original timeline, Kyle had held the record unchallenged for extended periods. He would continuously improve and break his own scores weekly, but he never received the bonus for breaking records. The academy had implemented a rule where bonuses were only awarded for surpassing other students’ achievements, preventing people from farming points by repeatedly breaking their own records.\nWhat I was planning was essentially the same concept in reverse. I intended to use Kyle’s competitive nature and strength to generate bonus points for myself and in turn for himself. He was the only student who could realistically compete with me, and I would leverage his pride and capabilities to repeatedly claim record-breaking bonuses. I knew this loophole would likely be patched quickly once the academy recognized the exploitation, but the accumulated bonuses would be worth significantly more than the monthly payments for holding the record.\nFurthermore, Kyle wasn’t stupid, I was sure that he would understand what I was doing and do the same.\nI looked Sylvia directly in the eyes. \"I want to attempt breaking the record now.\"\nSylvia’s expression shifted to shock. \"Now? I strongly suggest you reconsider. The current record is nearly five hundred points above your previous score, and you only have two attempts remaining this week. You could wait and try later when you’ve had more time to prepare.\"\nI shook my head firmly. \"It’s fine. I’ll try now.\"\nShe studied my face with a penetrating expression, clearly trying to understand my confidence in the face of such a significant gap. After several moments, she nodded slowly.\n\"Very well. If you’re certain about this decision, I’ll arrange for the testing area.\"Googlᴇ search novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nShe led me toward the training dummy section. Other students who had lingered after class began to notice our movement toward the testing equipment.\n\"What’s happening?\" I heard someone whisper.\n\"I heard a little from their conversation, is Adrian actually going to try breaking the new record already? It’s impossible to improve by 500 points in a single night at his level.\" another voice asked with obvious disbelief.\nWord was spreading quickly among the remaining students. Several began following us at a respectful distance, curious to witness whether I could bridge such a substantial point gap so soon after losing my previous position.\nSylvia activated the measurement systems and stepped back, giving me space to prepare.\n\"Remember, this is an official attempt. The results will be recorded regardless of the outcome,\" she warned.\nI nodded and began my preparation. I knew I would be able to break the record, I hadn’t even used my full power during my previous attempt. I had considerably more in reserve.\nTaking a deep breath, I selected a sword from the training racks. Then I activated my Blood Control skill, this time accelerating my circulation significantly faster than before to gain substantially more strength and speed.\nSylvia and the other students watched intently. Among the onlookers were Marcus Ironhold and Emmet Cole, both studying my technique with interest. I wasn’t sure why they remained behind, but it seemed like they had probably heard about my attempt too.\nSylvia crossed her arms and observed with a silent gaze, clearly analysing every aspect of my preparation.\nThe target number was clear in my head. Having attacked this dummy before, I understood exactly how physical force translated into the scoring system.\nThen I burst forward with explosive speed that exceeded my previous demonstration.\nWhoosh!\n***\nI watched this enigmatic student of mine launch into his attack. His speed was substantially higher than his previous demonstration, which surprised me considerably.\nTo say I didn’t think he was being overconfident would be dishonest, I had assumed his rumoured poor judgment was finally surfacing. But observing his preparation and execution, it seemed my concerns were misplaced.\nHis strike connected with the training dummy with power that elite freshmen would have in their second or third semester. Yet, here was Adrian Blackwood, doing so on the second day.\nI could immediately sense that this attack possibly possessed the force necessary to shatter the current record. The impact sent vibrations through the dummy, and the magical measurement systems flickered as they calculated the force behind his attack.\nI glanced at my other students as they watched in stunned silence. Even Marcus Ironhold, with his family’s known defensive power from the Earth Bear bloodline, would not be able to withstand an assault of this magnitude. The boy’s potential was becoming impossible to ignore.\nAdrian Blackwood had transformed from a mediocre student with questionable priorities into someone displaying Elite-rank mastery that rivalled second year students. His footwork demonstration earlier had shown solid technique, but this raw power output shouldn’t exist in someone his age.\nThere was two monsters in this year group and that worried me. What would the future hold for these two.",

      "content": "Chapter 62: Kyle Morrison\nThe measurement display continued climbing, numbers flashing higher than any first-year student should achieve. Whatever training regimen he’d undergone, it had produced results that defied normal progression of strength.\nThis wasn’t just improvement, this was a complete metamorphosis of ability that raised questions I wasn’t sure I wanted answered... unless he hadn’t actually improved so dramatically overnight, but had been concealing his true strength all along.\nThe number finally stopped climbing, and the result made my brow furrow deeply.\n[9,702]\nThe score was undeniably high, and Adrian had certainly broken the record, proving my scepticism about his attempt completely wrong. But that wasn’t what occupied my thoughts. Adrian had surpassed the previous record by exactly one point. It was almost absurd, was this intentional, or had he barely managed to break through the record?\nHis unwavering confidence before the attempt strongly suggested the former. No student would approach such a challenging task with that level of certainty unless they possessed complete control over their capabilities.\nBelieving the former came with its own complexity. To be able to achieve 9,702 points by choice is something that made me shiver slightly, not because of his strength, but because of his potential. Just what was his actual maximum output? The control needed to exceed the record by the smallest possible margin indicated a level of power and control that was frankly unsettling for a new student.\nHence, the thought was discarded from my head. He must’ve tried his hardest, it seemed like it anyways.\nI had witnessed many talented students throughout my career as a student and teacher, but none who displayed this power. Adrian Blackwood was gathering my curiosity and interest rapidly.\nBefore my eyes, Adrian returned the sword back to the racks with some heavy breathing.\nMy eyes narrowed at the scene, was he faking it, or was it truly his strongest attack...I couldn’t tell. But, time sure would.\n...\nAfter successfully achieving the number I had targeted, I began faking labored breathing. Of course, simply breathing rapidly wouldn’t fool Sylvia without the physiological markers of true exertion.\nI had deliberately slowed my blood circulation using my Blood Control trait, mimicking the genuine feeling of exhaustion and oxygen debt that came from pushing one’s limits to the maximum.\n\"Adrian... that was... This is going to be an interesting year,\" Sylvia finally said, a knowing smile crossing her face.\n\"Thank you, Instructor. About my 50,000 bonus points, when will I receive them?\"\n\"You’ll receive it shortly. You’re amassing quite the collection of points, aren’t you? I must say, you are most definitely the richest student in the academy.\"\nI smiled before replying, \"I don’t dare say that.\"\nThe other students who had witnessed the demonstration were murmuring among themselves, clearly trying to process what they’d just seen. Marcus Ironhold nodded approvingly, recognizing the skill behind the performance, while Emmet Cole’s competitive fire burned even brighter in his eyes.\nSylvia made notes, recording the new record. \"I’ll submit this immediately. The academy will want to update their records quickly.\"\n...\n[Kyle Morisson’s POV]\nSeraphina and I were still catching our breath after the agility course when she turned to me with the focused expression she always wore during class.\n\"Your maneuvers during the obstacle section were impressive,\" she said, adjusting the battle axe strapped to her back. \"The way you used your fire wings to change direction, It was good.\"Googlᴇ search\n\"Your ground positioning was solid too,\" I replied, wiping the sweat from my forehead. \"When you transitioned between defensive stances while maintaining forward momentum, that takes real skill.\"\nWe had partnered for several exercises today, and despite our different fighting styles, we worked well together. Seraphina’s Valkyrie bloodline made her a natural close-combat specialist.\n\"The course was more entertaining than I expected,\" she admitted, a rare hint of satisfaction in her voice. \"Though we should practice the coordination drills more. My axe work needs refinement when working alongside others.\"\n\"Agreed. I need to work on my agility abit more. It’s a weakness of mine.\"\nBefore Seraphina could respond, I heard familiar footsteps approaching. Professor Victor Castellane walked toward us with his usual faint smile, though something in his expression suggested he had specific business with me.\n\"Kyle, Seraphina,\" he greeted us both with a respectful nod. \"Impressive work during today’s exercises. Your coordination is improving rapidly.\"\n\"Thank you, Professor,\" Seraphina replied formally, though I caught her studying Victor’s face with that analytical look she used when something seemed off.\n\"Kyle, I need to speak with you privately for a moment,\" Victor continued, his tone remaining pleasant but carrying an undercurrent I couldn’t quite identify.\nSeraphina glanced between us before saying, \"I should head back anyway. See you later.\"\nAfter she walked away, Victor’s expression grew more serious. \"Kyle, I have some news regarding your combat record.\"\n\"What kind of news?\"\n\"Your attack record has been broken. A student from the second Elite class scored 9,702 points earlier today.\"\nThe words hit me like a physical blow. \"Broken? But I just set that record yesterday.\"\n\"Indeed. The student who broke it is Adrian Blackwood from House Blackwood. The previous record holder.\"\nI stared at Victor, trying to process this information. Adrian Blackwood - I’d heard about him, mostly unflattering rumors about his previous behavior and lack of serious training.\n\"Are you certain? That’s...\" I trailed off, calculating the implications.\n\"Quite certain. The measurement was verified by Professor Sylvia Ashworth herself.\" Victor paused, studying my reaction carefully. \"How does this make you feel, Kyle?\"\n\"Frustrated,\" I admitted honestly. \"I thought I had established a clear lead.\"\nVictor nodded approvingly. \"That frustration is valuable. It means that you have passion, and passion is good.\" He leaned closer, lowering his voice. \"Tell me, Kyle, are you familiar with the academy’s record-breaking policies?\"\n\"The basic ones, I suppose. Break someone’s record, you receive bonus points.\"\n\"There’s more to it than that. Students can attempt to reclaim records twice per week. The bonuses for breaking records can accumulate quite substantially if one is... strategic about the timing.\"\nSomething in his tone made me pay closer attention. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"Simply that the point system has nuances that diligent students can learn to navigate effectively. The monthly bonuses for holding records are substantial, but the breaking bonuses can be even more lucrative if managed properly.\"\nI frowned, trying to understand what he was suggesting. \"You’re saying I should focus on breaking records rather than just holding them?\"\n\"I’m saying that understanding all aspects of the academy’s systems can provide advantages that pure combat ability alone cannot.\" Victor’s smile returned. \"Of course, you would need the strength to consistently break records. Not every student possesses such capabilities.\"\nBefore I could ask more questions, I heard Seraphina’s voice calling my name. She was walking back toward us with a concerned expression.\n\"Kyle, I just heard something from the other students. Did someone really break your record already?\"\nHer shock was evident despite her attempt to maintain composure. Seraphina rarely showed surprise, but this news had clearly caught her off guard.\n\"Apparently so,\" I replied, still processing the information myself.\n\"Who?\" she asked directly, she didn’t seem to know.\n\"Adrian Blackwood.\"\nSeraphina’s eyes widened slightly before her expression hardened. \"Adrian!?\"\nWith a firm nod, I affirmed it. \"yes, do you know anything about him?\"",

We were... engaged until recently.\"\n\"Engaged?\" I couldn’t hide my surprise. \"What happened?\"\n\"The arrangement was made by our families when we were children,\" she explained, her voice taking on a neutral tone.\nShe paused, seeming to choose her words carefully. \"Adrian and I dissolved our engagement just before the academy term began. It was... a mutual decision. We both felt we were incompatible.\"\n\"But you’re surprised he broke my record after I broken his yesterday,\" I observed.\n\"Wait. It was Adrian’s record that you broke yesterday? I had heard rumours that you had broken another student’s record, but I didn’t catch the name in the gossip and I was too busy to look into it.\"\n\"Yes, why do you look so surprised? Someone with his power, it should be normal, no?\" I asked, not knowing much about Adrian Blackwood. I didn’t even know how the guy looked, but Seraphina was acting kind of weird that I couldn’t help but ask.\nHer brow furrowed before she said. \"Extremely surprised. The Adrian I knew showed no interest in serious training or combat. He was more concerned with...\" She trailed off before stopping herself.\n\"With what?\"\n\"Personal matters that had nothing to do with strength or skill. His reputation at social gatherings was... not focused on martial prowess.\"\nVictor had been listening to our exchange with obvious interest. \"People can change quite dramatically when properly motivated,\" he interjected. \"Perhaps losing his engagement provided the catalyst he needed.\"\nSeraphina’s expression remained sceptical. \"Perhaps. But the Adrian I knew could barely maintain focus during basic etiquette lessons, let alone develop such power...I don’t know, maybe I didn’t know him...well enough.\"\n\"How long ago did you dissolve the engagement?\" I asked.\n\"Around two weeks ago. Just before we both arrived at the academy.\"\nSeraphina wasn’t making sense. Just how could someone who wasn’t known to be a genius suddenly become one?\nSo, I voiced the question on my mind. \"Do you know when he awakened his bloodline?\"\nSeraphina’s brows drew together as she thought back. After a pause, she nodded.\"I think it was after breaking our engagement. Only a few days later.\"\n\"That explains it,\" I muttered, piecing the situation together in my head. \"After awakening his bloodline, he must’ve changed. Maybe his bloodline awakening had changed him, he probably has a powerful one. No... in fact, it has be powerful, most likely at the mythical rank.\"\nBut Seraphina shook her head immediately.\"No. His family claimed it was a rare-rank bloodline.\"\nA rare-rank?\nA frown formed on my face.\nThat didn’t line up with what I’d just witnessed through his score. Whilst Rare-rank bloodlines were powerful, they weren’t powerful to the extent that their wielder would be able to bypass me, a wielder of the supreme-rank phoenix bloodline, especially with his previous reputation that Seraphina spoke of.\nVictor folded his hands behind his back, the faintest curve on his lips betraying amusement.\"Rank alone doesn’t determine potential. Bloodlines can manifest differently in each generation. Perhaps Adrian’s awakening brought forth a powerful trait, or perhaps they had misjudged the rank of his bloodline. Either way, it doesn’t matter.\"Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nThe words lingered in the air like a blade unsheathed. I glanced between them, unease building in my chest.\nVictor tilted his head, regarding me with a curious look.\"Tell me, Kyle. Does this revelation discourage you? To know another has already surpassed your efforts without any previous accomplishment?\"\nFor a moment, I felt that same frustration building again. But then I clenched my fists, steadying myself. \"No. It just means I’ll work harder. If Adrian Blackwood can change, so can I. I won’t lose to him.\"\nHow can I lose when I have a supreme bloodline of the great phoenix clan. That’s impossible.\nVictor’s approving smile deepened, and his eyes glistened.\"Good. That’s the spirit I was hoping to hear. Remember this, Kyle. The academy isn’t just about strength. It’s about perception. If Adrian has indeed altered his image, others will rally around him. Influence, reputation, alliances, they can be as deadly as any blade. Learn that lesson quickly, and you’ll rise above them all.\"\nI nodded, though a storm churned inside me. Adrian Blackwood, a name I’d never heard of was suddenly becoming a rival I couldn’t ignore.\n...\nAfter class had ended, I made my way toward the student hub. My communication crystal had rung earlier, the faint blue glow flickering with the attendant’s voice informing me that one of the students was interested in one of my items.\nThe student was interested in my enhanced-rank spear.\nJust thinking about the profit I was about to make brought a grin to my face. I’d already decided on my price.\n100,000 points.\nPossibly his full monthly income if he was not in the elite rank class.\nIt wasn’t arrogance. It was simple economics. Enhanced-rank weapons were luxuries for all students including second and third years, bordering on impossible to obtain unless one had either family connections or sheer luck outside the academy. As for inside the academy, it was less scarce, you simply needed points to get it.\nThe established price in the weapon shops in the mall was around 150,000 - 200,000 depending on the weapon. I knew the value of discounts, and greed of students and I intended to exploit it to sell the items that I had gotten for free from the daily rewards.\nThe student hub was crowded as usual, filled with groups exchanging items, information, and gossip.\nAs I stepped inside, heads turned.\nAdrian Blackwood. The one who dethroned Kyle Morrison overnight.\nInformation had already spread about me breaking the record again. I wasn’t surprised, information in this academy was welcomed and many people used it to form connections or even sold it.\nI approached the designated counter where the attendant, a normal second year student waited, a polite young man in uniform bowing as I arrived. \"Sir Blackwood, the buyer is waiting in room three.\"\nWith a subtle nod, I made my way to the door before pushing it open.",

      "content": "Chapter 64: Increasing my trait levels.\nInside, a boy about my age stood, his posture stiff, clearly nervous. His auburn hair was damp with sweat, on the table between us lay his student card.\n\"You’re here for the spear,\" I said casually, taking the seat opposite him.\n\"Yes,\" he replied quickly, eyes darting toward the storage ring on my finger. \"I...I heard you listed it, and I wanted to purchase before anyone else could.\"\nI studied him for a moment. His eagerness confirmed my suspicion—this wasn’t a luxury for him, it was desperation.\n\"100,000 points,\" I said firmly.\nHis face paled. \"T-that’s... that’s my monthly allowance.\"\nI leaned back, expression unreadable. \"Then perhaps it isn’t for you.\"\nPanic flickered in his eyes. \"Wait! I... I need it. Please. I’ll pay. But I’ve used some of my points already. I only have 99,250. Is that acceptable?\"\nI sighed, before saying. \"Fine. 99,000 it is. I will leave you with 250 points, you need them to survive.\"\n\"T-thank you Lord Blackwood. Your generosity knows no bounds.\" Relief flooded his features as I withdrew the Enhanced-rank spear from my storage ring and placed it on the table. The weapon gleamed with subtle magical energy, its craftsmanship clearly superior to standard academy equipment.\nThe boy’s breath caught when he saw it. He reached out reverently, hands shaking as he grasped the weapon.\n\"Use it wisely, and don’t flaunt it around too much. Otherwise, other students might try to rob you when you venture outside the academy grounds.\"\nHe looked up, startled by the advice, then nodded quickly. \"Thank you, Lord Blackwood.\"\nThe student activated his card’s transfer function, and I felt the familiar chime as the points were added to my account. The academy’s student cards were sophisticated enough to handle such exchanges seamlessly.\nAfter completing the transaction, I checked my total points balance: 299,250.\nI hadn’t spent a single point during my stay in the academy. Unlike students that used these points to eat inside the academy, and buy other essentials. I kept my points for my plans.\nI was certainly among the wealthiest students in the academy now. I didn’t particularly care that the buyer had almost exhausted his points, it was his choice to purchase the spear, and I had done him a favour.\nA discount of nearly 100,000 points was no small thing. Whilst enhanced items cost from 150,000 to 200,000 points. The spear that came from my reward system was no ordinary one, it was certainly at the peak of its rank, nearing the 200,000 points cost.\nAfter selling the item, I made my way back to my dormitory before my next class.\nInside my room, I settled onto the couch and drank several vials of blood to quench my thirst. Then I activated my communication crystal to call my father and check on Kael’s progress.\n\"Adrian,\" my father’s voice came through clearly. \"Perfect timing. I was just thinking about updating you on the boy’s development.\"\n\"How is he adapting?\" I asked.\n\"Better than expected, honestly. His improvement rate is even faster than yours was at his age,\" my father replied with obvious approval. \"He accepted the training regimen without complaint and has integrated well with the other guards during group sessions.\"\n\"And his bloodline training?\"\n\"That’s where he truly shines. After the regular training with the guards, I’ve been working with him privately in our secured training room to focus specifically on his ice manipulation. His improvements are remarkable - I’ve taught him fundamental mana control techniques and basic combat.\"\nMy father paused before continuing. \"He’s still not at an advanced level, naturally, but his progress is rapid. Within a week, he should have solid control over his aim and basic ice techniques, along with the foundational skills necessary to become a capable fighter.\"\n\"Any behavioural issues?\" I asked, remembering Kael’s traumatic background.\n\"None whatsoever. He’s disciplined, focused, and eager to improve. Whatever happened to him before you found him, it seems to have given him strong motivation to grow stronger.\"\n\"Good. That’s exactly what I hoped to hear. Thank you, father.\"\n\"No problem, he also asks about you occasionally. He seems grateful for the opportunity you’ve provided him.\"\nA smile formed on my face. Everything was proceeding according to plan.\nAfter talking to my father, and mother for some time, I ended the call to practise.\nI wasn’t going to hunt today, instead I wanted to focus on increasing the level of my traits.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on NovᴇlFirenᴇt\n[Host: Adrian Blackwood]\n[Bloodline: Supreme Vampire - 20%]\n[Rank: Elite]\n[Traits: Blood Control (2nd Order, Lvl.3), Supernatural Physique (1st Order, Lvl.3), Blood Enhancement(1st Order, Lvl.1), Blood Trail (2nd Order, Lvl.1)]\n[Aspect: Serpent Scales(Elite), Silent Predator (Elite)]\n[Echo: Stone Armor(Transcendent)]\nAs it stood now, my current weakest was\n{Blood Enhancement}\nand\n{Blood Trail}\n. Blood enhancement was really useful as it strengthened items.

So, I headed took out my razor edge sword and started to enhance it with my\n{Blood Enhancement}\ntrait.\nOf course, I couldn’t just enhance the skill without any blood, so I took out a vial from my storage ring and started to use the blood inside to enhance the sword.\nI didn’t swing the sword. There was no need to, the skill was only based on using the enhancement itself, it had nothing to do with actually using the item that was enhanced.\nI experimented on various items in my storage ring. After enhancing my sword and keeping the enhancement on until it ran out, I moved to another item, testing the possible drawbacks that the trait had.\nAfter half an hour of experimenting, I found two drawbacks.",

      "content": "Chapter 65: A Spar?\nAfter training my\n{Blood Enhancement}\ntrait to increase its level inside my dorm, I discovered two significant drawbacks through experimentation.\nThe first drawback was duration dependency. The enhancement’s lasting power directly correlated with both the quantity and quality of blood used. Elite-rank blood maintained the enhancement for extended periods while providing stronger overall effects. Noble-rank blood, by contrast, offered shorter duration and weaker enhancement benefits.\nThe second drawback related to equipment rank. Higher-ranked items required substantially more mana investment to maintain the enhancement effect. It operated like a transaction system, I had to spend mana to extract enhancement benefits from the blood. Once the blood was exhausted, additional mana input became irrelevant.\nThe half-hour training session didn’t yield immediate improvements, but I wasn’t rushing the process. I decided to continue practicing the skill while walking to my next class, realizing I should have been training it during travel time from the beginning.\nAs I made my way through the academy corridors, I practiced subtle applications of Blood Enhancement on my Typhoon Pendant that I had gotten from the weapon treasury inside the academy.\nOther students passed by without noticing my discrete practice sessions. The ability to train continuously throughout the day would accelerate my skill development significantly compared to my other skills.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nThe only reason I was able to practise the skill, was because I was in the academy. I didn’t worry too much about using my mana, threats wouldn’t make it inside the academy, so there was no need to fear an attack whilst having little mana to work with.\nAs for students, nobody dared to attack me. I wasn’t someone to be bullied after all. Whether it was strength or background, I was superior to everyone else in both.\nI arrived at the classroom slightly earlier than usual, with about five minutes remaining before the lesson started. I decided to use that time to continue practicing my Blood Enhancement trait.\nThere weren’t many students inside at this early time. Once I entered and made my way to my seat, I noticed several classmates nodding acknowledgment in my direction, which I returned politely.\nSettling into my chair, I resumed my discrete training with a small pendant, focusing on maintaining steady mana flow. A minute later, Emmet Cole arrived, hands buried in his pockets with a naturally angry expression on his face.\nOur eyes met briefly across the room. Instead of heading to his usual seat on the opposite side, he changed direction and approached my desk directly.\nI stopped enhancing the pendant and slipped it into my pocket before he reached me.\nOnce he stood before my desk, I looked up and said, \"What’s up?\"\n\"I want to have a spar with you after class.\"\nHis directness was almost amusing, no greeting, no small talk, straight to his purpose. This was exactly what I had appreciated about his character in the novel. Unfortunately, the author had killed him off for the sake of Kyle’s character development.\nSensing the perfect opportunity to build a connection with him and potentially alter his fate, I smiled and replied, \"Sure.\"\nI knew Emmet had little patience for pointless conversation, so I didn’t waste time with unnecessary pleasantries. His eyes showed a flicker of approval at my straightforward acceptance.\n\"After Sylvia’s class then,\" he confirmed with a slight nod.\n\"Sounds good.\"\nHe returned to his seat just as more students began filtering into the classroom, preparing for another lesson with their favourite instructor.\n...\nThe class began with Sylvia taking on a more formal tone than her usual combat instruction style. Today’s lesson focused on the historical foundations of our kingdom.\n\"The Kingdom of Eldrathia was not born from peaceful negotiation or gradual expansion, It was forged through blood, sacrifice, and the unwavering determination of those who believed in a unified future.\"\nShe gestured to a large map that materialized through magical projection, showing the continent as it existed before the kingdom’s establishment.\n\"The first King, unified these lands, the continent was fractured into dozens of warring clans. Each clan controlled small territories, constantly fighting over resources, bloodline purity, and grudges that stretched back generations.\"\nThe map shifted, showing the chaotic borders and frequent conflicts between different coloured territories.\n\"The first King possessed the same legendary Tiger bloodline that his descendant, King Aldric wields today. But bloodline strength alone does not create kingdoms. It was his vision of unity and his willingness to pay the ultimate price that changed everything.\"\nSylvia’s expression grew somber as she continued. \"For thirty years, he fought campaign after campaign, not for conquest, but for consolidation. He offered every clan the same choice: join willingly as equals in a united kingdom, or be exiled from the land to face the vicious beasts.\"\nThe map displayed the gradual expansion of royal territory, showing how scattered clan holdings were slowly incorporated into a growing central authority.\n\"The soil of our kingdom was literally soaked with the blood of those who fought for this vision. Thousands of soldiers, both royal and clan forces, sacrificed their lives for the idea that a unified nation could provide greater security and prosperity than endless tribal warfare.\"\nI found myself engaged with the lesson. Understanding the kingdom’s violent founding helped explain the current political tensions between the great houses and the crown.\n\"Many clan leaders chose to submit rather than see their people slaughtered. These became the founding noble families we know today. The four Great Ducal Houses, Blackwood, Stormwind, Ironhold, and Rosewood all trace their origins to clan leaders who recognized the wisdom of unity over destruction.\"\nSylvia paused, her gaze across to find my eyes for a brief moment before continuing. \"The kingdom you live in today exists because countless individuals chose to sacrifice personal ambition for collective stability. Never forget that the freedoms and opportunities you enjoy were purchased with blood and determination.\"\nThe weight of that bloody history settled over the classroom as students contemplated the price of their current comfortable lives.\nThe class ended soon enough.\nElen stood up from her seat with an excited look on her face. \"Adrian! Want to go out to eat? I’ve got something I want to show you later.\"\nWith an apologetic look, I shook my head. \"Sorry Elen, but I have a sparring match right now. Maybe later?\"\nElen tilted her head curiously. \"Sparring match? With whom?\"\nEmmet walked toward my seat and positioned himself right next to Elen, his sudden appearance startling her slightly.\n\"With me.\"",

I didn’t know you two were acquainted.\"\nEmmet didn’t seem to entertain Elene’s chat. \"I will wait for you in the arena.\"\nWithout waiting for my response, Emmet simply turned around and left.\nI store my study materials inside the storage ring before standing up.\n\"What was that about? Did I do anything to bother him?\" Elen looked at me with a confused look.\nWith a smile on my face, I shook my head. \"Don’t take his actions too personally, I think he doesn’t like to talk much.\"\nElen nodded, though she seemed somewhat sceptical. \"Can I come too? I would like to watch your spar, maybe I can learn a thing or to from you.\"\n\"Of course, I can’t stop you from watching can I?\"Thɪs\nAs we prepared to leave for the training grounds, I could see other students taking notice of our arrangement. Based on their previous actions, my classmates loved gossip, so they would most definitely come to watch.\nEmmet had already left through the door, clearly eager to begin.\nI arrived at the arena alongside Elen. We both spotted Emmet waiting with his arms crossed, his expression focused and ready.\nThe arena was located in Section D. It wasn’t actually just one platform, the huge space contained several smaller training platforms that students could reserve for private sparring sessions.\nSince our spar wasn’t an official match, we didn’t need to get an instructor or third-year student as a referee. Only they were qualified to oversee formal matches, and all official bouts were recorded through magical artefacts to ensure any cheating would be caught and punished. This system meant no student or instructor dared show bias when refereeing.\nFor top third-year students, refereeing was a profitable side activity. They earned points for their services, which further reduced the effectiveness of bribery attempts, though the system wasn’t completely fool proof.\nEmmet had clearly reserved one of the smaller platforms for our use. I excused myself from Elen’s side as she offered her final words of caution.\n\"Be careful,\" she said seriously.\nI looked at her curiously. \"You think I’m going to get hurt?\"\n\"Quite the opposite. Be careful not to hurt him too badly,\" she replied, shaking her head with concern.\nFortunately, Emmet was far enough away that he couldn’t hear her comment. I had no idea how he would have reacted to that assessment of our relative capabilities, and I preferred to keep his competitive fire focused on the upcoming match rather than any perceived slights.\nI made my way toward the reserved platform where Emmet waited. I felt no concern or worry about the upcoming spar.\nOnce I stepped onto the platform, I glanced around and noticed a decent-sized crowd of students gathering to watch our sparring match.\nEmmet’s voice cut through my awareness of the spectators. \"Ignore them. They won’t benefit you when the beasts attack us.\"\nHis practical mindset was exactly what I’d expected from him - always focused on real combat applications rather than showmanship or social dynamics.\n\"Alright, let’s begin,\" I replied, drawing my sword and settling into a ready stance.\nEmmet took his position across from me, his hands already beginning to generate heat as small flames danced between his fingers. His eyes locked onto mine with intense focus.\nThe platform we stood on was roughly twenty meters in diameter, enough space for meaningful combat without being so large that mobility became the primary factor. The magical barriers around the edges would contain our attacks and prevent injury to spectators.\n\"No holding back,\" Emmet stated firmly.\n\"Understood,\" I confirmed.\nDespite my confirmation, I was certainly not going to use my more powerful traits, aspect or even echo. Otherwise, a genius that is worth nurturing will become nothing but a corpse ready for burial.\nThe fight began with Emmet dashing toward me at considerable speed. Compared to other students, he was moving like lightning, his Elite-rank capabilities were immediately apparent and exactly what I’d expected from someone of his calibre.\nEmmet launched a punch toward me that I sidestepped smoothly before countering with my own strike aimed at his midsection.\nWhoosh!\nMy attack connected and pushed him backward, though he managed to block with crossed arms. When my fist made contact, I heard his bones strain under the pressure, I could tell the impact had hurt him despite his defensive posture.\nI wasn’t particularly concerned about the minor injury. Students at his family’s economic level could easily afford healing potions, and small injuries like this were routine in serious sparring matches.\nEmmet grimaced but immediately pressed forward again, flames beginning to spiral around his arms as he prepared a more serious offensive. His competitive nature was clearly ignoring any discomfort from my counterattack.\n\"Better,\" he said through gritted teeth, his eyes burning with increased intensity. \"But you’ll need more than that to stop me.\"\n\"Wow. That was a powerful strike, I would seriously be injured if that strike had hit me. How is he still standing?\" I heard one of the students murmur to one of his friends.\nI gave a quick glance towards the crowd, more people were coming to watch. Whether it was second years, third years or even other students from the different classes in our year.\n\"Don’t you dare ignore me!\"\nEmmet threw a powerful punch towards me with his hands engulfed in fire.\nImmediately I crossed my arms to protect myself from the attack, it was a powerful strike and I needed to defend it.\nBoom!\nThe attack was powerful, but it didn’t do any real damage. But I had to give credit, where credit was due.\nI was pushed back a step from protecting that punch. Sensing Emmet’s intention of trying to continue the attack, I leapt back creating distance between the two of us.\nEmmet wasn’t fazed and followed me relentlessly trying to continue his attack.\nAs soon as my feet landed on the ground, I sprung back into action dashing towards Emmet that was doing the same.",

      "content": "Chapter 67: Sparring Emmet Cole [2]\nEmmet and I closed the distance simultaneously, both committed to landing decisive blows in our exchange.\nOur fists connected almost simultaneously, my punch drove deep into Emmet’s gut, forcing him to expel a massive breath of air mixed with saliva as his diaphragm contracted violently from the impact.\nWhack!\nHis own strike caught me in the ribs, causing me to wince as the force jarred through my enhanced physique.\nPow!\nThe crowd around the platform erupted in excited murmurs as they witnessed the brutal exchange. Neither of us had held back in that moment, and the raw power behind both strikes was evident to every spectator.\nEmmet staggered backward, his face pale as he fought to regain his breath.\n\"I expected nothing less, Adrian.\" Emmet said as he wiped a trail of blood from his mouth.\n\"Likewise, Emmet.\" I said, with a smirk on my face.\nDespite the obvious pain, his eyes still burned with determination. He pressed one hand against his stomach while raising the other defensively, flames flickering around his fingers as he tried to maintain his combat readiness.\nI rolled my shoulder slightly to work through the ache from his punch. His technique was solid, and the fire enhancement behind his strike had added significant force to what would have already been a formidable blow.\nIt had to be known that I wasn’t using my more powerful traits, I was simply fighting him through my physical strength only, nothing else. Still, Emmet was powerful enough to make me feel some pain which was commendable.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ\n\"Still standing,\" I observed, respecting his resilience.\nEmmet managed a pained grin between gasps. \"Takes more than that... to put me down.\"\nThe brief exchange had demonstrated that we were in the same range of strength, though I was holding back considerably more of my true capabilities than he was.\nBoth of us reset our stances, preparing for the next phase of our sparring match.\nA few strong scents of blood suddenly entered my nostrils. I recognized two of them immediately.\nI turned my head to find Seraphina walking beside Kyle and a few other students approaching the arena.\nMy eyes met Seraphina’s for a split second before I felt Emmet attacking me once again.\nI met his strike head-on without bothering to dodge. I wanted this to be a straightforward exchange of blows. It wasn’t a life-or-death battle anyway, and taking some damage would help me increase the level of my physical conditioning through real combat stress.\n[Kyle Morrison’s POV]\nAfter hearing about Adrian’s fight from passing students, curiosity got the better of me. I decided to make my way to the arena to see this person who had broken my record in action. Seraphina chose to come along as well, though she seemed more reluctant about it.\nOnce I arrived at the arena and my eyes landed on Adrian Blackwood in the middle of his sparring match, my eyes widened slightly in recognition.\nI knew this guy. I didn’t know him well, but I remembered him clearly. He was the one who had bumped into me when I first entered Luminara city weeks ago. The strange encounter where he’d stared at me for an uncomfortably long time before walking away without explanation.\n\"That’s him,\" I said quietly to Seraphina, nodding toward the platform.\n\"I know,\" she replied, her voice carrying a complex mix of emotions I couldn’t quite identify.\nWatching Adrian fight was illuminating. His movements were controlled and precise, showing real combat experience rather than just academy training. The way he absorbed Emmet’s attacks and countered impressed me despite my competitive instincts.\nThis was definitely the same person who had given me that intense look in the city, but his demeanour now was completely different. I expected nothing less from the man before me, in my eyes he was my rival.\nEspecially after breaking the record that I set recently using my full power.\nAs I watched Adrian’s performance in the sparring match, I couldn’t help but be impressed by his raw physical power. Each of his strikes carried tremendous force, and his defensive strength was equally impressive.\n\"Seraphina, what’s his bloodline? I can see he’s physically enhanced, but I’m not familiar with the specifics.\" I said quietly.\n\"It’s the traditional Blackwood family bloodline,\" she replied, her tone carefully neutral. \"It’s related to physical strength and enhancement. The duke has a knight’s bloodline that impressively increases his physical strength too.\"\nI nodded, studying Adrian’s movements more carefully. \"I can definitely see that. His opponent, the guy with black hair and red streaks, he’s putting up a good fight, but Adrian is stronger.\"\nThe exchange between the two fighters was intense. Adrian seemed to be deliberately engaging in direct confrontations rather than dodging. It was almost like he was testing himself as much as sparring with his opponent.\n\"He’s holding back, someone who broke my record should be ending this fight much more easily.\" I observed.\nSeraphina glanced at me with a thoughtful expression. \"Perhaps he’s being cautious about his ability, or maybe he’s using this as training rather than trying to dominate.\"\nWatching Adrian fight gave me insights into the person who had suddenly emerged as my primary competition at the academy.\n***\nThe fight between me and Emmet continued for about five minutes. We both fought to our heart’s content, enjoying ourselves without worrying about who was watching.\nThe fight between me and Emmet continued for about five minutes. We both fought to our heart’s content, enjoying ourselves without concern for our audience. There was something about engaging in honest combat with someone like Emmet that made it enjoyable.\nDuring the entire match, I could feel Kyle and Seraphina’s gazes tracking my movements, but I paid them no attention.\nSo what if he was the protagonist of some story I’d once read? So what if Seraphina was arguably the most beautiful girl on campus? Their presence wasn’t going to dictate my actions.\nI had spent too long thinking of myself as a side character in someone else’s narrative. That version of me, the one who measured his value against fictional plot points and worried about staying in predetermined lanes, was gone.\nThis was my life now. My choices. My story to write.\nI wasn’t going to spend my academy years hiding in the background, carefully avoiding the main characters for fear of disrupting some narrative. I had power, and opportunities that the original Adrian could never have dreamed of.",

If circumstances brought me into conflict or cooperation with any of the so-called main characters, I’d handle those situations based on my own judgment and goals.\nThe realization was oddly freeing. I threw another punch at Emmet with renewed vigor, no longer fighting as someone trying to avoid changing a predetermined story, but as someone determined to forge his own path forward.\nEmmet grinned through his exhaustion as he blocked my strike, clearly appreciating the increased intensity. This was what real growth felt like - not careful adherence to someone else’s script, but the courage to write your own.\nAfter my fight ended with Emmet, we shook hands. Emmet did not stay for idle talk, and simply left the platform.\nI didn’t wait out either, making my way to Elen who looked at me with an excited expression.\nAfter my fight ended with Emmet, we shook hands firmly. He didn’t linger for idle conversation and simply left the platform, which was exactly what I’d expected from his straightforward personality.\nI didn’t wait around either, making my way directly to Elen, who looked at me with barely contained excitement.\n\"Adrian, that was incredible!\" she exclaimed, her blue eyes bright with enthusiasm. \"The way you matched his fire techniques with pure physical prowess, I’ve never seen anything like it. Your defence was brilliant, and when you absorbed those direct hits without flinching... it was like watching a completely different level of combat. I had always thought that you were more of an attacking based awakener, but after watching this fight, you are really an all rounded fighter.\"\nShe paused to catch her breath before continuing. \"I could see you were not at your peak power too, you didn’t have a sword with you. That level of power without your main weapon while still putting on such an impressive display takes real skill. Emmet’s no pushover either, his fire bloodline is really cool, those tricks of his have really given me ideas on how I should use my own bloodline.\"\nAs Elen continued her analysis of the match, I heard a voice approach from behind.\n\"Excuse me.\"\nI turned to see Kyle Morrison walking toward us, with Seraphina standing beside him like a silent statue. Her expression was carefully neutral, revealing nothing of whatever thoughts might be running through her mind.\n\"I’m Kyle Morrison,\" he said, extending his hand in greeting.\nHis tone was respectful but competitive. \"That was an impressive sparring match, so I thought that I had to introduce myself.\"\nI shook his hand with a normal, measured grip. \"Adrian Blackwood. Nice to meet you, Kyle.\"\nSeraphina remained motionless beside Kyle, neither speaking nor making any gesture of acknowledgment. I didn’t bother addressing her directly, our previous relationship was concluded, and I felt no need to force awkward pleasantries neither did I want to.\nWe were never close anyway, the only thing that made us ever get in contact was the arrangement with our fathers and that has already been demolished.\n\"I heard you broke my record, I have to admit, I’m intrigued by the competition.\" Kyle continued, his dark eyes studying my face with obvious curiosity.\n\"Records are meant to be broken. Otherwise, they would have never existed in the first place, neither given any importance, no?\"\nKyle nodded, a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth. \"Indeed it does. I look forward to seeing how this semester plays out.\"\nThe conversation was polite but charged with the awareness that we were now direct rivals for the academy’s top position.\nBefore excusing himself, Kyle said, \"Let’s meet up sometime, for some coffee or food.\"\nI nodded my head and replied, \"I’m kind of busy recently. I’ll let you know when I’m free.\"\nI didn’t want to get too close to this guy. I didn’t particularly like him. Just because he was the main character didn’t mean I had to become his babysitter, friend, or ally. At most, we could become acquaintances who maintained polite but distant relations. As long as his goals didn’t go against mine, then we were on the same page, but if they did...then I will put myself first.\nKyle seemed to understand the subtext and nodded before departing with Seraphina trailing behind him like a silent shadow.\nWatching Kyle leave, Elen turned toward me with obvious interest. \"He’s so handsome, isn’t he? I wonder if he has a girlfriend. Aah...those black eyes...they are like the void, so deep.\"\nI scoffed inwardly, not at her first observation of his handsomeness, but at the question she posed. As the protagonist, I knew his halo was practically invincible when it came to attracting romantic interests. His ability to collect admirers was as effortless as breathing.\nWondering if he had a girlfriend was amusing, especially knowing that this guy would eventually accumulate romantic partners like they were collectible Pokémon.Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nI kept this thought to myself and shrugged casually. \"Who knows? Maybe you can ask him directly? He seemed like a nice guy, I’m sure he wouldn’t be harsh to you.\"\nShe shook her head, suddenly bashful. \"I can’t... I’m too shy for something like that.\"\n\"Well, if you’re genuinely interested, you could always find opportunities to interact with him naturally. You’re both Elite-class students, so your paths will cross during joint exercises and competitions.\"\nElen nodded thoughtfully, though her cheeks remained slightly flushed at the suggestion.\nI decided to redirect the conversation away from Kyle’s romantic prospects. \"Speaking of which, what was that thing you wanted to show me earlier? Before the sparring match interrupted our plans.\"\nHer eyes immediately brightened as she remembered her original purpose. \"Oh right! I wanted to show you a really cool shop outside the campus.\"\n\"Oh? You were looking for shops outside the campus? Why?\"\nElen smirked before saying. \"You forgot already? You’ve told me that we should keep our points until at least the next payment, to check if there is any hidden agendas. So, I decided to look for shops that took golden coins instead.\"",

We still had assignments to complete, improving based on feedback from our previous lessons, but those could wait for now.\nAfter about ten minutes of walking from the campus grounds, we stood outside the shop Elen had mentioned earlier.\nThe establishment was quite large and contained an impressive variety of materials and supplies spread across multiple sections.\n\"You like it, don’t you?\" she said with a grin on her face.\nI nodded my head. The place was indeed to my liking, the shop had a diverse inventory of items that would be useful for my upcoming plans.\n\"I stumbled upon this gem during my research. It has all kinds of materials we need for both alchemy and blacksmithing. I figured that before my lessons start, I should invest in some basic materials to get myself going, so I’m not completely clueless when the classes begin.\"\n\"You’re right.

It wasn’t because I would be clueless. Rather, I wanted to test my recently acquired skill. The system had granted me Tier 1 blacksmith knowledge, so I should be able to create Mortal-grade items without issue, at least according to the information in my head.\nElen and I explored the store. She had clearly done her research on appropriate materials for beginner alchemical experiments, and my inherited knowledge guided me toward suitable blacksmithing supplies.\nWithin ten minutes, we had selected and purchased our respective items. However, I noticed Elen’s expression grow conflicted when she paid for her materials. She hesitated over the final amount and seemed to count her coins carefully, which made me question whether her family’s financial situation was as stable as other noble households.\nThe Brightwater family was positioned at the lower end of the aristocratic hierarchy, and perhaps their resources were limited. Her careful budgeting suggested someone who couldn’t afford to make purchasing mistakes.Google seaʀᴄh\n\"Got everything you need?\" I asked casually, not wanting to draw attention to what I’d observed.\n\"Yes, this should be perfect for getting started,\" she replied, though her smile seemed slightly strained.\nI nodded in turn, not wanting to intrude. We weren’t close enough for me to inquire about her family situation, so I decided not to dwell on the matter and focus on my own concerns for now.\nAs I made my way back toward the academy, I spotted two figures I recognized from my family estate. They were among our most powerful guards, both at Transcendent rank. A slight frown formed on my brow as I walked toward them.\nI excused myself from Elen. \"I need to handle something. Take care.\"\n\"See you later,\" she replied with a wave before casting the two guards a quick glance then entering the academy.\nThe guards spotted my approach and walked toward me respectfully.\n\"Young Master,\" they greeted in unison with formal bows.\n\"Why are you here? Did something happen back at the estate?\" I asked immediately, concerned about potential emergencies that might’ve happened at the estate.\nThey shook their heads. \"Nothing happened at the estate, Young Master. We were instructed by Lord Marcus to provide protection for you. As for the specific reason, you can speak to the lord himself and he shall inform you.\"\nI contemplated their words for a moment before responding. \"Alright. I’m assuming you have accommodations arranged? You can’t enter the academy grounds.\"\n\"Yes, Young Master. We have secured lodging in the city.\"\nOne of the guards then retrieved a storage ring and extended it toward me. \"The lord has instructed us to deliver this to you.\"\nI accepted the ring, feeling its weight in my palm. \"What’s inside?\"\n\"We were not informed of the contents, Young Master. Lord Marcus said you would understand once you examined it.\"\n\"How long are you planning to remain here?\"\n\"Until further orders from the lord, Young Master. We are to maintain discrete surveillance and intervene only if you face genuine threats.\"\n\"Discrete surveillance,\" I repeated thoughtfully. \"So you will be following me everywhere?\"\n\"Correct. We will monitor from appropriate distances and positions. As for the academy, we won’t enter. The academy’s own security makes our presence largely precautionary.\"\nI nodded, though I wondered what had prompted my father to suddenly assign Transcendent-rank protection. \"Very well. I’ll contact my father tonight to discuss this arrangement.\"\n\"As you wish, Young Master.\"\nI made my way to my dorm, though I had other matters on my mind. The sudden appearance of these guards was disturbing, even if they claimed nothing had happened. I entered my room and closed the door behind me before taking out my communication crystal to contact my father.\nMy father didn’t respond to my initial request, most likely busy with estate business. So I decided to try reaching my mother instead.\nThankfully, she answered immediately.\n\"Adrian, sweetheart! How lovely to hear from you,\" her cheerful voice came through the crystal, instantly lifting my mood. \"How are your classes going? Are you eating properly? Making friends?\"\nI couldn’t help but smile at her barrage of motherly concerns. \"I’m doing well, Mother. Classes are challenging but manageable, and yes, I’m eating regularly.\"\n\"Oh, I’m so glad to hear that! Awe...I can’t believe my baby boy is finally growing up, I’m going to cry!\"\nMy mother started weeping out of nowhere, and I panicked slightly. \"Mother, why are you crying? Everything is fine!\"\n\"I-I know honey, but just thinking about your chubby cheeks when you were young...\"\nHer personality was sure something, and to be honest this is what me made me truly feel like she was my mother. Whilst, she wasn’t exactly the mother who had given birth to me, her motherly love radiated that warmness that made her feel like one.\nWe continued chatting for a while. As I comforted her, she updated me on gossip, asked about my classmates, and fussed over whether I was getting enough sleep.\n\"Actually, I was hoping to speak with Father, I couldn’t get a hold of him, Is he available?\"\n\"He’s in a meeting with some regional administrators right now, but it should finish within the next few minutes. You know how these political discussions drag on.\"\nAfter a few extra minutes of pleasant conversation, I ended the call with promises to visit soon.\nTrue to her prediction, my father’s communication crystal activated moments later, requesting a connection.\nTime to find out why Transcendent-rank guards had suddenly appeared to watch over me.",

      "content": "Chapter 70: Adrian is Worried [2]\n\"Good afternoon, Adrian.\"\n\"Good afternoon, Father. How was your meeting?\"\nMy father wasn’t surprised that I knew about it, clearly having guessed I’d spoken to my mother first.\n\"It went as well as could be expected. I know you’re surprised about the two guards I sent, so I’ll get straight to the point. Two of our carriages were attacked during transport from Alderton City. Many of our people died and valuable cargos were stolen.\"\nMy eyebrows furrowed at the news. Our family crest was prominently displayed on all our carriages, and for someone to attack them even after seeing that symbol, and still being capable of killing our people, meant these weren’t amateur bandits. This was a premeditated plan executed by competent adversaries.\n\"Is there anyone alive for questioning?\" I asked, though I suspected the answer was no.\n\"None. They either died in the fighting or fled the scene completely. The meeting I just finished was about this exact issue. We need to identify the perpetrators quickly, or this will escalate into a serious problem. The enemy isn’t weak, they deployed multiple Elite-rank fighters and at least two Transcendent-rank awakeners. That’s why I sent you those guards, son. They might target you directly.\"\nI nodded grimly. \"Thank you for the protection, Father.\"\nHaving the backing of a duke certainly had its advantages. Two Transcendent-rank guards protecting me, combined with my current capabilities, made me nearly invincible unless a Commander-rank opponent appeared on the scene or we were fully surrounded.\nThen I asked him about the contents of the storage ring. I had already examined it, my father had sent approximately 50,000 gold coins, which was an enormous sum considering I’d only spent about five hundred coins on mortal-grade materials at the shop with Elen. But the money wasn’t what prompted my question, it was something else.\nThere was also a sword, and I could tell immediately that it was extremely powerful. Since my system couldn’t appraise items it hadn’t given me, I needed to ask about its specifications.\n\"That’s a Rare-ranked sword, son. I commissioned it from the kingdom’s greatest blacksmith the day we began training together. With everything that’s happening, you should keep it close. It’s called Knight’s Wrath, bind it by dropping your blood onto the blade.\"\nI paused, feeling genuinely moved by his foresight and care. The family I had transmigrated into was truly exceptional. A rare ranked sword was an item that transcendent rank beings dreamt of having.\n\"Father, this must have cost a fortune. Thanks a lot.\"\n\"Your safety and success are worth any price, Adrian. Besides, you’ve already proven yourself capable of wielding such equipment. Your bloodline and record-breaking performances at the academy show you won’t let it go to waste.\"\nI examined the weapon more carefully after summoning it from the storage ring. The craftsmanship was extraordinary - every line and curve spoke of masterful technique and premium materials. This wasn’t just equipment; it was a work of art designed for serious combat.\n\"The blade can cut through every Elite-rank defences without difficulty. Against, awakeners at the transcendent rank, it can break through most of their defences. But remember, the sword is only as effective as the person wielding it. Without understanding your sword, you will not be able to truly make it shine.\"\n\"Yes, father. I won’t disappoint you.\"\n\"You already haven’t, son. Your mother and I couldn’t be prouder of what you’ve been doing. Just promise me you’ll be careful. These attacks on our people suggest someone is testing our family’s defences. I don’t want you taking unnecessary risks, and if possible, reduce your hunts in the forest.\"\n\"I promise to be more cautious. The guards you sent will help ensure that.\"\n\"Good. Is there anything else you need? \"\nI considered his offer carefully before shaking my head. \"Not at the moment. The financial support and equipment should cover my immediate needs. If the situation changes, I’ll contact you immediately.\"\n\"Very well. Take care of yourself, Adrian. And remember, you’re not just representing yourself at that academy. You carry the Blackwood name and everything it stands for.\"\n\"I won’t forget, Father.\"\nAfter ending the communication, I sat in contemplative silence, thinking about who would possibly want to attack the blackwood family. After ravaging through my memories, I decided to not dawdle on the matter. Whilst the suspects where very obvious, pinpointing to a specific suspect was the issue.\nThe original Adrian had been fortunate to have such parents, even if he’d been too immature to appreciate them properly. I wouldn’t make that mistake.\nI retrieved Knight’s Wrath from the storage ring, feeling its perfect weight and balance. Time to bind this weapon and prepare for whatever challenges lay ahead.\nI cut my fingertip with the blade’s edge, letting a small drop of blood fall onto the cold metal. The crimson droplet landed on the steel before being absorbed immediately into the weapon’s surface.\nAn intense light suddenly erupted from the sword for a brief moment before fading back to normal. While the weapon appeared unchanged externally, I felt a profound shift in our connection. It no longer felt like just any sword, it was unmistakably mine now.\nThis was the beauty of blood-bound items. The weapon would now respond to my specific mana signature and will. No one else would be able to wield Knight’s Wrath with the same effectiveness, even if they somehow managed to steal it from me.\nI gave the sword a few practice swings, marvelling at how naturally it felt. The balance point had shifted slightly to accommodate my preferred grip.\nMy father had truly given me something extraordinary. This weapon would serve me well through whatever challenges the academy and the wider world might present.\nWith Knight’s Wrath properly bound and my new guards stationed nearby, I felt more prepared than ever to face the uncertainties ahead.\nI stood up from the couch preparing to head to section G to book a room to start practising using my blacksmithing tools.\nThe ideas in my mind were wild, and I couldn’t wait to start implementing them.\nʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ",

      "content": "Chapter 71: Blacksmithing Room [1]\nI made my way towards Section G, but this time it wasn’t for class or normal training.\nI scanned my card on the door reader, hearing the mechanism click as access was granted.\n[-1,000 Points]\nOnce inside the room, I was greeted with a sight that immediately impressed me.\nThe blacksmithing workshop was spacious and meticulously organized, designed for both safety and efficiency.\nDominating the centre of the room stood a massive forge, its iron body blackened from countless hours of use. The forge’s mouth glowed with steady heat, maintained by a combination of magical enhancement and traditional coal. Above it, a crystal drew smoke and sparks upward, keeping the air breathable despite the intense heat.\nTo the left of the forge, a heavy anvil sat mounted on a thick wooden stump, its steel surface polished smooth from years of hammering. Arranged nearby were hammers of various weights and sizes, from delicate finishing tools to massive sledgehammers.\nAlong the walls, tool racks held an impressive array of specialized equipment: tongs in different shapes for gripping hot metal, files for smoothing surfaces, chisels for detailed work, and measuring instruments for accurate crafting. A large water trough sat ready for quenching heated metals, its surface occasionally rippling from the workshop’s vibrations.\nWorkbenches lined two walls, their surfaces scarred but sturdy, equipped with vises for securing projects during detailed work. Raw materials were organized in clearly labelled sections - iron bars, steel billets, various alloys. These materials were just the basics, and nothing like the items that I had bought from the shop.\nThe lighting was excellent, combining natural illumination from high windows with magical orbs that could be adjusted for different tasks. Ventilation systems kept the air moving, preventing the accumulation of dangerous fumes while maintaining the necessary heat levels around the forge.\nSafety equipment was prominently displayed and easily accessible - leather aprons, protective gloves, eye shields, and burn treatment supplies. The academy clearly took student welfare seriously in these potentially hazardous workshops.\nThis was a tier 1 facility that could accommodate everything that a tier 1 blacksmith would use, it was by no means comparable to the more advanced facilities available at the academy.\nIt was the most basic blacksmithing room in the academy.\n------\nI took out the items I had purchased and placed them carefully on the workbench. I had bought a kilogram of\nMithril.\nthe legendary lightweight metal that was stronger than steel despite feeling almost weightless in the hand. Perfect for creating things like delicate Armor that wouldn’t restrict movement, blacksmiths prized it for crafting mail that felt like silk but could stop arrows cold.\nI had also acquired a kilogram of\nOrichalcum\nwire. The golden metal that naturally channeled magical energy with remarkable efficiency. It was just like copper for conducting electricity back in the real world,\nOrichalcum\nIdeal for crafting spell-focus weapons, enchanted tools, and items that stored mana for later use. The metal glowed faintly when magic flowed through it, making it easy to monitor energy flow during the crafting process.\nA kilogram of\nQuicksilver Steel\n, which was a Mercury-infused alloy that’s incredibly flexible yet strong. Weapons made from it can bend without breaking and return to shape. It was popular for whips, flexible blades, and adaptive Armor.Finally, I had purchased a chunk of\nResonite.\nThe peculiar stone that vibrated at specific frequencies when exposed to magical energy. This was the core component used in communication crystals that allowed long-distance speaking. The stone could amplify both sound and magical signals across vast distances with proper preparation.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nI had bought these materials not for a single project, but for multiple ambitious undertakings that would push my blacksmithing knowledge to its limits.\nThe Mithril would serve as a stable base material for most of my projects. Its unique properties made it invaluable as a foundation component, lightweight enough not to burden the user, yet strong enough to maintain structural integrity under stress.\nThe Orichalcum wire was another essential element. Most magical items needed proper mana conduction channels, otherwise their effects would be severely diminished. The golden metal’s natural affinity for magical energy made it perfect for creating the internal networks that would power my creations.\nThe Resonite was where things became both tricky and exciting. With this stone, I could attempt to create something revolutionary, a communication device far more advanced than the basic crystals currently available. The existing communication crystals were essentially magical versions of old rotary phones from Earth, functional but primitive.\nOne of my ambitious goal was to craft an enhanced communication device with multiple frequency channels, possibly even visual transmission capabilities if I could integrate the Resonite properly with Orichalcum conducting networks.\nBut another project was what really excited me, a flying sword controlled through mana manipulation. Naturally, awakeners gained the ability to fly at Royal rank, but I wanted that capability much earlier. The advantages of aerial mobility in this world were enormous, and the applications for exploration, combat, and escape scenarios were limitless.\nPlus, I had to admit, it would look incredibly cool to casually summon a flying sword for transportation.\nThe technical challenges would be difficult to navigate but it would also be fun and very useful. I’d need to create a stable levitation enchantment, integrate responsive control systems, and ensure the sword could bear my weight safely during flight. The Mithril would provide the structural foundation, while Orichalcum networks would channel my mana into the levitation mechanisms.\nWhile I had all these ambitious thoughts, attempting them immediately would be impractical. They were projects that needed more planning, it wasn’t easy to create them. For now, I wanted to create something immediately useful and within my current capabilities.\nA crossbow.\nIn a world dominated by swords and shields, the crossbow represented a revolution. No years of training required, no master archer’s strength needed, just a trigger, a bolt, and precision at distance.\nThe crossbow I intended to craft wouldn’t be useful against higher-rank opponents, but that wasn’t my target market. I planned to design it for Noble-rank and Elite-rank awakeners with lower-tier bloodlines, a substantial demographic that would represent both an incredible business opportunity and a manageable first project.\nHopefully the crossbow would evolve to suit higher rankers as my knowledge and strength increased, but for now this was what I was capable.",

      "content": "Chapter 72: Blacksmithing Room [2]\nCrossbows were effective for fundamental reasons I understood from personal experience. My father back on Earth had been an antique collector who’d insisted on showing me his hunts with historical weapons during our wilderness trips. The experience had been educational, if unconventional.\nUnfortunately, I had never participated in the hunts themselves, but I did watch. Anyways, the mechanics were straightforward: the string gets drawn back using hand strength, a lever, or crank mechanism, then locked into a catch called the sear.\nA short projectile , called a bolt sits in the groove along the stock in front of the drawn string. When the trigger releases the sear, the string snaps forward, transferring its stored energy into the bolt and propelling it toward the target.\nBased on these principles, I could create a crossbow using my current Tier 1 blacksmithing knowledge. The finished product would be Mortal-grade quality, but still effective enough to help kill Noble-rank monsters, exactly what my intended customers would need.\nI began sketching the basic design on a piece of parchment, calculating the optimal dimensions for the stock, the tension requirements for the string mechanism, and the trigger assembly that would make the weapon reliable and safe to operate.\nAfter I was done with the first step, which was the design of the cross-bow, it was time to get to work.\nBefore I started working, a notification flashed before my eyes.\n[Daily Login Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your daily reward?]\n[Yes | No]\nAfter pressing yes, another notification appeared that made my heart skip a beat.\n[Congratulations! You have received: Aspect Rank Upgrade Card]\n[Aspect Rank Upgrade Card]\n[Grade: Rare]\n[Details: Increases the rank of any chosen aspect by one rank. The maximum rank aspect is Elite.]\nI stared at the notification in complete disbelief.\nAn Aspect Rank Upgrade Card was beyond valuable, I didn’t even know such a powerful item was within the available rewards. This card was practically system breaking, it was known that aspects and echoes could not increase in rank no matter what. Because even killing a stronger, more powerful version of the same beast you had killed when you attained that aspect, it still didn’t guarantee you would get the same aspect.\nI currently possessed two aspects: Silent Predator and Serpent Scales, both at Elite rank. Using this card would elevate one of them to Transcendent rank.\nThe implications hit me like a thunderbolt. I already had a Transcendent-rank echo, and with a Transcendent-rank aspect to complement it, I could possibly fight and defeat Transcendent-rank opponents even at my current overall strength level.\nThis daily reward was absolutely extraordinary.\nI didn’t hesitate for even a moment. The choice was obvious.\nWhile Serpent Scales was useful for poison resistance and related abilities, Silent Predator offered far more versatility in combat, stealth, and general survival situations.\nI activated the card immediately.\n[Aspect Rank Upgrade Card has been used!]\n[Select an Aspect]\n→ Silent Predator (Elite)\n→\nSerpent Scales (Elite)\nI pressed on Silent Predator without any hesitation.\n[Silent Predator has been upgraded to Transcendent rank!]\nThe transformation happened instantaneously as I checked my status.\n[Host: Adrian Blackwood]\n[Bloodline: Supreme Vampire - 20%]\n[Rank: Elite]\n[Traits: Blood Control (2nd Order, Lvl.3), Supernatural Physique (1st Order, Lvl.3), Blood Enhancement(1st Order, Lvl.1), Blood Trail (2nd Order, Lvl.1)]\n[Aspect: Serpent Scales(Elite), Silent Predator (Transcendent)]\n[Echo: Stone Armor(Transcendent)]\nI checked the details of my evolved aspect, and the results were very satisfying.\n---\n[Aspect: Silent Predator]\n[Rank: Transcendent]\n[Type: Active]\n[Details: Grants the ability to camouflage with the surroundings for five minutes. Your presence becomes nearly non-visible for those at similar strength, as for those at weaker strength, you become invisible. Your breath, scent, and visibility are all reduced to imperceptible levels for nearby enemies. Attacking or being attacked during activation cancels the aspect. Cooldown: 6 hours]\n---\nThe duration of the aspect has increased by five times, the cooldown has been reduced by two times and the overall effect had improved. My presence to those weaker than me would be completely non-existent, as for those at similar rank, it would be difficult for them to find me, unless they have some sort of ability to detect me.\nAfter examining my enhanced aspect, I refocused on the task at hand and began working on the crossbow project.\nI started by heating a piece of steel in the forge, watching as it gradually shifted from dull grey to bright orange. Using tongs, I carefully shaped what would become the crossbow’s prod, the horizontal bow portion that would store and release the string’s energy. The metal needed to be strong enough to handle repeated tension cycles while maintaining flexibility.\nWorking the heated steel against the anvil, I gradually curved it into the proper arc, testing the spring tension as it cooled.\nThe hammering echoed through the workshop as I refined the shape, drawing on both my inherited blacksmithing knowledge and memories of examining historical crossbows.\nAfter I was satisfied with the shape, I moved on the next task.\nInstead of creating a traditional mechanical trigger system, I decided to incorporate a mana-based amplification mechanism that would make this crossbow not only new, but also unique and wanted in the market.\nI began crafting the sear, the catch mechanism that would hold the string, using a combination of steel and thin Orichalcum wire. The golden metal’s natural mana conductivity would allow the sear to respond directly to magical energy input rather than physical trigger pressure. I carefully wove the Orichalcum through the steel framework, creating conductive pathways that would channel mana throughout the mechanism.\nThe stock required similar treatment. I carved it from hardwood, then inlaid delicate Orichalcum wire patterns along its length. These channels would distribute mana evenly from the user’s grip point to the sear mechanism, ensuring consistent energy transfer. The wire pattern resembled intricate filigree work, both functional and aesthetically pleasing.\nFor the string, I wove together traditional bowstring materials with Orichalcum threads. This hybrid construction would allow the string to store and amplify the user’s mana input, converting mana into additional kinetic force when released. The more mana channelled into the system, the more powerful the bolt’s impact would be.\nThe breakthrough came in designing the mana regulation system. I created small Resonite chips and embedded them at key points along the Orichalcum network. These would vibrate at different frequencies based on mana input levels, providing feedback to help users gauge their energy expenditure and prevent overloading the weapon.\nThɪs\nA low mana input would produce a standard shot comparable to a shot capable of injuring noble-rank beasts. Medium input would significantly increase bolt velocity and penetrating power. High mana investment could easy punch through Noble-rank defenses, making this weapon dangerous even to opponents above the user’s normal capabilities.\nThe beauty of this design lay in its scalability. Weak awakeners could use minimal mana for basic functionality, while stronger users could channel substantial energy for devastating attacks. The weapon would literally grow with its owner’s capabilities like other magical items, which made it more powerful than usual crossbows.\nSafety mechanisms were crucial. I incorporated Resonite warning stones that would glow if mana input exceeded safe thresholds, preventing the weapon from exploding in the user’s hands. The Orichalcum channels were designed to safely disperse excess energy if overloaded.",

      "content": "Chapter 73: Final Product, Testing Phase.\nTesting the completed trigger mechanism, I channelled a small amount of mana through the grip. The Orichalcum wires glowed faintly as energy travelled to the sear, which released smoothly without requiring any physical pressure. The Resonite feedback chips hummed quietly, indicating successful energy transfer.\nThis crossbow would revolutionize ranged combat for Noble to Elite-rank awakeners, offering them a weapon that could compete with higher-tier opponents through clever application of their existing mana reserves.\nWhat made this product particularly valuable was my ability to mass produce it. After creating the prototype and confirming its effectiveness, I could send the design to my father and have our estate’s craftsmen begin manufacturing copies.\nI wasn’t starting from scratch or needing to negotiate with other influential families for production assistance. The advantages of being part of a ducal house were truly countless, we had the resources, skilled workers, and distribution networks already in place.\nI inspected the crossbow with satisfaction. This specimen had cost approximately 50 gold coins in materials and taken only thirty minutes to craft. The cost-to-performance ratio was excellent for what would likely become a premium weapon.\nFurthermore, the cost was so high was because I didn’t have the proper channels to buy the items I needed in bulk. When that was put into perspective, the price would become even cheaper, resulting in a higher net profit yield.\nAfter testing the structural strength of various components, I was satisfied with most aspects except for the bolt groove, the channel where arrows were placed. The current design had a fixed size, which meant users couldn’t accommodate different arrow types. There were heavy bolts for Armor penetration, light bolts for speed and accuracy, specialized bolts with different heads, but my current groove could only accept one standard size.\nI decided to incorporate an adaptive mechanism inspired by the lock-and-key enzyme system from biology. In living organisms, enzymes have active sites that change shape to perfectly accommodate their specific substrate molecules. The enzyme’s flexible structure allows it to \"embrace\" the correct molecule while rejecting others that don’t match.\nOf course, the crossbow would reject structures that aren’t like the arrows, but apart from that it would accept most arrows.\nI could create a similar system using the flexible\nQuicksilver Steel\nwhich was known for its flexible yet strong mercury-infused alloy.\nThe bolt groove would have flexible walls that could detect the dimensions of whatever projectile was inserted and automatically adjust to grip it perfectly. Small sensors would measure the bolt’s weight and dimensions, then signal the Orichalcum-enhanced walls to shift into the optimal configuration.\nThe mechanism would work through mana feedback loops. When a bolt was placed in the groove, tiny Resonite crystals would vibrate at frequencies corresponding to the projectile’s physical properties. These vibrations would trigger the shaped memory alloy components to contract or expand, creating a custom-fitted channel for each individual bolt.\nThis adaptive groove would accommodate everything from heavy siege bolts to light arrows, maximizing the weapon’s versatility. Users could switch between ammunition types mid-combat without needing different weapons or manual adjustments.\nThe engineering challenge excited me immensely. I immediately began working on the prototype mechanism, carefully shaping the memory alloy strips and positioning the sensor crystals. The groove would need multiple adjustment points to handle the wide variety of bolt designs available in this world.\nCreating this adaptive system would increase production costs, but the added versatility would justify premium pricing. A crossbow that could use any available ammunition would be an absolute game changer to adventurers and guards who couldn’t predict what situations they might encounter.\nI heated the forge again and began crafting the delicate components needed for this innovative bolt-fitting system.\nI finished crafting the second prototype just as my reserved time in the blacksmithing workshop expired. The adaptive bolt groove mechanism had taken longer than expected, but the results were worth the effort. The crossbow could now accommodate various ammunition types seamlessly.\nAfter cleaning my workspace and securing my tools, I gathered both prototypes and left the academy grounds to test them properly. Field testing would reveal any flaws that the basic workshop examination might have missed.\nThe moment I stepped outside the academy gates, my assigned guards approached immediately.\n\"Young Master.\" They both saluted me with respect.\n\"I’m heading to the forest, I have a weapon that I want to test.\"\nBoth guards looked deeply troubled by my request.\n\"Young master...Given the recent attacks on your family’s carriages, perhaps testing your weapon within the academy’s safer training grounds would be more prudent.\" The guard said with obvious concern laced in his voice.\n\"The risk is manageable,\" I replied firmly. \"We’ll stay in the forest’s outer perimeter where only Noble-rank beasts roam. Nothing there should pose a serious threat to any of us.\"\nThe guards exchanged meaningful glances, clearly uncomfortable with my decision but recognizing they couldn’t directly refuse their lord’s only son.\n\"Very well, Young Master,\" the second guard said reluctantly. \"We’ll maintain close proximity and retreat immediately if we encounter anything suspicious.\"\n\"Agreed. This is purely a weapons test, not a hunting expedition.\"\nWe made our way toward the forest that bordered the academy grounds. The outer sections were relatively safe, used regularly by students for practical exercises and material gathering and by low-rank hunters that hunted for their living.\nAs we walked, I mentally reviewed the crossbow’s specifications. The mana amplification system needed real-world validation, and the adaptive bolt groove required testing with different ammunition types under actual field conditions.ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nOn the way to the forest, we stopped by a weapon’s shop to purchase the different arrows I wanted to test before continuing on our way to the forest.\nDespite being in the city, the guards still maintained alertness in case of any surprise attacks in the city. Although such attacks seldom happened, they did happen, so it wasn’t an impossibility.\nAfter some time, we arrived at the border of the city. We were now officially outside the city, and in the monster infested forest.\nA smirk formed on my face, as I prepared to test my new inventions.",

      "content": "Chapter 74: Testing Phase\nSoon enough, I encountered my first target, a Lazarus Sloth, the same type of creature I had faced when I first arrived in this world.\nI retrieved my crossbow from the storage ring, immediately noticing my guards studying the weapon with curious expressions. They had clearly never seen anything quite like it before, with its Orichalcum inlays and unconventional design.\nWhilst it looked like a bow, it certainly wasn’t a conventional one.\nTaking aim at the Lazarus Sloth from approximately 50 meters away, I prepared to test one of the key variables I wanted to examine, effective range at different distances.\nI channelled a minuscule portion of mana into the weapon, equivalent to what a Noble-rank awakener would typically invest in a basic attack. The Orichalcum wires glowed faintly as energy flowed through the conductive channels.\nThe bolt flew with remarkable speed, far exceeding what a conventional crossbow or bow could achieve. The mana amplification system was clearly working as designed, converting my magical energy into additional kinetic force.\nThe projectile struck the Lazarus Sloth torso with the combo of precision and power. The creature, which would normally require multiple arrows to bring down, collapsed immediately. The bolt had punched clean through its defences.\nA smile formed on my face at the effects of the crossbow which certainly met my expectations. \"Bingo.\"\n\"That was impressive, Young Master,\" one of the guards commented, his eyes on the crossbow.\nThe guard wasn’t impressed by my power, he was impressed by the weapon. It’s design was foreign and certainly spectacular, I can see it in his eyes.\nThe test had exceeded my expectations. At 50 meters with minimal mana input, the crossbow had delivered lethal force against a Noble-rank target. This performance suggested that with higher mana investment or against closer targets, the current weapon I had designed could potentially threaten even Elite-rank opponents.\nI needed to test different ranges and mana input levels to fully understand the crossbow’s capabilities and limitations.\nAfter my testing for another thirty minutes, carefully different ranges, mana outputs, and the weapon’s limitations through encounters with various Noble-rank beasts.\nThe crossbow’s optimal range proved to be 40 meters, where it delivered maximum impact with minimal mana investment. At 80 meters - the weapon’s maximum effective range - it still dealt significant damage to Noble-rank enemies, though accuracy became more challenging.\nAfter completing tests against Noble-rank creatures, I decided it was time to evaluate performance against Elite-rank beasts.\nMy guards immediately looked reluctant.\n\"Young Master,\" the senior guard said with obvious concern, \"engaging Elite-rank beasts would require moving deeper into the forest, further from the city’s safety. Given the recent attacks on our family’s interests...\"\n\"It’s fine. We won’t take long,\" I replied firmly.\n\"Perhaps we could conduct those tests ourselves and report the results to you? This would ensure your safety while still gathering the data you need.\" The second guard suggested with a troubled look.\nI shook my head. \"I just created this weapon. I need to understand its capabilities first-hand, not through second-hand reports.\"\nThe guards exchanged resigned glances. They couldn’t directly refuse, but their discomfort was evident. After a moment of silent communication, they sighed and decided to simply increase their vigilance.\n\"Very well, Young Master. But we remain alert for any signs of danger.\"\nWe began walking deeper into the forest where Elite-rank creatures made their territory. The guards maintained heightened awareness of our surroundings.\nAs we walked, one guard’s curiosity got the best of him. \"Young Master, what exactly is this weapon? It resembles a bow but operates differently.\"\n\"It’s called a crossbow,\" I explained. \"It functions similarly to a bow but delivers superior power, speed, and accuracy through mechanical advantage and mana amplification.\"\nTheir interest in the weapon’s design helped ease the tension as we ventured into more dangerous territory.\nI tested the crossbow against Elite-rank monsters, but the results revealed significant limitations. Even with increased mana input, the weapon wasn’t as effective as I’d hoped against these stronger opponents.\nThe primary issue appeared to be the arrows themselves, they simply weren’t durable enough to maintain their effectiveness against Elite-rank defences. The standard bolts I was using would deform or shatter on impact with tougher hide and resistance, reducing their penetrating power substantially.\nI couldn’t solve this problem by simply crafting superior arrows either. The crossbow’s current construction wouldn’t be able to handle the stress of launching heavier, more durable projectiles at the velocities needed for Elite-rank combat. The weapon’s frame and string system would likely fail under that kind of strain.\nThe arrows did inflict damage, each shot carved through the beast’s defences and drew blood, but the wounds weren’t deep enough to be decisive. It took approximately thirty shots to finally bring down a single Elite-rank creature, which was decent, but now what I wanted.ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nMy guards watched with interest as I tested different mana input levels and firing angles. They provided tactical support by keeping other creatures at bay while I conducted my extended field test.\nDespite the weapon’s limitations against Elite-rank opponents, I was satisfied with the overall performance. Against Noble-rank targets, the crossbow had performed admirably with excellent range and stopping power. For my intended market, Elite-rank awakeners with weaker bloodlines, this weapon would still provide significant advantages against appropriate opponents.\nThe testing had also revealed clear upgrade paths for future iterations. I would need to strengthen the crossbow’s frame using better materials, possibly incorporating more Mithril into the construction. The string system would require reinforcement to handle more powerful ammunition. Additionally, I’d be cool to develop specialized bolts designed specifically for Elite-rank combat.\n\"We should head back, Young Master,\" one guard suggested as I finished documenting the weapon’s performance. \"We’ve been in Elite territory for some time. The beasts themselves wouldn’t be an issue, but if our enemies are lurking nearby, it would be troublesome.\"\nI nodded, storing the crossbow and remaining ammunition. The field test had provided valuable data, and I was eager to begin designing improvements for the next prototype.\n\"Hehe, where do you think you’re going?\" A voice suddenly echoed through the clearing.",

      "content": "Chapter 75: Ambush [1]\nHearing the bone chilling chuckle, Knight’s Wrath immediately appeared in my hands as my eyes darted toward the source of that mocking chuckle.\nA figure slowly emerged from behind the trees, walking casually with a dagger gleaming in his grip and a black mask concealing his face.\nMy guards immediately formed a protective formation around me, their weapons drawn as they scanned for additional threats. Their instincts proved correct, as more enemies slowly began appearing from the surrounding forest.\nNearly ten people materialized from concealment. Two radiated the unmistakable aura of Transcendent rank, while the rest seemed to be Elite-rank awakeners.\nThis was a formidable force anywhere in the kingdom. Whoever had sent them was clearly targeting our family specifically, and they possessed resources that few organizations could muster.\n\"Well, well, the young Duke’s son, out for a pleasant stroll with only two guards. How... convenient.\"\nOne of my guards stepped forward slightly. \"You’re making a grave mistake. Attack the heir of House Blackwood, and Duke Marcus will hunt you to the ends of the continent.\"\nThe leader laughed coldly. \"Duke Marcus will be too busy mourning his dead son to hunt anyone. Besides, accidents happen in dangerous forests all the time.\"\n\"Quit the useless talking, you aren’t normal bandits. Who sent you?\"\n\"Oh? The notorious young master seems to be in such a hurry. Does it matter who sent us? You won’t live long enough to report back anyway. Haha.\"\nA frown formed on my face, as the Transcendent-rank enemies began closing the circle around us.\n\"Lex and I will hold the two guards. As for the rest of you, deal with the kid. Be careful and don’t underestimate him, he isn’t weak. Also, make sure that he stays alive, is that understood?\" the leader ordered.\n\"Yes boss!\" The elite-rank awakeners shouted in unison, as a grin formed on the faces of many.\nMy guards tightened their formation, but ten opponents including two Transcendent made this nearly impossible odds...at least in their eyes.\nOne of my guards frowned and whispered urgently, \"Young Master, we’ll create an opening for you. Take the chance to escape, we’ll delay them as long as possible.\"\nThe other nodded grimly in agreement. They understood this would be a brutal fight with uncertain survival odds.\nI smiled calmly and replied, \"Relax. They’re merely two Transcendent beings and some Elite-rank fodder. Nothing worth stressing over.\"\nMy guards looked visibly shocked, probably thinking fear had addled my judgment. Before they could voice their concerns, the two Transcendent attackers launched their assault, forcing my protectors to engage defensively.\nI activated my Blood Control trait, feeling the familiar surge of enhanced circulation flooding my system with power. My Transcendent-rank Silent Predator aspect remained ready as a trump card, while my Transcendent-rank Echo abilities waited to be unleashed.\nThe Elite-rank enemies approached with confident strides, clearly expecting me to be an easy capture.\nI raised Knight’s Wrath, its Rare-rank enchantments brimming with power as I prepared to deal with eight elite-rank assassins.\nThe eight Elite-rank awakeners smirked and chuckled as they closed the distance between the both of us.\n\"Just give up now, pretty boy, surrender peacefully and we won’t have to mess up that handsome face of yours.\" One of them called out mockingly.\nI couldn’t help but respond with equal mockery. \"Funny hearing about faces from people hiding behind masks. What’s the matter? Are your faces so ugly that even your mothers couldn’t love them?\"\nThe laughter stopped abruptly. The assassin in question visibly tensed, his relaxed posture shifting to that of anger.\nI had clearly struck a sensitive nerve.\n\"You little bastard! I’ll teach you some respect!\"\nHe broke formation and charged directly at me, his weapon raised aggressively. His companions called out warnings about maintaining their strategy, but his anger had clouded his judgement.\nI shifted into a defensive stance with Knight’s Wrath, letting him close the distance while I prepared my counterattack. His rage had made him predictable, and predictable enemies were easy to exploit.\nThe solo attacker’s blade came down in a powerful overhead strike, putting his full Elite-rank strength behind the blow.\n\"Take this!\"\nThe assassin wasn’t worried about hurting me, clearly he knew that I wouldn’t be weak enough to not hold it.\nWhich begged the question, how did they know that I wasn’t weak?\nThe only possibly reason I could think of was the academy. Clearly, they had gotten some information from the academy about my capability and power. Thankfully, they didn’t know my full capability.\nI sidestepped at the last moment, letting his momentum carry him directly into my blade’s path. Our eyes met for a split second as his body aligned perfectly with my strike position.\nWithout hesitation, I drove Knight’s Wrath forward with devastating accuracy. The Rare-rank blade, enhanced by my Blood Control and superior positioning, severed his neck cleanly in a single motion.\nThud!\nHis head dropped to the forest floor with a wet impact. The headless body stood for a moment before collapsing, releasing a fountain of crimson that soaked the earth beneath us.\nI turned calmly to face the remaining seven assassins, who had frozen in complete shock.\nThe confidence that had marked their approach moments before evaporated entirely. They stared at their fallen comrade, then at me, clearly struggling to process what had just occurred.\n\"Impossible,\" one whispered. \"He’s just Elite rank...he shouldn’t be killing him so quickly.\"\nThe reality of their situation was beginning to dawn on them. Blood dripped steadily from Knight’s Wrath as I held it ready, my eyes tracking each of their movements.\nOne of the remaining assassins pointed directly at Knight’s Wrath, his eyes squinting as he studied the weapon more carefully.\n\"Wait, that sword... it’s not ordinary. Look at the craftsmanship,\"Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nAnother assassin leaned forward, trying to get a better view. \"You’re right. That’s no Enhanced-rank weapon. The aura it’s giving off...\"\n\"It’s a Rare-rank sword!\" the first one exclaimed, his voice mixing fear with disbelief. \"An academy with access to Rare-rank equipment...being the duke’s son surely has merit.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 76: Ambush [2]\nThe revelation sent visible ripples of unease through their group. Rare-rank weapons were treasures that most awakeners could only dream of owning. They represented not just superior craftsmanship, but magical enhancement that could bridge significant gaps in combat ability.\n\"No wonder he cut through Marcus so easily,\" another muttered. \"A Rare-rank blade in the hands of an Elite-rank awakener...\"\nThe two Transcendent assassins continued their fierce battle with my guards in my peripheral vision. My protectors were fighting desperately, using every technique at their disposal just to hold back the superior opponents while praying I could handle my own situation.\nThe seven remaining Elite-rank assassins huddled together, whispering adjustments to their plans. Their colleague’s earlier reckless confidence had been replaced by caution. They understood now that a solo frontal assault would only result in more unnecessary deaths.\nBut their newfound prudence wouldn’t save them.\nAll seven launched their coordinated attack simultaneously, approaching from multiple angles to overwhelm my defences. Their positioning was professional, they had clearly worked together before, timing their strikes to eliminate escape routes.\nI didn’t wait for them to close the distance. Instead, I surged forward aggressively, every muscle fibre responded with strength and speed as increased blood pressure supercharged my physical capabilities.\nI activated Blood Enhancement on Knight’s Wrath as well, the Rare-rank blade humming with amplified power as my trait merged with its existing enchantments.\nTwo assassins blocked my direct path, their weapons raised to intercept my charge.\nI activated my Typhoon Pendant without hesitation. The magical artifact released a concentrated hurricane force in a straight line, devastating wind pressure erupting from my pendant.\nThe two assassins caught in the hurricane’s path were lifted off their feet like leaves in a storm. They crashed through multiple trees with bone-shattering impacts, their bodies disappearing into the forest depths amid splintering wood and flying debris.\nThe remaining five assassins pressed their attack from every other direction, refusing to let the spectacle distract them from their mission. Their discipline was admirable, even as their comrades were being brutalized.\nThe first assassin reached me from the left, his blade aimed at my ribs. I twisted away from his strike while bringing Knight’s Wrath around in a perfect arc.\nWhoosh!\nThe Null Strike’s first form activated, my blade cutting through his defences like they were paper. His torso separated cleanly, blood spraying across the forest floor.\nA second attacker came from behind, thinking my momentum would leave me vulnerable. I spun to face him.\nNull Strike’s first form flowed seamlessly once again into my counterattack, bisecting him before he could complete his own strike.\nThe third assassin approached from my right flank, coordinating with a fourth who attacked from directly ahead. I ducked under the right attacker’s swing while driving Knight’s Wrath upward through his chest cavity. The blade emerged from his back in a fountain of crimson. Without pausing, I pivoted and delivered a horizontal slash that caught the fourth assassin across his midsection, the Null Strike technique ensuring fatal damage despite his desperate attempt to block.\nThree bodies hit the ground in rapid succession, their blood mixing with the earth beneath my feet.\nFour assassins remained. Two were the ones I had thrown into the trees with my Typhoon Pendant, they were struggling to stand, their bodies battered and likely suffering from multiple fractures. The other two stood frozen in shock, unable to process how quickly their assault had been dismantled.\n\"This is impossible,\" one of the uninjured assassins whispered, his weapon trembling in his grip. \"He’s moving like a Transcendent...yet he is only an elite-ranker.\"\nHis companion took an involuntary step backward. \"We need to retreat. This intelligence was completely wrong.\"\nThe two injured assassins were attempting to re-join the fight despite their obvious pain, but their movements were slow and uncoordinated. One was holding his left arm, while the other had blood trickling from his mouth.\nI stood among the corpses of their fallen comrades, Knight’s Wrath dripping crimson onto the forest floor.\nWith cold eyes and a chilling tone I said. \"Your intelligence network needs improvement, did you really think a Duke’s heir would be defenceless?\"\nThey looked visibly horrified by the outcome of their assault that turned into a massacre. What made them even more troubled was the fact that their leaders were not nearby.\nMy guards had led the transcendent rank awakeners further away from us, so they had no idea what had happened here. My guards had gambled, but I couldn’t blame them, nor would I blame them.\nOne of them immediately grabbed his communication crystal with trembling hands. \"Help, this kid is a mons—ugh!\"\nBefore he could finish his desperate plea, I activated my\n{Blood Control}\ntrait and restricted the flow of blood to his heart. The significant power gap between us made this technique devastatingly effective. Against a more powerful opponent, such an attack would have been impossible.\nThe assassin immediately went into cardiac arrest, clutching his chest as his heart struggled against my control over his blood. His remaining teammates stared in confusion, unsure what was happening but knowing I was responsible for their teammate’s sudden collapse.\nWoosh!\nThe distance between us closed as I sprang towards him and with a quick thrust of Knight’s Wrath he was dead. His nearby companion barely had time to register the death before my blade found his throat as well.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nSpurt!\nTwo assassins remained, both injured from my earlier Typhoon Pendant attack. They could barely stand, let alone mount any meaningful resistance.\nI dashed toward them with the intent of finishing them off, I had to help my guards against the two transcendent assassins.\nAs I closed the distance, I found them standing motionless seemingly accepting their inevitable fate with resignation.\nOnce I was within attacking range, one of them looked up with a blood-stained smirk.\n\"Go to hell,\" he snarled.\nBells rang in my brain as my vampire instincts flared with urgent warning, something was wrong. His confident expression despite his imminent death suggested that he had a final gambit.",

      "content": "Chapter 77: Death of A Transcendent\nBOOM!\nBoth assassins’ bodies detonated simultaneously in a devastating explosion of blood, flesh, and bone fragments. The suicide attack sent a shockwave of debris and shrapnel racing toward me at lethal velocity.\nTime seemed to slow as my survival instincts kicked into overdrive. Without conscious thought, I activated my Stone Armor, the Transcendent-rank Echo.\nThe armour materialized around my body just as the explosion’s full force reached me. The armour covered every inch of my form, creating an impenetrable barrier between my flesh and the deadly blast.\nThe twin explosions hammered against my defences with tremendous force. I felt the impact through the armour, it would have certainly injured my unprotected body. The attack was akin to that of a transcendent rank being.\nThe plates absorbed the energy, dispersing the explosive force across their supernatural durability.\nSmoke and debris filled the air around me as the echoes of the blast faded.\nAs the smoke cleared, I examined my Stone Armor carefully. The Transcendent-rank protection had held perfectly, not a single crack or chip marred its surface. The armour had completely negated what should have been a fatal attack.\nI dismissed the Echo ability. The assassins’ final gambit had failed, leaving only scorched earth and scattered remains where they had once stood.\nMy guards were still engaged with the two Transcendent leaders, but these suicide bombers had been neutralized completely.\nThe explosion had been deafeningly loud. I was certain the Transcendent-rank assassins knew something had gone catastrophically wrong with their plan. Without wasting time, I sprinted toward the sounds of ongoing combat approximately 500 meters from my position.\nAs I burst into the clearing, both the assassins and my guards showed visible surprise at my arrival. The enemy leaders’ eyes widened as they processed my uninjured appearance - they had clearly expected the suicide bombers to eliminate me.\n\"Young Master, what are you doing here? You need to escape!\" one of my guards shouted desperately.\nThe distraction proved costly. One of the Transcendent assassins seized the opportunity and landed a devastating blow against my guard’s exposed flank before immediately pivoting toward me. He charged with incredible speed, his eye glinting with deadly intent.\nI activated Blood Control, feeling the familiar surge of power as enhanced circulation flooded my system. My Stone Armor materialized around me as additional protection, the plates forming just as he closed the distance.\n\"I don’t know how you survived their capture, but you’re proving far more troublesome than we anticipated,\" he snarled, his weapon raised for a killing strike.\n\"Die!\"\nI shifted into the proper stance, drawing upon the technique I was given by Carmilla. The Transcendent assassin was fast, but I had advantages he couldn’t anticipate.\nTime seemed to slow as I channelled everything into a single, perfect technique.\n[Sky’s Secret Sword Art - First Form]\nNull Strike!\nKnight’s Wrath moved with supernatural speed, cutting through the air itself as the technique activated. The blade carried the full force of my body, my weapon’s Rare-rank enchantments, and the devastating power of the Sky’s Secret Sword Art’s first form.\nThe assassin’s confident expression shifted to shock as he realized his attack would never reach me. My strike was already committed, aimed at the one point where his momentum would carry him directly into my blade’s path.\nMy sword met his dagger in a clash of steel and sparks.\nThe Null Strike technique worked perfectly, Knight’s Wrath cut through his attack like it was nothing, completely neutralizing his strike and sending vibrations up his arm. A glint of surprise flashed in my eyes as I witnessed the true power of an Overlord-rank secret art in action once again and its power never failed to amaze me.\nAfter nullifying his offensive, I spotted my guard positioning himself behind the assassin. Seizing the tactical advantage, I channelled mana into my Blood Control skill and attempted to manipulate the circulation within the Transcendent-rank opponent.\nThe assassin’s face contorted as he felt something wrong happening inside his body.\nControlling the blood of a Transcendent-rank being was incredibly taxing, but I managed to drastically increase the blood pressure around his eyes, causing the vessels to swell dangerously.\nUnfortunately, my plan didn’t achieve full success. He flared his mana defensively, protecting himself from complete incapacitation, though not before crying out in agony.\n\"What did you do to me! Argh!\"\nThe pain was clearly unbearable despite his defensive measures. While I hadn’t managed to blind him permanently, I had successfully stunned and disoriented him at a critical moment.\nWithout hesitation, I raised my leg and delivered a powerful kick to his torso, sending him flying directly toward my approaching guard.\nMy guard welcomed this opportunity with a devastating strike of his own. As a martial artist who fought with enhanced gauntlets rather than weapons, he brought his fist around in a crushing blow aimed directly at the assassin’s skull.\nThe timing was perfect. The assassin, still reeling from my blood manipulation and unable to properly defend himself mid-flight, took the full force of the strike.\nBoom!\nThe sound of impact echoed through the forest as the gauntlet connected with bone and flesh.\nSpurt!\nThe assassin’s head exploded like an overripe watermelon, brain matter and blood spraying across the surrounding trees in a gruesome fountain. His headless body crumpled to the ground, twitching briefly before going still.\nOne Transcendent assassin remained.\nThe remaining assassin froze in shock, the devastating reality of their failure hitting him like a hammer blow to the head. The intelligence they had received was completely wrong, they had been deceived and sent to their deaths!\nThis was no normal student, how could a first year student in his first semester have the ability to not only nullify the attack of a transcendent rank being, but also send him to his death, it was bizarre!\nSeeing his dead teammate’s headless corpse, rage and desperation overcame him. He lashed out with a powerful punch that sent my guard staggering backward, then immediately turned to flee through the forest.\n---\nBut my guards weren’t about to let him escape. They pursued relentlessly, their Transcendent-rank speed allowing them to close the distance rapidly. The uninjured guard caught up first, delivering a devastating punch that sent the fleeing assassin hurtling through multiple trees with bone-crushing force.\nAs trunks splintered and crashed around him, the assassin realized his situation was hopeless. Death was approaching inevitably, and escape had become impossible.\nI recognized the familiar look of desperate resolve crossing his face, it was the same expression the Elite-rank assassins had worn before their suicide attack.\n\"Careful! He’s going to self-destruct!\" I shouted urgently.\nMy guards immediately became alert and retreated to a safe distance, their combat experience making them react instantly to the warning.\nUnfortunately for the assassin, once the self-destruction sequence had begun, there was no way to stop it.\nBOOM!\nThe Transcendent-rank explosion was far more powerful than the previous detonations. The blast carved out a crater nearly ten meters wide, obliterating trees and scorching the earth in a perfect circle of destruction.\nWhen the smoke cleared, nothing remained of the final assassin except the smoking crater and scattered debris.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nThe forest fell silent except for the crackling of burning vegetation and our own heavy breathing.\nBoth guards stared at the smoking crater in stunned silence before exchanging meaningful glances.\n\"Young Master,\" the senior guard said, his voice tight with urgency, \"we need to leave this area immediately. There could be more of them.\"\n\"Agreed,\" the second guard added, scanning the treeline warily. \"This was clearly a coordinated operation. We’ve stayed in one location too long.\"\nThe first guard shook his head grimly. \"We couldn’t capture anyone for questioning. These weren’t amateur bandits, they were professional, ruthless assassins with absolute loyalty to their employers.\"\n\"The suicide explosions prove that,\" his companion replied. \"They’d rather die than risk revealing information. Whoever sent them has serious resources, status and they certainly don’t want to be known.\"\nAs they began moving toward the academy, the senior guard couldn’t help but voice what they were both thinking. \"Young Master, what happened back there... surviving eight Elite-rank assassins alone, then arriving to help us against Transcendent opponents...\"\n\"The intelligence they had about you was completely wrong,\" the other guard added. \"Your capabilities far exceed what anyone should expect from your age and rank.\"\nThe first guard nodded but then checked himself. \"However, we can discuss this properly once we’re somewhere secure. Right now, getting you to safety is our only priority.\"\n\"The duke needs to know about this attack immediately,\" his companion said. \"This attack proves that the House Blackwood is being targeted by an evil enemy that would stoop so low as to ambush you, young master.\"\nThey formed a protective formation around me as we moved swiftly through the forest, their questions and amazement temporarily set aside in favour of ensuring our survival.\nAs we made our way back, I had sneakily used my blood control skill to store the transcendent rank blood in my Crimson Blood pendent. I was certainly not going to pass on some transcendent blood.\nThe more I thought about that attack earlier on, the more I was frustrated. I had been unable to gain any useful intel on our family’s attackers and that was problematic in and of itself.\nInformation was worth its weight in gold during wars, and as a Blackwood, I had none of it. We were being attacked by an entity we didn’t know.\nBut I knew one thing for sure. Our enemy had information about my power, which meant that they were very well versed on what was happening in the academy. This meant that my enemy was closer than I realised.\nWell...whoever they are...they had just signed off their death penalty.",

      "content": "Chapter 78: Levelling Up [1]\nAs we made our way back toward the academy, we encountered a group of guards heading in the opposite direction, clearly responding to the sounds of the explosions that had echoed through the forest due to the assassin’s self detonations.\n\"Excuse me,\" their leader called out as we approached. \"Did you see or hear anything unusual in the forest? We received reports of loud explosions in this area.\"\nMy guards and I exchanged quick glances before responding with a calm tone.\n\"We heard some distant sounds while we were training,\" the senior guard replied smoothly, \"but we didn’t see anything specific. We decided it was best to head back when things got noisy.\"\n\"Nothing out of the ordinary from our perspective,\" I added. \"Though we did hear what sounded like magical combat somewhere deeper in the forest.\"\nThe responding guards nodded, accepting our explanation without suspicion. They couldn’t detain or interrogate members of House Blackwood without significant cause, and our story was plausible enough.\n\"Thank you for the information,\" their leader said respectfully. \"Please be careful if you venture back into the forest today. We’ll be conducting a thorough investigation of the area.\"\n\"Of course. Stay safe,\" my guard replied as we continued past them toward the academy.\nAs they disappeared into the forest behind us, I knew they would soon discover the aftermath of our battle - the crater from the final explosion, scattered remains of the assassins, and evidence of a significant magical confrontation.\nBut by then, we would be safely back at the academy, and any investigation would find only the remnants of a mysterious battle with no clear perpetrators.\nThe attack had failed, but it raised serious questions about who possessed both the resources and motivation to target House Blackwood so directly.\nBack in my dormitory, I activated my communication crystal to contact my father. The events in the forest needed to be reported immediately.\n\"Adrian?\" my father’s voice came through, concern already evident. \"You’re calling earlier than usual.\"\n\"Father, we were attacked. Ten assassins, eight Elite-rank and two Transcendent-rank. They were specifically targeting me.\"\n\"Where are you? Are you OKAY!\" My father’s panicked voice immediately sounded.\n\"I’m fine father, I’m back at the dormitory of the academy. We have killed the assassins that tried to attack us, my guards have sustained light injuries but they should heal within the next few days with proper rest and some healing potions.\" I responded.\nSilence stretched for several moments before my father’s voice returned, tight with shock. \"How did you survive? That force isn’t easy to deal with, you should have been against impossible odds, even with your guards.\"\n\"I’ve grown stronger, Father. I’m at peak Elite-rank now, and my combat capabilities have developed significantly beyond what my rank suggests because of the sword you’ve given me.\"\nAnother pause, then an explosion of disbelief. \"Peak Elite-rank? Already? Adrian, you’ve barely been at the academy for two days!\"\nI could hear the amazement and pride warring in his voice as he processed this information.\n\"At this rate of progression,\" he continued, his tone shifting to excitement, \"you could reach Transcendent rank by the end of your first year. That’s unprecedented development, even among the greatest prodigies in our kingdom’s history.\"\nHis laughter echoed through the crystal, filled with paternal pride and genuine joy at my advancement.\nHowever, his tone sobered quickly. \"Despite my excitement about your progress, you must be extremely careful, son. This attack failed because of your unexpected strength, but future attempts won’t underestimate you. Our enemies have revealed themselves openly now.\"\n\"Losing a force of two Transcendent beings and eight Elite-rank assassins isn’t a blow they can easily absorb,\" he continued grimly. \"They’ll retaliate soon, and next time they’ll come prepared for your true capabilities. I will send two more Transcendent guards to protect you, just in case.\"\nI shook my head firmly. \"Father, pulling two more Transcendent-rank guards from the estate would leave our home defenses vulnerable. Our enemies might use that as an opportunity to attack our family directly.\"The source of thɪs content is NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\n\"Adrian, your safety is my primary concern. Besides, I’m a peak commander level knight, do you really think they can do anything to our estate with me there?\" he replied, his voice strained with worry.\n\"Father, I know that they won’t dare to attack the estate with you there. But...What if they lure you away through other means. Besides, I won’t be venturing into dangerous areas anytime soon. I’ll stay within the academy grounds where whoever attacked today would never dare to attack. The academy has its own Transcendent and Commander-rank instructors.\"\nMy father remained silent for several moments, clearly torn between his paternal instincts and the implications of weakening our estate’s defences.\n\"Besides,\" I continued, \"having four Transcendent guards following me around would draw unwanted attention. It would signal to everyone that House Blackwood considers me under serious threat, which could destabilize our political position.\"\n\"You make valid points,\" he admitted reluctantly. \"But promise me you’ll avoid unnecessary risks. No more forest expeditions that will put you in risk, I will speak to the guards to understand what had happened exactly.\"\n\"Agreed. I’ll be cautious and stick to well-protected areas.\"\n\"Very well. But if the situation escalates further, I’m overriding your objections and sending additional protection regardless of the consequences.\"\nI could hear the finality in his tone - this was a temporary compromise, not a permanent solution.\nAfter hanging up with my father, I got up and made my way toward Section G where the training grounds were located.\nI needed to become stronger, and the only method currently available was repeatedly using my skills to increase their levels. Higher-level skills became both more powerful and more mana-efficient, making each advancement crucial for survival.\nToday’s encounter had been fortunate, and I couldn’t count on such luck in future confrontations against such enemies. My enemies had underestimated my power and protection significantly, allowing me to exploit their overconfidence. But after today’s massacre, they would reassess their intelligence.",

      "content": "Chapter 79: Leveling Up [2]\nMy enemies faced two possible conclusions: either I was significantly stronger than I appeared, which would prompt them to send overwhelming force in the next attempt, or my guards were more capable than they anticipated, leading them to plan around my protection.\nNeither scenario favoured me in future encounters.\nI needed to maximize my training efficiency while I had time. The academy’s training facilities would allow me to push my abilities for now until things cooled down a little. Blood Control, my enhanced physique, and weapon techniques all required constant refinement.\nThe training grounds were less crowded during evening hours, giving me space to practice without attracting unwanted attention. I had learned today that my true capabilities needed to remain hidden until absolutely necessary.\n...\nWalking through the corridor, I bumped into Victor Castellane, also known as the Wiseman among the second year students.\nHe stopped me with a knowing smile. \"Adrian, have you heard that Kyle has already broken your record?\"\nI shook my head. \"I haven’t heard that news yet.\"\nThere was no surprise in my mind, I had expected Kyle to improve at a similar rate. He was the protagonist, after all, and rapid development was practically guaranteed for someone in his position.\nVictor’s next words caught me slightly off guard. \"Would you like to attempt breaking his record? Any instructor is allowed to oversee your attempt, it doesn’t necessarily need to be your homeroom teacher.\"\nI studied his face for a moment, noting the expression behind his friendly demeanour. This wasn’t just a casual offer, Victor was testing something, though his exact motives remained unclear.\n\"Thanks, Instructor Victor, but I’m not ready to break the record yet. Maybe another time.\"\nVictor nodded, though I caught a flicker of disappointment in his eyes. \"That’s unfortunate.\"ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ\n\"Perhaps when I’m better prepared.\"\n\"Of course. The opportunity remains open whenever you feel ready this week.\" He paused meaningfully.\nWith that comment, he continued down the corridor with his hands behind his back. I glanced at his retreating figure before turning away to enter one of the training rooms.\nInside the elite-rank training room I had rented for 1,000 points over two hours, I began practicing my secret art’s first form—Null Strike—alongside my\n{Blood Enhancement}\ntrait. Blood Enhancement was my lowest-level ability, making it the most efficient target for improvement since early-stage skills progressed more rapidly.\nMy secret art carried Overlord rank, even though I could currently only access its Elite-rank applications. The power was undeniable, and dedicated practice would strengthen both the technique and my overall swordsmanship foundation.\nEach repetition of the Null Strike brought subtle improvements to my understanding. The movements became more fluid, the mana channelling more precise, and my grasp of the underlying principles deeper. The art seemed to teach me about swordsmanship on a fundamental level, revealing insights that went beyond mere technique memorization.\nBlood Enhancement responded well to repeated activation cycles. I practiced controlling different levels of circulation enhancement, learning to modulate the intensity based on specific needs. Light enhancement for extended periods, moderate boost for general combat, and maximum amplification for critical moments when overwhelming force was necessary.\nThe training room’s reinforced walls and magical barriers contained the effects of my practice, allowing me to push harder without concern for collateral damage. I alternated between solo sword forms and enhancement exercises, building muscle memory for seamless integration during actual combat.\nAfter an hour of intensive practice, sweat covered my body despite my enhanced physique. The combination of physical exertion and mana expenditure was taxing, but I could feel measurable improvement in both abilities.\nTime to continue pushing my limits while I had the opportunity.\nFor the remaining hour, I focused on Blood Control training, pushing my abilities to their current limits. The training room’s privacy was crucial, there was no surveillance to monitor students in their reserved spaces, ensuring complete confidentiality for sensitive skill development.\nThis isolation allowed me to practice Blood Control without concern about observers discovering this rare and potentially alarming ability.\nI began experimenting with weapon formation using my own blood. Starting with simple shapes, I gradually worked toward more complex constructs. I was able to create one or two spears of blood without any issue, but controlling them and manoeuvring them around was an issue. Thus, I decided to work on controlling multiple objects in the air at the same time.\nI experimented with different kinds of weapons. After spears came maces, requiring me to concentrate the blood into denser formations at the striking end while keeping the handle appropriately balanced. The weight distribution was tricky, but practice improved my control over density variations.\nSwords were slightly tricky to make as creating a proper blade edge while maintaining structural integrity throughout the entire weapon tested my manipulation skills. The blood needed to be compressed and hardened differently for the cutting surface versus the tang and grip areas.\nShields didn’t present a big challenge to create. I simply had to think about the surface area coverage, balance and defensive positioning. I practiced forming both small bucklers for deflection and larger tower shields for stronger protection.\nEach weapon type taught me different aspects of blood manipulation, compression techniques, engineering principles, and the relationship between form and function. The blood responded to my mental commands with increasing responsiveness as my understanding deepened.\nBy the session’s end, I had improved rapidly. I could cycle between different weapon configurations, adapting my arsenal to different combat scenarios. The versatility of Blood Control was becoming apparent, limited only by my imagination and understanding of physics.\nThe two-hour training session had significantly advanced my practical application of multiple abilities.\nUnfortunately, I was still unable to level up any of my traits, but the training wasn’t for naught. Despite the visible progression, I could feel it and I was certainly satisfied with the result.\n[Student Adrian Blackwood, your training session is over, please head out within the next minute. Any delay might result in a point penalty, or persecution.] A robotic voice sounded within the room.",

      "content": "Chapter 80: Failure [1]\nThe next day arrived, and once again I stood in the training facilities with Instructor Sylvia Ashworth, who showed no surprise at my request.\nI was asking to break Kyle Morrison’s new record. He had surpassed my previous score by exactly 100 points, bringing the current record to 9,802 points.\nSylvia didn’t question my decision or suggest I reconsider. She simply observed in thoughtful silence, clearly anticipating another demonstration of my rapidly developing capabilities.\nUnlike my previous attempt, another instructor had come to witness this record-breaking moment. Victor Castellane stood at the side with his hands clasped behind his back, that knowing smile never leaving his face as he prepared to observe my performance.\nI threw him a quick glance before focusing entirely on the training dummy. Activating my Blood Control trait, I felt the familiar surge of blood circulation flooding my system with supernatural power. Every muscle fiber responded with increased strength and speed.\nTaking a deep breath, I burst toward the target with explosive velocity. My enhanced physique carried me forward with tremendous momentum as the training sword cut through the air through a perfect arc.\nThe impact resonated through the training hall like thunder.\nBoom!\n[9,822]\nThe number appeared on the display, showing I had broken Kyle’s record by twenty points.\nShocked murmurs erupted from the students who had gathered to watch. Their conversations carried clearly through the training space.\n\"How is Adrian improving so rapidly, day after day?\" one student whispered in disbelief.\n\"There are really two monsters in the academy at the same time,\" another replied, shaking his head.\n\"We thought we were elite students,\" a third voice added with obvious demoralization. \"But watching how quickly Adrian advances his power... maybe we’re not elite at all.\"\n\"I’ve been training for years to reach my current level,\" someone else said quietly. \"He’s improving faster in weeks than most of us do in months.\"\nThe psychological impact was evident - my consistent record-breaking was forcing other students to question their own capabilities and standing within the academy’s hierarchy.\nVictor Castellane’s smile had grown even wider as he observed both my performance and the crowd’s reaction.\nI approached Sylvia, who let out a long sigh before speaking.\n\"You two are absolute monsters,\" she said, shaking her head in disbelief. \"I wonder how the headmaster is going to react to this constant record-breaking phenomenon. Nothing like this has ever happened at this rate before in the academy’s history.\"\nShe paused, studying my face with those sharp blue eyes. \"The administration is going to have to start questioning whether our measurement systems are even adequate for students like you and Kyle.\"\n\"Is that a problem?\" I asked.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ\n\"Not a problem, exactly. More like an unprecedented situation that no one knows how to handle properly.\" She gestured toward the display still showing my score. \"Most students spend their entire academy career trying to break a single record. You’ve now done it twice in a matter of days.\"\nVictor Castellane stepped forward with obvious satisfaction. \"Perhaps it’s time the academy adapted its systems to accommodate exceptional talent.\"\nSylvia shot him a pointed look. \"Either way, Adrian, your bonus points will be credited within the next few hours.\"\nI nodded, thanking her before leaving the training facility with Instructor Victor still inside.\nAs I exited, Elen caught up to me.\n\"Adrian,\" she said with a mix of admiration and frustration, \"I have to admit, I’m somewhat jealous of how easily you gain points. Breaking records seems effortless for you.\"\nI smiled at her honest admission. \"With hard work, everything is possible, Elen. Besides, combat records aren’t the only way to earn recognition. I heard there are also records in the additional modules that start in a few days.\"\nHer eyes immediately brightened at this news, and I could see her motivation returning. \"You’re right! I completely forgot about module records.\"\n\"You bought those alchemy materials already, didn’t you? You should start experimenting with them before the official classes begin. Getting a head start could give you a significant advantage.\"\nElen nodded eagerly. \"Indeed, that was the initial plan, to familiarize myself with the basic techniques and maybe even develop some unique approaches before everyone else starts. But after purchasing them, I started having anxiety over these items. I’m worried that I only understand the theory in the book and wouldn’t be able to implement it, leading to the waste of these items without actual learning.\"\n\"Hmm...Do you want my take on this?\"\nOnce again Elen nodded eagerly like a chicken pecking on food. \"Yes, please.\"\n\"Well, I believe that your water manipulation gives you natural advantages in alchemy that other students don’t have. So, it’s actually easier for you to concoct potions because of your knowledge about liquid density, the volume and various other forces that affect liquids.\nAs for your anxiety, let’s suppose that you do fail. Is it really considered failure? I don’t believe so.\"\n\"How could failing not be considered failure...Adrian, that doesn’t make sense.\" Elen looked at me with a puzzled look as if my words were contradictory.\nI looked at Elen for a moment, before repeating a phrase that has stuck with me for my two lives. A phrase by my late father from earth, a phrase that I truly resonated with.\n\"Elen... success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. But failure? Failure breeds passion. Passion fuels persistence. Persistence shapes resilience. And resilience... resilience forges true success.\nSo don’t be disheartened by failure. Instead, take it as your personal teacher, it might be harsh, yes, but it’s honest. Every misstep is a lesson, every setback is a chance to grow. The more you fail, the more you learn, and the more you learn, the closer you come to mastery.\"\nElen’s face contorted slightly, caught between disbelief and wonder, as though my words had struck deeper than she had expected. She lowered her gaze for a moment, her thoughts clearly unravelling, wrestling with the meaning I had laid before her.",

      "content": "Chapter 81: Failure [2]\nSilence lingered in the air for a few moments, until at last her lips curved into a beautiful smile that showcased her glistening white teeth.\nIt was the kind of smile that did not simply lift her cheeks but seemed to rekindle something within her.\nI could see that she had regained confidence in herself. Elen looked at me with renewed resolve, as if envisioning countless possibilities opening before her, each one a challenge to be met, a barrier to be broken.\nIn that moment, I knew she would step into the alchemy module not as a student burdened by doubt, but as a seeker ready to embrace every triumph, every failure, and every lesson the path had to offer.\nThis was exactly what made Elen different from other students, the way she absorbed advice was something that was special in her. She didn’t find ways to disprove your words, rather she contemplated and worked upon it.\nElen drew in a quiet breath, steadying herself before speaking.\n\"Adrian...\" she said, her voice almost a whisper at first, then stronger, carried by conviction. \"Thank you. I didn’t realize how much I needed to hear that. I thought my failures meant I wasn’t good enough, that maybe I wasn’t cut out for this at all. But now... now I see it differently.\"\nHer eyes glistened, not with weakness, but with determination. \"You’ve reminded me that failure isn’t the end. It’s just part of the journey. I won’t run from it anymore.\"\nFor a moment, her gaze softened, gratitude clear in every word that followed. \"Truly, Adrian... thank you.\"\nEmmet’s voice cut through the emotional moment for Elen bluntly. \"You done with the motivational speech? Why don’t you come and spar with me, Blackwood.\"\nI looked at Emmet for a moment before smiling. I wasn’t offended by his sarcastic interruption. The fact that Emmet was talking to us so casually meant he was beginning to recognize us as people worth his time, even if we weren’t considered friends yet. This informal interaction was progress.The most update n0vels are published on NovᴇlFirenᴇt\n\"I’ll have to pass this time, Emmet. Another time, though.\"\nEmmet clicked his tongue in disappointment, the sharp sound expressing his frustration at my refusal. His eyes showed he’d been looking forward to testing himself against me again after our previous match.\n\"Fine,\" he said with obvious reluctance. \"But don’t keep me waiting too long, Blackwood.\"\n\"I won’t.\"\nElen watched this exchange with curious interest, clearly trying to understand the dynamic between Emmet and me. The competitive tension was obvious, but so was the underlying respect.\n\"I’ll hold you to that promise,\" Emmet added before walking away, his hands already returning to his pockets.\nWith Elen by my side, I made my way toward the private rooms where students could practice blacksmithing, alchemy, and other specialized fields.\nElen’s excitement was obvious as we walked. \"I want to book a room too. I’m actually looking forward to learning through trial and error now.\"\nWe approached the booking station, and I scanned my card first. \"One blacksmithing room for two hours, please.\"\n[-1,000 Points]\nElen stepped forward next, though I noticed her hesitation when she saw the price display. \"One alchemy room for two hours.\"\n[-1,000 Points]\nShe winced slightly as the points were deducted from her account. \"These rooms are expensive, but I suppose it’s worth it for proper learning facilities.\"\n\"The academy charges premium rates because the rooms are equipped with magical grade equipment, think of it as an investment in your skills.\" I explained.\n\"You’re right,\" she said, her determination to improve overcoming her concern about the cost. \"I need to stop thinking short-term about expenses. If I can develop my alchemy abilities, the long-term benefits will far outweigh the initial point investment.\"\n\"Exactly. Plus, once the official modules start, you’ll already have hands-on experience that other students lack.\"\nElen nodded firmly. \"I’m going to make every minute of this practice session count. No more hesitation, no more fear of making mistakes.\"\n\"That’s the spirit. I’ll see you in a couple hours?\"\n\"Definitely.\"\nWe headed toward our respective practice rooms, both eager to push our skills to new levels.\nInside the blacksmithing room, I focused on creating stronger arrows to compensate for the damage limitations my crossbow had shown against Elite-rank opponents. The standard bolts simply weren’t penetrating deeply enough to be effective.\nI began by selecting higher-grade steel and incorporating thin strands of Mithril into the arrow shafts. This combination would provide superior durability while maintaining the lightweight properties essential for proper flight. The arrowheads required special attention, I forged them with a diamond-shaped cross-section to maximize penetration while adding small Orichalcum inlays to channel mana directly into the impact point.\nTesting the completed arrows against my own skin by rubbing them and testing their sharpness proved that they were indeed much better than the previous ones. Still, it needed real time testing, but that would have to wait.\nThese new arrows meant that the crossbow would be more devastating against normal Elite-rank opponents. The resource cost was higher than before but it made sense, the improved lethality justified the expense.\nWith stronger ammunition ready, I turned my attention to upgrading the crossbow itself. Rather than crafting an entirely new weapon, I retrieved my previous prototype and began handling the modifications to withstand the increased stress these powerful arrows would generate.\nI reinforced the bow stave with additional Mithril bands, preventing structural failure under higher tension loads. The string mechanism received Orichalcum wire reinforcement throughout its length, allowing it to channel more mana without degrading. Most importantly, I redesigned the trigger assembly to better distribute the explosive force generated by the enhanced arrows.\nThe adaptive bolt groove system required recalibration as well. The new arrows had different weight distributions and dimensional specifications that the mechanism needed to accommodate. I spent considerable time adjusting the Resonite sensors and memory alloy components to ensure proper fitting.\nAfter two hours of intensive work, I had transformed the crossbow into a weapon capable of threatening elite-rank opponents.",

      "content": "Chapter 82: Success or Failure\nAfter leaving the blacksmithing room, I saw Elen leaving the adjacent room with an excited look on her face.\n\"Adrian! Oh my god, you were right. Although I have failed the first few times, I learned from the mistakes I made and I was finally able to make a mortal grade potion...Although It was more expensive to make it than to actually to buy it from the store, haha.\" Elen scratched the side of her head.\nLooking at this scene unfold, I couldn’t help but smile at Elen’s infectious enthusiasm. The pride radiating from her was well-deserved after what must have been hours of frustrating attempts before finally succeeding.\nI laughed at her admission about the cost exceeding the potion’s value. \"That’s the beauty of learning, isn’t it? The first attempts are always expensive lessons, but each failure teaches you something invaluable.\"\nElen’s eyes sparkled with enthusiasm despite her slight embarrassment. \"Exactly! I made so many mistakes in the beginning - wrong proportions, improper heating temperatures, even mixing incompatible ingredients. But each failure showed me exactly what not to do next time.\"\n\"Well, congratulations, Elen,\" I said, genuinely pleased for her achievement. \"Making your first successful potion is always a milestone, regardless of the cost. The experience and knowledge you gained from those failed attempts is invaluable.\"\nShe beamed at my words, her earlier embarrassment about the expense clearly forgotten in the excitement of success. \"Indeed, you were absolutely right about failure being a teacher. Each mistake showed me exactly what I was doing wrong - timing the heat, measuring proportions, understanding how my water manipulation could enhance the mixing process.\"\n\"What type of mortal grade potion did you manage to create?\" I asked, curious about her first successful brew.\n\"A basic healing potion,\" she replied, pulling out a small vial filled with a soft, glowing green liquid. \"It’s not particularly potent, but it’s properly stabilized and should provide minor wound healing to Noble-rank awakeners. The magical resonance feels right, unlike my earlier attempts that felt... off.\"\nI examined the potion briefly, noting the consistent color and gentle luminescence that indicated proper magical binding. \"The clarity is impressive for a first success. Your water manipulation clearly gives you an advantage in controlling liquid consistency.\"\nElen nodded eagerly. \"That’s exactly what I discovered! I can sense the density changes during the brewing process and adjust accordingly. It’s like having an internal guide for when the mixture is reaching the right state.\"\n\"Have you considered experimenting with water-based enhancement potions next?\" I suggested. \"Given your natural affinity, you might find unique applications that other alchemists overlook.\"\nHer eyes lit up with new possibilities. \"I hadn’t thought of that! Most standard recipes don’t account for elemental manipulation during the brewing process. I could potentially develop variations that are more potent or efficient.\"\n\"Exactly. Innovation often comes from applying your unique strengths to traditional methods.\"\nAs we walked toward the exit together, I could see Elen’s mind already racing with new experimental ideas, her earlier anxiety about failure completely replaced by excited determination to push her skills further.\n\"And what about you?\" Elen asked, her curious gaze shifting to me as we continued walking. \"How did your blacksmithing session go? I imagine it must have been quite different from alchemy.\"\n\"It went alright,\" I replied with a modest shrug. \"I learned a few things about working with different materials and managed to create an arrow. Nothing too spectacular, but it was good practice.\"\nHer eyebrows raised with genuine interest. \"Oh really? Can I see it? I’ve never actually seen a handcrafted arrow before. Most of the ones we use in training are mass-produced academy equipment.\"\nI paused for a moment, then withdrew one of the arrows I had crafted during my session from my storage ring. The arrow gleamed subtly in the corridor lighting.\n\"Here,\" I said, holding it out for her inspection. \"I experimented with incorporating some Mithril strands into the shaft for durability while keeping it lightweight.\"\nElen’s eyes widened as she carefully took the arrow, immediately noticing its unusual weight distribution. \"This is... incredibly light,\" she murmured, turning it over in her hands with obvious fascination. \"But it feels incredibly sturdy too. The balance is perfect.\"\nShe examined the arrowhead more closely, noting the diamond-shaped cross-section and the subtle golden inlays. \"Are these Orichalcum traces in the tip? Adrian, this isn’t just ’alright’ work - this looks like professional craftsmanship. The precision of these inlays alone would take most beginners months to achieve.\"\n\"I had some good materials to work with,\" I said, deflecting her praise while watching her continued examination of the arrow with growing appreciation for her keen eye.\nElen continued to examine the arrow with evident admiration. \"The way you’ve woven the Mithril through the shaft... it’s not just functional, it’s actually beautiful. Although, I don’t really understand much about blacksmithing, I can tell that you’ve done a really good job.\"ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nElen then brought her index finger to the sharp pointy tip. I immediately grabbed her hand. \"Stop. You will hurt yourself, it’s really sharp.\"\n\"Oh...Thank you,\" Elen nodded her head shyly before pulling her hand away.\nSomewhat embarrassed by what had just transpired, Elen handed the arrow back to me. I noticed her expression had shifted slightly. While still appreciative, there was a hint of deflation in her posture, a subtle comparison she was making between her single healing potion and the strong arrow in my hands.\n\"Thank you,\" she said with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. \"It really is impressive craftsmanship.\"\nSensing her mood change, I carefully returned the arrow to my storage pouch before addressing what I suspected she was thinking. \"I should mention, I’ve had practice before, so this isn’t my first time working with a forge or these materials.\"\nHer head snapped up, surprise replacing the earlier disappointment. \"Really? You have prior blacksmithing experience?\"\n\"Yes, I’ve had some experience. In fact, this is also my second time entering these rooms, so I’m also familiar with the equipment and everything, which makes it easier.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 83: Elite Warrior Card\nAs we continued walking through the academy corridors, I felt the familiar notification chime in my mind that indicated my daily reward had become available.\n[Daily Login Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your daily reward?]\n[Yes | No]\nI pressed yes without hesitation, curious to see what today’s reward had to offer.\n[Congratulations! You have received x1 Elite Warrior Card]\n[Elite Warrior Card]\n[Details: Upon using this card, you would be able to summon a warrior at the peak of Elite-rank. This warrior would be able to reside in this card whenever you will for him to do so. There is no duration or cooldown for the summoning. The warrior is prone to damage, and death.]\nReading through the card’s description, my eyes widened ever so slightly. This reward was certainly one of a kind, I would have never thought that I would receive a peak Elite-rank awakener as a reward. The implications were staggering. A loyal warrior with no summoning restrictions could be invaluable for dangerous situations or even just as backup.\nI didn’t rush into using the card immediately. The main reason was because I was currently in the academy corridors with Elen beside me. Suddenly summoning an Elite-rank warrior would raise far too many questions that I didn’t need to answer.\nHowever, once I returned to my dorm, I was most definitely going to test it out. I needed to understand the full scope of this warrior’s capabilities and limitations. Would he have his own personality? Could he grow stronger through experience? Would he retain memories between summons? These were crucial details that would determine how useful this gift would actually prove to be.\n\"You seem lost in thought,\" Elen observed, glancing at me with mild curiosity as we walked. \"Thinking about your next blacksmithing project already?\"\n\"Something like that,\" I replied with a slight smile, carefully tucking the card away in my storage while maintaining our casual conversation pace. \"There are always new possibilities to consider.\"\nAfter hanging out with Elen for a little longer, discussing various academy topics and sharing observations about the academy so far.\nI eventually found a natural break in our conversation, \"I should probably head back to my dormitory,\" I said, glancing toward the residential wing. \"I have some things I need to take care of before tomorrow’s classes.\"\n\"Of course,\" Elen replied with understanding. \"I should probably review my alchemy notes anyway and plan my next experiments. Thank you for the encouragement earlier, Adrian. It really helped.\"\n\"Anytime, good luck, see you.\"\nWe parted ways at the corridor junction, and I made my way toward the dormitory section. The anticipation of testing the Elite Warrior Card had been building since I received it, and now I finally had the privacy needed to explore this unprecedented reward.\nOnce inside my room, I closed the blinds and took out the card from my system space. Looking at it properly for the first time, it was truly magnificent. The word ’Elite’ shone in silver light across the surface, while the card itself was pitch black, giving it a really cool aesthetic that I couldn’t dismiss. The contrast was striking and somehow conveyed both power and mystery.\nI walked toward the training section of my room since it offered more space for whatever might happen next. Taking a deep breath, I focused my will on activating the card.\nThe card disappeared from my hands instantly, followed by a blinding flash of light that forced me to squeeze my eyes shut and shield my face with my arm.\nWhen I opened them again, a warrior stood before me. He was imposing at two meters tall, with a thick black beard and long black hair that fell past his shoulders. A sword hung at his side, and his entire presence radiated the power I associated with peak Elite-rank awakeners.\nSurprisingly this warrior came with a full set. Whether it was his well-maintained Armor, or sword. \"I must say, the system really did not hold back with you.\" I muttered to myself as I looked at him.\nThe warrior’s dark eyes met mine calmly, waiting for instruction patiently.\n\"What’s your name?\" I asked, curious about the extent of his identity and memories.\nThe warrior’s response was immediate and matter-of-fact. \"I do not have one.\"\nHis voice was deep and steady, carrying the confidence of someone comfortable with combat but lacking any personal attachment or individual history. It was both fascinating and slightly unsettling - here was a being with all the skills and power of an Elite-rank awakener, yet he existed without the basic foundation of identity that came with having a name.\nI considered this for a moment, realizing that naming him would likely be an important step in establishing our working relationship. The name that came to mind felt appropriate given his obvious mastery with the blade.\n\"Then I’ll call you Kojiro,\" I decided, watching for his reaction.Googlᴇ search ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nThe warrior nodded once in acceptance, as if the name had always been his.\n\"The name comes from Sasaki Kojiro, a legendary swordsman from... a distant land,\" I explained, drawing from my memories of Earth’s history. \"He was renowned for his incredible skill with the blade and his technique called the ’Swallow Cut’ - a strike so precise it could supposedly cut down a bird in flight. Kojiro was known for his patience, discipline, and unwavering dedication to perfecting his swordsmanship. He spent years honing his craft in solitude, developing techniques that made him one of the most feared duellists of his era.\"\nI studied the newly named warrior’s reaction. \"Given your bearing and the way you carry yourself, it seemed fitting. You have the presence of someone who has dedicated their life to mastering the sword.\"\nKojiro’s expression remained composed, but there was a subtle change in his posture. The slight straightening that suggested the name and its meaning had resonated with him on some level.\n\"So...Kojiro, can you show me your swordsmanship? I would like to see you perform.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Sasaki Kojiro\nAfter my request, I took a step back to give him adequate space in the training area.\nWithout hesitation, Kojiro drew his sword in one fluid motion, the steel singing softly as it left its sheath. The blade gleamed under the room’s magical lighting, and I immediately noticed the perfect balance he maintained even while holding the weapon.\nHe began with basic foundational forms, but executed them with such precision that they transformed into something extraordinary. His footwork flowed seamlessly from stance to stance. Forward thrust transitions, lateral movements, defensive positions, each step calculated and purposeful. The way he distributed his weight spoke of experience, every muscle working in perfect coordination.\nKojiro moved through cutting patterns next, his blade tracing clean arcs through the air. Horizontal cuts, vertical slashes, diagonal strikes, each movement demonstrated textbook technique elevated by impressive execution. There was no wasted motion, no unnecessary flourishes, just pure efficiency married to deadly grace.\nHis defensive demonstrations were equally impressive. Parrying motions, counter-attack sequences, and evasive maneuvers all flowed together like a deadly dance. The blade seemed to move with its own intelligence under his guidance, always positioned exactly where it needed to be.\nWhat struck me most was his breathing control. Throughout the entire display, Kojiro’s breathing remained steady and controlled, synchronized with his movements in a way that spoke of true mastery. This wasn’t just physical technique, it was the embodiment of martial philosophy.\nI watched in genuine surprise, my estimation of his abilities climbing steadily. If I had to rank his swordsmanship skill, it would be closer to that of our Transcendent-rank guards back at the estate. Despite being only at the peak of Elite rank in terms of raw power, his foundation was extraordinary - the kind of technical mastery that typically took decades to develop.\n\"Impressive,\" I murmured, realizing I had acquired far more than just muscle in this summoned warrior.\n\"Kojiro, do you think you can improve further? Perhaps even reach Transcendent rank?\" I asked, genuinely curious about his growth potential. Just thinking about a summoned warrior that had incredible potential made my body course with energy.\nKojiro paused for a moment, his dark eyes growing contemplative as he considered the question. His hand unconsciously moved to rest on his sword hilt while he pondered.\n\"I can, but it will be difficult,\" he finally replied, his voice carrying the weight of honest self-assessment. \"I am almost at my maximum potential, which I believe is Transcendent rank. To break through that barrier, I believe I need to kill a Transcendent-rank being. Only by overcoming such a challenge can I transcend my current limitations.\"\nI looked at Kojiro for a moment, processing his words before a smile broke across my face. \"That’s not bad at all.\"\nThe news was significant. If Kojiro could reach Transcendent rank, combined with my two existing Transcendent guards outside the academy, I would effectively command three Transcendent-level warriors. Coupled with my own growing abilities, we might even have a chance to face a Commander-rank awakener if the situation demanded it.\nA plan began forming in my mind. When night approached, I would sneak out of the academy and summon Kojiro again. Then I would lead him to where my guards were currently stationed and instruct them to help facilitate his breakthrough to Transcendent rank. They had the experience and strength necessary to provide him with the challenge he needed.\nI wasn’t particularly worried about their safety during this endeavour. The recent attack on me in the forest had been carefully planned, and I didn’t believe our enemies would strike again without gathering more intelligence first. Sending troops blindly without proper information wasn’t exactly a smart tactical decision, especially after their previous failure.\nThe risk seemed manageable, and the potential reward of having Kojiro reach Transcendent rank was too valuable to pass up. Three Transcendent guards would significantly strengthen our defensive capabilities for whatever challenges lay ahead.\nWith several hours remaining until nightfall, I decided to make productive use of the time. I focused my will and unsummoned Kojiro, watching as he dissolved back into the card with the same flash of light that had brought him forth. The training room felt notably emptier without his imposing presence.\nTucking the card safely away in my storage ring, I left my dormitory and made my way toward the academy’s training facilities. The corridors were busier now as students moved between their various afternoon activities and optional modules.\nOn my way there, I encountered Kyle walking with his usual entourage. He offered me a brief nod of acknowledgment as we passed, which I returned with equal courtesy. Seraphina was beside him, along with several other students who seemed drawn to the protagonist’s natural charisma like moths to a flame. It was exactly what I’d expected from the novel’s dynamics, Kyle effortlessly attracting followers and admirers wherever he went.\nNot that I particularly cared about his growing social circle. I had my own priorities, and right now, getting stronger took precedence over.\nI continued toward the training facilities and approached the booking station.\n[-1,000 Points]\nThe deduction of another thousand points wasn’t much, I still had 339,000 points left and the investment would certainly be worthwhile. I needed practical combat experience, and I had the perfect sparring partner waiting in my storage.\nOnce inside the secured training room, I took out Kojiro’s card once again before activating it. The familiar flash of light brought him back into existence, his imposing figure appearing with the same calmness as before.\n\"Kojiro, I want to spar with you,\" I announced, moving toward the weapon rack mounted on the training room wall. \"We’re of similar strength in terms of rank, and your experience and skill will be valuable for improving my battle instincts and combat techniques.\"Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nI selected two practice swords from the rack, solid, well-balanced weapons with deliberately dulled edges designed to prevent serious injury while still delivering meaningful impact. The academy took training seriously, but they weren’t about to let students accidentally maim each other during practice sessions.",

      "content": "Chapter 85: Sparring Kojiro\nI tossed one of the swords to Kojiro, who caught it effortlessly and gave it a few experimental swings to test its weight and balance. His expression remained composed, but I could see him mentally adjusting to the weapon’s characteristics.\n\"These swords are dulled for safety,\" I explained, settling into a ready stance with my own practice blade. \"They’ll still hurt on impact, but they won’t cause lasting damage. Don’t hold back, I need to understand where my skills truly stand against someone with your level of expertise.\"\nKojiro nodded once, his grip shifting slightly on the sword’s handle as he adopted a defensive stance. \"Understood. I will provide the challenge you seek.\"\n...\nThe moment we both settled into our stances, I could feel the intensity radiating from Kojiro. His dark eyes assessed my stance.\nI decided to start without using any of my bloodline abilities, no Blood Control, no secret techniques, just pure swordsmanship enhanced only by the passive boost from my\n{Supernatural Physique}\ntrait that I couldn’t simply switch off.\nClang!\nKojiro moved first, his blade cutting through the air in a horizontal arc aimed at my midsection. I brought my sword up to parry, the impact sending vibrations up my arms as steel met steel.\nClash! Scrape!\nHe immediately followed with a vertical strike, forcing me to sidestep and counter with a thrust toward his shoulder. Kojiro deflected it effortlessly, his blade sliding along mine with a metallic screech before he pivoted into a diagonal cut.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nClang! Clang! Clang!\nThe rapid exchange of blows filled the training room with the harsh music of combat. Every time I thought I’d found an opening, Kojiro was already moving to close it, his footwork carrying him smoothly from attack to defence and back again.\nThud!\nHis pommel struck my ribs as he closed distance, forcing me to stumble backward. The dulled blade followed immediately, catching me across the shoulder with enough force to make me grunt in pain.\nWhoosh! Clang!\nI swung to create space, but Kojiro ducked under my wild cut and swept his blade in a low arc that caught my thigh. Even through the dulled edge, the impact sent a sharp jolt of pain up my leg.\nClash! Scrape! Thunk!\nMy attempts to press an offensive were dismantled. Every combination I tried, Kojiro had already anticipated. His blade seemed to be everywhere at once - parrying my strikes, deflecting my thrusts, and finding gaps in my defence that I didn’t even know existed.\nSmack!\nThe flat of his blade caught me across the back as I overextended on a lunge, sending me stumbling forward. I managed to turn it into a roll, coming up with my sword raised defensively.\nClang! Clang! Scriiing!\nBut Kojiro was relentless. His blade work was poetry in motion - flowing combinations that transitioned seamlessly from one technique to the next. Where I had to think about my next move, his responses were instinctive, it seemed.\nThwack!\nAnother pommel strike, this time to my solar plexus, drove the air from my lungs. I doubled over, gasping, as Kojiro’s blade pressed against my neck in a killing position.\n\"We should stop,\" Kojiro said, his voice steady despite the intense exchange. \"You will only get injured. This serves no purpose.\"\nI straightened slowly, wiping blood from a cut on my cheek where his cross guard had caught me during one exchange. My ribs ached, my shoulder throbbed, and my leg felt like it had been hit with a hammer.\n\"No,\" I said firmly, raising my sword again despite the pain. \"Continue.\"\nKojiro looked at me in silence for a moment before nodding. \"Very well.\"\nClang!\nI launched myself forward with renewed determination, but the result was the same. Kojiro’s superior technique and experience overwhelmed my raw enthusiasm.\nClash! Scrape! Thud!\nHis blade work was like watching a master craftsman at work. Every movement had purpose, every strike was precisely calculated. He could have ended the fight a dozen times over, but instead he was teaching me through pain, showing me exactly where my weaknesses lay.\nWhoosh! Clang! Crack!\nAnother devastating combination left me reeling. A feint high followed by a low cut that I barely managed to block, then a lightning-fast reversal that caught me in the ribs again.\nThunk!\nI hit the training room wall, my sword arm trembling from the constant impacts. Kojiro approached with measured steps, his blade held in a perfect guard position.\n\"You fight with heart,\" he observed, \"but technique requires more than determination. Your foundation still needs more work, even though it’s really good for your age.\"\nI pushed myself off the wall, sweat mixing with the blood from various small cuts. Every muscle in my body screamed in protest, but I’d learned more about my limitations in this battle than in hours of solo practice.\n\"We are taking a five minute break, then we will resume,\" I announced, my breathing somewhat laboured from the intense exchange.\nKojiro nodded his head before taking a seat on the floor cross-legged, closing his eyes in what appeared to be a meditative state. His breathing was also slightly laboured, showing a few signs of exertion from the vigorous sparring session we’d just completed.\nI activated my Blood Control trait, feeling the familiar sensation as I directed my own blood flow to accelerate healing in the injured areas. The ache in my ribs began to subside as I encouraged better circulation and cellular repair. It wasn’t miraculous healing, but it would help with the minor damage I’d sustained.\nI also retrieved one of the mortal-grade healing potions from my storage and drank it quickly. The effects weren’t particularly potent, but they were sufficient for the light injuries I’d sustained. The warm sensation spread through my body as the potion’s magic worked to mend cuts and reduce inflammation.\nFive minutes passed, and I felt significantly better, not perfect, but back in fighting condition. This time, I decided to up the ante a bit. It wasn’t exactly enjoyable getting beaten down twice in a row without at least making Kojiro work for his victories.\nI stood up, rolling my shoulders and testing my sword arm’s range of motion. Time to see how he handled a more serious challenge.",

I could feel the familiar surge as my bloodline ability coursed through my system, strengthening every muscle fibber and sharpening my reaction time.\nKojiro nodded his head, settling back into his defensive posture with the same calm and composed expression as before.\nBam!\nI charged at him without warning, closing the distance in a blur of motion that was significantly faster than my previous attempts. Our swords met with tremendous force, the impact reverberating through the training room.\nCLANG!\nI could see Kojiro’s eyes widen in surprise as my enhanced strike pushed him back several meters. His feet slid across the floor as he absorbed the unexpected power behind my attack, clearly recalibrating his assessment of my capabilities.\nWhoosh! Clash!\nThis time, I pressed the advantage immediately. My enhanced reflexes allowed me to flow seamlessly from the initial strike into a series of rapid combinations. Where before I had been reactive and defensive, now I was the aggressor.\nClang! Clang! Scriiing!\nɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nKojiro parried with difficulty, his blade work still technically superior but now struggling to keep pace with my new speed and strength. Each of my strikes carried enough force to jar his arms, disrupting the perfect form he’d maintained so effortlessly before.\nThud! Clash!\nI feinted high then swept low, my blade catching his leg guard and nearly taking him off balance. Kojiro stumbled slightly, the first time I’d seen him lose his perfect composure during our entire encounter.\nWhoosh! Clang! Scrape!\nMy vitality meant I could maintain this aggressive pace without the fatigue that had plagued me earlier. Each breath came easily, each movement flowed into the next with fluidity.\nCLASH!\nA powerful overhead strike drove Kojiro’s guard down, opening his defence for a split second. I immediately capitalized with a thrust toward his chest, forcing him to twist awkwardly to avoid the blow.\nClang! Thunk!\nFor the first time in our sparring, I managed to land a solid hit that hurt Kojiro. My pommel struck his shoulder as he overcommitted to a parry, the impact causing him to wince and step back.\nSlash! Clang! Scriiing!\nKojiro attempted to regain control with a series of precise cuts, but my enhanced reflexes allowed me to not just parry but counter-attack in the same motion. The rhythm of combat had shifted decisively in my favour.\nThwack! Clash!\nAnother successful strike, this time the flat of my blade catching his ribs as he failed to fully evade my attack.\nWhoosh! CLANG! Crack!\nI pressed forward relentlessly, each strike faster and stronger than what my body should naturally be capable of. Kojiro was being overwhelmed by my raw enhanced ability.\nThud!\nA shoulder check sent him stumbling backward as I closed distance. My strength made the impact far more devastating than it should have been, disrupting his balance and opening his guard.\nClang! Scrape! Thunk!\nI capitalized immediately with a combination that drove him further back. Where before every exchange had favoured Kojiro’s superior skill, now my enhanced physical capabilities were evening the playing field.\nCLASH!\nOur blades locked, and for the first time, I felt Kojiro struggling against my strength. His arms trembled slightly as he tried to push back against my force.\nScriiing! Thwack!\nI broke the lock and immediately followed with a strike that caught his sword arm, causing him to grunt in pain and adjust his grip.\nClang! Clang! Whoosh!\nKojiro was now clearly on the defensive, his movements more reactive than proactive. His technique remained strong, but he was being forced to respond to my attacks rather than dictating the pace of combat.\nThud! Clash!\nAnother successful hit landed on his torso, the dulled blade still carrying enough force to make him stagger. I could see in his eyes that he was struggling now, his earlier confidence replaced by focused concentration as he adapted to this new dynamic.\nThe tables had turned completely. My Second Order trait had transformed me from an outmatched student into a formidable opponent who could challenge even his superior technique through sheer physical capability.\nI ended the battle shortly after with a decisive combination that left Kojiro’s guard completely broken. I smirked before looking at him, noticing that he no longer regarded me with the same assessment as before. There was a new respect in his dark eyes, a recognition that I was more than just a normal student.\n\"What do you think?\" I asked with a triumphant smile spreading across my face. After being thoroughly beaten for minutes on end, it felt incredibly satisfying to repay him in kind.\nKojiro straightened slowly, rolling his shoulder where I’d landed several solid hits. \"You are strong... really strong. But your swordsmanship still needs more refining, though I can see it improving even as we fought. You are genuinely talented. That enhancement technique you used must be really powerful.\"\nI smiled at his honest assessment. It seemed like Kojiro wasn’t simply a yes-man who would flatter me regardless of reality. Rather, he appeared to be both loyal and truthful, exactly the kind of subordinate I needed.\n\"Alright, how about this,\" I proposed, lowering my sword. \"I won’t use my enhancement technique, and I want you to use your strongest attack against me.\"\nKojiro looked at me with obvious concern before responding carefully. \"I will hurt you.\"\n\"You won’t. Try it,\" I replied confidently.\nHe looked conflicted, clearly torn between following my orders and his reluctance to potentially injure me. After a long moment, he nodded reluctantly. \"Alright, but let me rest for a few minutes first.\"\nI nodded in agreement before adding, \"I will help you recover. Don’t fight it.\"\nI activated my Blood Control trait once again, but this time directed it toward Kojiro. I carefully enhanced his circulation, ensuring that oxygen and nutrients reached his muscles more efficiently while helping to clear metabolic waste that had built up during our intense sparring.\nKojiro’s eyes widened slightly as he felt the effects, his breathing becoming deeper and more relaxed as his body recovered at an accelerated rate.\nTen minutes later, Kojiro stood refreshed and ready, his posture indicating he was prepared to demonstrate the full extent of his capabilities.",

      "content": "Chapter 87: Secret Art.\nI smiled before holding my sword in a defensive position, my stance relaxed but ready. \"I’m ready whenever you are.\"\nKojiro’s entire demeanour shifted as he prepared for his ultimate technique. His eyes focused with laser-like intensity, and his breathing slowed to a calm, measured rhythm. The air around him seemed to thicken as his aura flared rapidly, waves of Elite-rank power radiating outward like heat from a forge.\nThe very atmosphere in the training room vibrated with the build-up of his concentrated energy. His sword began to emit a low, resonant hum as he channelled his full power into the blade.\nI stood calmly ten meters away, watching as Kojiro’s preparation reached its crescendo. His muscles coiled like springs ready to unleash devastating force.\nWHOOOOSH!\nSuddenly, Kojiro exploded forward with blinding speed. He launched himself across the distance separating us in a mere second. His sword trailed streaks of concentrated aura as it cut through the air.\nSHRIIIIING!\nThe blade sang with lethal intent as it descended toward me in a perfect arc, every ounce of his skill, experience, and power focused into a single, devastating strike. The sound was like lightning splitting the sky.\n’Null Strike!’ I thought to myself, activating the secret technique at the precise moment of impact.\nWOOOOM!\nAn invisible force erupted from my position, creating a sphere of absolute negation around me.\nCLANG-SILENCE\nKojiro’s sword met the invisible barrier and simply... stopped. Not deflected, not blocked, but it was completely negated. The devastating attack that should have cleaved through steel and stone simply ceased to exist the moment it entered the technique’s radius.\nTHUD!\nKojiro’s momentum carried him forward, but his attack had been so thoroughly nullified that he stumbled past me, his sword hanging uselessly in his grasp. The silence that followed was deafening after the explosive build-up.\nHis eyes widened in absolute shock as he spun around to face me, his breathing ragged not from exertion but from sheer disbelief.\n\"How?\" he gasped, his voice barely above a whisper. \"What kind of technique is this? I’ve never seen such a thing... it’s impossible!\"\nThe awe in his voice was unmistakable. Here was a warrior who had likely witnessed countless techniques and abilities throughout his existence, yet my Null Strike had left him completely speechless.\nClatter\nHis sword trembled slightly in his grip as he stared at me with newfound reverence. The attack that represented the pinnacle of his abilities had been dismissed as if it never existed..ɴet\n\"That wasn’t deflection or evasion,\" he continued, his mind struggling to comprehend what had occurred. \"You didn’t counter my technique...you simply... erased it. How is such a technique even possible?\"\nThe training room fell into stunned silence as Kojiro processed the implications of what he’d just witnessed.\n\"This is the stance of a secret art... a powerful one,\" I responded, keeping my expression carefully neutral.\nKojiro nodded his head in shock, still processing what he’d witnessed. \"Where did you find it? Where can I get such a secret art?\"\nI looked at him with a wry smile. \"I got it from... a friend. As for getting such an art, you can’t just find it anywhere. Everyone keeps these things to themselves, but if I find one, I will gift it to you. Don’t worry.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Kojiro looked at me with a genuinely grateful expression, bowing his head respectfully.\n\"You are welcome.\"\nMy thoughts drifted to Carmilla and the Overlord-rank secret art she had given me. I wondered how she could have known that I would eventually return to save her when I gained sufficient power. What if I simply forgot about her entirely? What if I decided she wasn’t worth the risk?\n\"ARGH!!!\"\nA terrible, agonizing pain suddenly erupted in my chest, radiating outward from my heart like molten metal coursing through my veins. The pain was so intense it felt like my heart was being crushed in an iron vice while simultaneously being set ablaze.\nThud!\nI clutched desperately at my chest, my sword clattering to the floor as my legs gave out beneath me. The world spun violently as waves of unbearable agony washed over me.\n\"Hey... Are you okay\" Kojiro’s voice reached me, but it sounded muffled and distant, as if he were shouting from the bottom of a well. I could feel his strong hands trying to support me, but my body had become completely unresponsive.\nCrash!\nI hit the training room floor hard, my vision blurring as tears of pain streamed down my face. Every heartbeat sent fresh spikes of torment through my entire body. It felt like I was dying, like something was literally tearing my soul apart from the inside.\nKojiro’s worried face appeared above me, his mouth moving frantically, but his words were completely drowned out by the roaring in my ears. The pain was beyond anything I’d ever experienced, beyond what I thought was humanly possible to endure.\nDarkness slowly engulfed my vision like thick smoke, creeping in from the edges until everything went black. My last coherent thought was terror at losing consciousness in such a vulnerable state.\n\"Hahh!\"\nI woke up gasping for air, my entire body drenched in cold sweat and my heart hammering against my ribs like a caged animal. Panic immediately seized me as the memory of that excruciating pain flooded back.\nI looked around frantically, searching for Kojiro with urgency. If the academy had discovered his existence while I was unconscious... if I’d been out for hours and someone had found us...\nRelief washed over me as I spotted him kneeling beside me, his dark eyes filled with concern.\n\"Are you okay?\" he asked immediately, his eyes scanning my body for any problems.\nI nodded shakily. \"How long have I been knocked out for?\"\n\"...About a minute.\"\n\"Oh... I see, thank god.\" I sighed in profound relief, my racing heart finally beginning to slow.\n\"Just what happened there...\" I thought to myself, still shaken by the inexplicable attack.",

      "content": "Chapter 88: Carmilla\nThe pain I felt couldn’t be a coincidence. The moment I had contemplated forgetting about fulfilling my promise to Carmilla, agony had nearly killed me. That level of precise timing was impossible to attribute to chance.\nMy mind raced back to that fateful encounter in that realm, specifically to the moment she had fed me her blood.\n\"Could it be...\"\nA grim smile formed on my face as the pieces fell into place. Carmilla hadn’t trusted me. No, of course she hadn’t. Someone at her level of power and experience knew exactly what she was doing when she had fed me her blood.\nShe had planted a damn safeguard directly into my heart through her blood.\nThe realization was both infuriating and grudgingly impressive. If I so much as entertained thoughts of breaking my promise to rescue her, I would receive this agonizing warning. And if my suspicions were correct, attempting to actually abandon her might result in death itself.\nCarmilla had effectively turned my own cardiovascular system into a magical contract enforcement mechanism. Every drop of her blood now flowing through my veins served as a constant reminder of my obligation to her.\nThe cunning of it was diabolical. She hadn’t relied on my honour, my gratitude, or my word as a fellow vampire. Instead, she had created a biological imperative that made betraying her literally painful, possibly fatal.\n\"Brilliant,\" I muttered under my breath, equal parts annoyed and impressed by her foresight.\nCarmilla’s POV\nIn an unknown realm that existed between dimensions, where shadows writhed with malevolent life and the very air hummed with power, I remained bound by chains forged from materials that predated most civilizations.\nThese shackles had held me for countless years, their metal drinking in my strength and preventing any attempt at escape. Yet even here, in this prison designed specifically to contain beings of my magnitude, I maintained certain... connections.\nMy eyes fluttered open as a familiar sensation rippled through the mystical bond I had so carefully established with an interesting, cute, little new-born vampire. The blood I had given to that young vampire was more than a powerup, it was a tether, a window into his very soul.\nA smile broke across my face, revealing my canines that gleamed like polished ivory in the realm’s perpetual twilight.\n\"How do you like my gift... hehe.\"\nThe new-born had just discovered the true nature of our arrangement. I knew that he was intelligent enough to grasp the implications quickly. Otherwise, I would have never allowed him to touch me, let alone drink my blood, directly from my neck\nMy laughter echoed through the empty realm. After so many years of imprisonment, it felt delicious to know that my liberation was only a matter of time under that new-born. With his talent, he should be able to rise high.\nThe blood contract I had woven into his very essence would ensure his compliance. Betray me, and face agony.\n\"Don’t take too long...it’s lonely out here, hehe.\" I whispered into the void.Follow current novels on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n***\n\"Are you sure you are okay?\" Kojiro asked me for the third time, his concern evident in his dark eyes.\n\"I’m fine, Kojiro. Also, I will unsummon you for now. I will summon you back some time later, okay? I want you to meet a few people,\" I said, still feeling the lingering effects of that mysterious pain but determined to proceed with my plans.\nKojiro nodded respectfully. \"Alright.\"\nWith that, I focused my will and unsummoned him, watching as he dissolved back into the card with the familiar flash of light. I then left the training room, abandoning the remaining five minutes of my rental time. The few points worth of time didn’t matter compared to what I needed to accomplish.\nMaking my way outside the academy grounds, I spotted one of my guards stationed at his designated patrol point. My personal guards were named Lex and Lux, brothers who had been cultivated by my family from a young age. They were no longer young men, now in their late twenties, but their loyalty to the Blackwood house was absolute.\n\"Take me to your house. I need to talk to you both,\" I said to Lex, who immediately straightened at my approach.\n\"Yes, young master,\" he replied without hesitation.\nThey led me through the nearby residential district to their shared dwelling, which wasn’t far from the academy’s perimeter. Entering inside, I was reminded of my father’s generous treatment of his servants. The house was genuinely luxurious, spacious rooms, quality furnishings, and magical amenities that reflected their status as Transcendent-rank awakeners in service to a ducal house.\nWhen we arrived in the main living area, I discretely retrieved Kojiro’s card from my storage and activated it without warning.\nFlash!\nThe familiar burst of light filled the room as Kojiro materialized in his combat gear, his imposing two-meter frame suddenly occupying the center of the space.\nBoth Lex and Lux were immediately on high alert, their hands moving instinctively to their weapons as someone had just appeared randomly inside their secure residence without any warning or detection.\n\"Be careful, young master!\" Lex shouted, his sword already half-drawn as both brothers moved to protective positions around me.\nLux’s body blazed with Transcendent-rank power as he prepared to engage what appeared to be an intruder. \"How did he get past our detection wards?\"\n\"Stop! He’s with me. I want you to meet him,\" I said quickly, raising my hands to prevent an unnecessary confrontation.\nBoth of my guards looked visibly shocked and confused. They could clearly sense that Kojiro was at the peak of Elite-rank, yet he had appeared as if he had simply materialized from thin air. Their faces showed the bewilderment of experienced warriors encountering something completely outside their understanding.\nI could see the questions forming in their minds, but I had no intention of explaining the card’s mechanics. They knew better than to press for details when I chose not to elaborate on family secrets.",

      "content": "Chapter 89: Lex and Lux\n\"Lex, Lux, this is Kojiro,\" I began, gesturing toward the imposing warrior who stood at attention in their living room. \"He’s an Elite-rank swordsman under my command, and I have a specific task that requires your assistance.\"\nBoth brothers remained alert but relaxed their combat stances, though their eyes never left Kojiro as they assessed this unexpected newcomer.\n\"I want you to accompany him on a hunt for a Transcendent-rank beast,\" I continued, watching their expressions carefully. \"However, your role is purely protective. You should only intervene if something goes catastrophically wrong. The actual combat must be handled by Kojiro himself - he needs to defeat a Transcendent-rank opponent to break through to that level himself.\"\nLex and Lux exchanged troubled glances, their internal conflict obvious. As my personal guards, their primary duty was protecting me, not babysitting other warriors on potentially dangerous missions.\n\"Young master,\" Lux said carefully, \"our orders are to ensure your safety above all else. Leaving you unprotected while we escort someone else goes against our responsibilities.\"\n\"I understand your concerns,\" I replied, anticipating this objection. \"But I can promise you that I will remain within the capital during your absence. The academy grounds are among the safest places in the kingdom, and I won’t venture beyond the city limits.\"\nBoth guards sighed in reluctance, clearly torn between their duty and my direct orders. After a long moment of consideration, they nodded their acceptance.\n\"We will do as you command,\" Lex said finally. \"However, we must inform Duke Blackwood of this arrangement. He needs to know about any changes to your security detail.\"\n\"That’s perfectly fine,\" I assured them. \"I can convince my father of the necessity once he understands the situation.\"\n\"Then, if everything goes well, we can set out this evening,\" Lux added. \"There are several known Transcendent beast territories within a few hours travel from here.\"\nBefore they departed, I decided to significantly improve Kojiro’s chances of success. I retrieved several of my Enhanced-rank items from storage and presented them to him.\n\"Take these,\" I said, offering the Swift Step Boots first. \"These will increase your agility by five percent and provide better mobility during combat.\"\nNext came the Mana Flow Bracelet, its silver surface gleaming with embedded micro-crystals. \"This will boost your total mana capacity, giving you more energy to work with during extended fights.\"\nThe Razor Edge Sword was the most significant upgrade. \"This blade possesses supernatural sharpness that can cut through steel like butter. It’s far superior to your current Mortal-rank weapon.\"\nFinally, I produced the Typhoon Pendant, its rare-rank aura immediately apparent to everyone present. \"This creates devastating whirlwind attacks. It’s currently fully charged and blood-bound to me, but I’m temporarily transferring usage rights to you, take care of it.\"\nKojiro looked incredibly grateful as he equipped each item, his overall combat effectiveness increasing substantially. \"With these enhancements, I stand a much better chance against a Transcendent-rank opponent, my lord.\"\nThe preparation was complete. Tonight, Kojiro would face his greatest challenge yet.\nOn the way back to the academy, my communication crystal began to ring with the familiar resonance that indicated an incoming call from my father. I had expected this conversation would happen sooner rather than later.\nI channeled a small amount of mana into the crystal, establishing the connection. \"Father.\"\n\"Adrian,\" came Duke Blackwood’s authoritative voice through the magical link. \"Lex just contacted me about some rather unusual arrangements you’ve made. Care to explain why you’re sending my Transcendent guards on a babysitting mission?\"\nI had anticipated his resistance and was prepared with my reasoning. \"I’m sure you’ve heard about the prototype weapon I’ve been developing from Lex and Lux.\"\nThere was a brief pause before he responded. \"Indeed, I have. I haven’t spoken to you about it yet because I figured I would wait for you to bring it up yourself.\"\nI nodded even though he couldn’t see me. \"Yes, father. I wanted the prototype to be significantly improved before sending it to you. And I’m almost finished with the current iteration. So I won’t be leaving the city anytime soon - you can trust me on that. If Kojiro could break through to Transcendent rank, I would actually have even better personal security.\"\n\"This Kojiro,\" my father’s tone became more serious, \"tell me about his origins. Where did you find him, and how can you be certain of his loyalty?\"\n\"I’ve known him for some time now, and he has proven himself trustworthy on multiple occasions,\" I replied carefully, keeping my explanation vague but confident. \"His skills are exceptional, and his dedication is absolute.\"The source of thɪs content is novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nAnother pause stretched across the connection as my father considered my words.\n\"Alright,\" he said finally, though I could hear the reservation in his voice. \"We will see how this arrangement works out. But Adrian - if anything seems amiss, you contact me immediately.\"\n\"Of course, father. How is Kael doing?\" I asked, shifting the conversation to the Winter Beast’s progress.\n\"He’s doing remarkably well, his strength is improving rapidly, and his physical development has been quite dramatic. He’s growing at an impressive rate, both in height and muscle mass. The healers are amazed by his transformation.\"\nI smiled at the news, though I wasn’t particularly surprised by this development. Kael had only appeared short and frail because of years of severe malnutrition while living as a street orphan. Once that underlying issue was addressed with proper food, medical care, and the resources of a ducal household, his true potential was finally being realized.\nThe awakening process had likely accelerated his physical development even further. When someone awakened their bloodline, their body underwent significant changes to accommodate their new abilities. In Kael’s case, this meant his stunted growth was being rapidly corrected as his enhanced physiology caught up to where it should have been all along.\nIt was satisfying to know that bringing him into our family had been the right decision.\n\"That’s excellent news, father. I’m glad to hear he’s adapting well to his new circumstances.\"\n\"Indeed. Your instincts about him were correct, Adrian. He shows great promise, based on my estimates he should become Intune with his body in about four days. By that time he would have learnt all the basics, and he would be ready to enter the academy.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 90: Class Examination [1]\nAfter speaking to my father, I was confident that Kojiro would soon be making his way to the wilderness to hunt a Transcendent-rank beast and achieve his breakthrough. The preparations were in motion, and my guards would ensure his safety while allowing him the combat experience he needed.\nBefore heading back to the academy, I decided to make another visit to the materials shop where Elen and I had purchased our crafting supplies. My mind was buzzing with different kinds of project ideas and to implement them, I needed to have resources.\nThe same merchant greeted me with obvious enthusiasm when he saw me return so soon. This time, I purchased a much more extensive collection of materials - additional Mithril for structural components, more Orichalcum wire for magical conductivity, and various alloy samples for experimentation.\nThe total came to nearly a thousand golden coins, a substantial investment that would have bankrupted most students but didn’t even make a dent in my family’s resources. These materials would allow me to pursue multiple ambitious projects simultaneously rather than being limited by supply constraints.\nOn the way back to the academy, I continued practicing with my Blood Enhancement trait, focusing on maintaining the enhancement for longer periods and achieving more precise control over the effect. The constant practice during my walks finally paid dividends.\n[Your Blood Enhancement trait has reached level 2]\nA smile erupted across my face as the notification appeared. This was exactly the kind of progress I needed to see. The enhanced version would provide even greater physical improvements and likely consume less mana to maintain.\nBut even this advancement wasn’t enough. I needed to level up all of my traits if I wanted to survive what was coming. I couldn’t afford to remain a sitting duck, hiding safely within the academy’s protective barriers while threats gathered beyond its walls.\nI wanted to be more proactive in my approach to gaining strength, and that meant actively seeking out combat opportunities to kill beasts and gain soul power. Only by accumulating enough soul power could I advance to the next rank and truly begin to matter in this world’s power structure.\nElite-rank awakeners were considered cannon fodder at best when real battles occurred. Only by reaching Transcendent rank would I have meaningful influence and the ability to protect myself and those I cared about. The path forward was clear.\nI spent the rest of the day immersed in training, alternating between practicing my various abilities and working on blacksmithing techniques. The repetitive routine was becoming mind-numbing. My life had been remarkably boring lately, consisting of nothing but endless training sessions.\nIt was a stark contrast to my previous life on Earth, where there had been countless entertaining diversions, reading web novels, playing video games, watching movies, socializing without the constant threat of assassination. Here, every moment was focused on survival and strength acquisition.\nI cursed my family’s enemies under my breath, vowing silently to make them regret forcing me into this prison-like existence within the academy walls. The next time they attacked, I would be ready. I would tear them apart before they could even consider their self-destruction tactics. Now that I understood their methods, I wouldn’t give them the opportunity to reach that desperate stage.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nThe next day arrived with an unusual sense of anticipation in the air.\nUnlike the previous routine days, today marked a significant new Chapter in my academic career. When I entered the classroom, Instructor Sylvia’s expression was more serious than usual, and there was an energy among the students that suggested something important was about to happen.\n\"Good morning everyone,\" Sylvia announced, her voice cutting through the morning chatter. \"I will get straight to the point as we don’t have much time. Today will be your first entry into the academy’s beast training ground. This will be a class examination, and like we’ve said before, during class examinations, you will be tested as a whole group rather than as individual students.\"\nThe atmosphere in the room shifted immediately. Students sat up straighter, their casual morning demeanour replaced by focused expressions.\n\"The examination will be held against other classrooms,\" Sylvia continued, \"and I say this with complete seriousness, you should not underestimate any of them. Winning this examination will not only provide you with the points you all desperately want, but will also allow the highest contributing student of the winning classroom to gain the swap card.\"\nConfused murmurs rippled through the class. Several students exchanged puzzled glances before someone finally voiced the question on everyone’s mind.\n\"Swap card? What’s that?\" Kyle asked from his position near the front of the classroom.\nInstructor Sylvia’s expression grew even more grave as she prepared to explain. \"The swap card is exactly what it sounds like, a card that essentially allows its user to swap places with any student in the Elite class. Which means, if another class wins this tournament, they will have the ability to replace one of you. The selected student will be demoted from Elite class status and take the winner’s place in their original classroom.\"\nThe implications hit the room like a thunderbolt. Murmurs spread rapidly across the classroom as students began to grasp the true stakes of this examination. This wasn’t just about points or academic rankings - this was about maintaining their privileged position in the academy’s most prestigious class.\n\"Wait,\" Elen said, her voice tight with concern, \"you mean we could actually lose our spots in Elite class?\"\n\"Precisely,\" Sylvia confirmed. \"Elite class positions are not guaranteed. They must be earned and maintained through consistent performance. This examination system ensures that only the most capable students remain in advanced programs.\"\nThe casual confidence that had characterized most of my classmates evaporated instantly. Everyone understood that the competition had just become deadly serious - not just against beasts, but against their fellow students who were hungry to claim their positions.\nI felt a grim smile tugging at my lips. Finally, something interesting was about to happen.",

      "content": "Chapter 91: Class Examinaton [2]\nWith the examination explained in full detail, we gathered our belongings and followed Professor Sylvia out of the classroom. The usual casual chatter among students was notably absent - everyone seemed lost in their own thoughts about the high stakes we now faced.\nThe walk took us through sections of the academy I’d never seen before, past restricted corridors and heavily warded doorways that suggested we were entering areas normally off-limits to students.\nSoon we arrived at our destination, and the sight was genuinely impressive. The examination area was an incredibly massive open space that stretched beyond what I could easily see, surrounded by towering fences reinforced with magical barriers. Guards were stationed at regular intervals along the perimeter, and I could immediately sense that many of them were Transcendent-rank awakeners.\nMost striking of all was the Commander-rank guard standing near the main entrance, his arms crossed as he surveyed the arriving students with the casual confidence of someone who could single-handedly eliminate everyone present if necessary. His very presence emphasized just how seriously the academy took these examinations.\nThis area was clearly not available to students under normal circumstances - accessible only during special examination periods when proper supervision could be maintained.\nOther classes began arriving alongside us, their instructors leading groups of students who looked just as tense and focused as we did. In total, I counted five classes that would be participating in this examination, meaning roughly one hundred and fifty students would be competing for the same prize.\nMy eyes briefly met with Kyle’s group as they approached. He nodded at me with his confident smile, followed by similar acknowledgments from his companions, including Seraphina. I returned their courtesy with a polite nod before deliberately turning my attention elsewhere.\n\"Hey, what do you think the examination is about?\" Elen asked quietly, moving closer so our conversation wouldn’t be overheard. \"Hunting beasts?\"\nI shook my head definitively. \"It can’t be that simple. If it were just about hunting beasts, the Elite classes would have an overwhelming advantage due to our higher average strength. The other classes would have essentially no chance of winning.\"\n\"That makes sense,\" Elen agreed, her mind immediately grasping the logic. \"There must be some kind of equalizing factor or different objective that gives everyone a fair shot.\"\nI wasn’t drawing from any knowledge of the novel for this assessment. This examination had never occurred in the original timeline, at least not that I could recall. My existence had obviously created ripple effects that were altering events, which wasn’t exactly surprising news at this point.\nWhile examinations in this location had been mentioned in the novel, I doubted the format would be identical to what had been described. The academy seemed to be adapting their testing methods, possibly in response to the changing dynamics among the student body.\nI was going to find out the truth soon enough, so I wasn’t particularly concerned about speculating further. Whatever challenge awaited us, I was confident in my ability to adapt and succeed.\nAfter everyone had arrived and the five classes were assembled in formation, I noticed that none of our instructors stepped forward to address us. Instead, the domineering, middle-aged guard at the Commander level moved to the centre of the gathering, his presence immediately commanding absolute attention from every student present.\nHis cold eyes swept across the entire crowd with the calculating gaze of someone who had seen countless students come and go over the years. When he spoke, his voice carried the authority of absolute power.\n\"I will make this brief,\" he began, his tone brooking no argument. \"First of all, I welcome you to my backyard. I’ve been guarding this place for longer than any of you have been alive, and I know more about it than you ever will. So, anything I say must be taken seriously - otherwise you will die, and you will have nobody to blame but yourself.\"Follow current novels on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nThe casual way he mentioned death sent a chill through the assembled students. This wasn’t hyperbole or intimidation tactics - this was a simple statement of fact.\n\"Your families might try to complain or raise issues if something happens to you,\" he continued with obvious disdain, \"but it will lead to nothing but disappointment. The academy’s liability ends the moment you enter these testing grounds, so don’t make me go through that headache of dealing with grieving relatives who should have taught their children to listen to their instructors better.\"\nSeveral students moved uncomfortably at his blunt assessment, but no one dared to speak or object.\n\"Now for the examination itself,\" the Commander said, his voice taking on a more business-like tone. \"It follows this format: You will have the ability to enter two different environments. All other areas will be marked by guards and magical barriers that will prevent you from venturing too deep into the more dangerous sections of this preserve. Your mission is to accumulate Crest Marks by completing various objectives within these designated zones.\"\nHe gestured toward two distinct sections of the massive enclosed area behind him.\n\"The environments available to you are as follows. The first is the Dense Forest section,\" he announced, pointing toward a heavily wooded area. \"This area is ambush-heavy, which means dangerous Elite-rank predators will be lurking throughout. You should exercise extreme caution when entering that place, as you could be ambushed at any moment from within the dense tree cover.\"\nI could see several students already looking nervous at the description.\n\"Inside the Dense Forest, your mission is to locate and kill white donkeys. These creatures have been specifically prepared for this examination - we have hidden Crest Marks inside their bodies. This means you will need to not only hunt them successfully but also dissect their corpses to retrieve the marks. Each white donkey contains between one and three Crest Marks, depending on the specimen. Before you ask, killing any other type of monster will not count towards your Crest Marks but simply ensure your survival.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Class Examination [3]\nThe Commander’s expression grew slightly more serious as he continued.\n\"The second environment consists of various Ruins and Shrines scattered throughout the eastern section,\" he said, indicating a area dotted with ancient stone structures. \"In this zone, you will need to complete different puzzles and locate hidden chambers where Crest Marks have been concealed. Mind you, while this area doesn’t contain as many predators as the Dense Forest, the puzzles are genuinely difficult to solve, and there are magical traps throughout these ruins that might disorient you, mislead you, or even cause serious injury.\"\nHe paused to let the information sink in before delivering what seemed to be the most important part.\n\"The examination will last exactly Two days. At the end of this period, all Crest Marks will be tallied by class. The class with the highest total number of Crest Marks wins the examination and gains access to the swap card. Individual contribution within the winning class will determine who receives the card itself.\"\nHis eyes narrowed as he scanned the crowd once more.\n\"I will say this only once more - the dangers in both environments are real and potentially lethal. The academy is not responsible for injuries, permanent disabilities, or deaths that occur due to student negligence or overconfidence. If you are not prepared to accept these risks, you may withdraw now and receive a failing grade rather than risking your life.\"\nThe silence that followed was absolute. Not a single student moved to leave, though I could see the fear and determination warring in many faces around me.\n\"Excellent,\" the Commander said with what might have been approval. \"You have ten minutes to strategize with your classmates before the examination begins. Use this time wisely, it may be the difference between success and failure...life and death.\"\nAs he stepped back, the reality of what we were about to face began to truly sink in.\nAfter the Commander stepped down, Elen turned to me with obvious concern written across her face. \"So... what are we going to do now?\"\nI shrugged my shoulders, keeping my expression neutral. \"Our team needs to decide on a leader first. What I say now won’t matter if we don’t pick a leader to coordinate our efforts.\"\nElen tilted her head thoughtfully. \"Why can’t we just have different leaders for different aspects? You know, someone for the forest team, someone for the ruins team?\"\nI shook my head firmly. \"There’s a reason why there’s only one king in a kingdom. Having multiple leadership structures will make things chaotic. Different people will have different ideas and conflicting strategies, and internal conflict will inevitably emerge. Agreeing on one leader is the best course of action to ensure we remain united as one cohesive unit without any destructive internal disputes.\"\n\"That makes sense,\" she nodded, her mind immediately grasping the logic behind unified command.\nBefore I could continue elaborating on leadership strategies, Emmet approached with his casual stride, hands buried deep in his pockets. He didn’t say anything, just positioned himself near me and remained there with his typical stoic expression. His action was clear without words - he was indicating his willingness to follow my lead.\nAs if encouraged by Emmet’s obvious show of support, other students began converging toward our position. One by one, the members of our Elite class gravitated toward where I stood, forming a loose circle around me.\nIn less than a minute, the entire Elite class had gathered in our vicinity, including all of the most talented individuals. Even Marcus Ironhold, who typically maintained his own independent stance, had moved to join our group.\nWith a knowing smile spreading across her face, Elen looked at me expectantly. \"Adrian, what should we do now?\"\nI looked around at everyone who had assembled, taking in the faces of my classmates who were now looking to me, waiting. The weight of their expectations was obvious, but I needed to handle this properly to avoid any resentment or challenges to authority.\n\"We need to pick a leader for this team examination,\" I announced clearly, ensuring my voice carried to everyone in our group. \"Anyone who wants to apply for the leadership position should raise their hands now. This is your opportunity to make your case for why you should guide our strategy.\"ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nI deliberately kept my own hand down for the moment, wanting to see who else might step forward and what kind of opposition or support might emerge. Leadership needed to be established through consensus rather than assumption, even if the outcome seemed predetermined based on how everyone had naturally gravitated toward my position.\n\"Just hurry up, Blackwood. Nobody here is going to take leadership, not after you’ve broken multiple records already,\" Emmet said with an exasperated roll of his eyes, his hands still firmly planted in his pockets.\nA few of our classmates chuckled at Emmet’s blunt assessment, clearly finding his directness amusing while also agreeing with the underlying sentiment. The laughter carried a note of acknowledgment - everyone understood that the leadership question had essentially been decided the moment they all gravitated toward my position.\nI glanced toward Marcus Ironhold, whose expression remained neutral but showed no signs of objection or challenge. His silence was as good as an endorsement, and I could see similar acceptance in the faces of the other students around me.\n\"Alright, I will take charge,\" I announced, stepping fully into the leadership role that had been implicitly offered to me. \"We’re going to split our class into four different specialized teams, each with distinct responsibilities that will maximize our efficiency and coverage.\"\nI gestured to different sections of our group as I explained the structure.\n\"Hunters and Frontliners: This team will be responsible for directly engaging the Elite-rank beasts in the Dense Forest and hunting the white donkeys. You’ll also serve as our primary defence against any rival class raids or interference.\"\nSeveral of the more combat-focused students, including Emmet, nodded their understanding. This was the role they fit in and were interested in.",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Class Examination [4]\n\"The next two roles will be less focused on combat, and more on information. First we have the scouts. Your job will be to identify white donkey trails, locate safe zones for our other teams, and map out the most efficient routes through both environments. You’ll also be in charge of monitoring our rivals, tracking their movements, identifying their camping spots, and reporting anything you find important.\"\nThe more agile students showed interest in this role, understanding the importance of intelligence gathering.\n\"Puzzle Solvers: This team will focus exclusively on the Ruins and Shrines, working to decode the magical puzzles and locate the hidden Crest Mark chambers. You’ll need analytical thinking, magical sensitivity and strength to protect yourself from other solvers you will encounter during your expeditions.\"\n\"Last but not least, the survivalists: You’ll build temporary shelters, manage our supplies and equipment, and handle emergency medical situations. This includes concocting antidotes for any magical traps we might encounter and ensuring everyone stays in fighting condition throughout the six-hour examination.\"\nElen’s eyes lit up at this description, clearly seeing where her skills would be most valuable.\nThe organizational structure was clear and comprehensive, giving everyone a defined role while maintaining flexibility for adaptation as circumstances changed.\nWe spent the next five minutes efficiently organizing everyone into their respective roles based on their individual strengths and preferences. The process went more smoothly than I had anticipated, with most students having a clear understanding of where they would be most effective.\nElen joined the Survivalists team without hesitation. Her magical strength wasn’t particularly high compared to some of our classmates, and she recognized that her analytical mind and alchemical knowledge would be far more valuable managing equipment and concocting healing potions if they became necessary during the examination.\nEmmet didn’t need to think much about his choice, immediately selecting the Hunters role. \"I want to fight,\" he stated simply. \"I don’t want to deal with anything else.\" His straightforward approach was exactly what I expected from him - direct combat was where he excelled and felt most comfortable.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nMarcus had surprisingly decided to join the Survivalists as well, which caught me off guard given his combat capabilities. \"My background and bloodline will allow me to help build effective shelters,\" he explained when I raised an eyebrow at his choice. \"The Ironhold family has extensive experience with construction and fortification.\"\nWhile it wasn’t necessarily a bad strategic decision, his power level could easily place him in the Hunters role where his strength would be more directly applicable. I didn’t reject his choice, letting him proceed as he pleased for now. If things went poorly during the examination, I would need to have a conversation with him about reassignment.\nI knew that convincing Marcus to change his mind would be particularly difficult. Even Kyle in the original novel had struggled to influence Marcus’s decisions effectively. The Ironhold family was renowned for their patience and methodical approach to everything, and Marcus clearly embodied those traits. I would need to take my time building trust with him rather than trying to force immediate compliance.\nA few other students caught my attention, especially those joining the Scouting and Puzzle Solvers teams. I recognized several of them from the novel - they were consistently top-performing students with solid reputations. While they weren’t necessarily exceptional talents who would reshape the story, they were competent individuals who would contribute meaningfully to our overall success.\nThe Scouts included students with enhanced perception abilities and natural stealth talents, while the Puzzle Solvers comprised those with strong analytical minds and magical sensitivity for detecting hidden enchantments.\nWith our team structure finalized, we quickly discussed basic coordination signals and emergency protocols. Everyone understood their primary responsibilities and how to communicate critical information back to the group.\nThe organization felt solid and comprehensive. Each team had clear objectives that would contribute to our overall Crest Mark accumulation while maintaining enough flexibility to adapt as circumstances changed during the examination.\n\"Attention!\" the Commander’s voice boomed across the entire area, immediately silencing all conversation among the assembled classes. \"Your preparation time has ended. The examination begins now. You have exactly Two Days. Good luck - you’ll need it.\"\n\"Attention!\" the Commander’s voice boomed across the entire area, immediately silencing all conversation among the assembled classes. \"Your preparation time has ended. The examination begins now. You have exactly two days. Good luck, you’ll need it.\"\nWithout waiting for any further instruction, students from all the other classes immediately darted toward the large gate that stood wide open. Everyone understood that getting an early advantage by entering first could be crucial for securing the best hunting grounds and puzzle locations.\nAs the mass exodus began, I held my team back with a simple gesture, raising my hand to signal them to wait. They all looked confused by this decision, and I could see some of them beginning to question my leadership ability. The delay seemed counterintuitive when every other class was rushing to claim territory.\n\"Why are we just standing here?\" one student muttered, clearly frustrated. \"We’re losing valuable time while everyone else gets ahead of us.\"\nBefore any real dissent could build, Emmet turned toward the complaining students with his characteristic cold gaze, his expression brooking no argument.\n\"We already chose him as our leader,\" Emmet stated flatly, his voice carrying an edge of warning. \"There will be no overturning of leadership decisions now. If you had problems with Adrian taking charge, you should have spoken up during the selection process.\"\n\"Bu-\"\n\"Do you want to fight?\" Emmet said, whilst walking towards the students with a smile on his face.\nElen immediately intervened. \"Let’s calm down guys.\"\nThe students who had been voicing doubts sighed in resignation and fell silent, though their body language still showed obvious impatience with the delay.\nAs Kyle’s group entered the forest area, he turned back to look at me with obvious curiosity, clearly wondering what strategy I had in mind that required holding back while everyone else rushed forward. His expression showed both confusion and interest, but he didn’t let it stop his own team’s advance.",

      "content": "Chapter 94: Hints [1]\nAfter all the students from the other classes had disappeared into the examination grounds, the Commander turned his attention to me with a look that mixed curiosity with stern authority. His experienced eyes seemed to be evaluating whether I had a legitimate reason for the delay or if I was simply making a rookie mistake.\nI looked back at my team, ensuring they understood to maintain their positions. \"Wait here. I will be back shortly.\"\nI walked directly toward the Commander, maintaining confident posture despite the intimidating presence he projected.\n\"How can I help you?\" the Commander asked, his tone neutral but clearly expecting a worthwhile explanation for my unusual approach.\n\"I want a hint.\"\nThe Commander looked at me as if I was an idiot, his expression shifting to one of complete bewilderment. He glanced over at my team, who had chosen me as their leader, clearly confused about why they would follow someone making such an apparently foolish request.\n\"Why would I give you a hint when I didn’t give the others?\" he said with obvious disdain. \"I suggest you hurry up and make your way toward the forest before you fall too far behind.\"\nI smiled confidently before delivering my real proposition. \"You will give me a hint because I will pay for it with my points.\"\nThe Commander looked visibly shocked, his eyes widening as if he couldn’t believe what the student before him had just said. The change in his demeanor was immediate and dramatic.\nNo student should know about the point system’s deeper applications yet. Every student who discovered the academy’s hidden point economy was required to sign a magical contract ensuring they couldn’t discuss it with families, friends, or anyone else.\nOnce that contract was breached, the academy would be immediately notified. This was how the institution ensured that new students remained ignorant of the system when they first entered, only gradually learning about it through experience.\n\"Who told you?\" The Commander’s aura flared dangerously, his power pressing down on me with intimidating force. This was clearly a serious issue in his mind - if someone had revealed the information, it meant the academy’s carefully designed secrecy system was compromised and fundamentally flawed.\n\"So I’m right... hah.\" I smiled with satisfaction at his reaction.\nThe Commander’s expression showed he realized he’d been played, that his shocked response had confirmed my suspicions about the point system’s hidden applications. His face darkened with a mixture of anger and grudging respect.\nHe looked like he wanted to detain me, interrogate me further, and take various disciplinary actions, but the examination was officially underway and he couldn’t abandon his duties.\n\"What hints do you want?\" he asked through gritted teeth. \"And do you even have the points required for such information?\"\nI knew I couldn’t ask for specific locations or detailed information - that would cost an astronomical number of points. Instead, I needed to ask an indirect question that would still provide valuable strategic advantage.\n\"I want to know the general direction of the shrine with the highest concentration of Crest Marks,\" I said carefully. \"Since there are multiple shrines, one must be significantly more difficult and valuable than the others. Am I right?\"\nThe Commander neither denied nor confirmed my assumption, remaining silent while he considered my request. \"So you want just the general direction?\"ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ\nI nodded my head firmly.\n\"Very well. That will cost you 50,000 points,\" he said with a smirk, as if saying ’would you really want to pay half of your monthly allowance just for this information?’\n\"That’s it? That’s pretty cheap,\" I replied with a smile, immediately agreeing without any hesitation or negotiation.\nI could have involved my team and made them contribute to the cost, but there was a specific reason why I had left them behind for this conversation.\nI took out my student identification card and handed it to him. \"You can deduct it directly.\"\n\"You’re not going to let your team help you pay?\" The Commander seemed genuinely shocked. Everyone desperately wanted points, yet here was a student casually spending them without even considering shared costs.\nI smirked before answering. \"Why would I let them know about this system?\"\nAfter paying the amount, the Commander leaned in slightly and said in a low voice, \"Head west.\"\nA smile formed on my face as I processed this information. During the initial rush, I hadn’t seen a single team heading in that direction. Most of the other classes had gone north toward the denser forest areas or south toward the more obvious shrine clusters.\nI returned to my team, where some members were clearly frustrated that we had already wasted several precious minutes while everyone else had gotten a head start. We were clearly behind everyone else, even the teams that were considered untalented.\n\"So? What did you talk to him about?\" Emmet was the first to ask, curious rather than impatient.\n\"I asked him about the direction of the shrine with the most Crest Marks,\" I replied matter-of-factly.\n\"And?\" Emmet pressed, waiting for the response.\n\"He told me it’s to the west. We should start moving.\"\nMy classmates exchanged confused glances, clearly bewildered by everything that had just transpired. How was such a thing even possible? Could they simply ask the Commander questions and receive answers?\nOne of the students spoke up with obvious scepticism. \"If he told you this information, why didn’t you ask him something more valuable?\"\n\"Because he won’t answer more detailed questions. You can try if you want,\" I shrugged my shoulders casually.\nIndeed, the curious student quickly approached the Commander and attempted to ask for more specific hints. Within seconds, he was told to scram and stop wasting time by the commander that was already in a bad mood because he was played by Adrian.\nThe student returned looking dejected and embarrassed, finally understanding that whatever I had done was not something that could be easily replicated.\n\"How did you manage that?\" Elen asked quietly as we began moving toward the western section.",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Hints [2]\nI led my team toward the western section, acutely aware of the growing scepticism among my classmates. Their doubt was clear, whispered conversations and sideways glances that they thought I couldn’t notice.\nThe uncertainty was eating at them: had I lied about obtaining information from the Commander, or had I told the truth?\nIf I had lied, they would undoubtedly hate me when the examination ended. I could already imagine the boycott that would follow, the complete loss of trust and respect that would make future cooperation impossible. But if I had told the truth... then they had underestimated me completely, and everything they thought they knew about how the academy operated would need to be reconsidered.\nI could understand their confusion. From their perspective, the idea that a student could simply get hidden information from academy officials seemed absurd. The whole concept challenged their understanding of how these examinations were supposed to work.\nThe first few hours of our trek through the forest proceeded relatively smoothly. We encountered several Noble-rank beasts along the way, nothing too challenging for our group’s combined strength. A pack of wolves tried to ambush us near a rocky outcropping, but our Scouts had detected them early enough to give us proper warning.\nWe also faced one weak Elite-rank beast, a bear that had been feeding near a magical spring. The creature’s hide sparkled with embedded gems that made it resistant to physical attacks, but our coordinated assault brought it down efficiently. Emmet had taken point on that fight, his enthusiasm for direct combat proving useful as he drew the beast’s attention while our other Hunters flanked it.\nEach encounter served as valuable practice for our team coordination. I made mental notes about how everyone performed under pressure, filing away information about their strengths and limitations that might prove crucial later.\nAs we pushed deeper into the western territories, the landscape began to change. The dense forest gradually gave way to more varied terrain, with rocky hills and clearer streams cutting through the wilderness. The change in environment was encouraging, it was a sign I was looking for because no shrines would have been in our old location.\nEventually, we came upon a significant river cutting through the landscape. The water ran clear and swift, creating small rapids where it flowed over rocks. The banks were lined with rich vegetation that suggested this was a natural gathering point for wildlife.\nI smiled as I surveyed the area. This river was a prime location for establishing our base camp. If any white donkeys existed in this region, they would definitely need to come here to drink. The value was obvious - we could monitor a large area from this single position while having access to fresh water for our own needs even if we had water mages.\nThe water that people like Elena conjured using man wasn’t exactly drinkable. At most it could be used for washing the body, but drinking it was a big no.\n\"We’ll set up camp here,\" I announced, gesturing to a slightly elevated area about fifty meters back from the riverbank. \"This gives us a clear view of the water while providing some concealment from anything approaching.\"\nMy team looked around the area with growing appreciation for the advantages of the location. Even the sceptics seemed to acknowledge that this was an excellent choice for our base of operations.Follow current novels on NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nMarcus Ironhold immediately took charge of the Survivalists team, his natural leadership abilities emerging as he began coordinating the construction of our temporary shelters. \"We’ll need protection from the elements and concealment from both beasts and rival teams.\"\nI watched with interest as Marcus activated his earth bloodline abilities. His hands began to glow with a deep brown energy that seemed to resonate with the ground itself. The Ironhold family bloodline was genuinely impressive to witness in action, he could manipulate earth and stone with ease.\nMarcus pressed his palms against the ground and began shaping the terrain to his will. Stone and compacted earth rose from the forest floor in response to his power, forming sturdy walls that would provide both shelter and defensive positions. The structures weren’t elaborate, essentially just walls with basic roofing, but they would keep us dry and hidden while we monitored the river.\n\"These should hold against anything short of a direct assault from multiple Elite-rank beasts,\" Marcus said with satisfaction as he completed the third small shelter. \"The walls are reinforced with my bloodline energy, so they’ll maintain their integrity even if I need to rest.\"\nElen and the other Survivalists began organizing our supplies within the shelters, setting up areas for food preparation, medical treatment, and equipment maintenance. Her alchemical knowledge proved valuable as she identified several useful plants growing near the riverbank that could be used for basic remedies.\n\"There are healing herbs here that I can process into emergency potions,\" she reported, already beginning to gather samples. \"Nothing as potent as what we could make in a proper laboratory, but sufficient for treating minor injuries or neutralizing weak toxins.\"\nOur Scouts spread out to establish a perimeter watch system, identifying the best observation points and setting up basic warning signals. They reported several game trails leading to and from the river, confirming my assessment that this area saw regular wildlife traffic.\nThe Hunters, led by Emmet, began exploring the immediate surroundings to familiarize themselves with the terrain and identify potential ambush points. Their job would be to eliminate any white donkeys that appeared while also protecting our camp from both beast attacks and rival team interference.\nAs the afternoon progressed and our camp took shape, I noticed the scepticism among my teammates beginning to fade.\nThe real test would come when we discovered whether this region actually contained the high-value targets we were seeking. But for now, we had established ourselves in what appeared to be an ideal location, with proper shelter, fresh water, and excellent surveillance capabilities.\nThe examination was far from over, but we had positioned ourselves for success.",

      "content": "Chapter 96: Scouting [1]\nAfter ensuring everything had been properly set up and our camp was organized for basic survival necessities, with sleeping areas appropriately divided between male and female sections, I gathered the entire team. It was time to get to work and begin the real mission to securing the win for this competition.\nLooking at our assembled group, I noted that our scouting team was by far the largest, consisting of sixteen people. The scouting team had to be the biggest solely because the area we needed to cover was vast, and these teams would need to split into different directions to ensure the largest possible area was monitored effectively.\nOnce the scouting team had gathered around me, I addressed all the team captains directly. Clear communication and proper organization would be crucial for our success over the next two days.\n\"I’m splitting the scouting teams into four separate units,\" I announced, looking each captain in the eye. \"Each unit will consist of three students and one captain. This structure is designed to ensure we remain organized and prevent any disputes or conflicts during your scouting missions, which could prove both dangerous and potentially lethal.\"\nThe captains nodded their understanding, already mentally organizing their respective team members.\n\"Your primary objective is to scout for ruins and shrine locations,\" I continued, my voice carrying the authority that had been granted to me as the leader. \"Whenever you discover a ruin or shrine, you must immediately contact me through your communication crystals. Do not attempt to enter or investigate these locations on your own, we need to coordinate our approach to maximize our Crest Mark collection efficiency.\"\nThe teams acknowledged their orders with serious expressions. Everyone understood that communication would be vital to avoid duplication of effort or missing valuable opportunities.\n\"Additionally,\" I added, my tone becoming more serious, \"if you encounter teams from other classes during your reconnaissance, you are not to engage them. This early in the examination, direct confrontation with rival teams is nothing more than a waste of valuable time and energy. We won’t gain any Crest Marks from fighting them, and the risk of injury or revealing our strategies isn’t worth any potential tactical advantage.\"\nI could see some of the more aggressive team members wanting to object, but they held their tongues in deference to the chain of command we had established.\n\"Your job is information gathering, not combat. Stay hidden, observe, and report back. If you’re discovered, disengage and relocate immediately. We want to maintain the element of surprise for as long as possible.\"\nAfter the scouting teams departed in their designated directions, spreading out like a web across the western territories, I turned my attention to Emmet, who had been waiting patiently for his specific orders.\n\"Emmet, you’re the captain of the Hunter team,\" I said, meeting his eager gaze. \"Today you’ll have the opportunity to leave camp and search for white donkeys along the river lines. This location is strategically ideal for such creatures - they’ll need water regularly, and this is the best natural drinking spot in the immediate area. Make sure you’re not detected by anyone while conducting your hunt.\"\nEmmet’s response was blunt and confident. \"Hmph, so what if we are caught? I’ll just beat them up.\"\nI shook my head firmly, recognizing the need to correct this dangerous mindset before it could lead to problems. \"That’s exactly the wrong approach, Emmet. If other teams catch sight of you hunting in this area, they’ll have a general idea of where our base camp is located. Eventually, they’ll be able to track us back to this position, and that won’t be good for our overall strategy.\"\nI could see him processing this information, his mind beginning to understand the broader implications beyond simple direct confrontation.\n\"Think about it strategically,\" I continued. \"If they know we’re operating in this region, they can set up ambushes, monitor our movements, or even attempt to raid our camp while our teams are scattered across the territory. The advantage we gained by coming to this western area will be completely negated if we reveal our presence too early.\"\nEmmet’s expression grew more thoughtful as he considered the ramifications. \"So you want us to be completely stealthy during the hunt?\"\n\"Exactly. Move quietly, stay concealed, and if you encounter any other teams, avoid them entirely. Your primary mission is to locate and eliminate white donkeys, extract their Crest Marks, and return to camp without compromising our position. Speed and stealth are more valuable than direct confrontation at this stage.\"\nI gestured toward the river area where his team would be operating. \"The terrain gives you plenty of natural cover - use the vegetation along the banks, the rocky outcroppings, and the sound of flowing water to mask your approach. White donkeys are likely to be cautious creatures, so you’ll need to be patient and methodical in your hunting approach.\"\n\"How many do you think we might find?\" Emmet asked, his earlier bravado replaced by practical curiosity.\n\"Unknown,\" I admitted honestly. \"But given that the Commander directed us toward this area, I’m confident there are valuable targets here. The key is to be thorough without being reckless. Take your time, do the job properly, and prioritize the safety of your team members over speed of execution.\"\nEmmet nodded with newfound understanding of his responsibilities. \"Understood. We’ll bring back every Crest Mark we can find without compromising the camp’s security.\"\n\"Good. Take your team and begin your sweep of the river area. Stay in communication range and report back regularly with status updates.\"\nAs Emmet gathered his Hunter team and prepared to depart, I was confident that our approach was already giving us significant advantages over the other classes who had likely rushed forward without proper planning or coordination.\nAfter Emmet and his team departed, I turned towards Marcus Ironhold, the captain of the survivalists team. Elen also stood beside him as she was part of his team.\n\"Marcus, you will stay in the base for now. Just in case our position is jeopardised, you are one of the strongest fighters in the class and having you here would be crucial.\"\nMarcus nodded his head.",

It’s dangerous to go alone, especially when we don’t know what other teams might be operating in the area.\"\nI shook my head firmly, rejecting both suggestions with confident authority. \"We shouldn’t change our team compositions now that everyone has been assigned their specific roles and responsibilities. The current structure is optimized for our objectives, and disrupting it would reduce our overall efficiency.\"\nI gestured toward the forest around us, reinforcing my argument. \"Besides, my bloodline abilities are particularly well-suited for solo work. My stealth capabilities mean I won’t be caught or detected by rival teams, and I can move much faster alone than with a group.\"\nThe students looked uncertain about my decision, but they couldn’t argue with the logic of my bloodline advantage or challenge my authority as the established leader. After all they didn’t know what my bloodline’s power was, all they knew was that I was powerful.\n\"In the end, this is the most tactically sound approach,\" I concluded definitively. \"I need you all to continue executing your assigned missions while I handle this particular investigation.\"\nThey had no choice but to accept my words, though their reluctance was still evident.\nBefore departing, I made sure to establish clear communication protocols. \"Notify me of everything that happens while I’m away, and provide status updates every thirty minutes through the communication crystals. If any emergency situations arise, contact me immediately regardless of the timing.\"\nThe team acknowledged these instructions, and I could see them mentally preparing to maintain operations in my temporary absence.\nA smile formed on my face as I left the camp behind, blurring through the trees with incredible speed that my\n{Physical Enhancement}\ntrait provided. The forest canopy provided excellent cover as I moved with supernatural grace and silence toward my true destination.\nNothing had actually caught my eye during our reconnaissance, and I wasn’t planning to scout for ruins or white donkeys. Rather, I was going to steal something far more valuable than any Crest Marks we might collect during this examination.\nMore specifically, I was going to steal a secret art that Kyle would have eventually obtained during his time at the academy. While it wasn’t during this particular examination that he would originally acquire the technique, that didn’t matter to me. I was going to claim it for myself instead, altering the timeline in a way that would benefit me significantly.\nThe secret art was fortunately located within the boundary areas that the Commander had established for our examination, so I wouldn’t need to break any official rules or risk disqualification to obtain it. The location was technically fair game for any student brave enough to venture that far from the main activity zones.\nThe secret art I intended to steal was genuinely exceptional, a footwork technique at the Royal rank that would revolutionize my combat capabilities. While it wasn’t at the Overlord level like the technique Carmilla had given me, Royal-rank secret arts were among the highest-tier techniques available in the entire kingdom.\nEven my father, despite his position as a Duke and his extensive resources, didn’t possess a Royal-rank secret art. The rarity and value of such techniques meant they were usually held by only the royal family that had accumulated them over centuries of power.\nGetting this particular footwork art would be incredibly useful for my development. Footwork was fundamental to all combat situations, it affected positioning, evasion, and overall battlefield mobility. A Royal-rank footwork technique would allow me to move in ways that most opponents couldn’t predict or counter, giving me decisive advantages in both offensive and defensive scenarios.\nThe technique was supposedly hidden in an ancient shrine that Kyle would have discovered much later in his academy career. According to my knowledge of the novel, he would stumble upon it during a completely different examination scenario, but the shrine itself had been there all along, waiting for someone skilled enough to unlock its secrets.\nI navigated through the forest with increasing confidence, using my enhanced senses to avoid any potential encounters with other teams or dangerous beasts. The terrain gradually became more challenging as I moved away from the river area, with rocky hills and stone formations beginning to appear among the trees.\nThe shrine I was seeking should be located in a secluded valley. It was well hidden and protected by both natural barriers and monsters that would deter casual exploration. Most students would avoid such areas, assuming they were either too dangerous or outside the examination boundaries.\nBut I knew exactly what I was looking for and how to approach it safely. This Royal-rank footwork secret art would be worth far more than any number of Crest Marks, and obtaining it would give me capabilities that would help me immensely.\nThe smile on my face widened as I anticipated the power that would soon be mine.\nAs I sped through the forest with supernatural grace, a pack of wolves suddenly emerged from the undergrowth ahead of me. Their eyes glowed with hunger as they blocked my path, snarling and positioning themselves for an ambush attack.\nThey were weak creatures, merely Noble-rank beasts. Nothing of real significance to me. Still, there was about ten of them\nShing!\nI drew my sword without breaking stride, the steel singing as it left its sheath. There was no time to waste on prolonged combat, I had a Royal-rank secret art waiting for me.\nThɪs updatᴇd by",

      "content": "Chapter 98: Royal Rank Secret Art [1]\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nThe wolves charged forward in unison, their paws pounding against the forest floor as they closed the distance.\nSlash!\nMy blade cut through the first wolf’s neck in a single clean motion, separating its head from its body before it could even register the attack.\nHOWWWWWL!\nThe remaining wolves let out piercing howls of rage and alarm as their packmate fell, but I was already moving past the corpse.\nClang! Scrape!\nThe second wolf’s claws scraped against my sword as I deflected its lunging attack, using its own momentum to spin it around. In the process, its claws broke completely, it was unable to handle the repercussions of the collision.\nSlice! Thud!\nMy blade found its spine in the same fluid motion, dropping it instantly to the ground.\nGrowl! Snap!\nTwo more wolves tried to flank me from either side, their jaws snapping at empty air as I flowed between them like water in a river stream.\nSlash! Slash!\nBoth heads hit the forest floor simultaneously, their bodies collapsing in twin sprays of blood.\nHOWWWWWL! HOWWWWWL!\nThe remaining wolves, realizing they were outmatched, began to retreat with terrified howls echoing through the trees.\nWhoosh!\nI continued forward without pause, leaving the carnage behind me as if it had never happened. My boots splashed through puddles of blood as I maintained my supernatural speed through the forest.\nThe entire encounter had lasted less than five seconds. These Noble-rank beasts were nothing more than minor obstacles on my path.\nRustle! Snap!\nBranches broke as I blurred past them, my focus entirely on the hidden shrine that awaited me in the distant valley.\nAfter about ten minutes of traveling at enhanced speed through the increasingly dense forest, I encountered another obstacle in my path. This time it was an Elite-rank beast - also a wolf, but this one was notably different from the pack I had just eliminated.\nA lone wolf... interesting.\nMost wolves were pack hunters by nature, so finding a solitary Elite-rank specimen suggested this creature had either been exiled from its pack for being too aggressive, or it had grown powerful enough that it no longer needed the support of lesser packmates. Either way, it represented a more significant threat than the Noble-rank wolves I had just dispatched.\nThe beast stood nearly as tall as my chest, its dark fur rippling with barely contained power. Its eyes held an intelligence that the previous wolves had lacked, and I could sense the concentrated aura of Elite-rank strength radiating from its muscular frame.\nGrowl...\nIt didn’t immediately attack like the others had. Instead, it studied me with the calculating patience of an apex predator, trying to determine whether I was prey or threat.\nI didn’t give it time to complete that assessment.\nWhoosh!\nI charged toward it with explosive speed, my speed allowing me to close the distance before it could react properly.\nTHUNK!\nWith one precise strike aimed directly at its skull, my sword penetrated through bone and brain matter. The Elite-rank wolf collapsed instantly, its powerful body hitting the forest floor with a heavy thud.\nBefore continuing on my journey, I took a moment to collect some of its blood in a small vial I carried. Since I no longer had easy access to beast blood from the outer forest areas around the city, I had decided to gather samples whenever convenient opportunities presented themselves.\nDrip... drip...\nThe crimson liquid filled the container as I worked quickly and efficiently.\nContinuing down my intended path, I navigated through increasingly tree-dense terrain. The trees grew larger and more gnarled, their branches forming a thick canopy that filtered the sunlight into an almost mystical green glow.\nEventually, I found what I had been searching for, an ancient ruin that seemed to match perfectly with my memories from the novel.\nThe structure was partially covered by centuries of plant growth, with vines and moss creating natural camouflage across weathered stone surfaces. Carved gargoyles perched at the corners of the entrance, their stone faces held the expressions of vigilance. Various other mystical beast statues surrounded the entrance, dragons, phoenixes, and creatures I couldn’t immediately identify, all rendered in exquisite detail despite their obvious age.\nRustle...\nThis seemed to be exactly what I was looking for, but one question remained in my mind: was this ancient ruin actually part of the official examination, did it have the crests as a reward or not?\nAlthough I wasn’t entirely certain, I was about to find out.\nI stepped through the entrance of the ancient shrine, my footsteps echoing softly in the enclosed space as I crossed the threshold into the mysterious interior.\nThe hallway stretched before me, surprisingly spacious despite the ruin’s exterior appearance. The architecture was clearly ancient, with carvings along the walls that seemed to shift slightly in the dim light filtering through cracks in the stone ceiling.\nTap... tap... tap...\nMy boots against the stone floor were the only sounds breaking the profound silence that filled this sacred space.\nThe corridor was mostly empty except for multiple statues positioned at regular intervals along both walls, and a prominent altar situated directly in the center of the far end. Each statue depicted different warriors in various combat poses, their stone faces frozen in expressions of determination and skill.\nI glanced at each statue carefully as I moved deeper into the shrine, studying their craftsmanship and positioning. To a casual observer, they would appear to be nothing more than decorative elements, ancient artwork meant to honor forgotten heroes or commemorate historical battles.\nBut I wasn’t fooled by their seemingly lifeless appearance and apparent lack of any vital energy.\nMy knowledge from the novel told me exactly what these statues truly represented, and what would happen once I initiated the trial sequence.\nDrip...\nI knew that the moment I allowed a single drop of my blood to fall onto the central altar, I would be facing these statues in combat.\nThey weren’t mere decorations, they were guardians, magical constructs designed to test anyone seeking to claim the Royal-rank secret art hidden within this shrine.",

      "content": "Chapter 99: Royal Rank Secret Art [2]\nThis was the trial’s fundamental requirement, elegant in its simplicity but completely unexpected for anyone who stumbled upon this place without prior knowledge. After all, who would naturally think to offer their own blood to an altar in a mysterious ruin?\nThe test was designed to weed out casual explorers while presenting a genuine challenge to those who truly sought the power contained within. Only someone who understood the shrine’s true nature would know to make the blood offering, and only someone with sufficient combat skill could defeat the guardians that would follow.\nSteady breathing...\nI approached the altar with calm steps, preparing myself mentally for the battle that was about to begin.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nI drew my sword and made a shallow cut across my fingertip, watching as a single crimson drop welled up and fell toward the ancient altar below.\nPlip\nThe moment my blood made contact with the stone surface, the entire shrine transformed dramatically.\nHummmmm...\nInvisible runes that had been hidden across the floor and walls suddenly blazed to life with brilliant red light. The magical inscriptions spread like fire along predetermined pathways, creating patterns that connected every statue to the central altar in a complex network of power.\nCrackle... crackle...\nThe energy flowed outward from where my blood had landed, racing along the glowing channels until it reached each of the warrior statues positioned throughout the hallway.\nTHRUM! THRUM! THRUM!\nOne by one, their auras erupted with overwhelming force. The stone guardians’ eyes began glowing with the same red light as the runes, and I could feel their dormant power awakening with terrifying intensity.\nCrack... crack... crack...\nStone dust fell from their surfaces as the statues began to move, joints that hadn’t shifted for centuries groaning back to life with magic.\nThey were all at the peak of Elite rank, every single one of the statues. This was absolutely no joke of a fight. The sheer number of opponents combined with their individual strength meant I was facing a genuinely life-threatening situation.\nStomp! Stomp! Stomp!\nThe first statue stepped down from its pedestal, stone feet striking the floor with impacts that shook the entire shrine.\nThe others followed suit, creating a symphony of grinding stone and magical energy.\nThis was going to be incredibly difficult, far beyond what I had initially anticipated.\nAccording to my knowledge from the novel, Kyle had faced these same guardians when he was already at Transcendent rank during his second semester at the academy.\nBut now, just a few days into our first year, even Kyle would struggle deeply against this challenge, he might even fail entirely.\nClang! Clang!\nThe statues drew their stone weapons, swords, spears, axes, and maces that gleamed with the same red enchantment flowing through their bodies.\nI found myself surrounded by eight Elite-rank opponents in the confined space of the shrine, each one programmed combat experience and powered by magic that showed no signs of weakness or fatigue.\nDeep breath.\nWithout hesitation, I immediately activated my blood enhancement abilities, feeling the familiar surge of power as my bloodline responded to my will.\nThump-thump! Thump-thump!\nMy heart began beating at an accelerated rate, pumping enhanced blood throughout my system and flooding my muscles with supernatural strength and speed. Every fibre of my being became more responsive, more powerful, as the enhancement took full effect.\nUnfortunately, my opponents were not living beings, which meant I couldn’t use the more versatile aspects of my Blood Control traits against them. I couldn’t manipulate their blood to control their movements, stun them with internal disruption, or cause them harm through blood manipulation. All I could do was strengthen myself and form weapons from the blood I had stored in my collection.\nFortunately, I had accumulated quite a substantial amount of high-quality blood over recent days. I had transcendent-rank blood, as well as peak Elite-rank blood that I had obtained from the assassins who had attacked me in the forest when I was testing out the crossbow.\nI made the strategic decision to save the transcendent-rank blood for truly desperate circumstances and instead utilize the peak Elite-rank blood from my attackers. This blood carried the power and essence of warriors who had been at the pinnacle of Elite rank, making it perfect for creating formidable weapons.\nClink! Clink! Clink!\nI retrieved several blood vials from my storage ring and threw them onto the stone floor of the shrine, watching as the precious crimson liquid scattered across the stones.\nWhoosh...\nImmediately, I activated my Blood Control trait and began manipulating the spilled blood, gathering it into concentrated masses that responded to my will like extensions of my own body.\nSolidify...\nI formed four blood spears that materialized above my head, each one gleaming with the deep red colour of concentrated life force. Spears were currently the easiest weapons for me to create and maintain while still delivering substantial damage against my opponents. The elongated shape required less precise control than more complex weapons, while the pointed tips could penetrate even stone with sufficient force behind them.\nFloat... float... float...\nThe four crimson spears hovered above my head like deadly satellites, rotating slowly as they awaited my command to strike.\nSTOMP! STOMP! STOMP!\nThe stone warriors continued their inexorable advance, their heavy footsteps creating tremors that ran through the shrine floor. Their glowing red eyes fixed upon me with determination, and I could see the magic driving them to fulfil their singular purpose.\nNot wanting to risk taking unnecessary damage from their coordinated assault, I activated my Stone Armor Echo ability. The familiar sensation of protection spread across my body as the Armor materialized, covering me in layers of supernatural defence.\nCrackle... harden...\nThe Armor would ensure that unless multiple enemies attacked me simultaneously with overwhelming force, I wouldn’t sustain serious injuries. It was my insurance policy against the superior numbers I was facing.\nI didn’t wait for them to reach me and initiate their attack pattern. Taking the initiative was crucial when facing multiple opponents, allowing them to coordinate their assault would put me at a severe disadvantage.",

The weapon carried the concentrated power of Elite-rank blood, giving it devastating penetration capabilities.\nCRACK!\nIt struck the stone warrior with tremendous force, creating spider web fractures across its torso but not quite penetrating completely through the magical stone construction.\nLaunch! Launch!\nTwo more spears followed in rapid succession, targeting the same opponent to maximize damage concentration rather than spreading my attacks across multiple enemies.\nCRASH! CRUMBLE!\nThe combined impacts finally shattered the first statue’s torso, causing it to collapse in a pile of rubble and dissipating magical energy.\nClang! Clang! Clang!\nThe remaining seven statues responded by increasing their advance speed, their stone weapons raised and ready to strike. They had learned from their companion’s destruction and were now approaching with more caution and coordination.\nWhoosh!\nI launched my final floating spear at a statue wielding a massive stone axe, aiming for its weapon arm to disable its primary threat.\nChip! Crack!\nThe spear struck true but only managed to damage the arm rather than severing it completely. These guardians were remarkably durable, clearly designed to withstand significant punishment.\nShing!\nDrawing my physical sword while simultaneously beginning to form new blood weapons from the remaining scattered crimson liquid, I prepared for close-quarters combat.\nReform... solidify...\nMore blood spears began taking shape, but the process required time and concentration that grew more difficult as the stone warriors closed the final distance.\nCLASH!\nThe first statue reached me, its stone sword sweeping in a devastating horizontal arc that I managed to parry with my own blade.\nSparks!\nThree more statues doubled down on the attack, forcing my to block once again.\nUnder their combined attack, the impact sent vibrations up my arms, but my strength allowed me to maintain my grip and footing.\nStab! Thrust!\nTwo more statues attacked from different angles, their assault testing the limits of my body.\nMy Stone Armor absorbed the impacts that I couldn’t completely avoid, the magical protection proving its worth as stone weapons struck hardened surfaces rather than vulnerable flesh.\nThis was only the beginning of what promised to be an exhausting battle of attrition. I needed to find a way to eliminate these guardians while conserving enough energy to claim the Royal-rank secret art that awaited me.\nDeep breath...\nCLASH! CLANG! SCRAPE!\nI found myself in the thick of brutal combat, my reflexes keeping pace with the assault from seven remaining stone guardians. My blood spears continued to harass them from multiple angles while I engaged in close-quarters combat with my sword.\nWhoosh! Crack!\nOne of my reformed blood spears struck the damaged statue I had hit earlier, widening the fractures across its torso and weakening its overall structure. This was my primary target, finishing off wounded enemies was always more efficient than starting fresh fights.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG! THUD!\nFour of the statues suddenly coordinated a devastating combined attack, their weapons coming at me from different directions in a pattern designed to overwhelm any possible defence. Stone sword, axe, mace, and spear all converged on my position simultaneously.\nThere was no way to parry or dodge all four attacks conventionally.\nDeep breath...\n’Null Strike!’ I thought to myself, activating the first stance of the Overlord-rank secret art at the moment of impact.\nWOOOOM!\nThe invisible sphere of negation erupted around me, creating that familiar distortion. The devastating combined attack simply ceased to exist the moment it entered the technique’s radius.\nSilence...\nThe four attacking statues stumbled forward, their momentum carrying them past me as their attacks were completely nullified. The confusion in their glowing red eyes was almost comical, their basic magical programming couldn’t comprehend what had just occurred.\nWithout wasting the opportunity, I charged directly toward the damaged statue from my earlier blood spear assault. Its torso was already heavily fractured, making it the perfect target for destruction.\nSlash! CRACK!\nMy first strike targeted its legs just above the knee joints, my strength and rare-rank sword finding the structural weak points in the stone construction.\nCRUMBLE! CRASH!\nBoth legs shattered simultaneously, causing the massive stone warrior to topple forward like a felled tree. Its upper body hit the shrine floor with tremendous force, sending stone fragments scattering in all directions.\nThud!\nI leaped onto the fallen statue’s back, positioning myself over its head as it tried to continue fighting even while immobilized.\nSlash! Slash! Slash!\nMultiple rapid strikes targeted the head and neck area, each blow creating deeper fractures in the stone structure. My speed allowed me to deliver devastating attacks faster than the guardian could react.\nCRACK! CRUMBLE!\nFinally, the head separated completely from the torso, rolling away as the red light in its eyes began to fade.\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nBut I wasn’t finished yet. I continued attacking the remaining torso, breaking apart the stone construction while searching for something specific.\nChip! Crack! Break!\nAfter several more strikes, I finally found what I was looking for, a brilliant crystal embedded deep within the statue’s chest cavity. The gemstone pulsed with the same red energy that had been animating the guardian, clearly serving as its magical power source.\nThe crystal was beautiful and obviously valuable, radiating concentrated magical energy that would be incredibly useful for my blacksmithing projects. Rather than destroying such precious material, I carefully extracted it from the crumbling stone.\nClink!\nI stored the power crystal in my storage ring, adding it to my growing collection of crafting materials. This single component was worth more than 100,000 points.\nCrumble... crumble... collapse...\nWith its power source removed, the statue finally crumbled completely into nothing more than a pile of ordinary stone debris. The magical animation was gone, leaving only rubble behind.\nSTOMP! STOMP! STOMP!\nThe remaining six statues had recovered from their confusion and were advancing again, having witnessed the destruction of their companion.\nWhoosh...\nI reformed more blood spears from the scattered crimson liquid, preparing for the next phase of this challenging battle.\nOne down, six to go.",

The stone guardians had closed in around me during my assault on their fallen companion, and staying surrounded in the middle of their formation was becoming increasingly dangerous.\nWhoosh! Thud!\nI landed several meters away, immediately assessing the positions and conditions of my remaining enemies. My vision quickly identified the most promising target.\nClang! Dent!\nThe statue closest to me was the trickiest opponent I had faced so far, it carried a large stone shield that it had been using effectively to block several of my blood spear attacks. The shield showed significant damage from our previous exchanges, with deep cracks running along its surface.\nThe shield was clearly on the verge of complete failure, making this the perfect opportunity to eliminate this particularly defensive opponent.\nI charged directly toward the shield-bearing statue, my enhanced speed allowing me to close the distance before it could properly coordinate with its companions.\nMy sword struck the damaged shield with tremendous force, finally shattering the stone barrier completely. Fragments of enchanted stone scattered across the shrine floor as the guardian’s primary defence crumbled.\nSlash! Slash!\nWith the shield destroyed, I immediately began targeting the statue’s head with repeated strikes, each blow creating deeper fractures in the stone construction.\nCRACK! Chip!\nThe head was beginning to show serious structural damage when the other five statues forced me to reconsider my position.\nThey had closed in rapidly, surrounding my position and launching a counter-attack to protect their damaged companion.\nMultiple stone weapons struck my Stone Armor in rapid succession, testing the limits of my defensive capability. The Stone Armor absorbed the impacts effectively, but I could feel the echo’s energy slowly being drained with each blow.\nI was forced to retreat several steps to avoid being completely overwhelmed by their assault. The partially damaged shield-bearer managed to stumble away from me, its head cracked but still functional.\nWhile my echo was still providing protection, I couldn’t afford to let it break. Once the armour shattered, I could lose access to my Echo ability entirely, and that wasn’t something I could afford to sacrifice in this situation.\nThe remaining six guardians had learned from their fallen companion’s fate and were now fighting with improved coordination.\nMore blood spears began taking shape above my head as I prepared for the next phase of this increasingly challenging battle.\nFor the first time since the battle had begun, I decided to activate my\n{Blood Enhancement}\nability on the rare-rank sword that my father had given me. The blade had served me during this fight, increasing the damage I had been dealing.\nI channelled my bloodline power directly into the weapon.\nOnce again, I pushed forward aggressively, moving so quickly that I appeared as little more than a shadow weaving between the stone guardians. My improved speed and the weapon’s enhanced cutting power gave me decisive advantages.\nI faked a direct assault on one of the attackers positioned to my left, causing several statues to shift their defensive positions to intercept what they perceived as my primary target. At the last moment, I diverted and attacked the same damaged statue that still carried the remnants of its broken shield.\nCRASH! SHATTER!\nMy blood-enhanced sword struck the shield’s weakened structure with devastating force, finally obliterating the defensive barrier completely. Stone fragments exploded outward as the guardian’s last protection crumbled to dust.\nThe other five statues immediately recognized the danger and took advantage of my momentary focus on destroying the shield. They closed in rapidly, positioning themselves for what appeared to be a coordinated, full-scale assault designed to overwhelm my defences.\nStone swords, axes, and maces all prepared to strike simultaneously from multiple angles. They perceived that this was their best opportunity to land decisive blows while I was engaged with their companion.\nWHOOSH! CLASH! THUD!\nThe coordinated attack launched with tremendous force, all five weapons converging on my position with lethal intent.\n\"Null Strike.\"\nThe familiar sphere of negation erupted around me just as their attacks entered my immediate range. The devastating coordinated assault that should have shattered even enhanced armor simply ceased to exist the moment it encountered my own strike.\nThe five attacking statues found themselves completely off-balance as their weapons met absolute nothingness instead of resistance. Their momentum carried them forward into vulnerable positions.\nOpportunity!\nI immediately took advantage of their confusion to focus all my attention on the now-defenceless shield-bearing statue. Without its protective barrier, it had no way to prevent my assault.\nSlash! Slash! Slash!\nMy blood-enhanced sword carved through the statue’s stone neck, each strike creating deeper fractures until the head finally separated completely.\nThe head hit the shrine floor with a heavy thud as I immediately began searching for the power source within the torso.\nAfter several precise strikes, I located and extracted the brilliant crystal core, its red energy pulsing with concentrated magical power.\nThe valuable component joined the first crystal in my storage ring, adding to my growing collection of rare crafting materials.\nWith its power source removed, the second statue crumbled into lifeless rubble.\nWithout pausing to catch my breath, I immediately charged back toward the five remaining guardians, who had recovered from their confusion and were repositioning for continued combat.\nWhat followed was an intense three-minute period of fighting. My blood-enhanced weapon carved through stone constructions, while my Null Strike technique continued to neutralize their most dangerous coordinated attacks.\nCRASH! SHATTER! CRUMBLE!\nOne by one, the ancient guardians fell to my relentless assault. Each statue followed the same pattern, targeted strikes to disable mobility, focused attacks on the head and torso, extraction of the power crystal, and final collapse into rubble.\nThree more precious crystals joined my collection as I dismantled the remaining defenders.\nThe last guardian collapsed with a thunderous crash that echoed throughout the shrine, its red eyes finally going dark as I extracted its power source.",

      "content": "Chapter 102: Acquiring the Royal-Rank Secret Art [1]\nI found myself slightly out of breath, but that was primarily because I had deliberately tried to finish the fight as quickly as possible rather than conserving energy. The aggressive approach had required more overall expenditure, but it had prevented the guardians from adapting further to my tactics.\nSilence...\nThe shrine fell completely silent for the first time since I had activated the trial. Five valuable crystal cores now rested in my storage ring.\nAfter I destroyed all the statues, I waited in the sudden silence, expecting the trial to conclude and the Royal-rank secret art to reveal itself. Minutes passed, but nothing happened.\nConfusion and growing worry began to gnaw at me. This was supposed to be the end of the trial according to my knowledge from the novel. I should have received the footwork technique by now.\nSilence...\nThe shrine remained eerily quiet, offering no indication of what I was supposed to do next.\nA terrible thought struck me - had someone already claimed the secret art before me?\nBut who could have possibly possessed the strength to defeat eight peak Elite-rank guardians and successfully complete this trial? And if they had, it must have been before we even entered the examination area, because the stone guardians had clearly been active and renewed. The academy wouldn’t have been able to restore the statues during an ongoing examination.\nPerhaps I had missed something crucial? Or maybe the novel’s author hadn’t fully explained the complete trial process, simply giving Kyle the technique without detailing all the required steps?\nI began examining everything around me with meticulous care - the walls, the floor, every carved detail and potential hidden mechanism.\nThe walls revealed nothing unusual, just stone covered in faded runes. The floor showed only the scattered remains of the destroyed guardians and the glowing pathways that had activated during combat.\nNone of it appeared to hide secret chambers or contain anything obviously out of place.\nHmm...\nMy eyes finally landed on the altar where I had originally dropped my blood to begin the trial. I walked toward it with renewed focus, studying its surface more carefully than I had initially.\nThat’s when I noticed them, small, precisely carved holes arranged in a specific pattern across the altar’s surface. They were barely visible unless viewed from the correct angle, blending seamlessly with the stonework.\nMy eyebrows furrowed as a sudden realization struck me. I retrieved the power crystals I had collected from the destroyed guardians, examining their size and shape against the mysterious holes.\nClink!\nThe first crystal I tested actually fit perfectly into one of the holes, sliding into place with a satisfying sound. The moment it settled, the crystal began shining with brilliant light.\n\"It seems like I’m not destined to have these crystals for myself,\" I muttered aloud with mild disappointment, realizing that the valuable crafting materials would need to be sacrificed to complete the trial.\nClink! Clink! Clink! Clink!\nOne by one, I placed the remaining crystals into their corresponding holes, each one adding to the growing illumination.\nRUMBLE! SHAKE!\nWhen the final crystal was positioned, the entire shrine began trembling violently. The altar itself started opening with the grinding sound of mechanisms activating after a longer period of dormancy.\nCRACK! SLIDE!\nThe stone surface split apart, revealing a hidden underground chamber that had been concealed beneath the altar all along.\nI descended carefully into the hidden underground chamber, my footsteps echoing off stone as I made my way down stairs that had been carved. The air grew cooler and more stagnant the deeper I went, carrying the musty scent of stonework.\nEventually, the stairs led me into a dimly lit corridor illuminated by torches mounted on both sides of the passageway. The flames danced with an unnatural steadiness, the flickering light created dancing shadows across the walls, giving the entire area an distinctly eerie atmosphere.\nMy boots against the stone floor created the only sounds as I moved forward through the corridor, alert for any additional traps or guardians that might be waiting.\nAt the end of the passageway, I found myself facing a split in the path. Two separate doorways led in different directions, but what caught my attention was a message carved into the central wall between them.\n[Congratulations. If you have made it this far, that means you have beaten the guardians of the shrine and successfully figured out the mechanism behind this doorway. This shows your strength, courage, and treachery...]\nA smile formed on my face as I processed these words. Whoever had written this message had probably made this place himself. They understood that reaching this point required more than just raw combat ability.\nIndeed, not many people would have the combination of skills needed to make it here. The strong, talented challengers who were able to even beat those statues, might destroy the power crystals inside the statues rather than preserving them, either out of ignorance or by accident during the heat of battle. Others might lack the thinking required to figure out the altar’s hidden mechanism, even if they did collect the crystals properly.\nI continued reading the inscription with growing curiosity.\n[You have a choice. Either pick the left path and continue to eventually face the final guardian, a Transcendent-rank monster, and claim the ultimate reward of this challenge, or pick the right path and receive your reward for completing the first part of the shrine, which is a transcendent-rank secret art.]\nPause...\nMy mind raced as I processed this unexpected development. The message had revealed that there was actually another prize which was a Transcendent-rank technique for completing the initial trial. The true ultimate reward, the royal-rank secret art, required facing an even more dangerous challenge.\nA Transcendent-rank monster was going to be difficult to fight off even with my current capabilities. Even with all my enhancements and techniques, that level of opponent could kill me if I made many mistakes.\nDespite the fact that I had killed a transcendent rank being, the ant, that was because I had injured it previously and I had regained my health and gained more power whilst it didn’t. Still, the potential reward for taking that risk was worth it.",

      "content": "Chapter 103: Acquiring the Royal-Rank Secret Art [2]\nAfter a moment of serious contemplation, weighing the risks against the potential rewards, I made my decision and took the left path. The difference between a Transcendent-rank secret art and a Royal-rank technique wasn’t even comparable - the power gap was enormous. If I could obtain such a valuable technique by taking a small risk, it would absolutely be worth the gamble.\nBesides, if I couldn’t manage to defeat a single Transcendent-rank being now, under controlled circumstances, how could I possibly hope to face the enemies that would eventually attack the city? In those future battles, Transcendent-rank beings would be nothing more than cannon fodder waiting to be slaughtered by truly powerful opponents. I needed to test my limits and push beyond them if I wanted to survive what was coming.\nI approached the left door and grasped the handle firmly. The moment the door swung open, I felt tremors running through the stone structure around me, followed by the distinctive sound of mechanisms activating. A heavy grinding noise came from behind me, and I turned to see that the right path had been permanently sealed. There was no going back now, I was committed to facing whatever challenge lay ahead.\nThe door led to another corridor, this one shorter than the previous passage but somehow more ominous in its construction. The walls here were carved with different patterns, depicting scenes of battles and what appeared to be ritual combat. The craftsmanship was more elaborate, suggesting I was approaching something of greater significance.\nAt the end of this new pathway stood a massive door, far larger and more imposing than any I had encountered in the shrine so far. The door itself was made from what appeared to be a single piece of dark stone, polished to an almost mirror-like finish. Most striking was the handle, which had been carved into the unmistakable face of a golden mane lion, its features rendered with incredible detail and artistic skill.\n’Could this represent the monster waiting inside?’ I wondered, studying the carved features more carefully.\nI knew these species well from my studies and my father’s warnings about dangerous creatures during my first two weeks inside the estate. Lions at the Transcendent rank were among the most lethal predators in existence. Their natural hunting instincts, combined with their powerful magical abilities and long years of evolution, made them incredibly dangerous opponents. They possessed supernatural speed, devastating physical strength, and an intelligence that allowed them to adapt their tactics mid-combat.\nTaking a deep breath, I began my final preparations for what would likely be the most challenging fight of my life.\nGlancing at the communication crystal in my hand, I remembered my guards and Kojiro. They should have been hunting for several hours by now, and I had left Kojiro with them specifically hoping he would achieve his breakthrough to Transcendent rank after defeating a suitable opponent. I realized I hadn’t received any updates from them since yesterday night.\nI raised the crystal and attempted to establish a connection with my guards outside the academy grounds, hoping to get a status report on their progress.\nThe connection failed immediately. My eyebrows furrowed in confusion before I remembered a crucial detail about academy examinations. During official testing periods, the academy implemented powerful magical barriers that prevented all forms of external communication. This policy served multiple purposes, ensuring fairness by preventing outside assistance, eliminating any possibility of cheating, and providing an additional safety measure by forcing students to rely on their own capabilities.\nI had completely overlooked this restriction in my eagerness to check on Kojiro’s progress. The isolation was absolute during examinations.\nPlacing the communication crystal back in my storage ring, I retrieved Kojiro’s summoning card instead. Perhaps I could call him to assist with this Transcendent-rank challenge, combining our strengths to improve our chances of success.\nI attempted to activate the card, channelling my will into the magical construct, but nothing happened. The familiar flash of light that normally brought Kojiro into existence simply didn’t occur.\nIt seemed that for Kojiro to be summoned again, he would first need to return to the card. Since he was currently in the physical world with my guards, the card couldn’t recall him from that distance or override his current location.\nI was truly on my own for this final challenge.\n***\nInside the royal castle of the kingdom of Eldrathia, within the opulent throne room where the strongest human in the kingdom resided, I sat upon the magnificent seat of power.\nA smile formed on my face as I sensed the magical disturbance from the academy grounds. It seemed like someone had finally been able to bypass the first layer of the challenge I had personally placed within the examination area years ago. The shrine had remained untouched for so long that I had begun to wonder if the current generation of students possessed any real talent.\nWhile I didn’t know who had managed to bypass the initial trial, only successfully passing the second layer would truly impress me. I had deliberately chosen not to place any surveillance magic inside that particular challenge. The reason was simple – people capable of completing that trial weren’t exactly easy to hide. Such exceptional power and skill couldn’t be concealed deeply, no matter how hard the talented individual might try to remain inconspicuous.\nKnock, Knock!\n\"Enter,\" I called out in an impassive voice.\nMy son entered the throne room and immediately knelt before the massive chair, maintaining his usual stoic expression.\n\"Your Highness, the monster attacks on our kingdom’s towns have escalated significantly. They have already taken complete control of one town,\" the prince reported with professional detachment.\nI nodded gravely, my expression shifting from amusement about the academy trial to serious concern about this developing threat. \"Any intelligence on the ranks of these creatures?\"\n\"There appears to be a Commander-level beast leading tens of Transcendent-rank monsters, and hundreds of elite-rank beasts according to survivor testimony from the fallen town. We confirmed the presence of multiple Transcendent-rank beasts by sending a scouting team, though they didn’t get close enough to verify the Commander-level creature directly.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 104: Acquiring the Royal-Rank Secret Art [3]\nA cold expression formed on my face. A Commander-rank beast leading organized attacks represented a serious threat to the kingdom’s stability and the safety of its citizens.\n\"Which duke’s territory does this town fall under?\" I asked, my voice taking on a harder edge.\n\"Duke Blackwood, Your Highness.\"\nI considered this information carefully. Duke Blackwood was a capable military leader with substantial resources, but a Commander-level beast required careful handling.\n\"Send him an official letter immediately. He needs to eliminate the Commander-level beast before more damage can be done to the surrounding regions. Tell him that we will support his efforts with some of our royal guards, this threat cannot be allowed to spread further.\"\n***\nAfter I opened the massive door, the room beyond was shrouded in almost complete darkness, challenging even my enhanced vampire vision. Through the oppressive shadows, I could make out the silhouette of a large beast resting in the center of the chamber. The shape confirmed my suspicions - it was indeed the lion I had anticipated from the door’s carved handle.\nI stepped across the threshold into the room, and the door immediately slammed shut behind me, as if the mechanism had been waiting for precisely that moment to trap me inside.\nThe moment the door sealed, torches began igniting spontaneously around the circular chamber’s perimeter. One by one, they burst into magical flame, gradually illuminating the entire space with flickering orange light that cast dancing shadows across the stone walls.\nNow I could see my opponent clearly, and the sight made my blood run cold.\nMy eyes landed on the magnificent yet terrifying beast before me. It was massive - easily twice the size of any normal lion, with a muscular frame that spoke of incredible physical power. Its most distinctive feature was the brilliant golden mane.\n’The Golden mane clan... just like I thought. The fact that someone was able to capture this lion and place him for this trial...this lion must be really angry and waiting for anyone to vent its anger upon.’\nA grim expression formed on my face. Golden mane lions were among the most dangerous Transcendent-rank predators in existence. They possessed not only devastating physical capabilities but also innate magical resistance.\nThe beast’s eyes opened slowly, revealing pupils that glowed like molten gold. It had been resting, conserving its energy, but my presence had clearly awakened it from its slumber. The creature rose to its feet with fluid grace, every movement displaying the danger of a perfect predator.\nThis was going to be the fight of my life. Unlike the stone guardians, this opponent was a living creature with unpredictable instincts, adaptive intelligence, and years of hunting experience. There would be no mechanical patterns to exploit, no predictable attack sequences to counter.\nThe Golden mane let out a low rumble that seemed to vibrate through the stone floor beneath my feet, its golden eyes fixed on me with focus. The real challenge was about to begin.\nFacing this Transcendent-rank Golden mane, I immediately began activating every enhancement at my disposal. This was absolutely no time for restraint or gradual escalation.\nFirst, I triggered my Blood Enhancement ability, feeling the familiar surge as my bloodline power flooded through my system. My heart rate accelerated, pumping enhanced blood to every muscle fiber and sharpening my reflexes to supernatural levels.\nBut that wasn’t enough against a creature of this caliber. I reached for the crimson blood pendant hanging around my neck - the one containing precious Transcendent-rank blood I had been saving for exactly this type of emergency. The moment I activated it, I felt an entirely different level of power coursing through my body. The Transcendent-rank blood provided enhancements far beyond what my own Elite-rank abilities could generate.\nMy muscles swelled with incredible strength, my vision sharpened to see every detail of the beast, and my reaction time decreased to almost precognitive levels. The combination of my natural enhancement with the Transcendent blood created a temporary state that allowed my strength to approach the transcendent rank .\nNext, I channelled my Blood Enhancement into my rare-rank sword, watching as the blade took on that familiar crimson aura. The weapon’s cutting power increased dramatically, giving it the ability to potentially penetrate even Transcendent-rank hide and magical defenses.\nFinally, I activated my Stone Armor Echo, feeling the protective magical coating spread across my entire body. The armor would provide crucial defense against the devastating attacks that were surely coming.\nI deliberately held back from using my Silent Predator aspect at this stage. The Transcendent-rank version had a six-hour cooldown, making it a eight-use ability for this entire examination period. I needed to save it for the perfect moment when it could provide maximum advantage - perhaps when the lion was preparing its most devastating attack, or when I needed to create an opening for a killing blow.\nROAR!!\nThe Golden mane’s thunderous roar exploded through the circular chamber with overwhelming force. The sound wasn’t just noise - it carried concentrated magical energy designed to paralyze prey through sheer intimidation and fear.\nI felt my body freeze involuntarily for a terrifying moment, every muscle locking up as the lion’s skill took effect.\nImmediately, I forced my blood to circulate even faster, pushing my enhancement abilities beyond their normal limits while simultaneously channelling mana to counteract the stunning effect. The combination of accelerated blood flow and magical energy helped break through the paralysis.\nThis was definitely a specialized skill, it was not just a normal roar, but a Transcendent-rank ability designed to create openings against powerful opponents.\nThe moment I regained control, the Golden mane was already in motion.\nThe massive predator launched itself across the chamber with explosive speed, covering the distance between us in a single bound. Its claws extended like golden daggers, each one capable of tearing through steel, while its jaws gaped open to reveal fangs that glowed with energy.\nI managed to raise my sword in time to intercept the first swipe of its massive paw. The impact sent shockwaves up my arms despite my Transcendent-level enhancement.",

      "content": "Chapter 105: Acquiring the Royal-Rank Secret Art [4]\nThe lion pressed on without mercy, following up with a devastating bite aimed at my head. I ducked and rolled to the side, feeling the creature’s jaws snap shut where I had been standing just moments before.\nMy Stone Armor absorbed a glancing blow from its rear claws as I repositioned, the magical protection preventing what would have been crippling wounds.\nThis beast was every bit as dangerous as I had imagined. Its combination of raw power, supernatural speed, and combat intelligence made it a nearly perfect killing machine.\nThe Golden mane circled around me with its killing intent oozing out, looking for openings in my defence.\nDrawing upon my Blood Control skills in ways I had never attempted before.\nFirst, I manipulated my own blood flow to create localized pressure points throughout my body. By concentrating enhanced blood in specific muscle groups just before impact. In theory, I could temporarily increase my striking power beyond even my current level. When the lion lunged again, I channelled concentrated blood into my sword arm and delivered a devastating counterattack that managed to pierce its golden hide.\nWhoosh! SLASH!\nThe beast roared in pain and anger, golden blood seeping from the wound I had created. But I wasn’t finished with my innovative approach.\nI extended my Blood Control to manipulate the lion’s own blood through the wound I had inflicted. The technique was incredibly difficult, controlling foreign blood required far more concentration and mana than manipulating my own, but I managed to disrupt the circulation around the injury, preventing it from healing as quickly as it normally would.\nThe Goldenmane’s eyes widened in surprise and fury as it realized what I was doing. No ordinary opponent had ever been able to affect its internal systems in such a manner.\nWhen the creature attempted another paralyzing roar,\nROAR!!\nI was ready. I had prepared a concentrated burst of enhanced blood to flood my eardrums at the precise moment of the attack, temporarily deafening myself but somewhat countering the stunning effect.\nA smirk formed on my face as I felt my the stun affect, but it was a diluted one. I was able to immediately break off the stun.\nThe lion’s confusion at my immunity gave me an opening to land another significant strike.\nI began using my Blood Control to create temporary blood weapons that served as extensions of my natural reach. Whilst the weapons didn’t do much damage to the golden mane, it was still able to pester him and stop him from dealing any damage or even getting close enough to do so.\nWhen my blood weapons ran out, the beast managed to get close and land a glancing blow despite my defences, I immediately used Blood Control to clot the wounds and redirect circulation away from damaged areas. This prevented blood loss from weakening me while allowing me to continue fighting at full capacity.\nThe damage it delt me did not come without a price, I had also countered his attack, landing a strong strike on his hide, once again drawing blood from it and using that blood to further enhance myself.\nThe Goldenmane was clearly frustrated by my hit-and-run tactics. Every time it adapted to one of my techniques, I would implement a new use of Blood Control that caught it off-guard.\nAs our battle intensified, I realized that victory would come eventually if everything went well. The lion’s strength and experience were formidable, but they weren’t enough, clearly this golden mane wasn’t an adult, but most likely a prepubescent.\nThe fight continued with the both of us dealing damage and circling around each other in order to predict the next attack.\nEventually, the Golden mane’s fury reached a boiling point as more of its precious golden blood seeped from multiple wounds, each drop being absorbed and converted into additional strength for me. The creature’s eyes blazed with rage as it witnessed me growing stronger while it grew weaker.\nI wasn’t surprised by its fury. To be left in this cage, powerless, is punishment enough—but to lose a fight when prey dares to come close must be unbearable. The beast was born to rule the hunt, yet it was being hunted. The lion’s eyes burned with something more than hunger; outrage, humiliation, and anger. This animal wasn’t just upset, it was wounded in its pride, and that wound was far more dangerous than any set of claws.\nThe lion’s massive frame trembled. Its golden mane seemed to ignite with internal fire as magical energy began building within its core. This was no longer a hunt, this had become a desperate battle for survival.\nThe Golden mane reared back on its hind legs, gathering power for what was clearly intended to be a devastating move that wanted nothing other than claiming my life. Energy coursed through its muscular frame, concentrating in its claws until they glowed like miniature suns. The very air around the creature began to shimmer with heat distortion.\nWith a thunderous roar that shook dust from the stone ceiling, the lion launched itself forward in a massive leap that covered the entire breadth of the circular chamber.\nWHOOSH!\nIts blazing claws extended toward me like golden spears, each one trailing fire and carrying enough force to shatter solid rock.\nThe attack came with such overwhelming speed and power that even my enhanced reflexes barely registered the movement. This wasn’t just a physical assault, the golden mane had channelled a lot of its remaining mana reserves into a single, all-or-nothing strike that could obliterate some of the weaker transcendent beings in one blow.\nTime seemed to slow as the burning claws descended toward my position. I could feel the intense heat washing over me, see the determination and fury in those golden eyes, sense the concentrated death approaching with unstoppable momentum.\nAt the precise moment of impact, I activated my ultimate defence.\n\"Null Strike.\"\nThe familiar sphere of absolute negation erupted around me, the Golden mane’s devastating solar-powered attack, all that concentrated fury, magical energy, and lethal intent clashed with it.",

STRAIN!\nThe technique managed to negate most of the attack, but the sheer difference in raw strength and magical power meant it couldn’t completely eliminate the assault. Cracks appeared in my negation field as some of the solar energy broke through.\nTHUD! CRACK!\nMy Stone Armor absorbed the remaining damage, making the lion’s attack almost useless.\nA smile formed on my face. \"My turn... now.\"\nI immediately channelled nearly thirty percent of my remaining mana into the most dangerous technique I could attempt, stopping the blood flow around the lion’s heart. This technique in particular was one of the most depleting and technically difficult moves in my\n{Blood Control}\nTrait, but at this critical moment, it could mean the difference between life and death.\nStrain... clot...\nI could see pain erupt in the Golden mane’s eyes as shock overtook its massive body. The artificial blood clot I had created formed a kind of magical stroke, disrupting the creature’s circulation at its most vital point.\nROAR! Gasp!\nThe lion’s anguished cry echoed through the chamber as its body seized up from the internal attack.\nAt such close proximity, I launched into immediate action with multiple sword strikes while the creature was stunned.\nWhoosh! SLASH!\nMy first strike carved deep across its shoulder.\nSlice! TEAR!\nThe second opened a gaping wound along its hide.\nSLASH! RIP!\nTwo more devastating cuts found their marks on its legs and torso.\nI managed to land four serious wounds before the stunning effect wore off. Through the torn golden hide, I could see the exposed flesh and bone beneath.\nThe paralysis lasted only about a second before the Golden mane’s incredible constitution allowed it to regain control.\nSNARL! LUNGE!\nThe wounded beast lunged at me with desperate fury, its claws seeking revenge for the crippling assault.\nCLANG! Parry!\nI countered its attack with a defensive strike, then immediately created distance between us.\nBoth of us circled each other again, but now the dynamic had shifted dramatically. The lion was bleeding heavily from multiple wounds while I remained relatively intact.\nDespite the wounds I had inflicted, I refused to let cockiness or arrogance cloud my judgment. The lion before me was still an extremely dangerous opponent with abilities that it perhaps hadn’t revealed yet. Now that it was wounded and desperate, it would likely start showing everything in its arsenal.\nAs if confirming my cautious assessment, the Goldenmane let out another roar - but this time it wasn’t the stunning attack from before. Its aura began rising dramatically, and crackling flames started manifesting around it.\nROAR! Crackle!\nThen it began to transform. The creature’s already imposing frame grew even larger, muscles swelling with supernatural power. Its golden fur literally burst into flames, creating a living inferno that radiated intense heat throughout the circular chamber.\nI swallowed hard as I watched its aura skyrocket to terrifying levels. This had to be some sort of bloodline trait that dramatically enhanced its physical capabilities for a limited time, essentially a berserker mode that would make it exponentially more dangerous.\nI couldn’t afford to let this transformation complete. If the lion finished powering up, I would be facing an opponent that could potentially overwhelm even my abilities and remaining defenses.\nSprint! Charge!\nI launched myself forward immediately, my enhanced sword gleaming with crimson energy as I closed the distance. Every second I delayed would make the creature stronger and more difficult to defeat.\nWhoosh! Flames lick!\nThe heat radiating from the transforming Goldenmane was already intense enough to make the air shimmer around it. Its burning mane created a corona of fire that would make close combat extremely hazardous.\nSLASH! Strike!\nI aimed for its neck, hoping to land a decisive blow before the transformation could reach completion and turn this fight into an impossible challenge.\nThe race was on - my blade versus its metamorphosis, with only seconds to determine the outcome of our deadly encounter.\nSLASH! SPLURT!\nMy sword connected perfectly with the lion’s neck, biting deep into the vital area. Golden blood splashed across the entire chamber, coating the stone walls and my face in brilliant crimson droplets.\nA bloody grin formed on my face as I waited for the Golden mane to collapse and die. I had clearly severed an important artery, this should have been the killing blow that ended our battle.\nBut to my complete dismay, the wound began closing immediately as fire consumed the injury and forced the torn skin back together. The flames acted like cauterizing agents, sealing the damage and preventing any further blood loss.\nROAR! Blaze! Complete!\nThe transformation reached completion in that same instant. The Golden mane now stood before me as a creature of living flame, its size increased by nearly fifty percent and its entire form wreathed in intense fire. The heat radiating from its body was so intense that I could feel intense heat from the close proximity.\nSnarl! Flame eyes!\nIts eyes now blazed like miniature suns, and every breath it took sent jets of fire from its nostrils. The creature’s claws had become molten weapons that could probably melt through even enhanced-rank sword if they made direct contact.\nMy confident grin vanished as I realized that things had taken an unexpected turn. This wasn’t just an enhanced version of the previous opponent, the lion now seemed to have fire-based regeneration and increased size and strength.\nI was forced to retreat several steps as the intense heat forced me to reassess my increasingly dire situation. The real fight was just beginning, and I was rapidly running out of viable options to deal with this blazing monstrosity.\nDespite having completed its dramatic transformation, the Goldenmane did not immediately launch into an attack. My eyes tracked its flaming form carefully, watching for any sudden movement that might signal an incoming assault.\nMy eyes suddenly widened as a crucial realization struck me.\nHe’s regenerating his previous wounds!\nThe thought made perfect sense. The flames weren’t just for show or intimidation.",

      "content": "Chapter 107: Secret Art Acquired [1]\nThe flames were actively healing all the damage I had inflicted during our earlier exchanges. That explained why the creature wasn’t pressing its advantage immediately. It was using this moment to repair itself completely before resuming combat.\nI could see the deep gashes I had carved into its legs and torso slowly sealing themselves shut under the regenerative fire. Within moments, I would be facing a fully healed opponent with dramatically enhanced capabilities.\nThere was no time to waste. This was dangerous territory, and with the lion’s current empowered state, I needed to deploy my most powerful asset.\n’Silent Predator.’\nI activated my Transcendent-rank aspect immediately, feeling the familiar sensation as my presence began to fade from detection. My breathing became silent, my scent disappeared, and my visual profile shifted to near-invisibility. Even to a Transcendent-rank opponent, I would be extremely difficult to track.\nThe aspect would last for five minutes, enough time to either find a decisive opening or exhaust the lion’s transformation. With my enhanced stealth capabilities active, I could potentially strike at the creature’s blind spots while avoiding its most devastating fire-based attacks.\nSeeing me suddenly vanish from sight, the Golden mane became visibly confused. Its blazing head swivelled back and forth, searching for any trace of my presence. The creature’s senses were clearly struggling to detect me despite its Transcendent-rank capabilities.\nUnfortunately, there was a crucial limitation of my aspect. The Silent Predator ability prevented me from attacking while maintaining invisibility - any aggressive action would immediately cancel the camouflage effect. This meant I couldn’t simply strike while hidden and end the fight quickly.\nStill, the aspect would be invaluable for surviving the next five minutes until the lion’s transformation completed. I needed to use this time to avoid its attacks while waiting for the creature to exhaust its enhanced state.\nROAR! Flames burst!\nThe frustrated Golden mane began launching attacks in every direction, hoping to hit my invisible form through sheer area coverage. Jets of fire erupted from its mouth in sweeping arcs across the chamber.\nI silently rolled behind a stone pillar as flames washed over where I had been standing moments before. The heat was so intense that even being near the fire’s path made me feel its burn despite my power and high defence.\nCRASH!\nThe lion’s massive claws raked across the stone floor where it thought I might be hiding, sending sparks flying as they gouged deep trenches in the stonework.\nI carefully climbed up the chamber wall, using handholds in the carved decorations to reach a higher vantage point. From above, I could observe the creature’s increasingly desperate attacks while staying out of range.\nThe Golden mane jumped toward my previous position, breathing fire in a massive cone that illuminated the entire chamber. I pressed myself flat against the ceiling, feeling the heat wash over me but remaining undetected.\nFor the next several minutes, this deadly game of hide-and-seek continued. The lion would attack phantom targets, breathing fire and slashing at shadows while I moved silently through the chamber like a ghost. Every near miss reminded me how devastating those attacks would be if they connected.\nHeavy breathing...\nAs the three-minute mark passed, I began to notice changes in the creature’s behaviour. Its movements were becoming less coordinated, and the flames surrounding its body were flickering rather than burning with steady intensity.\nThere it is...the weakness i’m looking for.\nThe transformation was clearly beginning to fade. The Golden mane’s massive frame started shrinking back toward its original size, and the regenerative fire that had been healing its wounds sputtered and died.\nThe lion was now exhausted and it was in a vulnerable state.\nWhen the enhancement finally ended completely, the lion looked significantly weaker than it had even before the transformation began. The powerful ability had drained its reserves substantially, leaving it breathing heavily and moving with obvious fatigue.\nThis was is moment.\nI deactivated Silent Predator and immediately launched myself from my elevated position, channelling every remaining enhancement into a decisive killing strike.\nDrop! Dive! SLASH!\nMy sword, still enhanced with blood manipulation and backed by Transcendent-level power, descended toward the exhausted creature’s neck with all I could muster.\nSLICE! Spray!\nThis time, when my blade found its mark, there was no regenerative fire to seal the wound. Golden blood sprayed across the chamber as I severed the major arteries and nearly decapitated the massive predator.\nI continued my attacks until I was satisfied.\nThe Golden mane crashed to the stone floor with a final, weak roar that quickly faded to silence. Its golden eyes dimmed as life left its powerful body.\nThud!\nI stood over the fallen Transcendent-rank beast, breathing heavily but victorious. The chamber fell silent except for my own laboured breathing and the crackling of dying flames.\nThe ultimate trial was complete, and whatever reward awaited me was finally within reach.\nIt was by no means an easy fight, and I would have been in serious trouble without my Transcendent-rank Silent Predator aspect and Stone Armor Echo. The golden manes were known to be a powerful clan with rare-ranked bloodlines, to face such a powerful Transcendent-rank being and emerge victorious was genuinely satisfying.\nWhen the lion died, however, nothing changed in the chamber. The creature’s death seemed to mean nothing in terms of triggering whatever mechanism should indicate completion of the final trial. There was no magical response, no hidden doors opening, no reward materializing.\nJust silence.\nWhile waiting for something to happen, I approached the massive corpse and began extracting its blood using my Blood Control trait. Transcendent-rank Golden mane blood was incredibly valuable, both for enhancing my own abilities and as a delicacy for my feeding. The blood flowed into my storage containers with a faint luminescent quality that spoke to its potency.\nAfter securing all the blood I could extract, I stored the lion’s entire body in my spatial storage. A complete Transcendent-rank Golden mane corpse would sell for an enormous amount of points at the academy.",

      "content": "Chapter 108: Secret Art Acquired [2]\nEvery part of such a creature had value, the hide for armor crafting, the bones for weapon construction, the organs for alchemical purposes, and the mane itself for enchantment materials.\nI was also planning to take some of its parts for my own blacksmithing, some of it’s bones would be really helpful in strengthening my crossbow or creating other items.\nThe silence stretched on as I waited for some indication that I had successfully completed the trial. Perhaps there was another hidden mechanism I needed to discover, or maybe the reward was concealed elsewhere in the chamber. I began examining the walls and floor more carefully, searching for any clues about what I was supposed to do next.\nAfter searching the chamber, it didn’t take long for me to spot a lever positioned next to where the lion had fallen during our battle. The mechanism was partially concealed, but once I knew what to look for, it was clearly visible.\nAfter confirming there was nothing else in the chamber that could serve a similar function, I pulled the lever down with a satisfying click. Immediately, a section of the wall slid open to reveal a hidden alcove, and a stone table rose from the floor. Resting on its surface was a single book.\nI approached the table and carefully picked up the tome. It was bound in black leather and surprisingly heavy for its size. The moment I opened it to the first page, I knew without doubt that this was the Royal-rank secret art I had been seeking.\nTaking out my communication crystal, I contacted my team members to check for any updates on their progress.\nThe news was mixed but useful. Emmet reported finding a group of white donkeys, successfully eliminating them, and extracting the Crest Marks that were hidden in their stomachs. The dissection process had been unpleasant but necessary. This information would be valuable for the whole team, we now knew to focus our search on the creatures’ digestive systems rather than examining the entire body.\nUnfortunately, no shrines had been discovered yet by the scouting teams, and the one I had just completed appeared to be completely separate from the examination’s official objectives. It seemed this ancient trial existed independently of the academy’s current testing system.\nI wasn’t surprised, the commander did say that not all shrines had the Crest Marks.\nStill, claiming a Royal-rank secret art made the detour more than worthwhile. Before returning to my team to help maximize our Crest Mark collection, I decided to examine the technique I had just acquired.\nOf course, I wasn’t naïve enough to believe I would be able to master it instantly. Unfortunately, my daily rewards system didn’t offer such convenient functions, real skill development still required time and practice.\nThe secret art was primarily composed of detailed illustrations showing a figure demonstrating various movements and positions. The visual representations were remarkably clear and dynamic, I could almost see the person within the drawings executing these techniques in real time. The artwork was accompanied by little explanatory text describing the purpose and mechanics of each stance.\nThe first stance was called \"Light Steps,\" and it provided a ten percent increase to the user’s agility. This was no small enhancement, such a significant improvement was remarkable considering this was only the introductory art and supposedly the easiest to learn. The magnitude of the boost was genuinely impressive, especially since this percentage would scale with my base capabilities as I grew stronger.\nFor someone at my current level, a ten percent agility increase would translate to noticeably faster movement, quicker reaction times, and improved battlefield positioning. As I advanced to higher ranks, that same percentage would represent even more substantial absolute improvements to my speed and manoeuvrability.\n***\nInside the royal throne room of Eldrathia.\nA faint smile crossed my lips as I sensed the trial mechanisms activating in ways they hadn’t for years.\nThe same person that had entered the second trial had been able to actually complete it.\nI leaned back in the throne, my fingers drumming against the armrest as I considered the changes that were occurring. The shrine I had personally established within the academy grounds decades ago had finally found a worthy challenger. Not only had they defeated the stone guardians, which was impressive enough, but they had also managed to survive an encounter with the Transcendent-rank Golden mane that I had caught and placed as the final test.\nThe Royal-rank footwork secret art was no longer gathering dust in that hidden chamber. After all these years, it had found a new owner...A rightful one.\nMy curiosity was genuinely piqued. Who among the current student body possessed both the combat prowess to defeat those guardians and the intelligence to solve the altar mechanism? The trial had been designed to filter out all but the most exceptional individuals - those who combined raw power with exceptional thinking and the courage to face overwhelming odds.\nThe timing was intriguing as well. With monster attacks escalating across the kingdom and the need for capable defenders growing more urgent, perhaps this was fate providing exactly what we required. A student capable of claiming Royal-rank techniques during their first week at the academy represented the talent that could shift the balance of future conflicts.\nI made a mental note to have my intelligence network investigate the students that were currently shining the most and those that could be potentially hiding their powers.\n\"The kingdom might have just gained a future champion.\"\nKnock-Knock.\n\"Come in.\"\nThe door opened to reveal a young, beautiful maid who entered with grace. Her posture was perfectly respectful, maintaining the proper etiquette expected in the royal presence.\n\"Your Highness, the banquet is ready. Her Highness is waiting for you,\" she said respectfully, keeping her eyes properly lowered toward the floor.\nI nodded, though my thoughts were still partially occupied with the completed trial.\n\"Alright, I will be there shortly,\" I replied, rising from the throne.",

      "content": "Chapter 109: Light Steps\nI remained inside the shrine for nearly an hour, dedicating myself to practicing the first stance of the Royal-rank footwork technique.\nThe \"Light Steps\" movement pattern was deceptively complex, requiring precise coordination between breathing, muscle tension, and energy flow. Each repetition felt slightly more natural than the last, and I could sense my body gradually adapting to the movements.\nThe full ten percent agility increase wasn’t immediately obvious during the initial attempts since I haven’t mastered it yet, but as my muscle memory began to develop, I noticed subtle improvements in my reaction speed and fluidity of motion. My footwork became lighter, more responsive, with each step carrying me slightly further than before with the same amount of effort and energy spent.\nAfter an hour of intensive practice, I decided to take a break and check on my team’s progress through the communication crystals. The examination was still ongoing, and I needed to ensure our Crest Mark collection was proceeding efficiently.\nI contacted Emmet first, knowing he would give me a straightforward report on the hunting operations.\n\"Emmet, what’s your status?\" I asked through the crystal.\n\"We’ve collected ten Crest Marks so far, found three more groups of white donkeys near the river tributaries. We’re moving along the waterways since that seems to be where they congregate.\"\n\"Excellent work. Keep maintaining your stealth and avoid other teams.\"\nNext, I contacted the scouting teams to get updates on their scouting efforts.\n\"Scouting Team Alpha, report,\" I said into the crystal.\n\"Captain, we just found a shrine!\" came the excited response from one of the team captains. \"It’s about two kilometres northwest of base camp, partially hidden by overgrown vegetation. The structure appears intact, and we can see magical energy emanating from the entrance. We’re maintaining observation distance as ordered and waiting for further instructions.\"\n\"Perfect. Mark the location and keep two of you in the vicinity, the rest should continue searching for additional sites. Don’t approach until we can coordinate a proper investigation.\"\nFinally, I checked in with Marcus and the Survivalists team managing our base camp operations.\n\"Marcus, how are things at camp?\" I inquired.\n\"Everything is proceeding smoothly,\" Marcus replied in his calm tone. \"The shelters are holding up well, and we’ve established secure perimeters around our position. Elen has been processing some of the local herbs into basic healing supplies, and we’ve maintained watch rotations without any incidents. No sign of rival teams in our immediate area.\"\n\"Good. Continue maintaining security and be ready to process any injured team members when the hunting and scouting groups return.\"\nThe reports were encouraging. Our approach was yielding steady results while maintaining operational security. With ten Crest Marks already secured and a new shrine discovered, we were positioning ourselves well for the examination’s conclusion.\nNow I needed to decide whether to re-join my team immediately or spend more time mastering the Light Steps technique while I had this private opportunity.\nChecking the follow-up movements within the first stance, I realized that practicing them effectively would be difficult back at the camp. The advanced footwork patterns required significant space and the ability to move freely without concern for detection or interruption.\nIn the past hour of focused practice, I had only managed to increase my agility enhancement by one percent, meaning I was merely ten percent of the way toward mastering even this introductory technique. The progress was measurable but slow - each movement needed to be repeated a number of times before it became natural enough to provide the full benefit.\nI spent another hour in dedicated practice, pushing myself to understand the subtle nuances of weight distribution, timing, and energy flow that the technique demanded. By the end of this second session, I had achieved another one percent improvement.\nMy total agility enhancement had reached two percent - a noticeable improvement that I could feel in my movements, but still far from the technique’s full potential.\nIn the grand scheme of developing a Royal-rank secret art, these were genuinely impressive gains for just two hours of initial practice. Most martial artists would spend months achieving similar progress. However, for my current situation with the examination ongoing and my team depending on my leadership, the time investment wasn’t practical.\nAfter calculating that mastering just this first stance would require more than ten hours of continuous practice, I made the decision to suspend my training. The technique would have to wait until I had proper time and facilities to dedicate to its development.\nThen, I carefully stored the precious manual in my spatial ring where it would remain safe until I could resume training. The shrine had served its purpose - I had claimed the Royal-rank secret art and gained valuable initial experience with its applications.\nAs for the fact that I had stolen it from kyle, I didn’t care. Every man was for himself in this world.\nNow it was time to return to my team and focus on maximizing our Crest Mark collection for the remainder of the examination. The footwork technique would be valuable for future challenges, but winning this current test required my immediate attention.\nI made my way toward the shrine’s exit, already planning how to best utilize the remaining examination time.\nAs I stepped outside the shrine and started making my way back toward the camp, I moved with purpose through the forest terrain. The Royal-rank secret art was safely stored, and now I needed to re-join my team to maximize our remaining examination time.\nTwo minutes into my journey, I encountered a team of students moving through the underbrush ahead of me. From their equipment and coordination, they appeared to be from one of the lower-ranked classes participating in the examination.\nWhile I had instructed my team to avoid confrontations with rival groups, I had no such personal restrictions. These students likely possessed Crest Marks and resources that could benefit our overall score. I could eliminate this team now and take whatever they had collected.\nMore importantly, I could then mislead them about my direction to avoid detection, something I wasn’t confident my team members would execute effectively. This was precisely why I had forbidden such aggressive tactics for the group.",

      "content": "Chapter 110: Shrine [1]\nMoving with supernatural stealth, I climbed silently into the trees like a shadow, positioning myself above their path. From this elevated vantage point, I could observe their formation and wait for the optimal moment to strike.\nThe opportunity presented itself when one student fell slightly behind the main group, creating separation that I could exploit. I descended silently behind the trailing individual and delivered a precise strike to render them unconscious. A quick search revealed some useful resources and herbs, which I collected before swiftly re-joining the shadows.\nWith three targets remaining, they became easy pickings. I incapacitated each remaining team member before they could realize what was happening, searching their belongings thoroughly.\nThe operation yielded three Crest Marks along with various other resources - a respectable haul that would contribute meaningfully to our class total.\nAfter securing their items, I located their emergency communication crystal and deliberately crushed it. This action would officially remove them from the examination and trigger instructor intervention for their safety. In truth, I was doing them a favor - leaving unconscious students in monster-infested territory would have been essentially condemning them to death.\nI waited approximately three minutes in the nearby trees until I spotted an academy instructor approaching the unconscious students’ location. The rescue response was proceeding as expected.\nThe instructor’s eyes swept the area before locking onto my position in the distance. Even from several hundred meters away, I could see him raise an eyebrow in what appeared to be knowing acknowledgment.\nOur gazes met for a brief moment across the forest clearing. The instructor’s expression suggested he understood exactly what had transpired, though he made no move to pursue or confront me. This was, after all, within the bounds of the examination rules.\nI gave a subtle nod of acknowledgment before melting back into the forest shadows, leaving the instructor to handle the unconscious students’ evacuation.\nWith the Crest Marks I had just obtained and the resources I had collected, I now had a convenient alibi for my absence. I had been planning to hunt for additional materials on my way back to camp, but the defeated team had solved that problem by providing me with their accumulated items.\nSix hours had passed since the examination had started, meaning we were approaching the halfway point of the two-day trial.\nTen minutes later, I arrived at our base camp. My team members were immediately alerted by the sounds of my approach, tensing for potential combat before recognizing my presence and relaxing their defensive positions.\nOnce they confirmed my identity and let their guard down, I explained that I had obtained these additional items during my mission. I deliberately omitted the details about encountering and defeating the rival team as revealing that information would have been strategically foolish.\nIf my team learned that I had broken the same rules I had established for them, they would likely view me as an unfair leader who held others to standards I wouldn’t follow myself. That kind of perceived hypocrisy could undermine their trust and cooperation for the remainder of the examination.\n\"I encountered some useful resources during my scouting,\" I reported matter-of-factly. \"Three additional Crest Marks and various herbs.\"\nThe team accepted this explanation without suspicion, focusing instead on the positive impact these acquisitions would have on our overall performance. Combined with Emmet’s successful hunting and the newly discovered shrine, we were positioning ourselves well for the examination’s conclusion.\nThe leadership dynamic remained intact, and our operational security was preserved. Sometimes effective command required selective disclosure of information, especially when full transparency might compromise team cohesion and mission success.\nAfter organizing the herbs I had collected by distributing them to the Survivalist team for processing, and giving the Crest Marks to Elen for safekeeping, I decided to head toward the ruin where my scouting teams were waiting.\nThe reason I had given the Crest Marks to Elen rather than Marcus was tactical. If our camp came under attack, enemy teams would naturally focus on retrieving valuable items from whoever appeared to be the strongest defender, which would logically be Marcus. By entrusting the Crest Marks to Elen instead, I was implementing a form of misdirection that would keep hostile attention away from her and our accumulated rewards.\nMarcus could serve as an obvious target while Elen remained overlooked, allowing her to potentially escape with our collected Crest Marks if the situation became desperate. It was a calculated risk distribution that played to our enemies’ likely assumptions about how we would organize our defenses.\nI gathered a small escort team and prepared to move toward the shrine location that had been discovered earlier. The puzzle-solving aspect of the ruins would require careful coordination, and my leadership would be essential for maximizing our Crest Mark extraction from whatever challenges awaited inside.\nThe examination was progressing well, but we couldn’t afford to become complacent. Other teams were undoubtedly making their own progress, and maintaining our competitive advantage would require continued strategic thinking and efficient execution.\nThe newly discovered shrine represented our best opportunity to significantly increase our Crest Mark total before the examination concluded.\nIt took me about fifteen minutes to reach the shrine location, moving through the forest at a steady pace. My two team members immediately spotted my approach, I wasn’t attempting to hide my arrival since they were expecting me.\nThey led me directly to the discovered structure, and I had to admit it was genuinely impressive. The shrine rose approximately four stories high, its stonework showing clear signs of age and weathering. Several bricks had crumbled or broken away, thick moss covered much of the surface, and vegetation had begun growing in the cracks between stones. Despite the decay, the overall structure appeared stable and intact.\n\"Did you go inside?\" I asked, studying the entrance for any obvious traps or magical barriers.\nThey shook their heads immediately. \"No, we didn’t. We simply waited outside like you had ordered us to do.\"\n\"Good,\" I nodded approvingly before turning back towards the shrine.",

      "content": "Chapter 111: Shrine [2]\nTheir discipline in following instructions was exactly what I needed for this examination . Rushing into unknown ruins without proper preparation could easily result in casualties from hidden traps or magical defences.\n\"Alright, let’s head in then.\"\nI gestured for them to follow as I approached the entrance cautiously. Unlike the previous shrine where I had faced the Golden mane, this structure was part of the official examination and should contain puzzles rather than deadly guardians. Still, maintaining vigilance was essential when dealing with these shrines.\nThe entrance loomed before us, dark and mysterious.\nWe stepped through the entrance into the first floor of the shrine. The interior was dimly lit by magical illumination that seemed to emanate from the stone walls themselves. The chamber was circular, dominated by a massive stone column in the centre that was carved with what appeared to be wind-whorl patterns.\nAt the top of the column, a feathered wind-sigil turned slowly in the still air, creating an almost hypnotic effect.\nMy two team members spread out to examine the walls while I approached the central column. Near its base, I discovered an inscription carved in some sort of ancient script, though thankfully it was written in a language I could read.\n\"I braid the breath on cliff and sail, yet wear no hand or string. I steal the names of footsteps and deliver news to distant reed. You feel me as finger and blade, but never clasp me at the wrist. Speak me in the old tongue where scholars kept the sky.\"\nI read the riddle aloud for my companions, who gathered around to listen carefully.\n\"It’s clearly describing wind,\" one of them said immediately. \"Everything about braiding breath, delivering news, being felt but not grasped, that’s obviously wind.\"\n\"Wind seems like the most logical answer,\" the second team member agreed. \"Should we try saying it?\"\nI held up a hand to stop them. Something about the wording troubled me, particularly the final line about speaking in \"the old tongue where scholars kept the sky.\" This suggested that a simple modern word wouldn’t suffice.\n\"Wait,\" I said, studying the inscription more carefully. \"It specifically asks for the old tongue, the way scholars would have referred to it. We need an archaic term, not just the common word ’wind.’\"\nI examined the base of the column more thoroughly and noticed two small claw-notches carved into the stone, positioned to point at specific locations. The markings appeared to indicate numerical positions - the first pointing to what looked like the eighth position, the second pointing to the sixth.\n\"Look at these markings,\" I called my team members over. \"Two claw-notches pointing at different positions. Eight, then six.\"\nWe studied the marks, though none of us immediately understood their significance. Still, I committed the pattern to memory - it seemed important somehow.\nReturning to the riddle, I considered various archaic terms for wind that scholars might have used. The answer needed to be something that would sound scholarly and ancient, befitting a magical shrine that tested knowledge rather than just common sense.\nAfter several minutes of contemplation, I spoke confidently toward the column: \"Aeriform.\"\nThe word echoed through the chamber, and immediately the feathered sigil at the top of the column began spinning faster. The wind-whorl carvings started glowing with soft blue light, and I could hear the grinding of ancient mechanisms activating somewhere above us.\n\"How did you know that?\" one of my team members asked with obvious admiration.\n\"Aeriform - meaning ’of the nature of air’ or ’air-shaped,’\" I explained. \"It’s an old scholarly term that would have been used in ancient texts about elemental forces. The riddle demanded the old tongue, not modern vocabulary.\"\nA section of the far wall slid away, revealing a staircase leading to the second floor. The puzzle was solved, and we could proceed deeper into the shrine.\n\"The claw-notches might be important for later puzzles,\" I noted, gesturing to the markings. \"Keep them in mind as we continue.\"\nWe ascended the staircase to the second floor, finding ourselves in another circular chamber. This level featured a different aesthetic, the walls were constructed from black stone flecked with pearlescent veins that created an almost otherworldly appearance. The surface seemed to absorb direct light while reflecting it faintly, creating an unsettling visual effect.\nAt the centre of this chamber stood another pedestal, this one topped with what appeared to be a crystal formation. The entire room had a quality that made it feel like we were standing inside a geode.\nWe approached the central pedestal and found another inscription carved into its base:\n\"I hoard the thin winters of night in crystal teeth; I weigh the small salt of paths. Hunters sleep with me under their tongue, I steady step and hide the glint. Found where tide and fur keep close counsel, named for the small moon’s memory.\"\nI read the riddle aloud to my team members, who immediately began offering suggestions.\n\"Crystal teeth... that sounds like some kind of gem,\" one of them said thoughtfully.\n\"Something hunters use, that hides glint and steadies their step,\" the other added. \"Maybe some kind of stone they carry?\"\nI studied the inscription more carefully, noting a ring of small dots carved around the pedestal’s edge. Like the previous floor, this appeared to be another indexing clue. I was certain that the clue from last floor was important as it was once again repeated.\n\"Let’s try ’crystal,’\" suggested one team member.\nI spoke the word clearly toward the pedestal. Nothing happened for a moment, then suddenly the chamber began to rumble ominously.\nA section of the floor cracked open, and an Elite-rank beast emerged, a spider with razor-sharp legs and eyes that glinted with a malevolent intent. It was clearly weaker than some Elite-rank creatures I had encountered, but still dangerous enough to require serious combat for my team members.\n\"Handle this,\" I instructed my team members, stepping back to observe while continuing to study the riddle.\n\"I need to figure out the correct answer.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 112: Shrine [3]\nMy companions engaged the creature competently, using coordinated tactics to avoid its venomous attacks while landing strikes on its carapace.\nMeanwhile, I analysed the riddle’s clues more.\n\"Named for the small moon’s memory\"\nThis phrase seemed crucial. Combined with the references to night, hunters, and hiding glint, it pointed toward something specifically lunar in nature.\n\"Moon Crystal,\" I said aloud as my team delivered the finishing blow to the spider.\nAgain, nothing happened initially. Then the rumbling returned, more intense this time, and two sections of the floor opened simultaneously. Two Elite-rank beasts emerged, this time they were larger and more aggressive than the first.\n\"Two this time!\" one of my team members shouted as they prepared for a more challenging battle.\nI continued analysing the clues while they fought, realizing that we needed to be more careful about our approach to avoid spawning additional guardians with incorrect answers.\nClearly, wrong answers had escalating punishments, with the difficulty scaling based on the number of incorrect attempts. The pattern was becoming obvious, one wrong answer spawned one beast, two wrong answers spawned two beasts.\nAs my team members fought against the two beasts, I finally pieced together the riddle’s true meaning.\n\"Moonstone!\" I called out confidently.\nBoth of my team members paused mid-combat, looking at me with obvious concern.\n\"Are you sure?\" one of them shouted while dodging a crystal spider’s lunge. \"If you’re wrong again, three Elite-rank beasts will spawn. That’s too much for us to handle - you’ll need to step in and fight!\"\nI nodded firmly. \"I’m certain this time.\"\nThey finished dispatching the current threats before gathering around to hear my analysis.\n\"Look at the clues, I hoard the thin winters of night in crystal teeth, moonstone captures and reflects moonlight, appearing to store it within the crystal structure. I weigh the small salt of paths, moonstone is often used by travellers for navigation and guidance. Hunters sleep with me under their tongue, it’s a common talisman carried by hunters for stealth.\"\nI pointed to the specific phrase that had provided the key insight. \"But the crucial line is ’named for the small moon’s memory.’ That directly points to moonstone - a gem literally named after the moon itself. The entire riddle is describing the properties and uses of moonstone, not just any crystal or gem.\"\nMy team members looked shocked by the thoroughness of the analysis.\n\"That... actually makes complete sense,\" one admitted. \"All the clues fit perfectly when you explain it that way.\"\n\"The pearlescent veins in these walls even match moonstone’s appearance,\" the other observed. \"We should have connected those visual elements to the riddle.\"\nI approached the pedestal and spoke clearly: \"Moonstone.\"\nThe word resonated through the chamber, and immediately the formation began glowing with soft, lunar light. The pearlescent veins in the walls pulsed in harmony with the central crystal, creating a beautiful display of synchronized illumination.\nA grinding sound echoed from above as another section of wall slid away, revealing a staircase leading to the third floor. The moonstone riddle had been solved correctly.\n\"Well reasoned,\" I said to my team as we prepared to ascend. \"Our approach is working clearly, we found the key to these puzzles.\"\nWe climbed to the third floor, entering a chamber with a distinctly different atmosphere. The stone here had a faint smoky scent, and seams throughout the walls glowed like smouldering coals, though the surfaces remained cold to the touch when we tested them. The contradiction between the visual warmth and actual temperature created an unsettling effect.\nAt the center of this level stood another pedestal, this one carved from what appeared to be blackened stone with veins of deep red running through it. The inscription was carved more deeply than the previous riddles, as if burned into the stone itself.\nI read the new riddle aloud:\n\"I stand between ember and breath though I hold no blade. I am the seam that keeps hearth from hunger; my name is the ward of flame. Speak the compound forged to turn ash aside, in the tongue the old smiths used.\"\nMy team members immediately began discussing possible answers.\n\"It’s talking about protection from fire,\" one said thoughtfully. \"Something that stands between flame and... whatever flame might damage.\"\n\"A barrier of some kind,\" the other suggested. \"But it specifically mentions ’the tongue the old smiths used,’ so we need an archaic term again.\"\nI studied the base of the pedestal and noticed new markings, a burnt notch combined with what appeared to be an older rune.\nOne of my team members suddenly straightened with obvious realization. \"Wait - ’the ward of flame’ and ’compound forged to turn ash aside.’ It’s asking for a specific protective term that smiths would have used.\"\nHe paused, working through the logic carefully. \"Flameward. That’s what they called protective barriers against fire in the old forging texts. It’s a compound word, flame plus ward, exactly what the riddle describes.\"\nI looked at him with genuine interest. \"That’s excellent reasoning. The riddle specifically asks for a compound term, and flameward fits all the clues perfectly. You’ve connected the smithing context with the protective function.\"\n\"Are you confident in that answer?\" The other team member asked, wanting to ensure he had fully thought it through.\nHe nodded firmly. \"Flameward describes something that wards off flame, it’s a compound term like the riddle requests, and it uses the archaic language that old smiths would have employed. All the clues align.\"\n\"Then speak it,\" I said, stepping back to let him claim credit for solving the puzzle.\nHe approached the pedestal and declared clearly: \"Flameward.\"\nThe word resonated through the chamber with a deep, satisfying sound. The coal-like seams in the walls flared brighter for a moment before settling into a steady, warm glow. The smoky scent intensified briefly, then cleared as mechanisms activated.\n\"Good job,\" I said to my team member who had solved the riddle.\nA section of the wall slid away with the grinding of stone on stone, revealing another staircase leading upward. The flameward puzzle had been conquered through reasoning rather than guesswork.",

      "content": "Chapter 113: Shrine [4]\nWe climbed to the fourth floor, entering a chamber that immediately evoked maritime themes. Tide patterns were carved intricately into the stone walls, creating flowing designs. Faint salt crystals clung around a shallow stone bowl positioned at the room’s center, and I could detect the subtle scent of ocean air despite being deep inland.\nThe academy had really worked hard on these shrines, they were very creative and unique. I wondered how the other shrines looked like.\nThe pedestal here was carved to resemble weathered driftwood, complete with rope-like patterns spiraling around its base. The inscription was etched in flowing script that mimicked the movement of waves:\n\"Where water forgets the weight of ships, I keep the knot of logs and nets. I speak in gulls’ grammar and remember every dragged rope. Say my name: the long shore that keeps the sea’s gossip.\"\nI read the riddle aloud, and my team members immediately began analysing the maritime imagery.\n\"It’s describing some kind of shoreline or harbour area,\" one observed. \"Somewhere that deals with ships, nets, and ropes.\"\n\"The phrase ’long shore that keeps the sea’s gossip’ seems important,\" the other added. \"It’s asking for a specific term related to coastal areas I assume.\"\nI examined the base of the pedestal and found a coast glyph carved into the stone, with markings that appeared to indicate the third and fourth letter positions.\nAfter several minutes of discussion, one of my team members spoke up confidently: \"Longshore. It’s a maritime term for the shore itself, or work done along the shoreline. The riddle specifically mentions ’the long shore,’ and longshore fits perfectly with all the nautical references.\"\n\"That reasoning sounds solid,\" I agreed. \"Speak it.\"\nHe approached the pedestal and declared: \"Longshore.\"\nThe chamber responded immediately, with the salt crystals beginning to glow and the tide patterns seeming to flow more dynamically across the walls. Another staircase was revealed, but as we prepared to ascend, we found ourselves facing a dilemma.\n\"We have the index clues from all four floors now,\" I said, reviewing our collected letters. \"MO from the first floor, ON from the second, FA from the third, and NG from this floor.\"\nMy team members looked puzzled. \"MONFANG? MONGFAN? None of these combinations make sense,\" one said.\n\"Maybe we need to rearrange them?\" the other suggested. \"Or perhaps they spell something when read in a different order?\"\nWe spent several minutes trying various combinations without success. The individual letter pairs seemed meaningful, but we couldn’t determine how they were supposed to connect.\n\"Let’s go back to the first floor and examine each puzzle location again,\" I decided. \"There might be additional clues we missed that explain how to use these letter combinations.\"\nWe descended through the shrine, stopping at each floor to re-examine the pedestals and their surrounding areas. The pattern seemed consistent - each riddle had given us two letters - but the purpose remained unclear.\n\"Maybe it’s not about combining them,\" one team member suggested. \"What if each pair represents something different?\"\n\"Or perhaps there’s a fifth floor that will provide the final piece,\" the other added.\nAfter extensive discussion and examination, we decided to test one theory.\nOne of my team members said. \"What if we’re supposed to speak all the letter combinations together as a phrase? MONFANG might be some kind of activation word.\"\nWe returned to the central area where all four floors connected and I spoke clearly: \"MONFANG.\"\nThe response was immediate and alarming. The floor beneath us cracked open in five different locations, and Elite-rank beasts began emerging - creatures similar to those we had faced earlier, but larger and more aggressive.\nA disembodied voice echoed through the shrine with ominous authority: \"Only one attempt remains.\"\nFive Elite-rank opponents was a serious threat that required immediate action. I stepped forward decisively while giving instructions to my team.\n\"Each of you take one beast,\" I commanded, drawing my enhanced sword. \"I’ll handle the other three.\"\nThe battle began immediately. My team members engaged their assigned targets with the coordination they had developed during our previous encounters. Meanwhile, I activated my blood enhancement and charged toward the three creatures advancing on my position.\nThe fight wasn’t difficult. I had just defeated nine peak-elite statues and a transcendent rank lion. Handling three elite-rank beasts was nothing in consideration. My sword carved through their carapaces with devastating power.\nWithin minutes, all five beasts lay shattered across the shrine floor. We had survived the punishment for our incorrect guess, but now faced the pressure of having only one remaining attempt to solve the final puzzle.\nWith the immediate threat eliminated, I stood among the beast remains and focused on the real challenge, solving the meta-puzzle before our final attempt.\n\"Let’s think about this calmly,\" I said, gathering my team around me. \"We have four letter pairs: MO from the first floor, ON from the second, FA from the third, and NG from the fourth. Perhaps we shouldn’t skip the O’s and actually read them all.\"\nI traced the letters in the air as I spoke them. \"What if we’re supposed to read them in the order we encountered them? MO-ON-FA-NG.\"\n\"MOONFANG,\" one of my team members said, his eyes widening with realization.\nI nodded. \"That’s it, Moonfang... I think I read somewhere that it’s a legendary term from hunter traditions. A relic that is rumoured to have been forged under moonlight, used to bind hunting packs or unlock sacred vaults or so the ancestors believed.\"\nThe pieces clicked together perfectly. Each individual riddle had tested our knowledge of archaic terminology, while the meta-puzzle required us to understand deeper old lore about legendary artifacts.\n\"In the Academy’s examination system, Moonfang would be a keyword that unlocks significant rewards. This isn’t just about solving puzzles, I think it’s also about demonstrating comprehensive knowledge of both linguistic history and magical traditions.\"\nWe made our way to what appeared to be the shrine’s central altar, a raised platform that connected all four floors through an open shaft in the center.",

      "content": "Chapter 114: Crests [1]\nThe convergence point was clearly where we needed to speak our final answer.\nStanding before the final circle, I took a deep breath and spoke clearly: \"MOONFANG.\"\nThe response was immediate and spectacular. The entire shrine began resonating with harmonic vibrations, and brilliant light erupted from each floor simultaneously. The altar split open to reveal a a small hidden chamber containing exactly what I had hoped for, ten magical Crest Marks, each one glowing.\n\"Ten crests ,\" I said with satisfaction, collecting the precious rewards. \"This is not bad at all, it seems like shrines give their fair bit of crests. It was the right choice to create scouting teams for these shrines, they are limited and they provide alot.\"\nMy team members looked at the haul with obvious amazement.\nWe left the shrine satisfied with what we had received. The ten Crest Marks represented a substantial haul that would significantly boost our class total. As we made our way back through the forest, I contacted my other teams to check on their progress.\nThe scouting team that had found the shrine reported an unexpected complication. They had discovered another shrine, but this one wasn’t uncontested. They were currently facing opposition from another team for control of the location.\n\"Which team is it?\" I asked through the communication crystal.\n\"It’s the other elite team’s scouting team,\" came the reply.\n\"Anyone you recognise?\" I asked.\n\"I can only recognise Seraphina. The others I’ve seen them but they aren’t famous or anything.\"\nA frown formed on my face. This was exactly the kind of confrontation I had hoped to avoid so early on. Kyle’s team represented serious opposition - they were skilled, well-coordinated, and led by some of the academy’s most talented students.\n\"Do not engage,\" I ordered immediately. \"Withdraw from the area now.\"\n\"But we found it first,\" one of the scouts protested. \"We should be able to contest for it.\"\n\"Listen to orders! Don’t do anything, and wait for my response,\" I said firmly, cutting off any further argument.\nFighting Seraphina’s team would only result in casualties and losses for us. Besides, it had taken our team nearly an hour to solve the previous shrine, and if this new location contained valuable Crest Marks, it would require at least equal time and effort. Getting into a prolonged battle with the current scouting team there would be counterproductive.\nI immediately connected with Emmet’s hunting team. \"How is the hunting going?\" I asked.\n\"We haven’t seen any white donkeys in a while,\" Emmet replied. \"The river areas seem to have been cleared out.\"\n\"Change of plans,\" I said, making a quick tactical decision. \"I’m sending you coordinates to join the scouting team that’s facing Seraphina’s group for a shrine. Wait until Seraphina and her group solves the shrine before engaging them.\"\nI could hear the excitement in Emmet’s voice as he responded. This was exactly the kind of challenge he had been hoping for.\nI contacted the scouting team through the communication crystal to provide updated instructions.\n\"Emmet’s hunting team is being redirected to provide you with backup,\" I informed them. \"Maintain concealment and keep watch on Seraphina’s team. Avoid detection at all costs, but monitor their progress and report any significant developments.\"\nThe tactical situation required careful coordination. Having Emmet’s combat-focused team supporting the scouts would give us options if the confrontation escalated, while maintaining our ability to gather intelligence on Kyle’s group.\nWith those orders issued, I turned to the two team members who had accompanied me to the shrine.\n\"You two need to go support the operation as well,\" I instructed. \"Follow the same coordinates I gave Emmet. Stay hidden, provide backup, and maintain communication with me.\"\nThey nodded and immediately set off through the forest toward the contested shrine location.\nNow traveling alone, I made my way back to our base camp with the ten valuable Crest Marks secured in my storage. The return journey gave me time to consider our overall strategic position. Between the Crest Marks we had already collected through hunting and these recent shrine rewards, our class was accumulating a substantial point total.\nThe confrontation brewing around the second shrine represented both opportunity and risk. If we could deny Kyle’s team access to that location’s rewards while avoiding significant loses, it would strengthen our competitive advantage considerably.\nReaching the camp, I would need to brief Marcus and the remaining team members on the developing situation while ensuring our base remained secure.\nI had sent Emmet’s group with a specific plan in mind. At this early stage of their development, Emmet could realistically handle Seraphina despite her legendary bloodline advantage.\nThe key factor was timing. Currently, Seraphina wasn’t operating at her peak potential. While legendary bloodlines were incredibly powerful, early in an awakener’s development the rank difference didn’t create as significant a gap since most traits remained locked. The real advantages of legendary bloodlines typically manifested as awakeners advanced to higher ranks and unlocked more powerful traits of higher orders.\nEmmet’s rare-rank bloodline was fully offensive in nature, which created a fair matchup against Seraphina’s current capabilities. More importantly, I knew about a critical weakness in her bloodline that she hadn’t discovered yet - one that wouldn’t reveal itself until later in the original timeline.\nBased on my knowledge from the novel, Seraphina’s legendary bloodline came with a severe drawback: once she entered serious combat, she became unable to stop fighting until either her opponent surrendered or she faced was unable to fight whether death or unconsciousness . This berserker-like compulsion was both a strength and a devastating weakness, depending on the tactical situation.\nThe weakness typically remained hidden because most early opponents either surrendered quickly when facing a legendary bloodline user, or the fights ended decisively before the compulsion became apparent. In the original timeline, Seraphina only discovered this limitation during the beast attacks on the city, when the monsters’ refusal to surrender trapped her in prolonged combat.\nBy having Emmet engage her directly, I could exploit this unknown weakness. Once Seraphina became locked in combat with him, she would be unable to focus on anything else - including coordinating with her team or securing the shrine’s contents. This would allow my numerically superior forces to claim the Crest Marks while she remained fixated on the fight.",

      "content": "Chapter 115: Engaging In Combat [1]\nAn hour passed while I remained at the base camp, using the time to plan our next strategic moves. The examination was progressing, but the resource situation was becoming increasingly clear.\nNo additional shrines had been spotted by any of our teams except for the contested one where Seraphina’s group was operating. Similarly, no white donkeys had approached our river position despite our advantageous location.\n’The resources are becoming scarce and difficult to find,’ I thought to myself. ’This will force teams to start targeting each other directly to acquire Crest Marks.’\nThis development was predictable. As easily accessible resources depleted, the examination would naturally evolve into more direct competition between teams. The academy had likely designed it this way intentionally, testing not just puzzle-solving and hunting abilities, but also tactical combat and resource denial.\nThe communication crystal suddenly rang, interrupting my strategic planning.\n\"We are about to engage with Seraphina’s team. Just wanted to update you,\" came Emmet’s voice through the device.\nI could hear the anticipation in his tone. This was exactly the kind of direct confrontation he had been hoping for throughout the examination.\n\"Understood,\" I replied calmly. \"Remember the priorities, figure out who has the contents first, engage in combat second. Coordinate with the scouting teams for numerical advantage, and maintain communication discipline.\"\nThe pieces were finally moving into position for what could be a decisive engagement. If executed properly, this confrontation would significantly strengthen our position while weakening one of our primary competitors.\n\"Keep me informed of major developments,\" I added. \"Good hunting.\"\nThe waiting phase was over.\nElen walked towards me after seeing me end the communication call, her curiosity evident in her expression.\n\"Who was it?\" she asked.\n\"It was Emmet. He’s engaging with another Elite class team,\" I replied matter-of-factly.\nElen’s eyes widened in surprise, she hadn’t been informed about this development during her focus on the alchemy work.\n\"Does he need help? Should we go support him?\" she asked with obvious concern.\nI shook my head firmly. \"It’s fine. He can handle the situation. How is the concoction work progressing?\"\nHer eyes immediately brightened, and she began speaking with genuine excitement about her recent progress.\n\"It’s going wonderfully! There are so many useful resources scattered throughout this forest area. I’m gaining practical experience with potion brewing without having to consume the expensive materials I purchased back at the academy. It’s like having a free outdoor laboratory with unlimited supplies.\"\nShe continued enthusiastically about the various herbs and components she had discovered, and the ones that I had brought, describing their properties and potential applications with the passion of someone truly engaged in their craft.\nI couldn’t help but laugh at her infectious enthusiasm. \"That’s excellent progress, as long as you’re certain they’re actually healing potions and not accidentally poisonous concoctions.\"\n\"That’s mean!\" she pouted in mock offense before breaking into laughter alongside me.\nMinutes passed by without any updates from Emmet or the other team members. The silence was concerning, but I forced myself to wait patiently for news from the field. Contacting them during crucial moments could distract them and prove to be a terrible mistake.\nI was bound to get new from them, whether successful or not.\nTen minutes finally elapsed before a response came through the communication crystal.\n\"Captain... We have retrieved the crystals, but Emmet is refusing to back down from the fight with Seraphina. He’s also threatening any of us if we dare to join in on the fight, he wants to fight her alone,\" one of the team members I had sent reported with obvious frustration and worry.\nA frown formed on my face. Emmet was clearly not following the plan I had set to him. He had gotten so caught up in the combat that he no longer cared about our broader objectives or team coordination.\nThe mission’s success was within hand’s length. Yet, Emmet wasn’t complying.\nI took a deep breath before asking, \"What about Seraphina’s team?\"\n\"We have immobilized them,\" came the reply.\n\"Good. Bring the crystals back to the shrine entrance, then withdraw. Leave Emmet alone,\" I ordered firmly.\n\"But Captain, shouldn’t we—\"\n\"I said leave him!\" I interrupted, my voice carrying clear authority.\nKnowing Emmet, with his mind clearly set on fighting Seraphina. Even my words won’t change anything. Thus, I decided to change the plan and work around Emmet’s issues to regain the advantage we had.\n\"Yes, Captain,\" the team member responded reluctantly.\nI stood up from the log I had been sitting on and immediately sought out Marcus, who was overseeing the camp’s defensive preparations. His presence would be crucial for maintaining security in my absence.\n\"Marcus, there’s been a complication,\" I explained quickly. \"Emmet has engaged in solo combat and is refusing to disengage. The team secured the shrine’s contents, but I need to handle the situation personally.\"\nMarcus nodded with his calm, and understanding expression. \"The camp will remain secure. How long do you expect to be away?\"\n\"Unknown. Maintain vigilance and be prepared for potential retaliation if other teams become aware of our activities. Keep Elen and the others focused on their tasks, and don’t let anyone leave the perimeter without explicit orders.\"\n\"Alright, take care.\" Marcus nodded.\nI gathered my equipment and prepared to depart immediately. Emmet’s reckless behaviour was threatening to compromise our carefully planned strategy, and direct intervention was now necessary to prevent the situation from spiralling out of control.\nThe distance to the contested shrine would give me time to consider how best to handle a teammate who had lost sight of our mission objectives in favour of personal combat satisfaction.\nMy body blurred through the various trees, bushes and undergrowth inside the forest. My destination was clear and my purpose was set. I needed to reach the shrine where Emmet was fighting.\nAs for the hostages and my other team, I wasn’t worried about them. They should be enough to deal with Seraphina’s team, they are hostages for a reason after all.",

      "content": "Chapter 116: Engaging in Combat[2]\nArriving at the location, I could hear the unmistakable sounds of intense combat echoing through the forest.\nClash!\nBoom!\nCrack!\nThe sounds of trees breaking, metal clashing against metal, and heavy grunting filled the air as I approached the battlefield.\nIt had taken me nearly fifteen minutes to reach the contested shrine. During those fifteen minutes, Emmet and Seraphina had clearly pushed themselves to their absolute limits. Both fighters were breathing heavily, their movements sluggish with exhaustion, yet they continued their relentless battle.\nI found them locked in what appeared to be the final stages of their confrontation. Seraphina’s body was keeping her upright despite obvious fatigue, while Emmet’s endurance had allowed him to match her blow for blow throughout the extended fight.\nBoth combatants reacted immediately to my arrival. Seraphina’s eyes widened as she registered my presence, clearly recognizing that facing two Elite-class opponents of our calibre simultaneously would put her in an impossible situation.\nYet despite this obvious disadvantage, she didn’t disengage from Emmet. Her body language suggested she physically couldn’t stop fighting.\nEmmet’s reaction was entirely different and far more problematic but expected.\n\"Don’t get involved, Blackwood!\" he shouted without taking his eyes off Seraphina. \"Otherwise I won’t be continuing this examination!\"\nHis threat was serious, Emmet was so consumed by the combat that he was willing to forfeit the entire examination rather than accept interference in what he viewed as his personal duel. The bloodlust and competitive drive had completely overridden his strategic thinking and team loyalty.\nI stood at the edge of the battlefield, analyzing the situation.\nThe fight continued as I watched from the sidelines with my arms crossed, analyzing the deteriorating situation.\nIntervening would definitely remove Emmet from my team permanently. He never backed down from his words - if he said he wouldn’t participate in the examination, then he absolutely wouldn’t.\nThe more the battle progressed, the more I realized that Emmet was going to lose. My original plan had been for him to hold Seraphina in combat just long enough for the others to secure the crests and then assist him. Fighting her alone for this extended period was never sustainable.\nSeraphina finally landed a devastating attack that sent Emmet crashing to the forest floor, unconscious. Her legendary bloodline had ultimately proven decisive in the prolonged engagement.\nSeraphina collapsed to her knees but remained conscious, breathing heavily with numerous injuries covering her body. It had clearly been an exhausting fight that had pushed both combatants beyond their normal limits.\nShe looked up at me with those distinctive cold eyes, recognizing that her situation had become precarious now that a fresh opponent had arrived while she was in a weakened state.\nWith the duel concluded, it was finally appropriate for me to intervene. I wasn’t going to honor any noble concepts about fair combat or wait for her to recover from her injuries.\nI approached deliberately, drawing my sword. The outcome had been predetermined from the moment I decided to come here personally. Seraphina had served her purpose in neutralizing Emmet, but now she represented a liability that needed to be eliminated to protect my examination standings.\nStanding before her kneeling form. I placed my sword blade gently under her chin, lifting her face to meet my gaze directly, our eyes locked in a moment of confrontation.\n\"Are you going to surrender, or...\" I began, offering her one final opportunity to end this peacefully.\n\"Never,\" she interrupted with fierce determination, immediately attempting to launch another attack despite her obvious exhaustion.\nHer movement appeared almost in slow motion due to her depleted state. The strike that might have been dangerous from a fresh opponent was easily readable and avoidable given her current condition.\nI shook my head at her stubborn refusal to accept the reality of her situation. Moving swiftly, I appeared beside her and delivered a precise strike with the hilt of my sword to render her unconscious.\nThud!\nHer body collapsed to the forest floor, finally ending the confrontation.\nWith both Emmet and Seraphina unconscious, I could now focus on damage control. I needed to activate her emergency crystals to ensure instructor intervention for her safety.\nActivating it will allow me to get rid of kyle’s strongest team member. With her gone, the first spot in this tournament was almost destined to be ours. It was nothing but a matter of time.\nThe situation had been resolved, though not exactly as I had originally planned. Emmet’s reckless behavior had created complications, but the primary objective of denying this shrine’s contents to Kyle’s team had been accomplished successfully.\nI began searching the immediate area for any additional Crest Marks or valuable materials before the instructors arrived to handle\nSeraphina’s uncounscious body.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nI quickly searched Seraphina’s unconscious body, looking for any items or resources she might have collected. My hands moved quickly through her equipment pouches, retrieving several Crest Marks she had been carrying before walking toward Emmet’s still form.\nLooking down at his unconscious body, I had to admit he had performed better than expected.\n’He did pretty well, I must say.’\nThe fight had lasted much longer than I had anticipated, and he had pushed Seraphina to her absolute limits despite the disadvantage of her legendary bloodline.\nSuddenly, voices erupted from the forest around us. I could hear sounds of people approaching rapidly through the underbrush - multiple voices and the sound of branches breaking as they moved toward our location. They were still far, but this area’s quietness and my enhanced senses allowed for me to spot them early.\nI needed to make a quick decision. The approaching voices likely belonged other student teams drawn by the sounds of the extended battle or Kyle’s group. Either scenario required immediate action.\nThe sounds of students grew closer and clearer as they moved swiftly toward my direction. I prepared to either engage with whoever was approaching or make a strategic withdrawal depending on what I encountered. The mission objectives had been accomplished, but now came the challenge of managing the aftermath.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "content": "Chapter 117: Letter [1]\nKyle’s POV\nIt had been more than an hour since Seraphina had left with the others to investigate and clear the shrine. Despite multiple attempts to contact them through the communication crystals, none of them had responded to my calls.\nGrowing increasingly worried and no longer willing to remain passive, I stood up and addressed my surrounding team members with urgency.\n\"I need to be direct with all of you. Something might have happened to Seraphina and her team at that shrine,\" I announced grimly.\nOne of my teammates looked genuinely shocked by this possibility. \"How is that even possible? Who could defeat Seraphina and the team accompanying her? Are you certain you’re not being overly paranoid, Kyle?\"\nThe concern was understandable. Seraphina was widely recognized as one of the top five strongest students in the entire academy. Her legendary bloodline wasn’t something that could be easily overcome by ordinary opponents.\nI frowned as I considered the possibilities. \"It’s most probably Adrian Blackwood’s team that’s responsible. Alternatively, she might have been ambushed by an entire coordinated class. Otherwise, I don’t see anyone else in this examination capable of neutralizing them completely.\"\nThe tactical implications were serious either way. \"I need a team to accompany me to investigate, while the rest of you remain here to maintain our base security. Who is willing to come with me?\"\nSeveral hands immediately shot up in response. I selected the most capable volunteers before giving final instructions to those staying behind.\n\"Be extremely careful and maintain concealment while I’m gone. Report anything unusual directly to me through the crystals,\" I commanded.\nWith my rescue team assembled, we prepared to depart and discover what had happened to Seraphina’s group.\n***\n\"Seraphina!\" I shouted as my eyes fell upon her motionless form on the forest floor. My blood ran cold, and I immediately darted toward her unconscious body.\nI pressed my fingers against her neck, desperately searching for a pulse. The seconds felt like an eternity before I detected the rhythmic beating.\nBeat. Beat...\n\"Thank god,\" I sighed in profound relief. She was alive, though clearly unconscious from whatever had transpired here.\nI quickly searched the surrounding area for the other team members who had accompanied her, but found no trace of them anywhere. The battlefield showed clear signs of intense combat - broken trees, disturbed earth, and scattered equipment - but my teammates were nowhere to be found.\nDuring my frantic search, my eyes landed on something that made them widen in complete shock. Before I could fully process the implications of the item lying on the forest floor, a familiar voice came from behind me.\n\"Student Kyle, could you please move away from her. I have a student who needs to be removed from the examination,\" an academy instructor said with professional authority.\nMy team members looked confused and alarmed by this sudden development. \"Did something happen to Seraphina? What’s going on?\" one of them asked with obvious concern.\nI understood the situation immediately and tried to intervene. Losing Seraphina so early on in the examination was a huge blow to our team that would be hard to deal with. \"Instructor, Seraphina is fine and she’s with us now. She might have activated her emergency crystal by accident during the fighting.\"\nThe instructor shook his head firmly, showing no flexibility in his stance. \"It doesn’t matter what the circumstances were. Her emergency crystal was activated, which means she is automatically excluded from this examination. She will not be permitted to continue participating.\"\nMy teammates looked genuinely shocked by this pronouncement. Seraphina being eliminated from the examination was a devastating blow to our overall strategy and competitive position.\n\"But she’s clearly capable of continuing,\" I protested. \"This has to be some kind of mistake or misunderstanding.\"\n\"The rules are absolute,\" the instructor replied. \"Emergency crystal activation results in immediate removal, regardless of the student’s current condition. This policy exists for safety reasons and cannot be overridden.\"\nI watched helplessly as the instructor began preparing to transport Seraphina away from the examination grounds, realizing that we had just lost one of our most powerful team members to circumstances I still didn’t fully understand.\nMy remaining team members gathered around me, their faces showing a mixture of confusion and concern about the rapidly deteriorating situation.\n\"Kyle, what should we do now?\" one of them asked with obvious worry. \"Seraphina has been removed from the examination, and her entire team has vanished without a trace.\"\n\"Yes, we are in a deep predicament. Just...who did this.\" Another member said, clenching his hands till they turned white.\nI grimly nodded my head, acknowledging the severity of our predicament. Taking a deep breath to maintain my composure, I addressed the group with as much calm authority as I could muster. I had to be technical and calm before my team, or they would panic and we would lose our cohesion.\n\"We need to search this entire area,\" I instructed. \"Look for any leads, evidence, or clues that might help us understand exactly what happened here. Check for tracks, displaced equipment, signs of struggle - anything that could tell us where the others went or who was responsible for this.\"\nThe team spread out across the battlefield, examining the disturbed ground and broken vegetation with careful attention to detail. The combat had clearly been intense and prolonged, but the specifics of what had transpired remained unclear.\nTime passed as we conducted our thorough investigation. The silence was tense as everyone focused on their assigned search areas, hoping to discover something that would provide answers.\nFinally, one of my team members called out with excitement. \"Captain! I’ve found a letter, somebody deliberately left it here!\"\nI immediately moved toward the team member’s location. There, partially concealed beneath some fallen leaves, was a folded piece of paper that had clearly been placed intentionally rather than dropped accidentally.\n\"Bring it here,\" I commanded, extending my hand to receive what might be our first real clue about the fate of Seraphina’s missing team members.\nThe folded letter represented our best hope of understanding the events that had led to this devastating situation.",

      "content": "Chapter 118: Letter [2]\nI opened the letter carefully, and as I read the contents, shock and disbelief filled my face completely.\n\"This...\" I began, unable to finish the sentence as the implications became clear.\nAdrian’s POV\n’He’s certainly going to have an interesting reaction to the letter I left him.’\nI had made the decision to evacuate the area when I heard the approaching voices. The letter had been prepared in advance, anticipating that Kyle would eventually arrive to search for his missing team members.\nIn the letter, I had written a direct message to Kyle:\n’If you want the rest of your team to remain in the examination, bring me fifteen Crest Marks within the next twenty minutes.’\nI had also provided him with specific coordinates - directing him to the same shrine where I had claimed the Royal-rank secret art. The irony of the location wasn’t lost on me. Using the site of my earlier victory as a negotiation point added a psychological element to the confrontation.\nThe terms were deliberately challenging but not impossible. Kyle’s team had been operating for hours and likely possessed a reasonable number of Crest Marks. However, surrendering fifteen would represent a significant portion of their accumulated resources and severely damage their competitive position in the examination.\nThe time constraint was equally important. Twenty minutes wasn’t enough time for Kyle to devise an elaborate counter-strategy or gather additional support. He would need to make a quick decision about whether his teammates’ continued participation was worth the substantial cost I was demanding.\nOn my way to the shrine, I took out my communication crystal while carrying Emmet’s still unconscious form over my shoulder.\n\"Marcus, I need you to bring a backup team immediately. We’re going to confront Kyle’s group soon, and we need superior numbers,\" I said into the crystal.\nMarcus’s voice came through. \"Is that really a wise strategy? We should consider maintaining a low profile instead. Abandoning the camp entirely leaves our base completely undefended.\"\n\"Don’t worry about tactical concerns right now,\" I replied firmly. \"There’s no time for extended planning. Bring everyone and abandon the camp temporarily, if anyone comes and takes hold we will simply remove them from this examination,\"\nAfter a moment’s hesitation, Marcus accepted the orders. My entire class would be mobilized for this confrontation.\nThe reason I was bringing overwhelming numbers was straightforward tactical psychology. I needed a show of force significant enough to intimidate Kyle into compliance without actual combat.\nWith our complete class contingent facing whatever smaller group he had brought to the meeting, he would be forced to accept the exchange without attempting any retaliation. The numerical disadvantage would make resistance tactically inadvisable.\nThere was no strategic benefit to fighting Kyle directly at this moment. Fighting him would need me to showcase my full power, Kyle was no weakling after all. Combat would only expose my capabilities unnecessarily and reveal techniques that were better kept hidden. I already suspected there was someone from the academy that had surveillance on me, my enemies were operating closer to my position than I preferred.\nA peaceful exchange backed by overwhelming force would accomplish the objective while preserving operational security and maintaining the element of surprise for future encounters.\nThe psychological pressure of facing superior numbers would do the work for me without requiring any actual violence.\nI arrived at the shrine and entered the familiar structure where I had previously claimed the Royal-rank secret art.\nInside, I found my team maintaining watch over Seraphina’s immobilized group. The captured students weren’t in shackles or physical restraints, they had the strength to break free from such crude measures. Instead, for each captured team member, two of my people stood guard nearby, creating an effective deterrent through superior numbers.\nThere were six members in Seraphina’s team, all looking resigned to their current predicament.\nImmediately, one of my team members noticed Emmet’s unconscious form draped over my shoulder and walked forward with obvious concern.\n\"Is he alright?\" the team member asked anxiously.\nI nodded reassuringly. \"He just needs to drink a healing potion and wake up. Other than that, he’s fine.\"\nThe team member nodded in relief, clearly satisfied that Emmet hadn’t sustained any permanent damage during his prolonged duel.\nSeraphina’s team looked at me with obvious wariness. They recognized exactly who I was and understood the implications of my presence. Their expressions showed they had been calculating potential escape scenarios, but my arrival had effectively eliminated any realistic chances of breaking free.\nThe numerical advantage was now overwhelming, and my reputation meant they couldn’t expect any oversights to exploit. The psychological impact was exactly what I had intended - complete demoralization of any resistance efforts.\nNow I simply needed to wait for Kyle’s arrival and see whether he would meet my demands or attempt some desperate alternative approach.\nMarcus arrived with the rest of our class, and I could see the complete resignation in the eyes of the captured students. Any lingering hope they might have harboured for escape evaporated entirely when they witnessed the overwhelming numbers now surrounding them.\nWith so many people present, there was absolutely no chance they could even contemplate breaking free, whether during daylight or under cover of darkness when some might sleep. The situation had become hopeless from their perspective.\nEmmet had regained consciousness by this point, but his mood was distinctly sour. He clearly understood that he had lost his duel with Seraphina and that I had intervened to save him from worse consequences.\n\"What happened to Seraphina?\" he asked with obvious reluctance.\n\"She’s been eliminated from the examination,\" I informed him matter-of-factly. \"Her emergency crystal was activated, so the instructors removed her from the competition entirely.\"\nEmmet’s expression showed a mixture of disappointment and frustration. Despite losing the fight, he had clearly hoped for some kind of rematch or continued rivalry. Learning that his opponent was no longer even participating seemed to diminish whatever satisfaction he might have gained from the prolonged combat.\nThe assembled students waited in tense silence as we prepared for Kyle’s arrival.\nNow came the critical moment of seeing whether Kyle would arrive with the demanded Crest Marks or attempt some alternative approach to resolve the situation.",

      "content": "Chapter 119: Confronting Kyle [1]\nNot long had passed since Marcus arrived before Kyle’s team appeared at the shrine entrance.\nMy expression remained calm and controlled as I watched Kyle approach, a deep frown etched across his face. He clearly understood the disadvantageous position he was walking into.\nHe hadn’t brought many people with him, a tactical mistake that worked in my favour.\nOne... three... eight. He has eight students from the Elite class with him, but compared to our full class presence, it’s practically nothing,\nI calculated silently.\nA grin almost escaped my lips, but I suppressed it to maintain my composed demeanour.\n\"Adrian, I would have rather not socialized under such circumstances,\" Kyle said with a soft sigh and subtle shake of his head.\n\"Indeed. But this is life, curveballs always appear out of nowhere, don’t they?\" I replied evenly.\nKyle nodded in acknowledgment. \"True enough. Was it you who caused Seraphina’s exclusion from the examination?\"\nI nodded without any change in my facial expression, maintaining direct eye contact. There was no point in denying my involvement or showing any emotional reaction to his question.\nThe numerical disparity between our forces was obvious to everyone present. Kyle had walked into a situation where he held virtually no leverage beyond whatever Crest Marks he had brought to meet my demands. The psychological pressure was exactly what I had intended to create.\nNow came the critical moment of discovering whether he would attempt to negotiate different terms or simply comply with my original ultimatum.\nOne of the imprisoned students suddenly made a desperate attempt to escape, trying to break away and join Kyle’s team. Both of my class members assigned to guard him immediately brought him down to the forest floor aggressively.\n\"Don’t move!\" they shouted as he continued to struggle against their restraint.\n\"Captain!\"\nKyle immediately intervened to prevent the situation from escalating. \"Stop! Do as they say,\" he commanded his teammate firmly.\nThe other captured students who had been about to intervene quickly retracted their steps, recognizing that resistance would only make their situation worse.\nKyle then turned his attention back to me with a negotiating tone. \"Fifteen Crest Marks... isn’t that excessive? The other classes barely have five at this point. How about ten instead?\"\nI shook my head with a subtle smile. \"I’m afraid I can’t accept that. Fifteen isn’t unreasonable for six of your classmates, don’t you think? If each person was worth three Crest Marks, that would be eighteen total. You’re not really operating at a loss.\"\n\"How about twelve?\" Kyle countered, clearly determined to negotiate better terms.\n\"No. Fifteen,\" I maintained firmly.\n\"Thirteen?\" he tried again.\nI shook my head once more.\n\"Fourteen Crest Marks and a kilogram of medicinal herbs from the forest?\" Kyle offered as his final compromise. His expression clearly showed that he was at the verge. It wasn’t about the single crest, it was about his reputation among his team.\n\"Deal.\" A smile formed on my face as I accepted his terms.\nFifteen had never actually been my real target price - it was deliberately set too high to create negotiating room. Fourteen Crest Marks plus valuable herbs was an excellent outcome that exceeded my actual expectations.\nThis approach served multiple strategic purposes. Kyle had managed to \"win\" some concessions in front of his team, which preserved his leadership credibility and prevented him from feeling completely cornered. Had I forced him into a position where he lost all face, he might have felt threatened enough to resort to desperate measures or outright rebellion.\nBy allowing him to seemingly negotiate me down from my initial demand, both sides could walk away feeling they had achieved something reasonable. Kyle maintained his dignity while I secured nearly everything I had actually wanted from this exchange.\nThe psychological dynamics were just as important as the material gains in maintaining long-term strategic advantage.\nWe both walked toward each other with deliberate, measured steps, our expressions carefully controlled and unreadable. The tension in the air was clear as both teams watched this critical exchange unfold.\nKyle reached for his pouch containing the Crest Marks while I raised my hand to signal my team to bring the prisoners forward. The moment had arrived for the actual transfer.\nKyle’s POV\nAs I withdrew the precious Crest Marks from my storage pouch, a dangerous thought suddenly emerged in my mind. The temptation to attack Adrian at this close distance was overwhelming - with my speed and the minimal space between us, I believed I could potentially take him hostage and reverse the entire situation in our favor.\nBut the moment I looked directly into Adrian’s eyes, my danger-sensing trait exploded like blazing red alarms throughout my consciousness. Every instinct I possessed screamed that whatever I was contemplating would be catastrophically foolish. It felt as if proceeding with any aggressive action would result in not just my removal from the examination, but the elimination of my entire team as well.\nMy heartbeat accelerated dramatically as the full weight of the threat became clear. How could the person standing before me radiate such overwhelming menace? He was someone who had never seriously trained...at least before his awakening, someone who had been written off as a failure by most of the people that knew him.\nHow could a single awakening have changed him so drastically? It was impossible that he could be working harder than me, so what explained this transformation? I possessed the supreme bloodline of the Phoenix clan, a legendary heritage renowned throughout multiple worlds for its power and potential!\nThe cognitive dissonance was staggering. Everything I thought I knew about Adrian Blackwood was being shattered by the reality of the man standing mere feet away from me. I knew he was strong, really strong.\nTo compete with me for the same power record, it wasn’t easy. But to raise such alarm bells?\nPerhaps its because his whole team is here, they would be able to react. Yes, it must be.\nI forced myself to calm down, taking slow, controlled breaths while fighting down the panic that threatened to overwhelm my rational thinking. My second-order trait was practically screaming at me to abandon any thoughts of resistance. The supernatural warning was so intense it felt like my bloodline itself was cowering in terror.\nWith tremendous effort, I extended the pouch toward Adrian, deciding to trust my danger-sensing ability completely. Every fiber of my being was telling me that survival depended on completing this exchange peacefully.",

      "content": "Chapter 120: Confronting Kyle [2]\nAdrian’s POV\nI accepted the pouch from Kyle’s hands, feeling the weight of the Crest Marks and herbs as they transferred into my possession. The exchange had proceeded exactly as I had calculated it would.\n\"Pleasure doing business with you, Kyle,\" I said with a satisfied smile, securing the pouch in my storage ring.\nKyle’s team members regrouped around him before he gave a curt nod and began withdrawing from the area. As they departed, I could see his eyes remained fixed on me, his body visibly tense with anticipation of a potential ambush.\nBut there was no need for such tactics. Ambushing him after completing the exchange would serve no beneficial purpose to me.\nAfter Kyle’s group disappeared into the forest, Elen approached me with obvious confusion about my decision.\n\"Why did you let him go? We could have easily surrounded them. You could handle Kyle while we dealt with the others. Once the Elite class is eliminated, we’re guaranteed to win the examination,\" she argued.\nI shook my head firmly. \"I gave him my word that no ambush would befall him during the exchange. I’m not going to break that commitment, I’m not that dishonourable.\"\nThe examination outcome was already decided in our favour. There was no doubt about our victory at this point.\nI looked at my assembled classmates and held up the pouch containing our newly acquired resources. \"Well done, everyone. This was earned through your collective hard work. We’re going to win this competition, and we’ll all receive the points we deserve!\"\nThe class erupted in excitement, with several students cheering and chanting praise about my leadership and strategic planning.\nEmmet kept his hands buried in his pockets, still visibly upset with gloomy eyes reflecting his disappointment over the earlier duel. Marcus stood with his arms crossed, maintaining his calm expression while observing the celebration of others.\nThe confrontation had effectively concluded in our favour. Our combination of resource gathering, strategic shrine solving, and tactical negotiations had created an overwhelming advantage that other classes couldn’t realistically overcome in the remaining time.\n\"Alright everyone, it’s time to return. Let’s head back!\" I shouted, motioning for the entire group to begin our withdrawal from the shrine area.\nEveryone followed instructions without hesitation. Their loyalty and trust in my leadership had been steadily increasing throughout the examination. Each decision I had made had demonstrated clear benefits for the team, building confidence in my strategic planning abilities.\nTime passed quickly as we made our way back through the forest. Night was approaching by the time we reached our established camp, the familiar shelter structures that Marcus had constructed earlier providing welcome security.\nAround the campfire, it was my designated turn to stand guard. I had managed to get some rest earlier in the day, so I was alert and ready for the night watch. Everyone operated on a rotation system for vigilance duties to ensure continuous security.\nMarcus was sleeping peacefully in one of the shelters, having completed his earlier watch shift throughout the day. Emmet remained awake alongside me, Elen and several other team members, though he still seemed subdued from his earlier defeat against Seraphina.\nThe flickering flames cast ominous shadows across our small camp while I maintained watch over the surrounding forest. The examination would conclude tomorrow, and our victory seemed assured given the substantial resources we had accumulated.\nOur position remained secure, and the successful negotiations had eliminated the primary threat to our examination performance.\nNow it was simply a matter of maintaining vigilance until the official conclusion and avoiding any last-minute complications that might jeopardize our accumulated advantages.\nAWOO!\nThe haunting sound of wolves echoed through the forest, distant but clearly approaching our position. The howls seemed to be getting closer with each passing minute.\nI stood up, preparing to deal with the threat before it could reach our camp and disturb everyone’s much-needed rest. However, Emmet quickly intervened.\n\"I will take care of them,\" he said, rising from his position near the fire.\nI studied his expression for a moment before nodding my approval. I could tell he was itching to release some of the built-up frustration and energy from his earlier defeat against Seraphina. Combat with these wolves would provide him with an outlet for those emotions while also serving our needs.\n\"Go ahead,\" I agreed. \"But stay within communication range and don’t pursue them too far into the forest if they retreat. If anything goes wrong, immediately inform me. Don’t wait.\"\nEmmet nodded curtly and moved toward the edge of our camp perimeter, his hand already moving to his weapon. The approaching wolf pack would give him exactly the kind of combat he preferred - no strategic considerations, just direct confrontation where strength and skill determined the outcome.\nI remained by the fire, ready to provide backup if the situation escalated beyond what he could handle alone, while keeping watch over the rest of our sleeping team members.\nThe distant howling continued to grow closer as Emmet prepared to intercept the pack before they could threaten our established position.\nElen moved closer to me by the campfire, her excitement about the examination’s outcome clearly visible in her animated expression.\n\"You know, Adrian, I’m really grateful that I’m in the same class as you. It’s genuinely comforting. Although, I must admit the rumours I had heard about you beforehand had put me off initially. But when I got to know you personally, I realized they were all lies. Thank you for carrying me toward victory.\"\nShe smiled brightly while gazing into the dancing flames of the campfire.\nIs it really a lie? The previous Adrian wasn’t exactly innocent, he deserved much of the criticism he received,\nI thought to myself. However, I chose not to address that particular topic, instead steering the conversation toward more practical matters.\n\"How many points do you think we’ll receive for winning?\" I asked.\nElen shook her head thoughtfully. \"I’m not sure, honestly. Even second-year students keep these details extremely secretive.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 121: Approaching End of Examination [1]\n\"I don’t understand why, but whenever points are mentioned, they maintain complete silence about specifics. Actually, they’re secretive about most academy matters, but the point system seems to be particularly sensitive information.\"\nOf course, I knew the mystery surrounding the points.\n\"Perhaps the secrecy serves a purpose,\" I mused. \"If students knew exact point values, they might focus too heavily on optimizing for rewards rather than actually learning and developing their abilities.\"\nEmmet returned some time later, blood coating his hands completely. It appeared he had used his bare fists to kill the wolves rather than drawing his weapon - a brutal but effective approach that spoke to his current emotional state.\nI observed him silently without offering any commentary. Emmet sat down by the fire without saying a word, his expression still dark and brooding.\nThe silence stretched between us as he stared into the flames. His violent handling of the wolf pack had clearly provided some outlet for his frustration, though he remained visibly troubled by his earlier defeat. The blood on his hands served as a stark reminder of the intensity he had brought to what should have been an easy elimination\nElen glanced between us uncertainly, sensing the tension but unsure whether to address it or maintain the quiet atmosphere.\nThe crackling of the campfire was the only sound as we sat in this uncomfortable stillness. Emmet’s mood was affecting the entire group dynamic, though I understood his need to process the loss in his own way. Combat had always been his primary method of working through emotional difficulties.\nEventually, someone would need to break this silence, but for now it seemed appropriate to let him have the space he clearly needed to work through his thoughts about the day’s events.\nTime passed steadily throughout the night, with occasional monsters venturing into our area. Several white donkeys actually appeared as well, drawn perhaps by the scent of dead monsters or the nearby water source.\nEmmet handled all these threats efficiently. Having someone as powerful as him deal with these disturbances was genuinely convenient, it removed the need for me to interrupt my own activities and allowed me to focus on personal improvement during the watch.\nThroughout the entire night shift, I practiced strengthening my weapon enhancement abilities. I was careful not to overuse my mana reserves, instead working slowly and methodically to build proficiency. Maintaining a substantial mana reserve was crucial in case any serious threats emerged that required my direct intervention.\nPeriodically, I ventured away from the campfire to consume my stored blood supplies. These discrete trips were necessary to maintain my enhanced capabilities, though obviously I couldn’t drink blood in front of my teammates without raising uncomfortable questions about my true nature.\nThe routine was meditative in its own way, maintaining vigilance, practicing enhancement techniques, and managing my physiological needs while ensuring the camp’s security. The steady progression of small improvements felt more valuable than dramatic breakthroughs that might attract unwanted attention.\nBy dawn, I had made measurable progress with my weapon enhancement control while successfully maintaining our defensive perimeter throughout the night. The examination would conclude today, and our accumulated advantages positioned us well for victory.\n[Your trait Blood Enhancement has reached level 3]\nA smile erupted across my face as my night-long practice finally bore fruit. At level 3, the enhancement required less blood essence, consumed significantly less mana, and provided even greater strengthening effects.\nThe night faded as the sun emerged over the horizon, signalling another day. It was time for the team to wake up. I felt energized despite not sleeping, the successful training had left me in good mood and my body was in excellent condition.\nWhen everyone had roused and gathered around the dying campfire, I began issuing new orders for the day.\n\"Listen up, everyone. Don’t become complacent just because we’ve had success. We’re still not guaranteed victory,\" I announced firmly. \"By removing Seraphina from Kyle’s team, we’ve created a dangerous enemy. They’ll be looking for opportunities to strike back at us.\"\nA classmate nodded thoughtfully. \"What’s our strategy for the final day?\"\n\"We’re abandoning this camp,\" I declared. \"With our resources secured, there’s no need to maintain a survivalist team anymore. I’m redistributing everyone into expanded scouting and hunting teams.\"\nElen looked concerned. \"Are you sure we should give up this defensive position?\"\n\"We won’t be staying another night, so there’s no point worrying about losing the site or someone taking it over,\" I explained. \"Pack everything up, we’re going mobile. Staying in this place isn’t safer, it’s actually more dangerous. A team might’ve already found our location without our knowledge. The news could be sold to other classes that could attack us or they could even attack us themselves.\"\nI turned to Marcus specifically. \"You’re going to captain a new team. I’m placing Elen with you along with several others.\"\nThe reason I placed Elen with Marcus was simple. When Kyle’s team inevitably attacks to retrieve Crest Marks, they’ll assume I’m carrying them personally. But the marks will actually be with Marcus’s team, a strategic misdirection that should give us tactical advantages.\nProtection through misdirection. They’ll focus their efforts on the wrong target while the magical crests remain safely guarded.\nWhen the time was right, we began our coordinated movement across the examination grounds. We currently possessed 40 Crest Marks, a substantial accumulation that put us in an excellent competitive position.\nApproximately 20 hours remained in the examination period, giving us ample time to secure additional resources while maintaining our advantages.\nWe moved as a unified group rather than splitting into smaller teams. While this made us more difficult to conceal, stealth wasn’t our objective at this point. Our numerical superiority meant we could afford to operate openly while deterring attacks from rival teams.\nOur approach continued to yield results as we encountered additional opportunities. We discovered and solved two more shrines during our sweep of the western territories. These puzzles proved easier than the complex four-floor shrine we had conquered earlier, though their rewards were correspondingly smaller, each provided 5 Crest Marks rather than the 10 we had claimed previously.",

      "content": "Chapter 122: Approaching End of Exmaination [2]\nThe hunting teams also maintained steady progress, locating and eliminating white donkeys that had been missed during earlier sweeps by other teams.\nThe creatures seemed to be becoming increasingly scarce as the examination progressed, confirming my assessment that resources were being depleted across the testing grounds.\nCurrently we possessed 55 Crest Marks total - a substantial number given the apparent scarcity of these items.\nBased on our observations of other teams’ activities and the difficulty of locating additional resources, this accumulation likely represented a commanding lead over our competitors.\nThe examination’s conclusion was approaching, and our methodology had created what appeared to be an insurmountable advantage.\nThe remaining time would be spent consolidating our position while preventing any desperate attempts by rival teams to close the gap through aggressive tactics.\nAs we moved through the forest in our coordinated formation, we encountered a small group of students from one of the lower-ranked classes. They were clearly outmatched by our overwhelming numbers.\n\"Surrender immediately,\" I called out to them, my voice carrying absolute authority.\nThe students looked at each other with obvious fear and resignation. Facing an entire Elite class was an impossible situation - they had no realistic chance of resistance or escape.\n\"We surrender,\" their apparent leader said quickly, raising his hands in defeat.\nWe systematically searched their belongings for any Crest Marks they might have accumulated, but found nothing of value. Their pouches contained only basic supplies and a few common herbs - no magical crests whatsoever.\n\"Please, you have what you wanted,\" one of them pleaded as I retrieved their emergency crystals. \"Can’t you just let us continue?\"\n\"We can’t risk you interfering with our operations or reporting our movements to other teams,\" I replied, crushing their crystals one by one.\n\"No, please don’t eliminate us from the examination!\" another student begged desperately. \"We’ve worked so hard to get this far!\"\nTheir pleas were understandable but irrelevant to our needs. Allowing rival teams to remain active, even weak ones, created unnecessary variables that could potentially complicate our final positioning.\n\"This is just the nature of competition,\" I said matter-of-factly as the academy’s emergency response activated to collect the disqualified students.\nWithin minutes, an instructor arrived to escort the eliminated team away from the examination grounds. Our elimination of competitors was proceeding exactly as planned, removing potential threats while consolidating our dominant position.\nFor the next several hours, everything proceeded exactly as we had planned. We maintained our dominant position, gathering additional Crest Marks through encounters with white donkeys, and eliminated two rival team we encountered. Our approach was yielding consistent results.\nThat changed when a loud announcement began echoing throughout the entire forest, transmitted through magical amplification that reached every corner of the examination grounds.\n[Students! You have reached the one-hour mark before the examination’s conclusion. There will be a special event from this moment onwards.]\nEveryone around me looked confused and curious about this unexpected development. The timing seemed deliberately calculated to disrupt established strategies during the final phase.\nThe Commander’s voice continued with detailed explanations about the new mechanics. A special zone had formed near the walls of the inner academy jungle - the same area where we had originally entered and begun the examination.\nWithin this zone, magical circles had appeared that would passively generate one Crest Mark per minute for any student standing inside them. The passive generation would continue as long as students remained within the circle boundaries.\nA deep frown formed on my face as I processed the implications. Without seeing these circles firsthand, I couldn’t fully understand the tactical situation. If there were many circles available, this could work in our favor given our numerical superiority. However, if only a few circles existed, everyone would be competing desperately for access to them.\nMore concerning was how this development threatened our carefully built advantage. We had been winning decisively through our resource accumulation and strategic elimination of competitors. But now, teams with fewer Crest Marks could potentially catch up or even surpass us by controlling these passive generation points.\nThe special event wasn’t favorable for our position. We had worked to establish a commanding lead, but this new mechanism could level the playing field if we couldn’t secure and defend the circles effectively against multiple competing teams.\n\"We need to move toward that zone immediately,\" I announced, already calculating the time required to reach the designated area and assess the new landscape.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n-----\nKyle’s POV\nWhen the announcement finished, a huge smile erupted across my face. The special event had just changed everything in our favor.\nI had been searching for Adrian’s team for the past several hours without any success. We had discovered an area where people seemed to have been residing recently - probably their former camp - but it was completely abandoned by the time we arrived.\nNow, with this special zone and its passive Crest Mark generation, we had a genuine chance of winning. The playing field had been dramatically leveled, giving teams like ours an opportunity to catch up despite our earlier setbacks.\nI turned to address my remaining team members, who had been growing increasingly demoralized after losing Seraphina and falling behind in the Crest Mark count.\n\"Listen up, everyone!\" I called out with renewed energy. \"This changes everything. Those circles represent our path to victory - we can generate Crest Marks passively just by holding position.\"\nMy teammates looked up with cautious hope beginning to replace their earlier despair.\n\"Adrian’s team may have more Crest Marks now, but that advantage means nothing if we can control those circles for the final hour,\" I continued. \"We have the speed and coordination to reach the zone quickly and establish defensive positions.\"\nThe mood of the group was shifting as they realized the implications. We weren’t out of this competition yet.\n\"March formation!\" I commanded, my voice carrying the authority they needed to hear. \"We’re going to reach that special zone first and claim our victory!\"\nMy team straightened with purpose, their earlier defeat and frustration transforming into focus. The examination wasn’t over - it was just beginning its final, most crucial phase.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "content": "Chapter 123: End of Examination [1]\nArriving at the special zone, I could see that many teams had already gathered in the area. They had either been camping nearby or had started making their way here early, likely because they had lost hope in winning through conventional resource gathering.\nEmmet and several other team members immediately wanted to charge forward and claim circles, but I held up my hand to stop them.\n\"Wait,\" I commanded firmly.\nWe were positioned at a distance that made it difficult for the other teams to clearly see us while still allowing us to observe the tactical situation.\n\"We’re losing Crest Marks every minute we stand here!\" one team member complained urgently. \"We don’t know how many they’ve already generated!\"\n\"Yeah, we should move in now before all the good positions are taken,\" another added with obvious frustration.\nI raised my hand to calm them down. \"Relax. These Crest Marks aren’t going to disappear. We need to be strategic about this.\"\nGesturing toward the chaotic scene unfolding in the special zone. \"We shouldn’t jump in blindly. Even if other teams accumulate Crest Marks from the circles, we can steal them afterward. The important part right now is identifying which individuals are holding the most valuable resources.\"\nMy teammates looked puzzled until I continued explaining my reasoning.\n\"By understanding who’s carrying the accumulated Crest Marks, we can target them directly without even needing to control the circles ourselves. It’s more efficient to let them do the work, then take everything at once.\"\nThe complaints immediately stopped as my team members realized the logic behind this approach. Sometimes patience and observation yielded better results than immediate action.\nElen nodded thoughtfully and added her own observation. \"Besides, if we jump in now, Kyle’s team would most likely unite with the other teams against us. We have the highest Crest Mark count after all - they would naturally focus their efforts on eliminating us first.\"\nI nodded in agreement. This was exactly another crucial reason why charging in blindly would be tactically disastrous.\n\"Right now, we’re the primary target,\" I confirmed. \"Every other team has an incentive to work together against us because we represent their biggest obstacle to victory. If we enter that chaotic situation, we’ll immediately face coordinated opposition from multiple directions.\"\nThe tactical landscape was clear once explained properly. Our current advantage would become a liability the moment we entered the contested zone without proper preparation.\n\"By staying back and observing, we can identify the optimal moment to strike,\" I continued. \"Let them fight each other for position while generating Crest Marks. When the situation stabilizes or when teams start to separate, we can move in with maximum efficiency.\"\nThe patience required was difficult for some team members who preferred direct action, but the benefits were undeniable. Sometimes the best move was waiting for the right opportunity rather than forcing immediate confrontation.\nOur superior numbers and accumulated resources gave us flexibility that other teams lacked. We could afford to be selective about when and how we engaged, while our competitors were forced into desperate gambits to catch up.\nThe battlefield quickly transformed as the lower-ranked classes made a tactical decision to gang up on Kyle’s Elite team. Despite Kyle’s individual strength and his team’s superior power, they found themselves overwhelmed by sheer numbers from multiple classes.\nKyle was caught in a genuine predicament, forced to defend against attacks from several directions simultaneously while trying to maintain control of the valuable circle positions. His team was stretched thin, yet remarkably they had managed to secure approximately half of the available circles through superior positioning and combat effectiveness.\nFrom our concealed observation point, I began analysing how the other teams were managing their accumulated Crest Marks. The pattern became clear relatively quickly - none of the non-Elite teams appeared to be concentrating their resources with a single individual.\n\"Look at how they’re distributing their Crest Marks,\" I pointed out to my team members. \"They’ve clearly adopted the ’don’t put all your eggs in one basket’ approach.\"\nElen followed my gaze and nodded in understanding. \"Each team member is carrying a portion of their total collection. Smart defensive strategy against theft. Once a person is caught, they would only lose a small portion rather than the whole ration, minimises loss. But it’s still not a good strategy.\"\n\"They’re trying to use the same concealment strategy we employed,\" Marcus observed, \"but they’re failing at proper execution.\"\nThe other teams had managed to hide their distribution method from each other during the chaotic fighting, but from our position as outside observers, their patterns were easily readable. Their movements were too predictable, their protective formations too obvious, and their communication too visible.\n\"Watch how that team’s formation shifts when someone approaches their apparent ’decoy’ leader,\" I noted. \"See how three specific members unconsciously move to create a protective triangle? Those are the real Crest Mark carriers.\"\nAnother team displayed even more obvious tells. Their designated leader made exaggerated gestures and loud proclamations about protecting their resources, while three quieter members consistently stayed at the formation’s rear with subtle but noticeable defensive positioning.\n\"Their concealment works against teams actively engaged in combat,\" Elen analysed, \"but anyone with time to observe can identify the patterns.\"\nThe tactical irony was striking. These teams had correctly identified the need for resource distribution but lacked the discipline and training necessary to execute the deception effectively. Their attempts at misdirection created new vulnerabilities that we could exploit.\n\"The green-banner team has their Crest Marks split between the archer, the girl with the staff, and the heavy fighter in the back,\" I catalogued systematically. \"The red-banner team is using their scout, their apparent second-in-command, and someone they’re pretending is injured.\"\nMy team members began following my example, identifying and tracking the actual resource carriers among the various competing groups. The intelligence gathering was proceeding smoothly while the other teams remained focused on their immediate tactical struggles.\n\"This observation phase is proving more valuable than immediate engagement,\" Marcus concluded. \"We’re mapping their entire resource structure without revealing our presence or capabilities.\"\nThe chaotic battle for circle control was providing perfect cover for our reconnaissance mission, setting us up for decisive action when the optimal moment arrived.",

      "content": "Chapter 124: End of Examination [2]\nAfter completing our reconnaissance of the other teams’ Crest Mark distribution patterns, I turned to Elen with specific instructions.\n\"Elen, you need to leave this area and find a secure hiding place. No matter what happens, you are not allowed to show yourself or leave that position. After the examination has passed, you’re permitted to move - but even if you hear my voice telling you to come out before then, don’t do it. Understood?\"\nShe looked confused by the seemingly paranoid instructions but nodded her agreement. \"I understand, but why?\"\nI explained the tactical reasoning to my assembled team. \"With you hidden safely away from the battlefield, we won’t have to worry about losing our accumulated Crest Marks during the fighting. The other teams have been too desperate for additional firepower, or they simply didn’t consider this approach. We don’t need to risk our existing resources while simultaneously fighting for new ones.\"\nThe logic was straightforward, by securing our current advantage, we could focus entirely on offensive operations without defensive concerns.\n\"This way we can steal other teams’ Crest Marks without worrying about ours being taken in return,\" I continued.\nMy team members nodded in understanding, their expressions brightening as they grasped the implications. They began whispering among themselves with obvious approval.\n\"This is a really good plan,\" one of them muttered with satisfaction.\nI turned to Marcus with another specific request. \"Marcus, can you help her find an optimal hiding location while using your earth manipulation talent to create a more natural concealment? Perhaps closing off cave entrances or creating camouflaged shelters?\"\nMarcus nodded without hesitation. His earth-based abilities would allow him to modify terrain features like sealing cave openings or creating underground hideouts that would make Elen’s concealment significantly more effective than simple camouflage.\n\"I can create a temporary earth shelter that blends with the natural rock formations,\" he confirmed.\nThese were all precautionary measures, but I wanted nothing left to chance. Kyle might notice our reduced numbers, or he might be too focused on his current predicament to pay attention. Regardless of whether he detected our strategy, I refused to leave our victory dependent on luck or enemy oversight.\nThe time restriction would prevent any potential shapeshifting or impersonation attempts that might try to trick Elen into revealing herself prematurely.\nAfter watching Elen and Marcus disappear into the forest to establish her hiding position, I turned to address Emmet and the remaining team members with our tactical objectives. Emmet had broken my words last time, and he couldn’t do that again.\n\"Our target is clear - we’re taking Crest Marks from the weaker teams engaged in that chaotic battle. We don’t need to engage with Kyle’s Elite team directly at all,\" I began, gesturing toward the ongoing conflict in the special zone.\nThe team gathered closer to hear the specific operational details.\n\"When the moment is right, we attack the vulnerable teams and take their accumulated Crest Marks. After securing the resources, we immediately withdraw, no one stays to fight prolonged engagements. You all scatter in different directions and regroup at the predetermined rally point.\"\nI paused to ensure everyone understood the strategic reasoning behind this approach.\n\"This creates a tactical dilemma for our opponents. They’ll be forced to choose between pursuing us to recover their stolen Crest Marks or maintaining control of the passive generation circles. Either choice they make works in our favour if we execute this correctly.\"\nEmmet nodded with obvious satisfaction at the direct action plan. \"Hit and run tactics while they’re distracted by their own conflicts.\"\n\"Exactly. The key is speed and coordination. We strike when they’re most vulnerable, take what we need, and disappear before they can mount an effective response. Their desperation for circle control becomes our tactical advantage.\"\nThe plan leveraged our superior mobility and numbers while avoiding unnecessary risks. By targeting the weaker teams first, we could accumulate additional resources while avoiding the strength of Kyle’s group until the optimal moment.\n\"Any questions about the execution?\" I asked, scanning their faces for understanding.\nThey shook their heads, indicating no questions about the plan.\nWith the briefing complete, I took a deep breath and observed the chaotic battlefield below. The fighting had intensified as teams desperately competed for circle control, their formations becoming increasingly disorganized as fatigue and desperation set in.\nI waited for the optimal moment, when the non-Elite teams were most engaged with each other and Kyle’s group was stretched thin defending multiple positions.\nThe moment arrived when two lower-ranked teams launched simultaneous attacks on different flanks of Kyle’s formation, forcing his people to spread their defensive efforts.\nI raised my hand and gave the signal.\nCRASH! THUNDER!\nWe erupted from the tree line like a devastating avalanche, our entire class charging into the melee with overwhelming force. The sound of our assault echoed across the battlefield as dozens of Elite-rank students descended upon the unsuspecting combatants.\nThe reaction was immediate and electric.\nSHOCK!\n\"What the hell?!\" shouted a student from the green-banner team as he spun around to face our charging formation.\n\"Where did they come from?!\" screamed another fighter, his voice cracking with terror as he realized the true scope of what was bearing down on them.\nThe non-Elite teams that had been locked in desperate combat suddenly found themselves facing an entirely new threat - one that dwarfed their previous concerns about circle control.\n\"It’s the second Elite class!\" someone yelled in panic. \"They brought everyone!\"\nCLASH!\nEmmet smashed into the red-banner team’s formation like a battering ram, his strength scattering their defensive line instantly. His target - the injured-looking student who was actually carrying their Crest Marks - tried to flee but found himself surrounded by three of our hunters.\nSCRAMBLE! DESPERATION!\nThe lower-ranked teams’ carefully planned resource distribution became a liability as our coordinated assault targeted their actual carriers. They had no time to adapt their strategy or redistribute their valuable items.\n\"Protect the carriers!\" someone shouted, but the command came too late. Our intelligence gathering had given us decisive advantages that couldn’t be overcome through last-minute adjustments.",

      "content": "Chapter 125: End of Examination [3]\nKYLE’S PERSPECTIVE\nKyle’s head snapped around at the sound of our assault, his eyes widening as he took in the scope of our attack. For a split second, his composed expression cracked completely.\nI could understand his thought process through the expression on his face. He had been waiting for me to show up, but he never expected this plan. He expected us to compete for the circles, but that was too foolish and basic.\n’Robbing people is always easier than making your own.’\nHe had been expecting some kind of move from us, but the timing and scale caught him completely off-guard. Just when he thought he had secured a strong position through the special circles, we had turned the entire battlefield upside down.\n\"Sir! Do we engage them?\" one of his team members called out desperately.\nKyle’s mind raced through the options. His team was already stretched thin holding their circle positions against multiple opponents. Engaging us directly would mean abandoning those valuable resources, but ignoring our assault would allow us to eliminate the other teams entirely.\n\"Hold positions!\" he commanded through gritted teeth. \"Help the other teams defend their crests, if he takes them then they would be guaranteed to win.\"\nThe calculation was brutal but logical. He couldn’t fight a war on multiple fronts, so he chose to preserve what he had rather than risk everything in pursuit of stopping our rampage.\nWithin minutes, our assault had achieved its objectives. The non-Elite teams found themselves completely outmatched, their Crest Mark carriers overwhelmed and their resources seized with ruthless efficiency.\n\"Fall back! Everyone fall back!\" I commanded as we secured the last of the targeted items.\nTrue to the plan, our forces scattered in different directions, making pursuit impossible for the demoralized and scattered opposition. The hit-and-run tactics had worked perfectly, leaving our enemies with an impossible choice between abandoning their hard-won positions or accepting the loss of their accumulated resources.\nThe battlefield fell into stunned silence as the full implications of our assault became clear.\nRealizing that his team was powerless to prevent my forces from plundering the other teams’ accumulated Crest Marks, Kyle immediately shifted to a more aggressive strategy. He turned to address everyone present - including those from the non-Elite classes who had been fighting against him moments earlier.\n\"My team will assist you! You’re going to completely fail this examination at this rate. You must recover what was stolen from you!\"\nThe other classes’ leaders frowned deeply at this proposal. While it was true they risked failing the examination entirely, recovering their previous Crest Mark totals seemed virtually impossible. My team had already scattered in multiple directions, making pursuit a futile exercise that was unlikely to yield any results.\nTheir eyes glinted dangerously as one of the non-Elite team leaders spoke up with sudden realization.\n\"You want us to help you fight them so you can take all the Crest Marks from these circles for yourself, don’t you?\" the leader accused. \"That’s not happening. As long as we maintain more Crest Marks than some of the other teams, we’ll still rank in the top three positions.\"\nThe tactical calculation was ruthlessly pragmatic - they didn’t need to win outright, just avoid being at the absolute bottom.\nThe leader turned away from Kyle to address his fellow non-Elite teams with a cunning proposal. \"Why don’t we steal the Crest Marks from Kyle’s Elite team instead? They stole from us just like the other Elite class did. We can take their accumulated resources and split them among ourselves!\"\nThe suggestion landed with explosive impact. The assembled non-Elite students began chanting and voicing their enthusiastic agreement, their desperation transforming into collective hostility directed at the nearest target - Kyle’s team.\n\"Yeah! They’re vulnerable defending those circles!\"\n\"We outnumber them easily if we work together!\"\n\"Split their Crest Marks between our classes!\"\nThe momentum was building rapidly as the mob mentality took hold. The non-Elite teams had found a new target that was both accessible and justified in their minds.\nKyle stared at the rapidly deteriorating situation in complete shock, his demeanour cracking under the absurdity of what was unfolding.\n\"How could this turn out this way?!\" he exclaimed, unable to comprehend how his attempt at building an alliance had backfired so catastrophically.\nHis strategic gambit to unite the lower-ranked teams against my forces had instead created a coalition against himself. The desperation and resentment he had tried to channel toward us had been redirected at the nearest available Elite-rank target, his own team.\nThe non-Elite students advanced on Kyle’s positions immediately, their previous exhaustion forgotten in favour of this new opportunity.\n\"Don’t let them escape! Keep an eye out on everyone here, one of them must have the crests.\" The leader of the green banner team shouted, as he advanced with his team behind him.\nKyle’s team found themselves facing exactly the coordinated assault they had been trying to organize against us, but with themselves as the victims.\nKyle’s mind raced through increasingly limited options. His team was already stretched thin maintaining their circle positions. Now they faced a unified assault from multiple angry teams who saw them as easier prey than pursuing my scattered forces.\n\"Defensive formation!\" Kyle commanded urgently, realizing that his tactical situation had become genuinely dire.\nThe irony wasn’t lost on him - by trying to manipulate the other teams into serving his interests, he had instead painted a target on his own back. Sometimes attempting to control chaos only created more unpredictable variables.\nI stood at a distance from the unfolding chaos, observing the situation with cold satisfaction. A smirk formed on my face as everything proceeded according to plan. Instead of pursuing my scattered forces, the non-Elite teams had turned their desperation toward the more accessible target - Kyle’s circle positions and accumulated resources. The outcome was even better than I had initially calculated.\n<Time’s up! Everyone stop fighting and please make your way toward the gate!>\nThe Commander’s voice boomed across the examination grounds, bringing the chaotic final hour to an abrupt conclusion.",

      "content": "Chapter 126: Results of Examination\nMy team began returning from their scattered positions upon hearing the announcement, regrouping efficiently as we had agreed on. Elen emerged from her hiding place as well, still safely carrying our accumulated Crest Marks.\nAs we assembled near the designated gate, I could feel the hostile stares from virtually every other team present. We had become public enemy number one, having destroyed multiple teams’ accumulated resources through coordinated theft and tactical manipulation.\nThe resentment was palpable. Students from the lower-ranked classes glared at us with obvious hatred, while Kyle’s team looked exhausted and bitter from their final desperate defense. Even teams we hadn’t directly engaged seemed to view us with suspicion and anger.\nBut none of that mattered. The examination was over, and our approach had secured what appeared to be a commanding victory. The other teams’ feelings about our methods were irrelevant compared to the tangible results we had achieved.\nThe tension remained high as all the surviving teams began the trek back toward the examination’s starting point, where the final tallies would determine our rankings.\n---\nThe Commander gathered all the students at the gate, his imposing presence commanding immediate silence from the exhausted and battle-worn participants.\n\"Before we announce the results, I want you all to reflect on what you’ve learned during this examination,\" he began, his voice carrying authority that made even the most resentful students pay attention.\n\"Survival isn’t just about individual strength. It’s about working with your team, coordinating efforts, and accepting differences even when you fundamentally disagree with your teammates’ approaches.\"\nAs the Commander spoke, I could feel Seraphina’s eyes fixed on me with laser-like intensity. Her gaze never wavered, plastered to my body like glue, but I deliberately avoided returning the look, keeping my attention focused on the Commander’s words.\n\"You’ve learned that leadership requires difficult decisions, that resources must be managed strategically, and that sometimes the most effective approach isn’t the most honourable one,\" the Commander continued. \"Now, let’s see how those lessons translated into results.\"\nThe tension in the assembled crowd became almost unbearable as everyone anticipated the rankings.\n\"Starting with the lower brackets,\" the Commander announced, pulling out a scroll. \"Teams with single-digit Crest Mark accumulation...\"\nHe listed the teams that had struggled throughout the examination, their disappointed faces reflecting their failure to compete effectively. The names droned on as teams with three, five, and seven Crest Marks were acknowledged for their participation.\nHe didn’t explain to them what they did wrong nor did he give them any advice. Their class teachers were meant to do that.\nThe Commander moved through the middle rankings, each announcement met with mixed reactions of relief or disappointment depending on expectations.\nFinally, he reached the moment everyone had been waiting for.\n\"Now for the top three positions,\" the Commander declared, his voice rising. \"In third place, we have the green-banner class with ten Crest Marks!\"\nThe green-banner team erupted in modest celebration - they had avoided complete failure and secured a respectable position despite only securing a measly amount and being outmatched by the Elite classes.\nThe remaining teams held their breath. Only two positions remained, and everyone knew they would go to the Elite classes that had dominated the examination.\n\"In second place,\" the Commander paused for maximum effect, \"with seventy Crest Marks, the Elite class led by Kyle Morrison!\"\nKyle’s jaw tightened imperceptibly, his hands clenching into fists at his sides. Seventy Crest Marks represented substantial effort and fighting, but second place stung like a needle. His team had fought desperately, lost Seraphina, endured multiple attacks from other classes, and still fallen short.\nThe number hung in the air like an accusation. Seventy wasn’t bad - it was actually impressive given the circumstances, but it meant they had been beaten decisively.\n\"And finally, in first place,\" the Commander’s voice boomed across the assembly, \"the Elite class led by Adrian Blackwood with one hundred and twenty Crest Marks!\"\nThe announcement hit like a thunderclap. One hundred and twenty Crest Marks, nearly double Kyle’s total.\nMy team erupted in celebration, shouting and embracing each other with unrestrained joy. Elen was practically glowing with excitement, while even the more reserved members couldn’t suppress their triumphant grins.\nElen threw herself at me, hugging me tightly in joy that she couldn’t contain. I paused for a moment before hugging her back with one hand. Returning the hug but still being respectful and dignified.\nThe other teams’ reactions ranged from shock to bitter resentment. The gap was overwhelming, we hadn’t just won, we had dominated with such superiority that it bordered on humiliation for everyone else.\n\"Congratulations on passing and excelling in this examination,\" the Commander announced with genuine approval. \"Your reward will be one hundred thousand points each!\"\nKyle stood perfectly still, his expression controlled but his eyes betraying the storm of emotions beneath. One hundred and twenty versus seventy, the gap was insurmountable and undeniable.\nInstructor Victor Castellane approached Kyle and placed a reassuring hand on his shoulder, offering a soft smile that carried both sympathy and pride. \"Don’t worry about it kyle,\" Victor said quietly. \"You fought well with the resources you had.\"\nKyle nodded stiffly, accepting the consolation while his mind already raced through everything he could have done differently to avoid this result. The Phoenix bloodline user had been outmaneuvered by his greatest rival.\nIt was a jab straight to Kyle’s pride. To be outsmarted, and outperformed by his rival stung deeply.\nDespite being eliminated from the examination, Seraphina wore a calm expression on her face as she watched the results unfold. She never fully showed her emotions out in public, always keeping it to herself, private.\nShe understood exactly what Adrian had accomplished. The person that she had decided to break up with because of his incompetence had not only removed her from the examination with his own hands, by knocking her out. He had also defeated her team mercilessly.\nShe felt pathetic, and for a moment she had almost let her emotions rage.\nThe examination had revealed a new power dynamic among the Elite students, and everyone in Adrian’s class understood that Adrian Blackwood was the main reason behind their win.",

Victor led them away from the gate area, creating distance from the celebrating victors.\nOnce they were out of immediate earshot, Victor stopped and turned to face his students. His expression was stern but not entirely disappointed.\n\"Listen carefully,\" he began. \"Second place means you performed better than every other class except one. That’s not failure, that’s excellence against extraordinary circumstances.\"\n\"But we lost Seraphina early,\" one student protested. \"If she had stayed—\"\n\"If, if, if,\" Victor interrupted sharply. \"Combat doesn’t care about your excuses.

You adapted and still secured second place.\"\nI remained silent, absorbing my instructor’s words while my mind continued analysing where my strategy had faltered and where I had been out performed by Adrian.\n\"The Blackwood heir demonstrated his superior planning and strength, he didn’t even need to use his power much. Unlike Kyle who had to fight multiple students to secure your spot,\" Victor continued bluntly. \"Still, that doesn’t entirely diminish your efforts. It means you’ve identified a competitor who requires different approaches. You did not plan well, and you need to learn from that.\"\nHe looked directly at me. \"You have a powerful bloodline, heritage with immense potential. But bloodlines alone don’t guarantee victory. Strategy, preparation, and adaptability matter just as much as raw power. You saw that with Adrian, despite being strong, he didn’t need to use his strength.\"\nI nodded slowly in agreement. \"Understood, sir.\"\n\"Good. Now let’s return to campus and begin analysing what we can improve for next time.\" Victor gestured for them to continue walking. \"This examination was just one battle. The war is far from over.\"\n-----\nSylvia’s Class.\nInstructor Sylvia gathered our victorious class with considerably more enthusiasm than Victor had displayed, though her professional composure remained intact.\n\"Follow me back to our classroom,\" she announced. \"We have matters to discuss before you’re dismissed for the day.\"\nThe walk back was filled with excited chatter among my classmates, the adrenaline from our victory still running high. Elen kept glancing at the total point rewards we would receive, practically glowing with satisfaction.\nOnce we reached our designated classroom, Sylvia waited for everyone to settle into their seats before addressing us directly.\n\"Congratulations on your performance,\" she began, her tone carrying genuine approval. \"One hundred and twenty Crest Marks represents exceptional strategic coordination and execution. You should be proud of what you accomplished.\"\nThe class erupted in renewed cheers and applause, students exchanging high-fives and congratulatory gestures.\nSylvia raised her hand for silence. \"However, I need you all to listen very carefully to what I’m about to say.\"\nThe celebration quieted as her serious tone registered.\n\"Do not get complacent, This was one examination. Yes, you dominated. Yes, you earned substantial rewards. But the moment you start believing you’re invincible is the moment you become vulnerable.\" she stated firmly.\nShe paced across the front of the classroom, making eye contact with various students.\n\"Kyle Morrison’s team earned seventy Crest Marks despite losing one of their strongest members early and facing coordinated attacks throughout the examination. That’s not weakness - that’s resilience and capability that you need to respect.\"\nEmmet shifted in his seat, clearly still brooding over his personal defeat against Seraphina.\n\"The other classes will study the strength you have shown in the examination,\" Sylvia continued. \"They’ll adapt their strategies specifically to counter your approaches and bloodline strength. Your success today has painted a target on all of you for every future competition.\"\nElen nodded thoughtfully. \"So we need to continue evolving our methods.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Sylvia confirmed. \"Adrian demonstrated excellent leadership and planning during this examination. But leadership also means maintaining your team’s focus and preventing arrogance from undermining future performance.\"\nShe looked directly at me when she said this.\n\"The hundred thousand points each of you earned are substantial resources,\" Sylvia explained. She did not dive deeper into the usage of these points.\n\"What about the swap card?\" someone asked. \"Does that mean we’re safe from being replaced?\"\n\"For now,\" Sylvia answered. \"But the academy holds multiple examinations throughout the year. Every one represents an opportunity for ambitious students to challenge your positions. Elite class membership must be continuously earned.\"\n\"I’m not trying to diminish your achievement,\" Sylvia clarified. \"You performed exceptionally well. I’m ensuring you understand that excellence requires sustained effort, not just occasional brilliance.\"\nElen raised her hand. \"How do we prevent complacency while still celebrating our victories?\"\n\"Good question,\" Sylvia acknowledged. \"Celebrate tonight. Tomorrow, begin analyzing what you could have done better. Every victory contains lessons about your weaknesses if you’re willing to examine them honestly.\"\nShe pulled out a stack of papers. \"I’ll be distributing detailed performance evaluations for each of you by tomorrow. These will identify your individual strengths and areas requiring improvement based on my observations.\nThis leads to your question about the swap card, since you guys have won the competition, the one with the most contribution to the team will be the one to gain the card. The swap card will be handed out tomorrow.\"\nMarcus spoke up. \"What’s our next major challenge?\"\n\"Various smaller personal assessments over the coming weeks,\" Sylvia replied. \"Then another team-based examination approximately two weeks from now. Different format, different objectives, different opportunities to prove yourselves.\"\nShe returned to her desk and sat down, her expression softening slightly.\n\"I am genuinely proud of your performance,\" she said. \"You worked together effectively, adapted to changing circumstances, and achieved decisive victory. But pride must be balanced with humility and continued dedication to improvement.\"\n\"Understood, instructor,\" several voices replied in unison.\n\"You’re dismissed,\" Sylvia announced. \"Enjoy your victory tonight, but return tomorrow ready to continue your development. The path to true greatness requires consistency, not just occasional excellence.\"\nAs we filed out of the classroom, the atmosphere had shifted from pure celebration to something more measured and focused. Sylvia’s words had provided necessary perspective without completely dampening our satisfaction at the victory.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nAfter class ended, Elen filed out of the classroom, trailing behind me with obvious excitement radiating from her entire demeanor. Her eyes practically sparkled as she calculated her accumulated wealth.\n\"I’ve barely used the 200,000 points I started with, so coupled with these new rewards, I nearly have 300,000 points now! I’m so excited - I’m definitely going to have to splurge some of those points.\"\nI laughed at her enthusiasm. \"Just don’t get too absorbed in spending. There are countless things that can deplete your points faster than you’d expect. Training facilities, specialized equipment, rare materials, supplies - the academy is designed to make those points disappear quickly if you’re not careful.\"\nShe nodded her head, though her excited expression suggested she was already mentally planning her purchases. \"I know, I know. But surely I can treat myself to at least a few nice things after this victory?\"\n\"Of course,\" I agreed. \"Just maintain some balance. You saw how expensive those blacksmithing and alchemy rooms were - a thousand points for just two hours. Those costs add up faster than you think when you’re trying to improve your skills seriously.\"\n\"You’re right,\" she admitted. \"Maybe I’ll limit myself to one or two purchases and save the rest for actual development needs.\"\nAs we walked through the academy corridors, other students were already discussing their point rewards and making elaborate plans for how to spend their newfound wealth.\nAfter spending some time together, I tried to leave, but Elen grabbed my arm and dragged me along with her toward the academy’s mall.\n\"Come on! You need blacksmithing materials too, right? We can go together,\" she insisted with infectious enthusiasm.\nIn the end, I decided to accompany her since I could use some additional blacksmithing supplies. A few hundred points wouldn’t significantly impact my reserves, and having more quality materials didn’t hurt, I still had alot of crossbows to experiment on.\nThe equipment exchange was bustling with students who had just completed the examination. Everyone seemed eager to convert their newly acquired points into tangible improvements for their capabilities.\nElen immediately gravitated toward the alchemy section, her eyes scanning the shelves filled with rare herbs, essences, and specialized equipment. I could see her mentally calculating which purchases would provide the best value for her point investment.\n\"Look at these purification crystals,\" she said excitedly. \"They’re only three hundred points and would significantly improve my potion quality.\"\nI moved toward the blacksmithing materials section while she continued browsing. The selection was impressive - various grades of metal ingots, specialized tools, enhancement catalysts, and crafting supplements that could improve success rates for complex projects.\nMy eyes landed on a set of hammers designed for detailed metalwork. They would be particularly useful for the components required in my more ambitious projects. The price was reasonable at six hundred points.\nThey were certainly better than the ones found in the training room. Not that those were terrible, but better always existed.\n\"Finding anything good?\" Elen called over from her section.\n\"A few things worth considering,\" I replied, continuing to evaluate my options while being mindful not to overspend on impulse purchases.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "content": "Chapter 128: New Item Created [1]\nAfter shopping with Elen, I excused myself from her company. This time she didn’t insist on continuing together, letting me go without resistance. After bidding her goodbye, I made my way out of the mall and found a secluded area away from potential eavesdroppers.\nI retrieved my communication crystal and channeled mana into it, establishing a connection with my guards outside the academy. The examination’s communication restrictions had been lifted now that the event was officially concluded, so I could finally check on the situation I’d left unresolved.\nThe crystal warmed in my hand as the connection established. After several moments, Lex’s familiar voice came through clearly.\n\"Young master Adrian,\" he greeted respectfully. \"We’ve been waiting for your contact.\"\n\"Report,\" I said directly. \"What happened with Kojiro’s advancement attempt?\"\nThere was a brief pause before Lex responded, and I could hear the weight in his voice. \"The hunt was successful. Kojiro managed to locate and engage a Transcendent-rank beast, a crystal-backed bear that had been terrorizing merchant caravans in the outer territories.\"\nI waited for him to continue, sensing there was more to the story.\n\"The battle lasted nearly two hours,\" Lex continued. \"Kojiro fought with exceptional skill, but the beast was formidable. Lux and I maintained our positions as you instructed, only intervening when the situation became genuinely life-threatening.\"\n\"Did he break through?\" I asked, getting to the critical question.\n\"Yes, young master,\" Lex confirmed. \"After delivering the killing blow, Kojiro successfully advanced to Transcendent rank. His aura transformation was remarkable - the enhancement items from you clearly provided the foundation he needed to bridge that final gap.\"\nRelief washed over me. Having three Transcendent-rank guards significantly improved our defensive capabilities for whatever challenges lay ahead.\n\"How is his condition now?\"\n\"Recovering but stable. The advancement process was taxing, and he sustained several injuries during the prolonged combat. We’ve secured him in a safe location for recuperation.\"\nI wasn’t surprised by the news. Just because Kojiro had successfully advanced didn’t mean he was in optimal condition. Breaking through to Transcendent rank while simultaneously fighting a formidable opponent would naturally leave him injured and depleted.\n\"What about the assassins? Did you encounter any during the hunt?\" I asked.\n\"No sight of them, young master,\" Lex replied. \"We maintained vigilance throughout the operation, but there were no signs of hostile surveillance or attack attempts.\"\nA frown formed on my face as I processed this information. It seemed the enemy organization was laying low since their last failed ambush attempt on me. They were most likely recovering from their losses and preparing to deploy even greater strength for their next attempt. The silence was more concerning than active aggression in some ways - it meant they were planning something more dangerous.\n\"Where are you located now?\" I asked.\n\"We’re resting in a secure cave system approximately fifteen kilometres northeast of the city. We’re waiting for Kojiro’s injuries to stabilize sufficiently before attempting to move to a more permanent location.\"\n\"Alright, maintain maximum caution. Tell me immediately if anything unusual occurs or if you detect any threats. Is that understood?\"\n\"Yes, young master,\" Lex confirmed with military precision. \"We’ll report any developments immediately.\"\nI terminated the connection and secured the crystal back in my storage. Having Kojiro successfully reach Transcendent rank was excellent news for our defensive capabilities, but the continued silence from our enemies suggested they were preparing something significant. I would need to remain vigilant and continue strengthening myself and my allies for whatever was coming.\nAfter concluding my conversation with Lex, I decided to book a training room to practice my bloodline traits. If I wanted to see improvement, it required dedicated time and focus.\nTwo hours passed, costing me a thousand points. Unfortunately, none of my traits leveled up during the practice session despite my focused efforts. Progress at higher levels required exponentially more work than the initial breakthroughs. But, that didn’t mean I didn’t progress somewhere else.\nI had trained my newly acquired royal-rank secret art and was able to progress further. I was around 30% into the first stance, and my speed was 3% faster than without the secret art. Once I master the first form, I would be able to increase my natural speed by 10%.\nAfter finishing, I made my way to the blacksmithing facilities and booked another two-hour session. I planned to practice my crafting skills and experiment with a creative project I’d been considering. Even though I had received Tier 1 blacksmith knowledge from the daily reward system, practical experience still refined my abilities and intuition with materials.\nDuring those two hours, I worked on creating something novel for this world - a skateboard powered by magic crystals. The concept was straightforward enough that it didn’t require complex enchantments or advanced materials. Since it served purely as convenient transportation rather than combat applications, the item requirements remained minimal.\nThe design used a simple board constructed from lightweight materials reinforced with thin metal plating. The key innovation was the propulsion system - embedded magic crystals that converted the user’s mana into kinetic force. The control mechanism responded directly to the rider’s mana flow, allowing intuitive acceleration and deceleration.\nAfter completing the construction, I stepped onto the finished product to test its functionality. The moment my feet made contact with the board’s surface, I felt it respond to my ambient mana signature. The enchantments activated smoothly, requiring surprisingly little mana input to generate movement.\nI channelled a small amount of energy into the board and felt it begin gliding forward with remarkable smoothness. The mana consumption was negligible, even at higher speeds, my natural regeneration exceeded the expenditure rate. This meant I could theoretically ride indefinitely without depleting my reserves.\nInside the confined training room, I could only test basic manoeuvrability, but the responsiveness was excellent. The board turned smoothly in response to weight shifts and mana direction, making control intuitive even for a first-time user.\nEager to test its full capabilities, I left the academy grounds and found an empty stretch of road where I could safely accelerate without bumping into pedestrians.",

      "content": "Chapter 129: New Item Created [2]\nI channelled more mana into the propulsion system and felt the board surge forward with exhilarating speed. The wind whipped past my face as I leaned into the acceleration, testing the upper limits of what the enchantments could sustain.\nAfter several passes, I estimated the maximum speed at approximately 40 miles per hour - decent performance for what was essentially a convenience item rather than serious transportation. The speed wasn’t suitable for long-distance travel compared to carriages, but for navigating around the academy or city, it was perfect.\nPeople along the roadside stopped and stared as I passed by, their expressions ranging from confusion to outright bewilderment. Several pointed and spoke in hushed tones to their companions, clearly having never witnessed such a device before.\n\"What is that thing?\" I heard someone exclaim.\n\"Is he... floating? No, there’s a board underneath him!\"\n\"How is it moving without any visible mechanism?\"\nAn elderly merchant actually dropped the crate he was carrying, his mouth hanging open as I zoomed past his shop. A group of academy students I didn’t recognize simply stood frozen, trying to comprehend what they were witnessing.\nThe reaction was understandable - this world had various transportation methods, but the concept of a personal, mana-powered board was completely novel. Most magical vehicles required significant infrastructure, expensive enchantments, or were restricted to wealthy individuals.\nI had just created something democratically accessible that could be mass-produced at relatively low cost. Any awakener with basic mana control could use it effectively.\nThe implications were staggering. This single invention could revolutionize urban transportation, particularly for younger awakeners who couldn’t yet afford traditional magical conveyances. The academy alone would provide an enormous market of potential customers.\nI circled back toward the academy entrance, drawing continued stares from bewildered onlookers. Several students were now actively chasing after me, shouting questions about the device.\n\"Where did you get that?\"\n\"Is that custom made?\"\nA satisfied smile crossed my face as I smoothly decelerated and stepped off the board near the academy gates. I had just demonstrated something this world had never seen before - a practical, efficient, and accessible form of personal transportation that would change how people moved through their daily lives.\nThe blacksmithing session had cost a thousand points, but the potential return on this invention was incalculable. Sometimes the most valuable innovations weren’t weapons or armor, but simple solutions to everyday problems that nobody had thought to address.\nI wasn’t worried about the invention being stolen in terms of credit or design. There were several layers of protection working in my favour.\nFirst, it wasn’t remotely simple to replicate something like this. Creating a functional mana-powered skateboard required understanding principles that didn’t exist in this world’s current knowledge base. It was easy for me because I had used skateboards extensively in my previous life and understood the mechanics, balance points, and design philosophy. But someone hearing about it for the first time would struggle to reverse-engineer the enchantment arrays, material ratios, and control mechanisms without that foundational understanding.\nEven with my Tier 1 blacksmithing skills, the project had required careful planning and multiple iterations to get right. Someone attempting to copy it from brief observation would likely produce inferior or non-functional versions.\nThe second reason was more direct - if anyone dared to try stealing my invention and claiming it as their own, my family would demonstrate the consequences. The benefits of being part of a ducal household were substantial, and I appreciated them immensely. The Blackwood name carried weight that discouraged most forms of intellectual theft or patent infringement.\nI didn’t need to hide my inventions’ capabilities or pretend to be weaker than I was. Sure, I concealed certain things - my vampire bloodline, my most powerful techniques, my knowledge of future events - but those were for genuine safety reasons rather than fear of competition.\nThe principle was simple: never show all your cards to anyone. Always keep hidden aces in reserve. But that didn’t mean living in constant paranoia about every innovation or achievement.\nThe skateboard was a relatively minor invention in the grand scheme of things. It would generate income and attention, but it wasn’t a game-changing weapon or technique that enemies could use against me. The strategic value was in the economic and status opportunity it represented rather than any direct combat application.\nI secured the board and made my way back toward the academy, already considering what other concepts from Earth might translate profitably into this world’s magical framework.\nArriving back at my dormitory, I decided to contact my father to check on Kael’s progress and discuss some business matters.\nThe crystal connected after a moment, and my father’s familiar voice came through clearly.\n\"Adrian, good timing. I was wondering when you’d check in about the examination results.\"\n\"We won,\" I reported simply. \"First place with a good lead over the second-place team.\"\nMy father’s proud laughter boomed through the crystal, the sound of a father genuinely pleased with his son’s accomplishments. \"Excellent work! I knew you’d excel once you put your mind to it. Your strategic mind is finally showing itself.\"\nI could hear my mother’s voice in the background before she apparently took the crystal from my father. \"Adrian! I just heard the news. We’re both so proud of you, darling. When you come back home I will cook you, your favourite meal!\"\nMy mouth twitched at the meal proposition but I didn’t voice it out.\n\"Thank you, Mother,\" I replied, appreciating their genuine enthusiasm despite this being only one relatively minor achievement in the grand scheme of things.\nMy father reclaimed the crystal. \"Now, what else did you want to discuss? I know that tone - you have something on your mind.\"\n\"Two things. First, how is Kael’s progress?\" I asked.\n\"Remarkable, actually,\" my father responded with satisfaction. \"The boy’s physical transformation has calmed down now that he’s receiving proper nutrition and training. His awakened abilities are developing well, and he’s been working with our combat instructors daily. More importantly, his determination is exceptional. You made an excellent choice bringing him into the family.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 130: New Daily Reward: Hint\nAfter ending the communication with my father, I felt the familiar notification pulse in my consciousness.\n[Daily Login Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your daily reward?]\nI pressed yes without hesitation, curious about what today would bring after the recent string of useful items.\n[Congratulations! You have received: Book of Hints]\nA leather-bound book materialized in my hands, its cover unmarked except for a simple title embossed in silver: \"Hint.\" The weight felt substantial, and I could sense faint magical energy emanating from its pages.\nI opened it carefully, unsure what to expect. The first page was blank, but as I focused my attention on it, words began appearing in flowing script:\nThis book will provide one hint about imminent dangers facing those connected to the bearer. The hint will only appear when threats are immediate and significant.\nMy heart rate increased as I turned to the next page. More text materialized, and what I read made my blood run cold.\n[Duke Marcus Blackwood has been ordered by King Aldric to eliminate the monster threat that has seized control of Thornhaven, a town within the Blackwood duchy. Intelligence reports indicate a Commander-rank beast leads the force, supported by dozens of Transcendent-rank creatures. The King will provide some support - three Transcendent guards and dozens of elite-rank guards as supplementary forces.\n[Probability of Duke Marcus Blackwood’s survival: 5%]\nI stared at the page in complete shock, my hands trembling slightly as I processed the information. My father was being sent on what amounted to a suicide mission, and he hadn’t mentioned a single word about it during our conversation mere minutes ago.\nWhy hadn’t he told me? The answer came immediately, he didn’t want me to worry. He was trying to protect me from the burden of knowledge about dangers I couldn’t influence from the academy.\nBut that was unacceptable. I wasn’t the same helpless person he thought I was anymore.\nMy mind raced through potential solutions. Could I stop him from going? Unlikely - refusing a direct royal command would be treason that could destroy our entire family. Could I accompany him? The academy would never permit it, and my Transcendent-rank strength would be useless against Commander-level threats anyway.\nThen it hit me, I could give him better tools to survive.\nThe Royal-rank secret art I had just obtained from the shrine. The footwork technique that increased agility by ten percent even at the first stance, with presumably even greater benefits at higher levels. If my father could master even the basic forms before departing, it might provide the edge he needed to survive.\nI grabbed my communication crystal and immediately contacted the carriage.\n\"This is Adrian Blackwood. I need immediate transportation to the Blackwood estate. Emergency priority.\"\n\"Young master, we can have a carriage at the academy gates within five minutes,\" came the swift response.\n\"Make it less,\" I commanded, already moving toward my dormitory to gather essential items.\nAs I packed, my thoughts continued racing. The communication crystal wouldn’t work for this conversation - my father would simply order me to stay at the academy and not worry. I needed to confront him in person where he couldn’t dismiss my concerns so easily.\nI contacted Lex and Lux through my crystal while rushing toward the academy gates.\n\"Young master?\" Lex’s voice came through immediately.\n\"Drop everything and return to the estate immediately. I’m on my way there now. This is urgent,\" I commanded.\n\"We’ve just arrived at the city outskirts with Kojiro,\" Lex reported. \"Is something wrong?\"\n\"My father’s been given a mission that’s essentially a death sentence. I need you both at the estate as soon as possible.\"\n\"Understood. We’ll head there immediately, young master.\"\nThe carriage arrived at the gates exactly twenty minutes later. I climbed in and commanded maximum speed. The driver nodded and urged the elite-rank beasts forward at a punishing pace.\nDuring the two-hour journey, I couldn’t stop my mind from analyzing every possible angle. The Royal-rank secret art was valuable beyond measure - something I had risked my life to obtain and planned to use for my own advancement. Giving it to my father meant delaying my own progress significantly.\nThe typhoon pendant Kojiro was carrying - I’d need that too. A rare-rank item with offensive capabilities would provide my father with additional tactical options during combat. Every advantage mattered when facing such overwhelming odds.\nI pulled out the Book of Hints again, hoping for additional information that might help. New text appeared:\nThe attack on Thornhaven will occur in approximately one week. Duke Marcus Blackwood plans to depart in five days to assess the situation and prepare defensive strategies. Time is limited for preparation.\nFive days. That gave my father barely any time to train with new techniques or equipment. But it was better than nothing.\nThe carriage finally reached the Blackwood estate as the sun was setting. I could see Lex, Lux, and Kojiro waiting near the entrance, having arrived shortly before me. They were near the forest, so they were closer to the estate than I was.\nI stepped down and immediately approached them. Kojiro looked different - his aura had transformed completely, radiating the power of a Transcendent-rank warrior. Under different circumstances, I would have celebrated this achievement enthusiastically. Having a transcendent rank body guard that materialise out of thin air, nobody had such privileges.\n\"Kojiro, congratulations on your advancement,\" I said quickly. \"But I need the typhoon pendant back immediately. It’s an emergency.\"\nHe didn’t hesitate, removing the rare-rank item and handing it over. \"Of course, my lord.\"\nA smile formed on my face at his words. It seemed like Kojiro was no longer reluctant in calling my lord after his advancement. He had been convinced that working under me was good for him.\nLex stepped forward with concern evident in his expression. \"Young master, what’s happening? You said the duke is in danger?\"\n\"The King has ordered him to eliminate a Commander-rank beast leading an army of Transcendent monsters. The mission is almost impossible to complete, with minimal support, overwhelming opposition, and possible political enemies orchestrating his death.\"\nBoth guards’ faces went pale. They understood the implications immediately.\n\"We need to speak with Duke Blackwood urgently,\" Lux said.\nI nodded grimly and strode toward the estate entrance, my newly acquired Transcendent guards flanking me. My father wasn’t going to like this conversation, but I was done accepting situations I could potentially change.\nThe survival rate might be only five percent, but I was going to do everything in my power to improve those odds, even if it meant sacrificing advantages I’d worked hard to obtain.\nI pushed open the heavy oak doors of the estate’s main dining hall, my hurried footsteps echoing against the marble floors. The scene before me was one of domestic tranquility that felt jarringly at odds with the urgency burning in my chest.\nMy father sat at the head of the long table, my mother to his right, and Kael - looking healthier and more robust than when I’d last seen him - seated across from her. They were in the middle of their evening meal, engaged in quiet conversation.\nAll three heads turned toward me simultaneously, their expressions shifting to shock.\n\"Adrian?\" My mother stood up immediately, concern flooding her features. \"What are you doing here? You didn’t tell us you were coming.\"\nMy father’s eyes narrowed slightly, his mind already assessing my unexpected arrival and reading the tension in my posture. \"Son, is something wrong?\"\nI forced myself to take a calming breath and walked toward the table with measured steps. \"Please, continue eating. I’ve already ate, I’m not hungry, I would like to speak to father about something after.\"\n\"But Adrian—\" my mother began.\n\"After dinner, Mother,\" I said firmly but gently. \"There’s no immediate emergency that can’t wait another twenty minutes.\"\nMy father studied me for a long moment before nodding slowly. \"Very well. Take a seat.\"\nA servant quickly set a place for me, and I sat down, not tasting the food that was placed before me. The conversation around the table had become stilted and cautious, everyone aware that something significant had prompted my unannounced visit.\nKael kept glancing at me with curious concern, clearly sensing the tension but wisely remaining quiet. The physical transformation in him was remarkable - he’d gained healthy weight, his posture was more confident, and there was a sharpness in his eyes that spoke of regular training.\nThe meal stretched on interminably, each minute feeling like an hour as I rehearsed what I needed to say. My father maintained his composure, though I could see the questions in his eyes every time our gazes met.\nFinally, the plates were cleared and the servants withdrew.\nBefore my mother could speak, I addressed my father directly. \"Father, I need to speak with you. Privately.\"\nHis expression remained neutral, \"Let’s go to my study.\"\nWe both stood, and my mother reached out to touch my arm. \"Adrian, please tell me everything is alright.\"\n\"I will, Mother. Just... let me speak with Father first.\"",

The warm father from dinner had been replaced by the calculating Duke who commanded armies.\n\"Speak,\" he said simply.\n\"I know about your trip,\" I stated directly.\nMy father’s expression remained carefully neutral. \"I don’t know what you’re referring to. I have various duties throughout the duchy—\"\n\"Father, please. I know the King has ordered you to eliminate the monster threat that’s taken control of the town. I know about the Transcendent forces you have to fight against.\"\nHis composure cracked, shock flooding his features. \"How could you possibly know that? Royal orders are classified at the highest level. There’s no way that information could have leaked to the academy.\"\n\"How I found out doesn’t matter,\" I said, refusing to explain the Book of Hints. \"What matters is that you’re walking into a death trap.\"\nMy father’s expression hardened. \"Adrian, this is not your concern—\"\n\"Do you know the full extent of the threats?\" I interrupted.\nHe paused before answering carefully. \"The King’s intelligence reports indicate numerous Transcendent-rank creatures. With the three guards he’s providing as backup and our own troops, it should be manageable.\"\nI frowned deeply. \"And what if there are Commander-level beings that the reports don’t mention? What if the intelligence is deliberately incomplete?\"\nMy father’s jaw tightened, and he nodded slowly. \"It’s a possibility I’ve considered. But I must fulfill my duty regardless. Refusing a direct royal command would bring consequences far worse than the risks of this mission.\"\nWithout another word, I reached up and removed the Typhoon Pendant from around my neck, placing it on his desk.\nMy father stared at the rare-rank artifact in complete shock. \"Adrian... where did you get this? I paid an enormous sum to commission that rare-rank sword for you, yet somehow you’ve acquired a rare pendant as well?\"\nHe didn’t ask for details about its origins, clearly understanding that I wouldn’t reveal such information easily. He reached for the pendant to return it. \"I can’t accept this. You need protection at the academy—\"\n\"I refuse,\" I said firmly, pushing it back toward him. \"You need every advantage you can get. This pendant has offensive capabilities that could save your life in critical moments.\"\nMy father looked at the artifact, then at me, conflict evident in his eyes between paternal concern and tactical necessity.\n---\nAfter he reluctantly accepted the Typhoon Pendant, I didn’t stop there. I reached into my storage ring and withdrew the Royal-rank secret art manual, placing it deliberately on the desk beside the pendant.\nMy father’s eyes widened as he immediately recognized what he was looking at. His shock was unmistakable - he understood exactly how incredible this item was, how rare and valuable Royal-rank techniques were in the entire kingdom. The fact stood that my father didn’t have one, and he was a commander-level warrior.\n\"Adrian... this is...\" He picked up the manual with trembling hands, examining the authentic markings that confirmed its rank. \"Where did you get this?\"\n\"From the examination. There was a hidden shrine that contained it as a reward for completing the trials,\" I explained simply.\nMy father immediately tried to hand it back. \"No. Absolutely not. This is yours - you earned it through your own efforts. You need this for your development.\"\n\"You can return it to me when you’re done with the mission,\" I countered, pushing it back toward him.\n\"Adrian, I can’t—\"\n\"Father, listen to me,\" I interrupted, my voice carrying more intensity. \"You’ve been stalled at the peak of commander rank for years. I know you’ve been searching for an opportunity to break through to Royal rank but haven’t found the right catalyst. This might be exactly what you need.\"\nHis expression showed conflict between duty to himself and responsibility to his son. \"You need this technique. It will help you grow stronger much faster. You’re still only at Elite rank - I won’t steal opportunities from your future.\"\n\"And what good is my future if you’re dead?\" I shot back. \"This mission has a ninety-five percent mortality rate based on the intelligence I’ve gathered. You need every possible advantage.\"\n\"Where did you get that number?\" he demanded.\n\"My sources are reliable. Father, please. Take the manual.\"\nHe stared at me for a long moment before shaking his head firmly. \"No. A father doesn’t take from his son’s future to preserve his own life. That’s not how this works.\"\nThe stubbornness in his voice told me that rational arguments weren’t going to work. He was too principled, too concerned with being a proper father to accept what he viewed as stealing my opportunities.\nI sighed deeply, recognizing there was only one way to convince him. \"Then we settle this the Blackwood way. I will show you that i’m not the same Adrian you always knew, father...I have a mythical-rank bloodline.\"\nMy father’s eyebrows rose but he accepted it, not thinking much of my words.\n\"I’m aware of the difference. But if I can prove that I’m capable enough to not need these items immediately, will you accept them?\"\nHe studied my face carefully, searching for something. Finally, he sighed heavily. \"Fine. If you can demonstrate sufficient capability in combat, I’ll accept your gifts. But understand, I won’t hold back completely just because you’re my son.\"\n\"I wouldn’t want you to,\" I replied.\nWe left the study and made our way to the estate’s personal training area - a large enclosed space designed specifically for high-rank combatants to practice without damaging property or endangering servants. The reinforced walls could withstand attacks up to Royal rank, and privacy enchantments prevented observation from outside.\nMy mother appeared in the doorway as we entered. \"What’s going on? Marcus, why are you both heading to the training area at this hour?\"\n\"A small matter between father and son,\" my father said calmly. \"Nothing to worry about, dear.\"\nShe looked between us sceptically but nodded. \"Don’t hurt each other too badly.\"\nOnce the doors closed behind us, my father moved to the centre of the training area and drew a training sword.\nI drew my own sword, channelling my Blood Enhancement immediately. The crimson aura surrounded my blade as I prepared to face the strongest opponent I’d ever confronted.\n\"Rules?\" I asked.\n\"First significant injury or surrender ends the match,\" my father stated. \"I’ll suppress my power to early Transcendent level, but my technique and experience remain unchanged.\"\n\"That’s acceptable.\"\nWe settled into ready stances, the air between us crackling with tension. My father’s eyes carried the calculation of a seasoned warrior who had fought in countless battles, while I relied on my enhanced abilities and unconventional techniques.\n\"Begin,\" he announced, and launched himself forward with speed that made my previous opponents look sluggish by comparison.\nCLASH! STEEL ON STEEL!\nMy father’s blade descended with devastating precision, targeting my shoulder in what should have been a fight-ending strike. I barely managed to parry, the impact sending shockwaves through my arms despite my blood-strengthened muscles.\nScrape! Sparks!\nHe immediately followed with a horizontal slash that forced me to twist away. His footwork was flawless - decades of combat experience evident in every movement. Even suppressed to early Transcendent level, his technique was overwhelming.\nWhoosh! Dodge!\nI activated my enhanced reflexes fully, channelling blood enhancement through my entire body. My perception of time slowed slightly as adrenaline and supernatural power flooded my system. His next strike came fast, but I could track it now.\nCLANG! Counter!\nI deflected his thrust and attempted a riposte toward his midsection. My father’s eyes widened fractionally - my speed had increased beyond what he’d anticipated from an Elite-rank opponent.\nBlock! Slide!\nHe parried my counterattack effortlessly, but I could see the calculation in his expression shifting. He was reassessing my capabilities in real-time.\n\"Impressive enhancement,\" he acknowledged, pressing forward with renewed intensity.\nSlash! Slash! Thrust!\nA three-strike combination came at me with brutal power. I enhanced my sword simultaneously with my body, the crimson aura strengthening the blade’s cutting power as I met his attacks.\nCLASH! CRACK! RING!\nMy sword clashed against his, sparks flying as steel met steel.\nLeap! Distance!\nI created space and activated my Stone Armor Echo. The familiar protective coating spread across my body, creating layers of hardened magical defence that gleamed under the training room lights.\nMy father’s eyes widened genuinely. \"A Transcedent Echo ability!? At your age and rank?\"\nHe didn’t wait for explanation. His mind had already adapted to the new variable.\nBOOM! STRIKE!\nHis next attack targeted my Armor directly, testing its durability. The impact sent tremors through my body, but the Stone Armor held firm, absorbing most of the force.\nThrust! Parry! Slash!\nI pressed my advantage, using the Armor’s protection to take calculated risks. Where before I’d been purely defensive, now I could trade blows more aggressively.\nCLANG! CRACK! THUD!\nHis blade caught my shoulder, but the Stone Armor prevented serious damage. I countered immediately with an enhanced slash toward his ribs that forced him to give ground.\nBreathing heavy... focus...\nMy father wasn’t having an easy time despite the rank difference. The combination of blood enhancement, weapon strengthening, and defensive Armor had created combat effectiveness approaching true Transcendent level.\nWhoosh! Feint! Strike!\nI executed a deceptive manoeuvre, feinting high before striking low with enhanced speed. My father read it and parried, but his counter came slower than before. I was forcing him to work for every exchange.\nCLASH! SCRAPE! SPARKS!\nOur blades locked briefly, and I could see sweat on his brow. He wasn’t suppressing his power anymore - the fight had become genuine.\n\"Your combat instincts...\" he said through gritted teeth. \"They’re far beyond your experience level.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 132: Fighting the Duke [2]\nHe forced me back with raw strength, but I rolled with the momentum and came up ready.\nEnhanced Strike! BOOM!\nI channelled concentrated enhancement into a powerful overhead attack. The impact when he blocked sent cracks spreading through the reinforced training floor.\nMy father’s expression showed genuine respect now. \"You’ve improved much more than I expected, Adrian. You are able to show transcendent rank combat power at elite-rank...this is incredible.\"\nThrust! Parry! Counter!\nWe exchanged another rapid sequence, neither gaining decisive advantage. My Stone Armor was showing fractures from accumulated damage, but it had served its purpose - proving I could survive against superior opponents.\nIn one moment, we both committed to finishing strikes. His blade came for my chest while mine targeted his shoulder. The impact would’ve been tremendous but we both reached a conclusion as our eyes met.\nMy sword stood shy of his shoulder whilst his stood shy of my chest. We froze in that position, I was breathing heavily whilst he wasn’t. Despite limiting his combat power to transcendent rank, his vitality was still that of a commander-level awakener.\n\"Father, that should be enough\" I said quietly. \"I’ve proven my point. I can survive against Transcendent opponents. You need those items more than I do right now.\"\nMy father slowly lowered his weapon, his expression a mixture of pride, concern, and resignation.\n\"You’ve grown far beyond what I imagined possible in such a short time,\" he admitted. \"Fine. I’ll accept your gifts. But Adrian...\" His voice carried weight.\n\"Where did you learn to fight like that?\"\nI quickly formulated a plausible excuse. \"It’s part of my bloodline abilities. It provides combat instincts and battle awareness beyond normal levels.\"\nMy father nodded thoughtfully, then laughed with genuine warmth. \"A Mythical-rank bloodline isn’t for nothing, is it? I should have expected extraordinary capabilities.\"\nThe explanation satisfied him, and he finally accepted the items without further argument. \"Very well. I’ll make use of both the pendant and the secret art. Though I still think you’re giving up too much.\"\n\"Just promise you’ll come back alive,\" I said simply.\n\"I’ll do my best.\"\nAs we walked back toward the living room where Mother and Kael were surely waiting, I discreetly pulled out the Book of Hints and opened it to check the updated information.\nProbability of Duke Marcus Blackwood’s survival: 40%\nMy heart lifted slightly. The survival chance had increased exponentially from the original five percent. That dramatic improvement was exactly what I’d been hoping for - proof that my intervention could actually make a difference.\nFor now, forty percent was acceptable. Once my father had time to practice the Royal-rank secret art and master even its basic forms, the probability should increase further.\n\"Father,\" I said as we approached the living room doors, \"be extremely careful. This mission might be a setup orchestrated by our family’s enemies. They could be using the royal command to their advantage, secretly manipulating the King into sending you into a trap while maintaining plausible deniability.\"\nMy father’s expression darkened. \"I’ve had similar suspicions. The timing and circumstances are too convenient for certain parties at court.\"\n\"Then don’t go in assuming the intelligence reports are accurate. Prepare for worst-case scenarios.\"\n\"I always do, son. I always do.\"\nAfter the tension of the duel and the serious discussion with my father, we returned to the living room where my mother and Kael had been waiting. My mother immediately noticed my appearance but seemed relieved that I wasn’t injured.\nKael stood when we entered, and I took the opportunity to properly observe the transformation in him.\n\"Adrian,\" Kael said respectfully, then hesitated before continuing. \"I was hoping we could speak privately for a moment?\"\nI glanced at my parents, who nodded their understanding. \"Of course. Let’s step outside.\"\nWe excused ourselves and made our way to one of the estate’s private gardens, far enough from the main building to ensure our conversation wouldn’t be overheard by anyone.\nOnce we were alone, Kael turned to face me directly. His expression carried something that suggested he’d been thinking about this conversation for some time.\n\"I wanted to properly thank you,\" he began, his voice steady but carrying genuine emotion. \"For that day when you saved me from that beast in the forest. For bringing me into your family. For giving me a life I never could have imagined.\"\nHe paused, as if gathering courage for the next question.\n\"But I need to understand... why? Why did you help some random street orphan? You’re the son of a Duke. I was nobody. What made you stop and intervene?\"\nI shrugged with nonchalance, not wanting to make this more dramatic than necessary. \"Does there need to be a complicated reason? You were in trouble. I had the capability to help. So I did.\"\n\"But people walk past situations like that every day,\" Kael pressed. \"Nobles especially don’t involve themselves with street problems. Yet you not only helped me, you brought me into your own family. That’s not normal.\"\n\"Maybe I’m not normal,\" I replied simply.\n---\nHe looked at me for a long moment, as if searching my face for deeper meaning, before finally nodding his head as if accepting my answer at face value.\nI took a seat on one of the garden benches and stared up at the night sky. \"So, what are you going to do now? I heard from Father that you’ve been training really hard. You must have something specific in mind.\"\nKael nodded, his expression growing more serious and determined. \"Indeed. I want to get stronger - much stronger. I don’t want to be weak anymore. I don’t want anyone to be able to pick on me or control me ever again.\" He paused before adding, \"So I want to enter the academy next year.\"\nInwardly, I felt satisfaction at hearing this confirmation, but I kept my expression calm and neutral. \"That’s a solid plan. The academy is an excellent place to gain opportunities and develop your skills properly.\"\n\"I wish I could have entered this year,\" Kael continued, a hint of regret in his voice. \"Entering alongside you would have been interesting, and I could have started gaining those opportunities and skills earlier.\"\nThere it is. That’s exactly what i’ve been looking for.\nKael had made it easier for me to bring up what I’d been planning. I no longer needed to convince him - he’d expressed the desire himself. My accumulated points were finally going to be put to strategic use.\n\"What if I told you that’s still possible?\" I said casually, watching his reaction carefully.\nKael’s head snapped toward me, his eyes widening with shock. \"What? But... I already asked the Duke about it. He said admissions were closed for this year. The academy doesn’t accept late entries.\"\nI nodded calmly. \"Indeed, official admissions have been closed. But I have ways around certain restrictions within the academy. Being the top-ranked student in the Elite class doesn’t come without benefits and influence.\"\nKael stared at me in complete disbelief, his mouth opening and closing as he processed what I was suggesting. \"You... you could actually get me into the academy this year? That’s possible?\"\n\"The academy operates on a point system,\" I explained. \"Students can spend points on various services and privileges beyond just equipment and training facilities. One of those privileges is sponsoring exceptional candidates for special admission reviews.\"\nHis expression showed he was struggling to comprehend the magnitude of what I was offering. \"But that must cost an enormous amount of points. And you just started - you can’t possibly have accumulated enough...\"\nI allowed myself a small smile. \"I just won first place in a major examination with my entire class. We each received substantial point rewards. I have resources to work with.\"\n\"Adrian, I can’t let you spend that much on me,\" Kael protested immediately. \"Those points are for your own development and advancement. You shouldn’t waste them—\"\n\"It’s not a waste if I’m investing in my new brother,\" I interrupted. \"Besides, having someone I trust within the academy provides strategic advantages beyond simple point calculations.\"\nKael’s expression showed a mixture of overwhelming gratitude and genuine concern about accepting such a valuable gift. \"I don’t know what to say. This is... this is more than I could have imagined.\"\nInwardly, I was satisfied with how this was progressing. Kael entering the academy this year served multiple purposes that he didn’t need to fully understand. Having someone loyal to me personally rather than just the Blackwood family would be valuable for navigating academy politics. His growth would also contribute to our family’s overall strength during the coming conflicts.\nMost importantly, getting him integrated now meant he would develop alongside the main storyline events rather than missing critical opportunities that only occurred during this specific academic year.\n\"There are conditions,\" I said seriously. \"You’ll need to pass the academy’s assessment tests. I can get you the opportunity for review, but you have to prove you’re capable enough to meet their standards.\"\n\"I understand,\" Kael said with determination replacing his shock. \"I won’t waste this chance. I’ll prove I deserve to be there.\"\n\"Good. Then I’ll make the necessary arrangements when I return to the academy tomorrow.\"\nWith Kael’s future roadmap settled, I felt much more relieved. Another part of my plan has gone successful, Kael was no longer the same Winter Beast that would terror everyone in the city, but he would become my close ally and potentially be my right hand man.\nMy father’ survival was also more secure now.\nI need to get stronger...much more stronger.",

      "content": "Chapter 133: Departing the Estate\nFive Days Later\nThe past five days at the academy had settled into a productive rhythm that allowed me to focus on multiple development priorities simultaneously. Nothing major had disrupted the routine - no assassination attempts, no dramatic confrontations, just consistent progress across various fronts.\nClasses had continued as expected. Instructor Sylvia maintained her rigorous standards, using the examination results as a springboard for deeper discussions. She’d been analysing our performance in detail, pointing out both our successes and the subtle mistakes we’d made that could have proven costly against more prepared opponents. The lessons were valuable, though my mind often wandered to concerns beyond the classroom.\nI had also broken the record twice with Kyle, the record was now under my name at 11,025. From the constant record breaking, I was able to amass an extra 100,000 which was always welcome. However, happiness never stayed for too long as Instructor Sylvia informed me that there was no longer any point reward for breaking the standing record.\nUnfortunately, the glitch had been patched but at least I had made 200,000 points from it which was not a small number, at all.\nMy blacksmithing projects had consumed significant time and resources. The crossbow design had undergone another iteration, this time focused on improving mana efficiency and handling capabilities for even stronger projectiles. The breakthrough came when I realized I could be more efficient in my resources by creating arrows directly from blood manipulation rather than crafting physical ammunition.\nBlood arrows were easier and faster to produce, didn’t require expensive materials. The advantages were substantial, unlimited ammunition as long as I had access to blood sources which I had plenty of.\nThe crossbow’s internal mechanisms now featured enhanced Orichalcum channelling that reduced mana consumption by approximately fifteen percent while increasing the weapon’s durability against the stress of firing blood-enhanced projectiles. The adaptive bolt groove I’d designed earlier worked perfectly with these new ammunition types, adjusting automatically to the blood arrows’ unique properties.\nThe skateboard had also received improvements. After observing how various surfaces and speeds affected its performance, I’d reinforced the board’s structure with additional Mithril threading and refined the control enchantments. The result was significantly improved durability and more responsive handling at higher speeds. Students were already asking where they could purchase similar devices, though I’d deliberately delayed any commercial production until after securing proper patents through my family’s legal channels.\nBut beneath all these productive activities, one concern dominated my thoughts, my father’s survival probability.\nEvery morning, I’d been checking the Book of Hints, watching the survival percentage fluctuate as circumstances changed. The number had climbed steadily as my father practiced with the Royal-rank secret art and familiarized himself with the Typhoon Pendant’s capabilities.\nThis morning’s check had shown remarkable improvement:\nProbability of Duke Marcus Blackwood’s survival: 59%\nThe increase from five percent to fifty-nine percent was extraordinary. It represented the difference between near-certain death and reasonable odds of survival. My intervention had genuinely mattered, and the gifts I’d provided were making measurable impact on the outcome.\n’Fifty-nine percent is decent,’ I thought while reviewing the updated information. ’Not guaranteed, but far better than before. I can only hope it continues improving during his travel to the monster infested town and throughout the actual confrontation.’\nThe book provided additional context about my father’s preparations:\n[Duke Marcus Blackwood has achieved proficiency with the first stance of the Royal-rank footwork technique, increasing his combat mobility significantly. The Typhoon Pendant has been integrated into his planning. He has assembled a strike force of twelve Transcendent-rank soldiers from the Blackwood military, supplementing the guards provided by the Crown. Departure scheduled for today at noon.]\nTwelve Transcendent soldiers plus the crown guards meant more than fifteen Transcendent-rank fighters supporting my father not to mention the large number of elite-rank fighters. My father was clearly taking this threat seriously and leveraging every resource at his disposal.\nI was no longer consumed with worry about his survival. The odds weren’t perfect, but they were acceptable given the circumstances. My father was a seasoned military commander who had survived countless battles - with proper tools and preparation, he had a genuine chance of success.\nSince today marked his departure, I had decided to travel to the estate to give him a proper farewell. The journey would take approximately two hours each way, but seeing him off felt important beyond mere sentiment. It was an opportunity to assess his condition personally and potentially provide any last-minute advice or resources.\nI’d already informed Instructor Sylvia that I would be absent from afternoon classes due to family matters. She’d granted permission without requiring detailed explanation, though her knowing look suggested she understood more than I’d explicitly stated.\nThe carriage I’d commissioned was waiting at the academy gates as scheduled. I climbed aboard and settled in for the familiar journey, my mind already rehearsing what I wanted to say during the farewell.\nMy father was about to embark on one of the most dangerous missions of his career, walking into a situation that could have very well carefully orchestrated by political enemies to eliminate him. But he wasn’t walking in blind or unprepared. He had tools, skill, and support that the architects of this trap hadn’t anticipated.\nThe survival percentage wasn’t guaranteed victory, but it represented genuine hope where there had been almost none before. Sometimes, that was the best anyone could achieve - shifting impossible odds into merely difficult ones and trusting in skill, preparation, and determination to bridge the remaining gap.\nAs the carriage rolled through the countryside toward the Blackwood estate, I allowed myself a moment of satisfaction. My interventions were making real differences in outcomes that mattered. The knowledge from my previous life, the resources from the daily reward system, and the strategic advantages of understanding future events were combining to alter destinies that had seemed fixed.\nMy father’s survival wasn’t the only goal, but it was an important one. Preserving our family’s strength would be crucial for the challenges ahead - challenges that I knew were coming even if others remained oblivious.\nThe estate appeared on the horizon, its familiar towers a welcome sight after days spent navigating academy politics and training schedules. Today I would say goodbye to my father, wish him luck, and trust that the preparations we’d made together would prove sufficient.\nFifty-nine percent survival odds. It would have to be enough.\nThe estate’s training grounds were already bustling with activity when I arrived. My father’s strike force was conducting final equipment checks and tactical drills, their disciplined movements reflecting the years of professional military training they had went under my father.\nI found my parents in the main courtyard. My mother was overseeing the logistics preparation while my father reviewed maps with his senior commanders. They both looked up when I approached.\nSeeing my arrival, the senior commanders decided to take their leave for now to leave us for some alone time.\n\"Adrian...I’m glad you came.\" my father greeted warmly.\n\"I wouldn’t miss seeing you off,\" I replied with a soft smirk on my face.\nMy mother approached before pulling me into her blossom and embraced me tightly.\nAfter letting go she smiled before saying, \"Your father has been practicing that footwork technique obsessively. I’ve barely seen him sleep these past few days, thank you, son.\"\n\"The first stance alone has already improved my mobility significantly,\" my father confirmed. \"Though I wish I had more time to master the advanced forms.\"\n\"You’ll have time to practice during travel, the journey to Thorn haven will take several days, right?\"\nMy father nodded. \"Indeed, I was thinking of doing that.\"\nWe spoke for a while about tactical considerations and contingency plans. My father had clearly thought through numerous scenarios, his mind working overtime to prepare for various threat configurations.\nEventually, my mother suggested something unexpected. \"Marcus, why don’t you spar with Adrian one more time before you leave?\"\nMy father raised an eyebrow. \"You want to watch us fight?\"\n\"I want to see if my son can keep up with you like you had said before,\" she replied with a knowing smile.\nMy father quickly became embarrassed at complimenting me behind my back before he regained his composure, he wasn’t a duke for no reason, he had a thick skin.\nWe moved to the designated sparring area, and I noticed my mother positioning herself with an excellent view of the proceedings. She was clearly planning to enjoy this.\n\"Ready?\" my father asked, settling into his stance that incorporated elements of the new footwork.\n\"Ready.\"\nCLASH!\nThe difference from our previous spar was immediately apparent. My father moved with significantly improved speed and fluidity, the Royal-rank technique enhancing his already formidable capabilities.\nStill his power was limited to transcendent rank, but even then the footwork made a huge difference that I was slightly jealous I haven’t learnt the first form yet.\nWhoosh! Parry! Strike!\nI activated my blood enhancement and met his assault with everything I had. Our blades rang out in rapid exchanges that showcased the improvement both of us had made.\n\"Go Adrian!\" my mother called out enthusiastically from the side-lines.\nMy father shot her an amused look mid-combat. \"You’re supposed to be supporting your husband, dear!\"\n\"I can support whoever displays better technique!\" she replied with mock severity. \"And right now, Adrian’s is superior!\"\nCLANG! Footwork! Counter!\nI capitalized on the distraction to land a solid strike against my father’s guard, forcing him back several steps.\nMy mother applauded. \"Excellent! See, Marcus? This is what happens when you get cocky!\"\n\"You’re enjoying this far too much,\" my father complained, though his grin suggested he wasn’t actually bothered.",

      "content": "Chapter 134: Departing the Estate [2]\n\"After twenty years of marriage, I deserve some entertainment,\" my mother teased. \"Besides, watching our son hold his own against a Transcendent is rather impressive.\"\nFinal Exchange! CLASH!\nWe concluded the spar with mutual respect, both breathing heavily but satisfied with the demonstration.\n\"You’ve improved as well,\" my father acknowledged. \"That enhancement of yours is becoming more refined.\"\n\"And your footwork integration is seamless, the technique suits your fighting style perfectly.\" I nodded.\nMy mother approached and kissed my father’s cheek. \"Now that I’ve had my entertainment, I suppose I should support my husband properly. Come back safely, Marcus. We’ll be waiting.\"\n----\nAfter my father’s departure, I decided to remain at the estate for the day. The academy had granted students an off-day following the recent examination, and I wanted to spend time with my mother while also assessing Kael’s progress first-hand.\nMy mother had returned to her study to handle correspondence, leaving me to explore the training facilities. I found Kael practicing basic sword forms in one of the smaller training yards, his movements showing dedication even without supervision.\n\"Kael,\" I called out, approaching the area. \"Would you be interested in a proper sparring session? I want to see how much you’ve developed.\"\nHis eyes lit up with enthusiasm mixed with obvious nervousness. \"I’d be honoured, though I’m not sure I’ll provide much of a challenge compared to your academy opponents.\"\n\"Everyone starts somewhere,\" I replied, gesturing toward the main sparring area. \"Besides, I need to evaluate your capabilities if I’m going to sponsor your academy admission.\"\nWe moved to the reinforced training space, and I noticed how Kael’s posture had improved dramatically. The malnourished orphan kid was completely gone, replaced by someone who carried themselves with emerging confidence.\n\"Begin whenever you’re ready,\" I instructed, settling into a relaxed stance with my sword held loosely.\nCharge! Strike!\nKael launched himself forward with respectable speed, his blade aimed at my midsection in a straightforward attack. The technique was fundamentally sound but lacked the refinement that came from combat experience.\nParry! Redirect!\nI deflected his strike easily, redirecting his momentum past me rather than meeting it with force. \"Good initial aggression, but your recovery is slow. You’re vulnerable after committing to attacks.\"\nHe adjusted immediately, resetting his guard faster on the next attempt.\nSlash! Block! Counter!\nWe exchanged several sequences, and I could sense his Elite-rank strength clearly. The power behind his strikes was legitimate - he’d been training seriously and his awakened abilities were developing properly.\nWhat caught my attention more than his raw strength was the purity of his ice element manifestation. When he channelled his bloodline abilities, frost formed along his blade with remarkable clarity. The crystalline formations showed no impurities or instability, this was a high-quality ice bloodline..\nFreeze! Extend!\nKael attempted to coat his sword with ice enhancement, extending its effective reach. The execution was clumsy, but the underlying concept was sound.\n\"Stop,\" I commanded, holding up my hand. \"Your bloodline manifestation is impressive. The purity of that ice element is really good, you have potential.\"\nKael looked at his frost-covered blade with mixed pride and uncertainty. \"The Duke’s instructors said my affinity was unusually strong for someone with my background.\"\n\"They’re correct. But you’re treating it like a simple enhancement rather than understanding its true applications.\" I gestured for him to observe as I demonstrated. \"Ice isn’t just about making things cold or creating barriers. It’s about controlling temperature gradients, manipulating moisture, and understanding phase transitions.\"\nI channelled a small amount of energy to illustrate the principle. \"Watch how energy flows and concentrates. Your ice should respond to intention, not just raw power.\"\nKael attempted to replicate the concept, his expression showing intense concentration. The ice formation became slightly more stable, responding to his directed will rather than just flooding outward.\n\"Better,\" I acknowledged. \"Your experience is limited, but your learning speed is good. That’s more valuable than raw power in the early stages.\"\nWe continued sparring, but the dynamic had shifted from combat test to teaching demonstration. I would execute techniques slowly, explain the underlying principles, then have Kael attempt variations suited to his ice abilities.\nStrike! Freeze! Shatter!\nHe discovered he could create temporary ice formations that would shatter on impact, creating distracting debris clouds. The technique was crude but showed that Kael had creative thinking.\n\"Excellent adaptation. That’s the kind of tactical innovation that will serve you well at the academy. Don’t just mimic others - develop applications unique to your abilities.\"\nAfter about forty minutes of intensive training, I called the session to a close. Kael was breathing heavily but his eyes showed the satisfaction of genuine learning rather than just exhausting exercise.\n\"You have Elite-rank strength with solid fundamentals,\" I assessed. \"Your combat experience needs significant work, but that will come naturally with time and practise. Focus on understanding your ice bloodline’s properties more deeply - that’s where your true advantages will emerge.\"\n\"Thank you for the guidance,\" Kael said sincerely.\n\"The academy will push you harder than this,\" I warned. \"But if you maintain this learning attitude, you’ll adapt quickly.\"\nLater that afternoon, I found my mother in the estate’s garden, tending to some rare magical plants that required careful cultivation. She looked up when I approached, setting aside her gardening tools.\n\"How was your session with Kael?\" she asked, already knowing I’d been evaluating him.\n\"Promising. He has legitimate Elite-rank strength and a strong ice bloodline. With proper training, he’ll perform well at the academy.\" I sat on a nearby bench, watching her work. \"How are you holding up with Father gone?\"\nMy mother’s hands paused briefly before continuing their careful movements. \"I’ve been through this before. Your father has embarked on dangerous missions throughout our marriage. Each time, I worry. Each time, he returns.\"\n\"Indeed.\"\nShe looked at me directly, her maternal intuition clearly sensing something. \"You know something you’re not telling me. That’s why you gave him those valuable items.\"\nI chose my words carefully. \"I have... sources that suggest this mission carries unusual risks. Political complications beyond just the monster threat.\"\nMy mother nodded slowly, unsurprised. \"Your father suspected as much. That’s why he assembled such a substantial force despite the Crown’s support.\" She returned to her plants, though her movements had become more mechanical. \"Tell me, Adrian - honestly - do you believe he’ll return?\"\n\"Yes,\" I answered without hesitation. \"The odds aren’t perfect, but they’re acceptable. Father is too skilled and too prepared to fall to a simple ambush, even one disguised as a royal mission.\"\nShe smiled faintly. \"Good, you need to believe in your father. Adrian, you know you’ve changed so much since your awakening. The old Adrian would never have been so direct about such serious matters.\"\n\"The old Adrian was foolish in many ways. I’m trying to be better.\"\nIn a calm, motherly tone she said. \"You’re succeeding, your father is proud of you, even if he doesn’t always express it too much. Sponsoring Kael’s admission, improving your combat abilities, winning your examination so decisively - these are achievements that reflect well on our family.\"\nWe sat in comfortable silence for a while, the afternoon sun casting long shadows across the garden. Despite the underlying worry about my father’s mission, there was peace in this moment.\n\"Stay for dinner,\" my mother suggested. \"Kael would appreciate more time with you, and I’d enjoy the company.\"\n\"I’d like that,\" I agreed.\nThe estate felt different with my father gone, but not emptier. Instead, it reinforced the importance of the connections I was building - with Kael, with my mother, with the future I was trying to shape through knowledge and careful intervention.\nFifty-nine percent survival odds for my father. It would have to be enough, because I’d done everything within my current power to improve those chances. Now came the harder part - waiting and trusting that preparation would prove sufficient when the critical moment arrived.\nThe next day arrived with quiet morning light filtering through the estate windows. I had decided to remain another day, wanting to keep my mother company while my father travelled toward what could be his most dangerous mission yet.\nWe shared breakfast together in the smaller dining room rather than the formal hall - a more intimate setting that felt appropriate given the circumstances. My mother spoke about estate management, upcoming social obligations, and various mundane matters that provided comfortable distraction from heavier concerns.\n\"The Rosewood family has invited us to their summer gathering,\" she mentioned while reviewing correspondence. \"Though given your father’s absence, I’ll likely decline or send regrets.\"\n\"You should still attend if you want to, I will accompany you if you want.\" I suggested.\nShe flashed me a smile before nodding. \"Perhaps. We’ll see how matters develop.\"\nThroughout the morning, I accompanied her on various activities around the estate - reviewing accounts with the workers, inspecting the gardens, discussing menu planning with the head cook. The domestic routines provided grounding normalcy that we both appreciated.\nAs afternoon approached, I felt the familiar notification pulse in my consciousness that indicated my daily reward had become available.\n[Daily Login Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your daily reward?]\nI mentally selected yes while maintaining my conversation with my mother, hoping for something more useful than the disappointing items I’d received over the past five days.\nThe previous rewards had been frustratingly mundane - basic healing potions, common herbs, low-grade equipment that offered no improvements over what I already possessed. It felt like the system was cycling through filler content rather than providing genuinely valuable acquisitions.\nThis time, I hoped the pattern would break and deliver something substantial that could contribute meaningfully to my various development priorities or the challenges ahead.",

      "content": "Chapter 135: Mysterious Egg\n[Congratulations! You have received: Mysterious Egg]\nI maintained my composure during the conversation with my mother, though internally my attention had completely shifted to the notification. The reward description was intriguing enough that I needed to examine it privately as soon as possible.\n\"Mother, I think I’ll retire to my room for a bit,\" I said casually after we finished reviewing the week’s accounts. \"I want to go through some academy materials I brought with me.\"\n\"Of course, dear. I’ll be in the solarium if you need anything.\"\nI made my way quickly to my guest chambers and closed the door, activating the privacy wards before summoning the reward from my system space.\nWhat materialized in my hands made my eyes widen considerably.\nThe egg was approximately the size of a melon, its surface displaying a mesmerizing array of colours that shifted and swirled as I rotated it. Deep purples blended into vibrant crimsons, which transitioned into brilliant golds and oceanic blues. The patterns weren’t static, they moved across the shell like living aurora lights, creating hypnotic displays that suggested powerful magic contained within.\nI quickly accessed the detailed information:\n[Mysterious Egg]\nRank: King]\n[Details: Mysterious egg of an unknown species containing a beast that can reach King rank at maturity.]\nMy heart raced as the implications sank in. King rank, two full tiers above where my father currently stood. Beasts that could achieve King rank were really powerful creatures, the kind that could reshape battlefields and influence the fate of entire kingdoms. They were all intelligent and some had the trait of talking once they reached a high rank.\nThe egg felt warm to the touch, and I could sense faint life energy pulsing within. Whatever creature was developing inside was already alive, just waiting for the right conditions to hatch.\nI examined the shell more closely, noting intricate patterns that might indicate the species type. The color combinations suggested possible elemental affinities - the crimson and gold might indicate fire or light attributes, while the purple and blue could suggest storm or shadow elements. Without more information, identifying the exact species was impossible.\nQuestions flooded my mind. What did it need to hatch? How long would the incubation period last? What kind of care would the hatchling require? And most critically - could I trust a King-rank beast to remain loyal once it reached its full potential?\nThe daily reward system had just provided something that could fundamentally alter my long-term power trajectory. A King-rank companion would be invaluable for the conflicts I knew were coming, assuming I could successfully raise and bond with whatever emerged from this spectacular egg.\nI carefully returned it to my system space, my mind already racing through the logistics of managing such a powerful acquisition while maintaining secrecy about its existence.\nBut first, I needed to understand the hatching requirements.\nI retrieved the egg again and examined it from every angle, searching for clues about what conditions might trigger the incubation process. The warm surface suggested it might require heat, but how much? The swirling colors could indicate elemental affinity needs, but which elements specifically?\nI tried channeling small amounts of mana into the shell, watching for any reaction. Nothing changed. I attempted blood manipulation, wondering if a blood bond was required for hatching. Still no response.\nThen, nearly an hour of my time was spent attempting various approaches - exposing it to different temperatures, trying various enchantment activation phrases, even speaking to it directly in case it responded to verbal commands.\nNothing worked.\nFinally, I had to accept that the egg would hatch according to its own timeline and requirements, whatever those might be. Forcing the process could damage the creature inside.\nWith a sigh, I returned it to my system space once more. Patience would be required.\nWhile the reward was undeniably powerful, it provided no immediate benefits for my current situation. I wasn’t foolish enough to measure value solely by instant utility, a King-rank beast companion would be really powerful once matured, but in the short term, the egg was essentially an investment rather than a power boost.\nThe rest of the day was spent productively in combat training with the estate’s guards and Kael. My father’s departure had left several Transcendent-rank guards behind to maintain estate security, and I decided to test myself against their capabilities.\nThe sparring session drew quite an audience as word spread through the garrison that the young master was challenging Transcendent opponents.\n\"Your footwork has improved dramatically, young master,\" remarked Captain Deren, one of the senior guards who had served my family for decades. \"I remember when you could barely hold a proper stance. Now you’re forcing me to concentrate.\"\nCLASH!\nI engaged him with full blood enhancement active, my blade meeting his with strength that clearly surprised him. His eyebrows rose as I pushed through his defensive guard.\n\"That enhancement technique...\" another guard observed from the sidelines. \"It’s bridging the entire rank gap. I’ve never seen anything like it.\"\n\"The young master’s combat power rivals our own,\" Another senior guard added with obvious respect. \"At Elite rank, no less. Imagine what he’ll be capable of once he advances to Transcendent. He will be able to face commander level threats!\"\nA smile formed on my face hearing his words, but I didn’t take them seriously. I knew that the higher the rank the higher the gap between them. Whilst I was doing was really impressive, it wasn’t unheard of, the modt takented in the history of the kingdom were able to do so at the peak of elite rank.\nI demonstrated the Light Steps technique I’d been practicing, the Royal-rank footwork allowing me to outmaneuver Deren’s counterattacks. His expression showed genuine approval.\n\"You’ve been training your footwork really well,\" he concluded after our exchange. \"The fluidity and precision aren’t something you develop through basic drills alone.\"\nAfter sparring the senior guards, I joined the normal trainning session. Honing my swordsmanship skills, footwork, and helping Kael too.",

      "content": "Chapter 136: Elen’s predicament\nWhen the sun started to set, casting long shadows across the estate grounds, I decided it was time to return to the academy. I had classes scheduled for the next day and needed to maintain my academic attendance despite the family circumstances.\nI found my mother in the sitting room and Kael practicing forms in the training yard to bid them both farewell.\n\"Travel safely, dear,\" my mother said, embracing me warmly. \"And don’t worry too much about your father. He’s survived worse situations than this.\"\n\"I know. But stay vigilant while he’s away. I’ve ordered Lex and Lux to remain at the estate for your protection.\"\n\"That’s not necessary,\" she protested gently. \"You need guards at the academy—\"\n\"You need them more than I do,\" I interrupted firmly. \"My combat capabilities are sufficient for academy security, and I have Kojiro available if truly serious threats emerge. The estate is a more likely target while Father is away.\"\nMy mother nodded, recognizing the logic even if she worried about my safety.\nKael approached as I prepared to depart. \"Thank you again for the training and guidance. I’ll work on the ice manipulation applications you demonstrated.\"\n\"Keep practicing. I’ll make the arrangements for your academy admission when I return.\"\nThe carriage journey back was uneventful, giving me time to review the day’s events and plan for the coming week. The mysterious egg remained secure in my system space, a powerful secret that would require careful management once it eventually hatched.\nArriving at the academy grounds, I noticed it was quite late - well past the normal curfew hours. The gates were still accessible for students with proper authorization, but the campus was notably quiet compared to daytime activity levels.\nAs we approached within about two hundred meters of the main entrance, I spotted two figures standing near the gate. The magical lighting revealed Elen’s distinctive blue hair, and she appeared to be in conversation with a middle-aged man I didn’t recognize.\nSomething about her body language troubled me. Her posture looked defensive and vulnerable in ways I’d never seen before, even during dangerous examination situations.\n\"Stop the carriage here,\" I commanded the driver. \"I’ll proceed on foot from this point.\"\n\"Young master, are you certain—\"\n\"I’ll handle it. You can leave now.\"\nI exited the carriage and walked slowly toward the gate, staying just outside their senses range but close enough for me to hear their discussion.\nAs I drew nearer, Elen’s frustrated voice carried across the distance.\n\"Father, until when are they going to embezzle you?!\"\nThe middle-aged man, apparently her father, which made him Baron Brightwater sighed heavily. His clothing was well-made but showed signs of age and repeated mending, suggesting financial constraints unusual for nobility.\n\"Elen, please understand the position I’m in,\" he said wearily. \"The merchant consortium has been undermining our trade routes for years. Every appeal to higher authorities gets blocked by their political connections.\"\n\"Then fight back! Report them to the Duke or even petition the Crown directly!\"\n\"You think I haven’t tried?\" His voice carried the exhaustion of someone who had fought and lost repeatedly. \"The Brightwater barony doesn’t have the influence to challenge families with Royal Court connections. Our complaints disappear into bureaucratic delays while they continue bleeding our resources.\"\nElen’s hands clenched into fists. \"So what am I supposed to do? You’re asking for my academy points again, aren’t you?\"\nThe Baron’s expression showed guilt and desperation in equal measure. \"The points can be converted to gold through. Just fifty thousand points would cover our most urgent debts and buy us time to restructure—\"\n\"Fifty thousand?!\" Elen’s voice cracked slightly. \"Father, I need those points for training facilities, equipment, materials for my alchemy studies. Without proper resources, I can’t develop my abilities fast enough to actually help our family long-term.\"\n\"I know what I’m asking,\" he said quietly. \"But if we don’t address the immediate crisis, there won’t be a long term. The creditors are threatening to petition for administrative receivership of our barony. We could lose everything.\"\nThe pieces suddenly clicked into place for me. This explained Elen’s careful consideration when purchasing blacksmithing materials with gold coins at that shop. It explained her hesitation about spending points on the alchemy room despite clearly wanting the practice time. She wasn’t naturally frugal - she was supporting a family on the verge of financial collapse.\n\"I’ll give you the points,\" Elen said after a long silence, her voice resigned. \"But Father, this can’t continue forever. I’m willing to help - that was my goal in coming to the academy in the first place, to gain abilities that could improve our family’s position. But you need to start doing something too. Find new trade partners, develop alternative revenue sources, anything besides just relying on me to bail out the barony.\"\n\"You’re right,\" the Baron admitted. \"I’ve been passive for too long, hoping the situation would somehow resolve itself. That changes now. I promise I’ll be more proactive about finding solutions rather than just managing decline.\"\nElen then left for a while before coming back with a few large pouches of gold that she pulled out her storage ring.\nShe had probably converted points to gold. The Baron accepted it with obvious relief mixed with shame.\n\"Thank you, daughter. I know this is difficult.\"\n\"Just... make it count this time,\" she said softly.\nThey embraced briefly before the Baron departed, leaving Elen standing alone at the gate with slumped shoulders that spoke of emotional exhaustion.\nI remained in the shadows, processing what I’d witnessed and considering whether to reveal my presence or allow her privacy to compose herself.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nAfter a moment I decided to hide my presence, appearing now wasn’t a good idea for my plans.\nAfter her father left, Elen stood there for a while simply staring at the sky adorned with the glittering stars and moon.\nThen, out of nowhere she slapped both her cheeks and put on a smile on her face before turning back to head inside the academy with joyfuly energy.",

      "content": "Chapter 137: Blacksmithing\nThe next day arrived with my usual early morning routine, blood consumption, trait training, and academy classes. By afternoon, I made my way to the blacksmithing facilities for the optional crafting module that had become one of my most valuable skill development opportunities.\nThe workshop was already heated when I entered, the massive forge radiating waves of warmth that made the air shimmer. Several other students were scattered throughout the space, working on various projects with varying degrees of competence.\n\"Blackwood!\" A booming voice called out from near the main anvil. \"About time you showed up. I was beginning to think you’d abandoned proper craftsmanship for those academy combat drills.\"\nJan, one of the kingdom’s master blacksmiths and our instructor for the blacksmithing class, was impossible to miss. The elderly man stood nearly as tall as Kojiro despite his advanced age, his frame still packed with the dense muscle that came from decades of working metal. His long white beard reached nearly to his belly button, while his short white hair was perpetually dusted with soot and metal filings. Deep laugh lines creased his face, and his hands, scarred and calloused beyond belief - could shape steel with more precision than most could manage with delicate tools.\n\"Just had some matters to attend to, Master Jan,\" I replied respectfully, moving toward my designated workstation.\n\"some matters,\" he grumbled, though his eyes showed approval rather than criticism. \"At least you have your priorities straight. Too many youngsters these days think combat prowess is everything, ignoring the fundamental truth that civilization is built on craftsmanship, not sword swings.\"\nI couldn’t help but smile at his familiar lecture that he had been repeating for the past few days. Jan had been trying to convince me to abandon combat training entirely since my second blacksmithing session, when he’d realized I possessed genuine Tier 1 capabilities despite being a first-year student in the first semester.\n\"Speaking of which,\" Jan continued, approaching my station with surprising speed for someone his age. \"Show me what you’ve been working on. And don’t think I didn’t notice those improved skateboard designs circulating through the student body. I asked a few students, apparently that was your work.\"\n\"Yes, Master Jan. I refined the propulsion system and durability-\"\n\"Of course you did!\" He laughed heartily, slapping the anvil with enough force to make it ring. \"The boy has Tier 1 skills, a mind for innovation, and he wastes half his time hitting training dummies during combat practice! It’s a tragedy, I tell you. A proper tragedy!\" Jan nudged one of the other students who smiled wryly.\nOther students glanced over at Jan’s outburst, some looking envious while others seemed resigned to his un-filtered personality.\nI laid out my current project - components for an improved crossbow design that would incorporate more sophisticated mana channeling. \"I wanted your advice on the Orichalcum threading patterns. The current configuration works, but I think there’s inefficiency in how the energy flows through the curves.\"\nJan leaned in close, his experienced eyes immediately identifying the issue I’d been struggling with. \"Aha! See, here’s your problem. You’re treating Orichalcum like it’s just conductive wire, but it’s got properties that respond to geometric patterns enhancing its effect. You need to account for the internal structure when planning your threading paths.\"\nHe grabbed a piece of chalk and began sketching complex diagrams on the workbench surface, his hands moving with surprising delicacy. \"See these angles? Orichalcum conducts mana most efficiently at thirty-seven and sixty-two degree turns. Your curves are creating resistance that bleeds off about fifteen percent of your input energy.\"\nI studied his corrections carefully, immediately recognizing the brilliance of his insight. \"So if I redesign the channel pathways to incorporate those specific angles...\"\n\"Exactly! Now you’re thinking like a proper craftsman instead of an academy brat who thinks everything is solved by throwing more mana at problems.\"\nWe worked together for the next hour, with Jan providing guidance that went far beyond standard instruction. Of course in this hour, he helped other students too. His knowledge came from decades of practical experience with materials that most blacksmiths never even encountered.\n\"You’ve got a gift, boy,\" he said seriously during a break from the intense work. \"Real talent that shows up maybe once in a generation. Most students struggle for a whole year to reach Tier 1 competency, whilst some never reach it, but you arrived already possessing those skills. It’s like you were born knowing how metal wants to be shaped.\"\n\"I had good foundational training\" I deflected, unable to explain that the skills came from a daily reward system.\n\"Foundational training my aged arse,\" Jan snorted. \"I’ve seen dozens of students with ’good foundations’ who couldn’t shape a decent horseshoe after months of practice. You understand the material on an intuitive level that can’t just be taught.\"\nHis voice took on a more serious tone. \"That’s why it pains me to see you dividing your focus. If you dedicated yourself fully to blacksmithing, truly dedicated yourself, you could reach Tier 3 before you’re thirty. Maybe even Tier 4 in your lifetime. Do you understand what that means? There are only three Tier 4 blacksmiths in the entire kingdom.\"\n\"I appreciate the confidence, Master Jan. But combat skills are necessary for survival in this world.\"\n\"Bah! Survival? You’re the son of a Duke! Hire people to do your fighting while you create masterworks that will outlast kingdoms!\" Despite his argumentative words, his expression showed he understood my position even if he disagreed with it. \"But I suppose youngsters need to make their own mistakes. Just promise me you’ll keep working on your craft alongside all that sword-swinging nonsense.\"\n\"Of course. I promise, Master Jan.\"\nJan nodded his head in approval before turning to help a student that called for him.\nNearby, I could hear other students whispering among themselves, their voices carrying across the workshop despite attempts at discretion.\n\"Did you hear Master Jan praising Blackwood again? The old man barely acknowledges most of us here, but he treats Adrian like a prized apprentice.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 138: Surprise Exam!\n\"It’s not fair. He wins the combat examination, breaks academy records, and apparently he’s some kind of blacksmithing prodigy too? How is one person good at everything?\"\n\"I heard he invented that skateboard thing everyone’s talking about. Created it from scratch in a single session.\"\n\"Probably inherited talent from his bloodline. Duke bloodline’s must get all sorts of advantages we can’t match.\"\nThe envy in their voices was obvious, though I’d grown accustomed to such reactions. Excellence attracted both admiration and resentment in equal measure.\nJan apparently heard them too, because he raised his voice deliberately. \"Talent is meaningless without dedication! Half you lot complain about others’ success while spending your workshop time gossiping instead of actually working! Now get back to your projects before I assign remedial hammer swings!\"\nThe students scattered back to their stations with guilty expressions, and Jan winked at me conspiratorially.\n\"Let them grumble. Jealousy is just recognition that someone else is achieving what they wish they could. Now, show me how you’re planning to integrate those angle corrections.\"\n...\nOnce the blacksmithing class ended, I made my way to Instructor Sylvia’s classroom along with the rest of my Elite class. The afternoon session typically covered tactical theory and strategic planning, but something about Sylvia’s expression when we entered suggested today would be different.\n\"Take your seats quickly,\" she commanded, her tone carrying unusual sharpness. \"We’re conducting a surprise written examination today.\"\nThe classroom erupted in surprised murmurs and groans. Surprise tests were notoriously difficult to prepare for, and Sylvia’s examinations were known for their comprehensive scope.\n\"This will be an individual assessment, not a team exercise,\" she continued, silencing the protests with a raised hand. \"The exam covers kingdom history, regional geography, political structures, economic systems, and military theory - all material from our curriculum thus far.\"\nMy mind immediately began calculating. Theory-based examinations weren’t my greatest strength. While I possessed knowledge from my previous life and the novel, the specific historical details of this kingdom’s past weren’t always perfectly aligned with what I’d read. I knew the basics and could certainly pass, but passing wasn’t sufficient.\nI wanted the highest marks possible. Academic excellence contributed to overall academy rankings and influenced future opportunities.\nSylvia began distributing thick examination booklets while another instructor set up privacy enchantments around each desk - magical barriers that prevented students from easily seeing their neighbors’ papers through casual glances.\n\"You have two hours,\" Sylvia announced. \"No talking, no unauthorized material access, no communication artifacts. Anyone caught cheating will receive automatic failure and potential disciplinary action.\"\nAs she placed the exam on my desk, I quickly scanned the questions. The content was comprehensive and detailed - asking for specific dates of historical treaties, precise geographic coordinates of strategic locations, and nuanced analysis of political decisions made centuries ago.\nI knew exactly whose paper I needed to reference.\nElen.\nFrom the novel, I remembered clearly that Elen was the most academically gifted student in our class when it came to written examinations. Her theoretical knowledge was exceptional, developed through long hours of studying. While her combat abilities were still developing, her scholarly capabilities were undeniable.\nSecondly, I knew that Elen did not change from my interactions with her. She was still as studious as she had been in the novel.\nThe challenge was accessing her answers without detection.\nThe privacy enchantments prevented simple visual observation, but they weren’t designed to stop someone with my particular advantages. My vampire bloodline provided supernatural senses far beyond human norms, and my Physical Enhancement trait could be applied to sensory capabilities as well as combat attributes.\nI activated my enhanced vision carefully, channeling just enough power to sharpen my perception without creating obvious magical signatures that Sylvia might detect. The privacy barriers were designed to stop normal sight lines, but enhanced supernatural vision operated on different principles.\nElen sat three rows ahead to the left, not ideal positioning, but workable. I could see her bent over her exam, already writing with confident, precise strokes.\nSylvia began patrolling the classroom with sharp attention, her eyes scanning for any suspicious behavior. She was experienced enough to recognize the subtle signs of cheating - awkward postures, unusual eye movements, hesitation patterns that suggested students were waiting to copy others.\nI maintained perfect composure, writing my own answers at a steady pace while simultaneously tracking Elen’s paper with peripheral vision. The key was appearing completely focused on my own work while actually dividing my attention.\nQuestion seven: Describe the Treaty of Thornvale and its impact on regional trade routes.\nI’d written a basic response based on general knowledge, but Elen’s answer was far more detailed. She included specific merchant guild names, precise percentage changes in trade volumes, and political ramifications I hadn’t considered.\nI carefully incorporated her additional details into my response, rephrasing to avoid exact duplication while capturing the substance of her knowledge.\nSylvia paused near my desk, and I immediately stopped my enhanced observation, focusing entirely on my own paper. She studied me for a moment before moving on, apparently satisfied that I was working legitimately.\nQuestion twelve: Identify the geographic coordinates and strategic importance of the Northern Watch fortresses.\nThis one was particularly difficult - requiring precise numerical coordinates that I had no way of knowing from general knowledge. Elen was writing them down with confident accuracy, clearly having memorized the data.\nI waited until Sylvia moved to the opposite side of the classroom before enhancing my vision again. The coordinates appeared clearly despite the privacy barrier - numbers that I quickly transcribed while maintaining my casual writing posture.\nThe process was nerve-wracking. Each time I accessed enhanced vision, there was risk of detection. Sylvia was no fool, and prolonged magical enhancement would eventually register on her awareness.\nI had to be strategic - copying only the most valuable information, the answers I genuinely couldn’t produce through my own knowledge, while filling the rest with legitimate responses to maintain authenticity.\nQuestion eighteen: Analyze the political factors that led to the Continental Alliance collapse.\nThis required political understanding that went beyond simple facts.",

      "content": "Chapter 139: Surprise Exam[2]\nElen’s analysis was brilliant - identifying underlying economic pressures, personality conflicts among leadership, and strategic miscalculations that had contributed to the alliance’s dissolution.\nI absorbed her framework and wrote my own version, maintaining enough difference to avoid raising suspicion while benefiting from her superior analytical perspective.\nTime continued passing with agonizing slowness. Sylvia’s patrols remained unpredictable, forcing me to constantly adapt my observation timing. Several times, she stopped near students who were struggling, offering no assistance but clearly monitoring for cheating behaviors.\nAn hour and forty minutes into the examination, I had successfully referenced Elen’s answers for approximately twenty critical questions while genuinely completing the remaining through my own knowledge.\nThe final twenty minutes, I focused entirely on my own paper, reviewing and refining answers to ensure consistency and quality. No more enhanced vision, no more observation - just legitimate work that would withstand any scrutiny.\n\"Time is up,\" Sylvia announced precisely two hours after we’d begun. \"Put down your writing instruments and close your examination booklets.\"\nI complied immediately, my heart rate finally beginning to normalize after the sustained tension of covert information gathering.\nSylvia collected the exams personally, her sharp eyes scanning each student’s face as she took their papers. When she reached my desk, she paused fractionally longer than with others.\n\"Confident in your performance, Adrian?\" she asked neutrally.\n\"I did my best with the material, Instructor,\" I replied honestly, which was technically true even if the method was questionable.\nShe nodded and moved on, leaving me uncertain whether she suspected anything or was simply maintaining her vigilance.\nAs we filed out of the classroom, I caught Elen looking thoughtful, though she couldn’t possibly know I’d been observing her work. The privacy enchantments had functioned as designed from her perspective.\nThe gamble had been necessary. In the academy’s competitive environment, every advantage mattered, and maintaining top academic standings was just as important as combat excellence for long-term positioning.\nAll I have to do now was simply wait for the exam results to arrive.\nAs I walked toward the training facilities following my usual afternoon routine, an unexpected voice called out behind me.\n\"Wait.\"\nI turned around to find Seraphina walking toward me with her characteristic calm composure. The legendary bloodline user moved with natural grace, her distinctive features drawing attention from other students in the corridor even though she maintained a deliberately low profile.\nI stood in place, waiting for her to close the distance while my mind raced through possible motivations for this conversation. Was she fishing for information on behalf of Kyle’s faction? Attempting to assess my capabilities for future confrontations? Or did she have some personal agenda I hadn’t anticipated?\nThe novel had portrayed her as straightforward and honorable, but circumstances had changed significantly. My interference with the timeline and her elimination might have altered her personality or priorities in ways I couldn’t predict.\n\"Yes?\" I asked neutrally, studying her expression for clues about her intentions.\n\"I want to talk with you for a minute,\" she said calmly, her voice carrying none of the hostility I might have expected from someone I’d effectively removed from a major competition.\nAfter a moment of contemplation, I nodded and gestured toward a quieter area of the academy grounds. \"This way.\"\nWe walked in silence until reaching a secluded courtyard away from the main student traffic. Seraphina positioned herself with typical awareness - maintaining comfortable distance while ensuring clear sight lines in case this conversation turned confrontational.\nShe started without any preliminary small talk. \"Were you hiding your true strength before your awakening?\"\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\" I responded, despite knowing what she wanted.\nSeraphina’s cold eyes studied me carefully. \"During our engagement period, you displayed completely different capabilities and personality. The Adrian Blackwood I observed then barely qualified as competent in basic combat fundamentals. Yet within weeks of awakening, you’re defeating Elite-rank opponents, creating innovative magical devices, and orchestrating complex tactical operations. That degree of transformation seems... implausible without prior concealment.\"\nThe pieces clicked together. She was questioning whether the \"old Adrian\" had been an elaborate act rather than genuine incompetence.\n\"Oh, that,\" I said, allowing a slight smile. \"No, I wasn’t hiding my strength. I genuinely changed after my awakening. The bloodline transformation affected more than just my physical capabilities - it altered my entire perspective and priorities.\"\nI met her gaze directly. \"I realized that chasing after certain things simply wasn’t worth the effort anymore.\"\nHer eyebrow moved fractionally - the only visible reaction to what was clearly a deliberate jab at her. Of course she understood the meaning behind my words. The old Adrian had pursued her relentlessly, making a fool of himself through transparent attempts to win her favor despite her obvious disinterest.\nThe silence stretched between us, charged with unspoken acknowledgment of that history.\nSeraphina’s expression remained composed, though I detected subtle calculation behind her cold exterior. She was reassessing everything she thought she knew about me, recalibrating her understanding based on this new information.\n\"A convenient explanation,\" she finally said. \"Bloodline awakenings can certainly cause personality shifts, though rarely to such dramatic degrees.\"\n\"Well, I guess I’m one of those rare cases,\" I countered with a smile on my face.\n\"Perhaps.\" She didn’t sound entirely convinced, but neither was she outright rejecting the explanation. \"Your performance during the examination was... impressive. Particularly your strategic manipulation of the final confrontation.\"\n\"Thank you. Your duel with Emmet was also noteworthy. You defeated him despite the prolonged combat exhaustion.\"\nHer eyes flickered with something that might have been respect. \"You knocked me unconscious and triggered my elimination.\"\n\"Do you resent it?\" I asked directly.\nSeraphina considered the question seriously before responding. \"No. You operated within the examination parameters and made tactically sound decisions. I lost because I allowed myself to be manipulated into an unsustainable combat situation. That’s a lesson worth learning, even at the cost of elimination.\"\nThe maturity of her response aligned with the novel’s portrayal of her character - someone who valued strength and thinking above petty grudges.\n\"Was there something specific you wanted from this conversation?\" I asked. \"Or was this purely reconnaissance?\"\nA ghost of a smile touched her lips - the first real expression beyond cold composure. \"Reconnaissance, primarily. Kyle’s faction is trying to understand how you achieved such decisive victory. I volunteered to approach you directly rather than rely on second-hand speculation.\"\n\"And what will you report back?\"\n\"Well, nothing new. You didn’t really say much, did you?\"\nSeraphina nodded, accepting the non-answer. \"Fair enough. Thank you for your time, Adrian.\"\nShe walked away with the same grace she’d arrived with, leaving me to contemplate the implications of this unexpected conversation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nAfter the conversation with Seraphina concluded, I continued toward Section G where all the specialized training facilities were located. The area was designated for intensive personal development, featuring various magical constructs and enchanted equipment designed to push students beyond their normal limits.\nI approached the booking station and made an unusual request. \"I need a training room with a Transcendent-rank combat dummy for two hours.\"\nThe attendant’s eyebrows rose slightly. \"Young master Blackwood, you’re aware that’s significantly more expensive than the standard Elite-rank facilities? It’s five thousand points per hour.\"\n\"I’m aware. Proceed with the booking.\"\n[-10,000 Points]\nThe substantial deduction barely fazed me given my recent examination rewards, though I could see other students nearby glancing over with obvious curiosity about why an Elite-rank student would pay premium rates for Transcendent-level training equipment.\nThe assigned room was noticeably larger and more heavily reinforced than standard facilities. The Transcendent-rank training dummy stood in the center - a magical construct that could withstand and measure attacks far beyond what Elite-rank equipment could handle.\nI spent the next two hours in intensive training, pushing every aspect of my bloodline abilities to their absolute limits. Blood Control exercises focused on precision manipulation and maximum output. Supernatural Physique training involved extreme physical stress that would have crippled normal bodies. Blood Enhancement practice pushed my augmentation capabilities beyond comfortable thresholds.\nThe dummy’s integrated measurement systems tracked every strike, every technique application, every marginal improvement in my performance. The data would be valuable for analyzing my development trajectory.\nTwo hours later, drenched in sweat and breathing heavily from sustained exertion, I felt the familiar notifications pulse through my consciousness.\n[Your Blood Control trait has reached level 4]\n[Your Supernatural Physique trait has reached level 4]\n[Your Blood Enhancement trait has reached level 4]\nA smile formed on my face as I read through the notifications. All three of my primary traits had advanced simultaneously - an unprecedented achievement that represented weeks of accumulated effort finally bearing fruit. The improvements would be substantial, enhancing my combat effectiveness by a significant margin.\nBefore the training session, I had tested my maximum damage output against the Transcendent dummy to establish a baseline. The recorded value had been 21,500 damage units, the value was above anything any normal elite rank awakener could output. Anything above 20,000 units was known to be in the territory of transcendent-rank awakeners, even if it was on the lower end of the transcendent rank.\nNow, with all my traits elevated to level 4, I was eager to see exactly how much stronger I had become.\n\"Time to test my new strength,\" I said aloud, a confident smile spreading across my face as I activated all my enhancements simultaneously and prepared to strike the dummy with everything I had.\nTaking a deep breath, I steadied myself before activating my traits. The sword in my hand became enhanced, and multiple spears appeared above my head, waiting for my command to obliterate anything I wanted.",

      "content": "Chapter 140: Surprising Daily reward\nMy Blood Enhancement coursed through my muscles and bones, strengthening every fiber of my being beyond normal Elite-rank limitations. My Supernatural Physique amplified this effect further, my body becoming a weapon in itself.\nThe training dummy stood motionless, its magical sensors ready to measure the full force of what I was about to unleash.\nDash! Launch!\nI exploded forward with supernatural speed, closing the distance in a blur of motion. The blood spears shot ahead like crimson missiles, their trajectories perfectly calculated to strike simultaneously with my sword.\nBOOM! CRACK!\nThe spears slammed into the dummy’s reinforced surface with devastating force, each one creating explosive bursts of energy that would have shredded Elite-rank defenses. The magical construct absorbed the attacks, its measurement systems recording every unit of force.\nSLASH!\nMy enhanced sword followed immediately behind, striking with the accumulated strength of all my traits working in concert. The blade carved through the dummy’s exterior with a sound like thunder, releasing a shockwave that rippled through the entire training room.\nMEASUREMENT CALCULATING...\nThe dummy’s display began processing the damage data, numbers scrolling rapidly as magical sensors analyzed the multi-layered attack I had just executed.\n[TOTAL DAMAGE OUTPUT: 24,725]\nThe number appeared in bright letters above the training construct, and I felt satisfaction wash over me at the concrete proof of my improvement.\nI quickly ran the calculations in my head.\nPrevious maximum: 21,500.\nCurrent result: 24,725.\nThe difference: 3,225 additional damage units.\n\"Not bad,\" I said aloud, unable to suppress my pleased smile. \"A fifteen percent increase in overall combat power.\"\nThe improvement was substantial and represented far more than just numerical advantages. A fifteen percent boost meant I was no longer operating at the absolute bottom threshold of Transcendent-equivalent combat effectiveness. While I still wasn’t matching truly experienced Transcendent warriors, I had pushed beyond the level of newly advanced awakeners.\nThis meant facing opponents like the experienced Transcendent guards at my estate would now be genuinely competitive rather than overwhelming challenges. It meant my survival odds against higher-rank threats had improved meaningfully.\nThe level 4 advancement across all three primary traits had synergized perfectly, each enhancement amplifying the others to create exponential rather than merely additive improvements.\nI dismissed the blood spears and deactivated my enhancements, feeling the familiar fatigue that came from maximum output but satisfied with the investment of time and points.\nTen thousand points for this training session had been expensive, but the measurable results justified every point spent.\nMy combat power continued climbing steadily toward levels that would allow me to face the challenges I knew were coming - challenges where Elite-rank strength would be\ndangerously insufficient, but Transcendent-equivalent capabilities might just be enough to survive.\nAfter my training session concluded and I’d taken a moment to catch my breath, my communication crystal began vibrating with an incoming call. I retrieved it from my pocket and channeled mana to establish the connection.\n\"Young Master Blackwood,\" came a professional voice I recognized as Gerald, one of the grand managers my father had assigned to oversee my business ventures. \"I hope I’m not interrupting your studies.\"\n\"Not at all, Gerald. What’s the status report?\"\n\"Excellent news, sir. The first production line for both the skateboard and crossbow systems has been completed and distributed as you know. We’ve sent samples to the twelve noble families currently operating under the Blackwood duchy’s commercial network for advertisement and market testing purposes.\"\nOver the past week, I’d been working intensively on finalizing the prototypes for both inventions. The designs were now refined enough for mass production, and my father’s business infrastructure was proving invaluable for rapid commercialization.\n\"The initial reception has been extremely positive,\" Gerald continued with obvious enthusiasm. \"Several families have already submitted advance orders based on the demonstration units. The skateboard in particular is generating significant interest among younger nobles and wealthy merchant families.\"\n\"What about the crossbow system?\"\n\"Also promising, though the market is more specialized. Military officers and security forces are showing strong interest, particularly after seeing the mana-efficiency demonstrations.\"\n\"Good. And the second production line?\"\n\"Currently in progress and should be ready for distribution by tomorrow. We’ve scaled up manufacturing capacity based on the projected demand from initial responses.\"\nGerald paused before addressing the pricing structure we’d discussed previously. \"Regarding the final pricing you requested confirmation on - we’ve settled on two hundred golden coins per skateboard unit. The element-compatible arrows are priced at twenty golden coins each, and the complete crossbow system is eight hundred golden coins.\"\nI considered these numbers carefully. Two hundred gold for a skateboard was substantial but reasonable given its magical enhancements and the target demographic of wealthy families. The crossbow at eight hundred gold positioned it as premium military equipment rather than mass-market goods, which aligned with my intentions.\n\"Those prices are acceptable,\" I confirmed. \"Maintain quality standards above profit margins. I want these products building the Blackwood reputation for its superior craftsmanship.\"\n\"Understood, Young Master. I’ll send detailed sales reports weekly.\"\nWith production successfully underway and distribution channels established, a satisfied smile formed on my face. Based on conservative estimates, this business venture would generate several million golden coins if everything proceeded according to plan.\nThe skateboard’s accessibility and novelty would create massive demand among urban populations, while the crossbow system’s military applications would generate steady contracts with security forces and noble house guards. The profit margins were substantial given the relatively low material costs compared to the premium pricing.\nTime passed with my usual routine of classes, training, and business coordination. When the familiar notification arrived indicating my daily reward was available, I activated it without particular expectations.\n[Daily Login Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your daily reward?]\n[Yes | No]\nI selected yes, and what materialized made me stare in complete confusion.\n[Congratulations! You have received: Luxury Mansion Deed]\n[Property Details: 5,000 square foot mansion, fully furnished, located within the capital city, District 3, Noble Quarter]\nLooking at the reward before my eyes, I was genuinely perplexed.\nI had just received an entire mansion instead of equipment or consumable items? This was unprecedented - the system had never provided real estate before.\nI examined the official deed more carefully, noting the legal seals and property registration that confirmed legitimate ownership. What shocked me even more was the specific location. The mansion was actually situated within walking distance of the academy, positioned in one of the capital’s most prestigious districts.\nThis wasn’t some modest property in the outer rings. Properties in District 3’s Noble Quarter commanded astronomical prices due to proximity to the Royal Palace, academy access, and the concentration of influential families. A 5,000 square foot mansion in this location would cost millions of golden coins on the open market.\nI decided to investigate immediately since the property was apparently only about ten minutes away on foot - or mere minutes via skateboard.\nRetrieving my enhanced skateboard from storage, I hopped on and channeled mana into the propulsion system. The familiar smooth acceleration carried me through the academy gates and into the surrounding city streets.\nPedestrians still stared at the unusual device, but I’d grown accustomed to the attention. The skateboard had become something of a trademark for me around campus and the nearby districts.\nFollowing the address listed on the deed, I navigated toward District 3’s exclusive residential areas, curious about what exactly the daily reward system had just granted me.\nFollowing the address through increasingly upscale streets, I arrived at the specified location in District 3’s most prestigious section. When the mansion came into full view, recognition struck me immediately.\nI knew this property.\nMy father had mentioned it during a recent conversation about expanding our family’s holdings in the capital. This mansion had been constructed just months ago by a master builder who specialized in creating residences for the highest nobility. The Duke had been seriously considering purchasing it to establish a permanent Blackwood presence near the Royal Palace and academy.\nAnd now the deed sat in my possession, courtesy of the daily reward system.\nStanding before the entrance, I couldn’t help but feel somewhat stunned. Although I hadn’t received combat equipment or magical items, this deed was worth its weight in gold several times over. Getting a property valued at multiple millions of golden coins was an extraordinary windfall.\nThe mansion itself was impressive without being ostentatious. The exterior featured clean white walls that gleamed in the afternoon sunlight, their pristine appearance showing the expert maintenance. The architecture followed classical design principles - balanced proportions, elegant columns flanking the main entrance, and large windows that would provide excellent natural lighting.\nThe grounds were equally impressive. A huge front garden stretched before the main building, carefully landscaped with manicured lawns and ornamental flower beds displaying seasonal blooms. A rocky pathway curved gracefully from the entrance gate to the front doors, bordered by meticulously trimmed hedges.\nTrees had been strategically placed throughout the property to provide shade and aesthetic appeal without overwhelming the space. I could see a fountain in the central courtyard, its water features adding both visual interest and pleasant ambient sound.\nThe entire estate was enclosed by a tasteful wall that provided security without appearing fortress-like. The iron gates at the entrance bore no family crest yet, leaving them available for customization.\nFive thousand square feet meant substantial interior space - enough for living quarters, entertainment areas, study rooms, and servant accommodations. This was a property designed for someone of significant social standing to host gatherings and conduct business while maintaining appropriate noble standards.\nI approached the main entrance with the deed in hand, eager to see what the interior revealed.",

      "content": "Chapter 141: Using the Mask [1]\nI unlocked the main entrance with the key that had materialized alongside the deed and stepped inside. The interior was as impressive as the exterior promised, though currently unfurnished and waiting for someone to make it their own.\nThe entrance hall was spacious and bright, with polished marble flooring that reflected the natural light streaming through tall windows. A grand staircase curved upward to the second floor, its elegant railings and wide steps designed to make an impression on visitors.\nMoving through the ground floor, I discovered a large formal reception room that could easily accommodate fifty guests for social gatherings. The high ceilings and excellent acoustics made it perfect for entertaining, but as I stood in the empty space, a different vision emerged.\n’This could be a cinema room,’ I thought, my mind racing with possibilities from my previous life. The dimensions were ideal - I could install tiered seating, projection equipment using magical crystals for illumination, and sound enhancement enchantments. A private theater where I could recreate the movie-watching experience from Earth would be both personally enjoyable and impressively novel for this world.\nThe only issue was the movies.\nWhere am I going to get movies in this world...I guess I might have to create my own then.\nContinuing my exploration, I found what appeared to be designed as a formal dining hall. The room was massive, with space for banquet tables and elaborate serving arrangements. But another idea struck me as I examined the layout.\n’This could become a modern entertainment lounge,’ I realized. Gaming tables, comfortable seating areas, perhaps even attempting to recreate arcade-style games using magical interfaces. The concepts from Earth could be adapted with this world’s magical technology.\nThe kitchen area was large and well-equipped with magical appliances for food preservation and preparation. At least this space could maintain its intended purpose, though I’d likely modernize the equipment with innovations inspired by Earth’s culinary technology.\nMoving to the second floor, I discovered several bedroom suites, each with private bathing facilities. One particularly large room at the end of the corridor caught my attention immediately.\nThe space was enormous - probably intended as a master bedroom suite - but its attached bathroom area gave me ideas. The existing bathing chamber featured a sunken pool-style bath and excellent ventilation, but I could envision something far more luxurious.\n’A proper spa and jacuzzi setup,’ I thought with growing excitement. Hot tubs with magical heating and water jets, separate sauna and steam rooms, massage areas with enchanted tables that could provide therapeutic benefits. This world had healing magic, but combining it with Earth’s wellness concepts could create something genuinely unique.\nAnother large room on the second floor appeared designed as a study or library, with built-in shelving and excellent natural lighting. This could remain relatively traditional, though I’d certainly stock it with both this world’s knowledge and whatever information I could recreate from my previous life.\nThe third floor surprised me with its open layout - a massive space that currently served no obvious purpose. Standing in the centre, I could imagine multiple possibilities.\n’A personal training facility would be nice,’\nThe basement level offered even more potential. Several large, climate-controlled rooms that were probably intended for wine storage or food preservation could be repurposed entirely.\n’Underground pool? Indoor sports court? Maybe even a magical workshop separate from the estate’s main areas,’ I considered. The possibilities seemed endless.\nWalking back through the mansion, I felt genuine excitement building. This wasn’t just valuable real estate - this was an opportunity to create a modern living space that combined this world’s magical advantages with Earth’s comfort and entertainment concepts.\nThe daily reward system had given me a personal sanctuary where I could experiment, relax, and build something entirely unique that this world had never seen before.\nAfter thoroughly checking the house and mentally cataloguing all the renovation possibilities, I decided to wait until night-time before pursuing another critical objective. My blood supplies were running dangerously low, and more importantly, my soul power accumulation had stagnated completely over the past week.\nI needed to hunt.\nWhen darkness fell properly over the capital, I slipped on the mask I kept for exactly these purposes. The enchanted item altered my appearance to show my original Earth features - a face that bore no resemblance to Adrian Blackwood and would prevent identification even if someone caught glimpses of me during the hunt.\nThe anonymity was essential. I couldn’t afford to have the Blackwood family’s enemies tracking my movements or identifying my hunting patterns. More practically, I needed fresh blood supplies and soul power absorption from defeated beasts, activities that were easier conducted without witnesses.\nMy standards had evolved significantly since my early awakening days. I no longer cared about Noble-rank or even low Elite-rank beasts - their blood was too weak, their hides too common, and their soul power too negligible to justify the effort. After tasting the potency of high Elite and Transcendent-rank blood, consuming lesser specimens felt almost disgusting by comparison.\nI left the mansion through a side exit, immediately beginning a deliberately convoluted route through the capital’s back streets and alleyways.\nMultiple turns, seemingly random direction changes, doubling back through covered passages, all designed to ensure nobody could follow my trail even with the mask concealing my identity.\nMy families’ enemies were sophisticated and patient. I wouldn’t make the mistake of underestimating their surveillance capabilities or assuming the mask alone provided sufficient protection.\nAfter thirty minutes of careful navigation, I was confident no tail had managed to track me successfully. Only then did I retrieve my skateboard and accelerate toward the wilderness areas beyond the city walls.\nI wasn’t worried about anyone catching me. It was night time, and the skateboards were no longer a thing only exclusive to me.\nZoom! Speed!\nI blurred through the forest at enhanced velocity, my bloodline-improved senses easily navigating the dark terrain.\nLesser beasts appeared occasionally in my path, but I ignored them completely even when they were foolish enough to attack.\nGrowl! Lunge!\nA Noble-rank wolf attempted to intercept me, clearly not recognizing my true strength since I kept my aura suppressed.",

      "content": "Chapter 144: Transcendent Prey\nAdditionally, the probability of gaining a new echo or aspect from such concentrated combat was high. Mass elimination events often triggered bloodline evolution responses that single fights couldn’t match.\n’A mosquito’s leg is still meat, no matter how small,’ I reminded myself with grim satisfaction.\nEvery Elite-rank Thornback represented incremental progress. Every high-Elite specimen added meaningful soul power. And the three Transcendent defenders would provide substantial advancement once I possessed the strength to defeat them.\nThis nest was a treasure trove waiting to be harvested, I just needed to become strong enough to claim it properly.\nI left the Thornback nest area and continued deeper into the hunting grounds, searching for suitable prey that would provide meaningful soul power without requiring me to engage entire colonies or overwhelming numbers.\nThe forest grew denser as I moved further from civilization, the ambient mana concentration increasing to levels that would disorient inexperienced awakeners.\nMy senses detected various beast signatures throughout the territory. Though some were too weak to bother with, others already engaged in their own hunts. I needed something specific: a solitary Transcendent-rank creature that I could defeat through skill and tactics rather than overwhelming power.\nAfter approximately twenty minutes of careful searching, I detected exactly what I needed.\nThis one gas a distinct aura... it’s powerful...\nThe magical signature emanated from a clearing ahead, carrying the unmistakable density of Transcendent rank but lacking the cooperative pack mentality that made group hunts so dangerous.\nI approached cautiously, using the dense vegetation as cover while assessing my target.\nWhat emerged into view was a massive wild yellow boar and \"wild\" barely captured its formidable nature.\nThe creature stood nearly six feet tall at the shoulder, its body covered in coarse yellow fur that seemed to shimmer with energy. Six powerful legs supported its massive body, each one ending in hooves that had carved deep gouges into the surrounding earth.\nTwo wickedly curved horns protruded from its skull, each one glowing faintly with the same yellow energy that permeated its fur. The beast radiated an aura of low Transcendent rank - strong enough to be dangerous, but within the range I could potentially defeat without complications.\nWith the assessment complete... I was ready to engage.\nI stepped into the clearing deliberately, no longer concealing my presence. The yellow boar’s head snapped toward me immediately, its small eyes reflecting vigilance as it recognized a challenger.\nSNORT!\nThe creature pawed at the ground with its front legs, creating small craters as it prepared to charge. Steam emanated from its nostrils, and the yellow aura around its body intensified visibly.\nI drew my rare-rank sword and activated my blood enhancement, feeling the familiar surge of power flood through my system.\nCHARGE!\nThat’s a bloodline trait!\nThe boar launched itself forward with explosive speed, its entire body engulfed in blazing yellow aura that left scorched earth in its wake. The charging skill transformed it into a living battering ram, capable of shattering stone and crushing steel.\nI threw myself sideways at the last possible moment, the boar’s massive form thundering past my previous position. The displaced air felt like a physical blow, and I could smell the acrid scent of burned vegetation from its aura trail.\nI counterattacked while it was recovering from the missed charge, my blade carving a deep gash along its flank. Blood sprayed from the wound, but the creature’s thick hide and supernatural constitution prevented it from being a critical injury.\nROAR!\nThe yellow boar spun with surprising agility for its size, and I saw energy gathering in its twin horns. The glow intensified dramatically as it prepared its second bloodline skill.\nBLAST!\nTwin beams of concentrated yellow energy erupted from the horns, converging on my position with devastating force. The attack carved through trees behind where I’d been standing, leaving smoking craters and shattered wood.\nI barely avoided the energy blast by channeling maximum blood enhancement into my legs, moving faster than the boar could track. The beams swept across the clearing, searching for me as the creature tried to adjust its aim.\nWhile the beast was focused on its energy attack, I activated my Blood Control trait with a goal in mind. Reaching out with invisible manipulation, I targeted the blood vessels behind one of the boar’s eyes and commanded them to rupture.\nPop\nThe yellow boar’s roar of pain echoed through the forest as its left eye exploded from internal pressure. Blood streamed down its face, and the energy blast from its horns cut off abruptly as the creature staggered from the sudden trauma.\nBut I wasn’t finished with my blood manipulation assault, with its body in shock, I doubled down on the effects.\nI targeted the major blood vessels near its brain, creating temporary clots that disrupted circulation and oxygen flow. The technique was difficult, requiring precise control to create the stroke effect.\nStumble!\nThe boar’s legs buckled slightly as the artificial stroke took effect. Its movements became uncoordinated, its remaining eye unfocused as its brain struggled to function with disrupted blood flow.\nThat’s the opening! Strike Now!\nI charged forward with my blade, targeting the creature’s exposed neck. This was my opportunity to land a decisive blow while it remained vulnerable.\nSLASH!\nMy rare-rank sword carved through thick hide and muscle, opening a massive wound that sprayed Transcendent-rank blood across the clearing. The boar’s roar became a gurgling sound as the blade damaged critical structures.\nBut Transcendent beasts didn’t die easily. The yellow boar’s survival instincts kicked in, and it began channeling its bloodline power for another devastating charge despite its injuries. The yellow aura flared even brighter than before.\nThis is an all-or-nothing attack. It’s trying risking everything, it felt its impending doom.\nThe creature launched itself at me with suicidal determination, its entire body becoming a projectile of compressed energy and physical mass. Even with one eye destroyed and blood pouring from multiple wounds, the attack carried enough force to pulverize anything it connected with.\nI could dodge again, but that would just prolong the fight.\nTime to end this decisively.",

      "content": "Chapter 145: transcendent Prey [2]\nNull Strike.\nWOOOOM!\nThe invisible sphere of absolute negation erupted around me at the precise moment of impact. The yellow boar’s devastating charge - all that accumulated energy, bloodline power, and desperate momentum - simply ceased to exist as it entered the technique’s radius.\nThe creature’s remaining eye widened in complete disbelief as its ultimate attack was negated entirely. The yellow aura surrounding its body flickered and died, leaving it vulnerable and exposed just feet away from my position.\nI channeled every bit of blood enhancement into one decisive blow, my blade glowing crimson with concentrated power. The sword descended toward the stunned boar’s neck with supernatural speed and strength.\nSLASH!\nThe enhanced strike severed the creature’s head completely, sending it tumbling across the clearing while the massive body collapsed with a ground-shaking impact.\nI felt the familiar sensation of soul power flowing into me from the defeated Transcendent beast.\nThe essence was substantially more potent than Elite-rank absorption this single kill provided progress equivalent to dozens of peak elite creatures.\nThe combat had pushed me harder than recent fights, but the combination of blood manipulation, skill usage, and the Null Strike technique made it easier.\nThe yellow boar had never stood a real chance once I’d applied pressure from multiple angles.\nI approached the corpse and began extracting its Transcendent-rank blood, the golden-yellow liquid filling multiple vials with precious enhancement material. This quality of blood would provide significant power when used for future combat or simply used for my feeding.\nThe hunt was proving successful. One Transcendent beast eliminated, valuable resources acquired, and meaningful soul power accumulated toward my eventual rank advancement.\nI continued searching through the hunting grounds with renewed focus, my enhanced senses scanning for additional Transcendent-rank prey. The soul power from the yellow boar had been decent, but I needed more to make meaningful progress toward my goals.\nMinutes later, I detected another promising signature - the distinctive aura pattern of a creature I actually recognized from my own studies.\nThere... perfect target...\nA massive Stone-Hide Bear lumbered through a rocky clearing ahead, its body covered in natural armor that resembled granite plating. The creature stood nearly twelve feet tall when upright, with thick limbs that could crush boulders and claws that carved through solid rock.\nLow Transcendent rank, just like the boar.\nMore importantly, I had studied this species during monster ecology classes. The Instructor had dedicated an entire lecture to Stone-Hide Bears, emphasizing their weaknesses alongside their formidable strengths.\nThey were really common because they were a part of one of the strongest clan in the surrounding area of the kingdom, the Bear clan.\nKnees... that’s the key...\nThe creature’s massive body was supported by relatively vulnerable knee joints. Once those joints were compromised, the bear’s own weight became a liability rather than an asset. With both knees broken, the creature would be immobilized and easy to finish.\nI didn’t waste time on long observation. Knowledge was power, and I possessed exactly what I needed to end this fight quickly.\nI channeled a good blood from my vials, forming it into a massive mace - an effective bludgeoning weapon designed specifically for crushing things.\nWhoosh!\nI sent the blood mace hurtling through the air like a missile, guided by my [Blood Control] trait toward the bear’s right knee joint. The projectile moved with devastating velocity, ensuring a powerful impact.\nCRACK!\nIndeed, just like I expected. The impact was catastrophic. The mace struck the knee joint without fail, shattering bone and tearing ligaments with a sickening crunch that echoed through the clearing.\nROAR!\nThud!\nThe Stone-Hide Bear’s roar of agony was immediate as its right leg buckled completely. The massive creature lurched sideways, struggling to maintain balance on three remaining limbs while its shattered knee rendered one leg useless.\nA gust of wind sent leaves flying as I charged forward while the beast was off-balance, my enhanced sword already positioned for a devastating follow-up strike. No time to let it recover or adapt to the injury.\nSLASH!\nMy blade carved through the bear’s left knee with enhanced cutting power, slicing through the thick hide that normally resisted conventional weapons. I targeted the tendons and ligaments specifically, applying the anatomical knowledge from my studies.\nCollapse!\nWith both knees destroyed, the Stone-Hide Bear crashed to the ground with tremendous force. Its massive body became a prison rather than an advantage - the creature simply couldn’t move effectively without functional legs.\nIt thrashed desperately, claws gouging the earth and jaws snapping at empty air, but the tactical situation was decided. An immobilized Transcendent beast was just a matter of execution.\nI positioned myself carefully and drove my sword deep into the creature’s chest, piercing through the stone-like hide and penetrating directly into its heart. The strike would have been nearly impossible against a mobile opponent, but with the bear pinned by its own weight, it was straightforward.\nThe moment my blade penetrated the heart muscle, I activated my Blood Control trait with lethal intent. I manipulated the bear’s own blood, forcing it to flow at dramatically accelerated rates that the damaged heart couldn’t sustain.\nThe combination of physical damage and forced blood manipulation created catastrophic internal bleeding. The heart muscle, already pierced by my sword, couldn’t withstand the pressure I was applying.\nManipulating the blood inside the heart would have been almosg impossible had I not damaged it severely due to the difficulty of such an action.\nWithin seconds, the Stone-Hide Bear’s struggles weakened dramatically. Its roar faded to a gurgle, then silence, as massive internal hemorrhaging caused rapid system failure.\nThe familiar sensation of Transcendent-rank soul power flowing into me confirmed the kill. This essence combined with the yellow boar’s contribution, creating meaningful progress toward my eventual rank advancement.\nThe entire fight had lasted less than two minutes from initial engagement to final death. Academic study combined with tactical application had transformed what could have been a prolonged battle into a quick fight.\nI withdrew my blade and began extracting the bear’s blood, noting the unusual thickness and earth-affinity properties that might prove useful for specific enhancement applications.\nBefore I attempted to extract the Stone-Hide Bear’s blood, a familiar notification pulsed through my consciousness, the sensation that always accompanied significant development.\n[You have gained the aspect: Strong Body]",

      "content": "Chapter 146: Advancing in Rank!\n[Aspect: Strong Body]\n[Rank: Transcendent]\n[Type: Passive]\n[Details: Permanently increases the user’s physical durability and defensive capabilities by 25%. This enhancement affects skin resilience, bone density, muscle toughness, and internal organ protection. The aspect draws upon the Stone-Hide Bear’s natural armor properties, granting similar defensive characteristics without the mobility penalties that plagued the original creature. Unlike active aspects, this ability remains constantly active without mana expenditure or cooldown restrictions.]\nA smile formed on my face as I processed the implications. This was exactly the kind of passive enhancement I needed - constant defensive improvement that would stack with my Stone Armor Echo for even greater protection.\nThe 25% increase meant attacks that would have caused serious injury would now only deal moderate damage, and blows that might have been fatal could potentially be survived.\nThe aspect’s origin from the Stone-Hide Bear was fitting. By studying and exploiting the creature’s weaknesses, I’d absorbed not just its soul power but also adapted its greatest strength into a form that suited my combat style perfectly.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nWith the new Strong Body aspect providing constant defensive enhancement and the accumulated soul power from two Transcendent kills, I felt significantly more confident about eventually tackling the Thornback nest by myself.\nThe passive 25% durability increase would be crucial when facing swarm tactics from dozens of Elite-rank and transcendent rank spiders.\nHowever, I could sense something else - a familiar sensation that indicated I was extremely close to advancing from mid-Elite rank to high-Elite rank. The soul power accumulation was nearly complete, just requiring one or two more substantial kills to trigger the breakthrough.\nTo maximize my chances of survival during the nest assault, I decided to eliminate another beast or two at Transcendent rank before attempting that dangerous operation. Every advantage mattered when facing overwhelming numbers, and entering at high-Elite rank with additional combat experience would be significantly better than rushing in prematurely.\nBefore continuing the hunt, I turned my attention to the Stone-Hide Bear’s corpse. Wasting valuable materials would be foolish when I had the time and storage capacity to harvest them properly.\nI quickly dissected the massive creature with efficiency, my enhanced strength and sharp blade making the work manageable despite the tough hide. The bones were incredibly dense and strong - perfect base materials for crafting durable weapons or reinforced equipment. I extracted several large bone sections and stored them in my spatial ring.\nThe tendons and ligaments possessed unusual elasticity despite their thickness, suggesting applications in bowstrings or flexible armor components. I carefully removed the most intact specimens and preserved them properly.\nVarious organs showed promise for alchemical applications - the heart with its earth-affinity properties, certain glands that produced defensive secretions, even the creature’s blood had unique characteristics worth preserving beyond simple consumption.\nThe hide itself would fetch excellent prices or could be crafted into superior armor, though processing it properly would require specialized equipment I didn’t have in the field but as the son of a duke, that wasn’t an issur.\nAfter approximately ten minutes of harvesting, I had collected everything valuable and portable. The remaining carcass would feed scavengers and return nutrients to the forest ecosystem.\nTime to continue hunting... more prey needed...\nI left the clearing and resumed my search for additional Transcendent-rank opponents, my enhanced senses scanning the surrounding territories while my newly acquired Strong Body aspect provided reassuring passive protection.\nThe night was still young, and I had more beasts to eliminate before dawn arrived.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nI continued through the hunting grounds with stealth, my enhanced senses leading me to a Transcendent-rank Flame Wolf that had been stalking prey near a volcanic spring.\nA volcanic spring was a natural occurrence due to mana. The creature’s fire-based abilities made it dangerous to others, but it wasn’t for me.\nThe fight was brief but intense, the wolf’s flames scorched the surrounding vegetation, but I used Blood Control to create internal disruptions that weakened its coordination. A well-timed Null Strike negated its most powerful fire blast, and my sword found its throat before it could recover.\nSoul power absorption...\nThe Transcendent essence flowed into me, and I felt something slowly change within my core. The accumulated soul power from three Transcendent beasts was about to trigger the breakthrough I’d been sensing.\n[You have advanced to High Elite Rank]\nThe transformation was immediate and profound. My body felt stronger, my mana reserves deepened, and my bloodline traits operated with noticeably greater efficiency. The rank advancement represented a meaningful leap in overall capability.\nAfter advancing it was time to return to the nest, I had spiders to eliminate.\nOn my way back, I encountered peak Elite-rank beasts, as I fought I realized something significant. I was now strong enough to directly target and rupture their hearts without worrying about mana.\nA peak Elite-rank deer with distinctive red antlers appeared in my path. Instead of drawing my sword, I simply focused my Blood Control trait on the creature’s heart.\nBurst!\nThe stag collapsed instantly as I commanded its heart to explode from within. The technique required a decent amount of mana and precise control, but against peak Elite opponents it was now feasible.\nThud\nThat was immediate death...without touching it.\nI moved on to the next target - a Sapphire Serpent coiled around a tree.\nSame technique, same result. The creature died before it even registered the threat.\nAgainst Transcendent-rank beasts, this instant-kill method remained somewhat difficult. Their stronger constitutions, enhanced mana resistance, and more robust circulatory systems made direct heart manipulation extremely difficult and mana-intensive.\nI could still create disruptions and clots as I’d done with the yellow boar at a larger scale, but outright bursting a Transcendent heart would drain my reserves dangerously.\nBut for peak Elite specimens? The technique was devastatingly efficient.\nAnother target... Stone Badger...\nI encountered a heavily armored peak Elite badger that would normally required me to fight it and to penetrate its defenses using my sword. Instead, I simply reached through its body with invisible blood manipulation and crushed its heart.\nWithin thirty minutes, I had eliminated eight peak Elite-rank beasts through this method, accumulating their blood and soul power without wasting time on extended fights.\nThe mana expenditure was manageable. My enhanced mana regeneration at high-Elite rank meant I could sustain this hunting pace for a really long time.",

      "content": "Chapter 147: The Nest Fight [1]\nI arrived back at the Thornback nest with renewed confidence, my newly advanced high-Elite rank and new aspect were reassuring. What had seemed like a gamble hours ago now felt like a manageable challenge.\n\"Time to clear out this infestation,\" I muttered with anticipation, a predatory smile forming on my face.\nUnlike my previous cautious reconnaissance, I didn’t bother activating Silent Predator or suppressing my aura. There was no point in stealth when my intention was total extermination. Every spider in this nest was going to die tonight - nothing would leave this place alive.\nI strode directly toward the entrance.\nPat! Pat! Pat!\nRain poured outside like the clouds could no longer hold it in.\nThe familiar webbed interior appeared as I crossed the threshold, but this time I wasn’t sneaking past patrols.\nAlmost immediately, I encountered my first targets. Three Noble-rank Thornbacks scurrying along the wall on some routine patrol or maintenance task. Their multiple eyes registered my presence, their sharp legs beginning to shift into defensive positions.\nThey never got the chance to attack.\nBlood Control! Heart Burst!\nI focused my trait on all three simultaneously, commanding their hearts to rupture from within. The technique was effortless against Noble-rank opponents - their cardiovascular systems offered virtually no resistance to my blood manipulation.\nPop! Pop! Pop!\nThe spiders collapsed instantly, their bodies convulsing once before going still. Blood oozed from their mouths and leg joints, pooling beneath their corpses as their circulatory systems failed catastrophically.\nI continued forward without pause, leaving the intact carapaces behind. The hard exoskeletons remained completely undamaged by my internal attack method - those shells would fetch excellent prices from merchants who specialized in monster materials.\nMore targets ahead...\nA larger group appeared as I moved deeper - ten Thornbacks of various sizes emerging from a side passage. Nine were Noble-rank workers, but one larger specimen at the front registered as mid Elite-rank, likely a patrol leader.\nThey detected the blood scent from my previous kills and began advancing aggressively, their sharp legs clicking against stone in coordinated rhythm.\nI targeted all ten hearts simultaneously, pushing my trait to handle multiple opponents at once. The Noble-rank specimens died instantly as before, but the Elite-rank leader’s stronger constitution provided a split second of resistance.\nThe patrol leader managed to take half a lurching step forward before its heart ruptured completely, joining its subordinates in a spreading pool of spider blood.\n\"Efficient,\" I noted with satisfaction, already moving past the corpses.\nBursting hearts proved remarkably useful for resource harvesting. The carapaces remained pristine and undamaged, meaning I could sell them for premium prices rather than dealing with the reduced value of combat-damaged shells. The technique was both tactically effective and economically sound.\nDeeper... stronger specimens...\nAs I penetrated further into the nest’s interior, the ambient mana density increased and the spider sizes grew noticeably larger. These were the mid-Elite and high-Elite specimens that formed the colony’s primary defence force.\nA group of five appeared ahead, each one registering as mid-Elite rank with the enhanced auras of experienced combatants. Their multiple eyes reflected intelligence beyond the instinct-driven behavior of lesser specimens.\nBlood Control! Execute!\nI targeted their hearts with concentrated force, but these stronger spiders possessed enough constitution to resist momentarily. Their bodies convulsed violently as they fought against the internal attack.\nSHRIEK! SHRIEK! SHRIEK!\nBefore dying, three of them managed to release piercing alarm calls that vibrated through the entire nest structure. The high-frequency sound would alert every spider in the colony to the intrusion.\nIt seems like the warning has been issued...Well, irrelevant.\nI didn’t panic at the alarm. In fact, I welcomed it. Having all the spiders converge on my position would be more efficient than hunting them individually through the maze of passages.\nPop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!\nThe mid-Elite Thornbacks finally succumbed to the heart rupture technique, collapsing in rapid succession as their cardiovascular systems failed. Blood pooled beneath their larger bodies in quantities that shouldn’t be wasted.\nBlood Control! Harvest!\nI drew the spider blood from the corpses, collecting it into storage vials. Thornback blood had unique properties - its venomous characteristics and natural anticoagulants made it valuable for certain alchemical applications and weapon enchantments.\nMore importantly, I could use their blood for creating blood weapons during the upcoming fight rather than depleting my existing supply of higher-quality Transcendent blood. Why waste premium resources when abundant inferior alternatives were available?\nI hear them... many approaching...\nThe nest erupted with activity as the alarm call triggered colony-wide response. I could hear the clicking of hundreds of sharp legs against stone, the rustling of disturbed webbing, and the aggressive chittering of aroused Thornbacks converging on my position from multiple directions.\nCome... all of you...\nI activated my blood enhancement fully and drew my rare-rank sword, the blade gleaming with crimson energy as I prepared for the swarm assault. The collected spider blood began forming into additional weapons above my head - spears, blades, and projectiles ready to launch at my command.\nMy Strong Body aspect provided passive protection that would prove crucial when surrounded. My Stone Armor Echo could be activated if the pressure became overwhelming. And my various bloodline traits had proven effective against everything from Noble to Transcendent rank opponents.\nThe Thornback colony had survived for decades in these caves, eliminating countless adventurers who dared disturb their domain.\nTonight, that reign would end.\nThe first wave of responding spiders appeared from three separate passages simultaneously, easily thirty Elite-rank Thornbacks advancing with coordinated aggression born from hive-mind communication.\nI smiled grimly and launched my blood weapons forward while simultaneously targeting their cardiovascular systems with internal manipulation.\nThe slaughter was about to begin in earnest.\nThe first wave crashed into my position like a tidal wave of chitin and venom. Thirty Elite-rank Thornbacks converged from multiple passages, their sharp legs clicking in synchronized rhythm as hive-mind coordination drove them forward.\nSPIT! VENOM SPRAY!\nMultiple spiders launched streams of corrosive liquid at me simultaneously, the large amount of yellowish venom was capable of melting through steel armor.",

      "content": "Chapter 148: The Nest Fight [2]\nI dodged the initial volleys with my speed, but the confined space made complete evasion impossible.\nSplash!\nSeveral venom streams struck my chest and arm, the corrosive substance immediately beginning to eat through clothing and reaching skin. But my newly acquired Strong Body aspect and enhanced constitution meant the damage was superficial - very subtle burning rather than the devastating flesh-melting that would affect normal opponents.\nAnother group fired sticky webbing projectiles designed to immobilize prey. The strands were supernaturally strong, capable of restraining even Elite-rank awakeners through sheer tensile strength.\nSlash! Cut Through!\nI carved through the incoming webs with my blade, the blood energy coating my sword burning through the sticky material before it could properly bind me. A few strands managed to catch my left leg, but I simply tore through them.\nI targeted ten spiders simultaneously, commanding their hearts to rupture from within. The technique was becoming almost effortless with practice and my increased rank.\nPop! Pop! Pop!\nThe targeted Thornbacks convulsed and died, their bodies creating obstacles that disrupted the advance of those behind them. But more kept coming - the colony’s numbers seemed endless.\nRather than let the spider blood pool uselessly, I activated my Blood Control trait to draw their essence to create more weapons. The inferior blood couldn’t match Transcendent-quality resources, but quantity had its own advantages.\nThe spider blood reformed into deadly projectiles above my head - dozens of crystallized blood spears that would cost enormous mana if created from my personal reserves. But using the enemies’ own blood as ammunition? That was resource-efficient.\nThe blood spears shot forward like a crimson rain, each one targeting vital points on approaching spiders. The projectiles punched through exoskeletons with devastating force, creating a barrier of impaled corpses between me and the next wave.\nI reached for the artifact hanging around my neck and channelled blood into its enchantments. The pendant’s unique ability allowed me to burn blood as fuel for enhanced power - and I had abundant fuel available from dozens of spider corpses.\nBURN! Power Surge!\nThe pendant flared with brilliant red light as it consumed spider blood like a furnace consuming coal. My physical capabilities spiked beyond even my blood enhancement’s normal output. Strength, speed, and durability all increased as the artifact converted biological material into raw power.\nEach sword strike carved through multiple spiders, each movement left afterimages, and each defensive position became an impenetrable fortress.\nSlash! Decapitate Three!\nMy blade moved so fast, severing heads from bodies in sweeping arcs that left no room for counterattack.\nBlood Spear! Mass Launch!\nMore projectiles formed from harvested blood and launched continuously, creating a rhythm of death that the spiders couldn’t penetrate. For every one that fell, its blood became ammunition for killing two more.\nSHRIEK! ATTACK! OVERWHELM!\nThe spiders attempted coordinated rushes from multiple angles, trying to use their numbers to drag me down through sheer mass. Dozens of sharp legs struck at my position, venomous bites sought exposed flesh, and sticky webs tried to bind my movements.\nStrong Body! Absorb Impacts!\nMy passive defensive aspect proved its worth as attacks that should have pierced skin merely left bruises. Bites that should have injected lethal venom were absorbed by my enhanced constitution. The spiders were discovering that I was far more durable than any prey they’d encountered before.\nCounterattack! Devastating Response!\nEvery failed spider attack created openings that I exploited ruthlessly. A bite attempt became a severed head. A leg strike became a burst heart.\nA web launch became impalement by blood spear.\nFifty dead... seventy... ninety...\nThe body count climbed rapidly as I eliminated everything that entered the central chamber. Elite-rank Thornbacks ranging from newly low rank specimens to peak-level. They all fell before me like swarms of flies.\nThe confined space that should have been my disadvantage became a killing field. Where warriors would be overwhelmed by attacking from all angles, I thrived on the density of targets. More enemies meant more blood to harvest, more fuel for my pendant, and more opportunities.\nNearly one hundred dead... where are the leaders? Are they planning to just watch?\nThe swarm was thinning noticeably now. The initial wave of Elite-rank defenders had been decimated, their bodies creating a literal carpet of corpses and pooled blood that made footing treacherous for anything trying to advance.\nThen I felt them - three powerful auras approaching from the nest’s deepest chambers.\nSHRIEK! SHRIEK! SHRIEK!\nThe three Transcendent-rank Thornbacks finally arrived, their massive forms appearing at the chamber’s far entrance. These were the alpha specimens I’d observed during my initial scouting, each one twice the size of Elite specimens, with battle-scarred exoskeletons and eyes that burned with fury.\nThey surveyed the massacre with what could only be described as shock and rage. Nearly a hundred of their colony lay dead in minutes, slaughtered by a single intruder.\nI looked at the three arrivals with a blood-splattered smile, my sword dripping with spider blood and my aura blazing like a crimson beacon.\n\"Took you long enough, I was starting to think you weren’t going to show up to your own extinction party.\"\nThe mockery enraged the Transcendent Thornbacks beyond rational thought which was exactly what I intended.\nAll three launched themselves at me simultaneously, their combined fury promising that the real fight was finally beginning.\nThere were approximately fifteen Elite-rank spiders remaining from the initial swarm, scattered throughout the chamber and passages. When they witnessed the three Transcendent alphas launching their furious charge, the survivors immediately joined the assault with renewed aggression.\nThe Transcendent Thornbacks led the coordinated assault, their massive forms thundering across the corpse-strewn floor while the Elite survivors followed in supporting positions. The combined force represented the colony’s final desperate defence - everything they had left to throw at the intruder who had massacred their numbers.\nThe three Transcendent specimens moved with terrifying coordination. The largest took point position, its battle-scarred carapace acting as a battering ram. The other two flanked wide, attempting to surround my position while the Elite survivors swarmed from multiple angles.",

Taking the initiative was crucial when facing multiple Transcendent opponents and Elite support simultaneously.\nMy blood enhancement surged to maximum output, every muscle fiber flooded with more power as I launched myself forward to meet their charge head-on. The Crimson Moon Pendant burned even brighter, consuming spider blood at an accelerated rate to fuel abilities beyond my normal limits.\nThe largest Transcendent crashed toward me like a living battering ram, its massive carapace gleaming with natural Armor that had turned aside countless weapons. Behind it, the two flanking alphas spread wide while Elite survivors rushed in to fill gaps and create overwhelming pressure.\nI targeted the lead Transcendent with a devastating sword strike, my enhanced blade carving through one of its forward legs. The limb separated cleanly, spraying ichor across the stone floor as the creature stumbled from the sudden imbalance.\nSlash! Severed!\nBefore it could recover, I pivoted and drove a blood spear through another leg joint, further destabilizing its charge. The massive spider crashed sideways into the chamber wall, creating an opening I exploited immediately.\nThe Elite survivors attempted to capitalize on my committed position, launching venomous projectiles and web attacks from multiple directions simultaneously. Their attack was admirable, attacking from angles that should have been impossible to defend.\n’Null Strike.’\nThe sphere of absolute negation erupted around me precisely as the attacks converged. Venom streams, sticky webs, and physical strikes simply ceased to exist upon entering the technique’s radius. The spiders recoiled in confusion as their coordinated assault was negated entirely.\nI used the momentary disruption to eliminate five Elite specimens with rapid heart burst techniques, their bodies dropping instantly as I continued moving, constantly repositioning to prevent them from landing an effective attack.\nThe second Transcendent alpha attempted a sweeping leg strike designed to knock me off balance while its companion prepared a venomous bite attack. The combination would have worked against other opponents, forced to dodge one attack directly into the other.\nInstead, I activated my Stone Armor Echo, the defensive coating spreading across my body just as the leg strike connected. The impact that should have shattered bones barely knocked me sideways, and I used the momentum to spin and deliver a devastating counterstrike.\nCRACK!\nMy blood-enhanced blade punched through the Transcendent’s natural armor, carving deep into its thorax and creating catastrophic internal damage.\nSHRIEK!\nThe shriek of pain echoed through the chamber as vital fluids sprayed from the massive wound.\nThree more Elite spiders died to blood spear projectiles as I continued the relentless assault, their bodies adding to the growing carpet of corpses. The survivors were beginning to show hesitation, their hive-mind recognizing that this fight wasn’t going according to their plan.\nThe third Transcendent alpha, seeing its companions injured, attempted to retreat and regroup. I couldn’t allow them to withdraw, letting them escape would just prolong the extermination.\nI launched a massive blood tentacle formed from the harvested spider blood on the floor. The tentacle wrapped around the retreating Transcendent’s rear legs. The creature thrashed violently, but I channelled more mana through the blood manipulation to drag it back into combat range.\nOnce it was within range, my sword found its eyes, blinding the creature with precise strikes that left it disoriented and vulnerable.\nI continued with a follow-up attack that targeted the joint where its head connected to its body, carving through the natural armor with blood-enhanced cutting power that came from the rare-rank weapon\nWhoosh!\nThe third Transcendent’s head separated from its body, the massive corpse collapsing with ground-shaking impact.\nOne alpha down, two remaining, and seven Elite survivors still attempting futile attacks.\nThe injured Transcendent from my initial assault tried to compensate for its severed legs by using venomous spray attacks, coating the entire chamber with corrosive liquid that hissed and bubbled against stone.\nThe enclosed space made complete evasion impossible.\nMy Strong Body aspect and enhanced constitution absorbed the damage that penetrated my defenses. The venom burned, but it didn’t incapacitate or slow me meaningfully.\nI closed distance with the injured Transcendent and activated Blood Control with lethal precision, targeting not its heart but the major blood vessels feeding its brain. The technique created artificial stroke effects that disrupted its coordination completely.\nThe creature’s legs buckled as neurological function failed, its body betraying it at the worst possible moment. My blade found its throat, then its heart, ending its existence with brutal efficiency.\nTwo Transcendent alphas eliminated. One remaining, along with seven increasingly desperate Elite specimens.\nThe final Transcendent recognized it was alone against an opponent who had just massacred nearly its entire colony. Instead of retreating, it committed to a suicidal final charge, channeling every bit of its bloodline power into devastating attacks.\nVenomous spray mixed with physical strikes and web attacks in a combination assault that would have overwhelmed most Transcendent-rank opponents. The spider fought with the desperate fury of a creature that knew death was inevitable but refused to go quietly.\nI met its charge with equal intensity, my enhanced abilities operating at absolute peak.\nEvery sword strike carved through chitin and flesh.\nEvery blood spear found vital targets.\nEvery defensive position utilized my high durability to absorb attacks that would kill lesser warriors.\nSlash!\nThe final Transcendent’s head separated from its body mid-charge, its massive corpse sliding across blood-slicked stone to crash against the chamber wall. The impact sent tremors through the entire nest structure.\nThe seven remaining Elite spiders broke formation completely, their hive-mind recognizing total defeat. They scattered in different directions, attempting to flee deeper into the nest or escape to the surface.\nI couldn’t allow survivors.\nWitnesses meant the colony might be reestablished, and incomplete extermination meant wasted effort.\nMy blood spears hunted them down, each projectile guided by my blood trail trait to find targets even when they tried to hide in side passages or beneath webbing.\nHeart burst techniques eliminated those that managed to get further away, their cardiovascular systems rupturing from invisible manipulation.\nFinal kill...\nThe last Elite Thornback died attempting to climb toward an upper tunnel, its heart exploding mid-escape as my Blood Control reached out and ended its existence.\nSilence finally descended on the chamber. The only sounds were my own breathing and the dripping of blood from hundreds of corpses scattered throughout the nest’s passages.\nTotal extermination has been achieved with every spider eliminated.\nThe Thornback colony that had dominated these caves for a long time was now extinct, their final moments spent in futile resistance against an opponent whose capabilities exceeded anything their evolutionary experience had prepared them for.\nI deactivated my Crimson Moon Pendant, conserving what remained of the harvested blood for future use.\nMy enhancements began settling back to normal levels, though the adrenaline and satisfaction of successful combat kept my senses sharp.\nNow came the tedious but profitable work of harvesting materials.\nWith the spiders dead and silence finally settling over the gore-strewn nest, I retrieved my communication crystal and channelled mana to establish a secure connection. After several moments, a familiar voice answered.\n\"Young Master Blackwood. How may I assist you?\"\nI recognized the voice, one of my family’s senior operatives stationed in the capital. The man was discreet, efficient, and knew better than to ask unnecessary questions about orders he was given.\n\"I need an excavation team prepared immediately. Full resource harvesting operation, specialized in monster materials extraction.\"\n\"Understood. What scale are we discussing, young master?\"\n\"Approximately one hundred Elite-rank Thornback corpses, including three Transcendent specimens. Complete nest extermination in the eastern hunting grounds, sector seven.\"\nThere was a brief pause as Marcus processed the magnitude of what I’d just reported. To his credit, his voice remained professionally neutral when he responded.\n\"That’s... quite the number of beasts, young master. I’ll assemble a team of experienced harvesters immediately. They’ll need proper equipment for Thornback carapace extraction and venom collection. I will arrange for secure transport wagons.\"\n\"Good. Also send guards, at least two Transcendent-rank to secure the perimeter. The nest is cleared, but I don’t want scavengers or opportunistic hunters claiming materials that belong to the Blackwood family.\"\n\"Of course. The team will arrive within an hour with full security detail. Anything else required?\"\n\"Discretion. This operation doesn’t need to attract unnecessary attention from rival families or anyone else.\"\n\"Understood completely, young master. Consider it handled.\"\nI terminated the connection and surveyed the massacre surrounding me.\nThe night’s hunting had been extraordinarily profitable, and the monetary returns would be substantial once these materials reached market.\nI waited at the area for the next hour, killing any beast that came within the perimeter of the cave. Monsters in the area were accustomed to the smell of blood, and with the river of blood that I left in the cave, it was no wonder that the cave attracted many beasts, searching for an opportunity.\nBy the time the team arrived, there was nearly twenty beast carapaces outside the cave, although they were nothing crazy. Just a few low elite-rank beasts and some mid-elite beasts.",

      "content": "Chapter 150: Hotel\nI removed my mask and stored it carefully, resuming my normal appearance as Adrian Blackwood. There was no point maintaining my alternate identity with family subordinates, just in case. I wanted this identity to be completely free from my own identity with no ties.\nThe sound of approaching footsteps and equipment echoed from the cave entrance, multiple individuals moving.\n\"Young Master Blackwood?\" A commanding voice called out.\n\"In here,\" I replied calmly.\nThe excavation team entered the main chamber, led by a Transcendent-rank captain whose disciplined bearing marked him as professional security. Behind him, a dozen specialized harvesters carried equipment designed for monster material extraction, while additional guards maintained perimeter positions.\nThe captain stepped into the chamber and froze completely.\nHis eyes swept across the massacre before him - hundreds of spider corpses carpeting the floor, walls splattered with blood and ichor, the massive bodies of three Transcendent Thornbacks dominating the space. The sheer scale of carnage was overwhelming even for someone with his combat experience.\nWhat made his shock even more profound was the obvious fact that only I stood among the dead.\nThere was no other bodies, no sign of additional combatants. Just a single young man waiting calmly in the aftermath of total extermination.\nThe captain’s face showed transparent confusion and dawning realization as he processed the implications. His gaze moved from the corpses to me , then back to the corpses, clearly struggling to reconcile what he was witnessing with what should have been possible.\n\"Young master...\" he began, his voice carrying obvious disbelief. \"Did you...never mind.\"\nI walked over and patted him on the shoulder with a casual gesture. \"Take care of everything, Captain. Harvest what’s valuable, secure what needs preservation, and dispose of the rest appropriately.\"\nThe captain’s expression shifted immediately to one of profound reverence. He straightened his posture and saluted, any trace of scepticism replaced by awed respect.\n\"Yes, Young Master! It will be handled with utmost efficiency!\"\nThis wasn’t just some random awakener giving orders.\nThis was the young master of the Blackwood family - the sole inheritor, the future Duke who would someday command their entire duchy. And he had just demonstrated capabilities that would make experienced Transcendent warriors look inadequate by comparison.\nThe captain turned to his team and began issuing rapid commands, his voice carrying the authority of someone who understood exactly how significant tonight’s operation was.\nWith the excavation team handling the material harvest, I left the cave and made my way back toward the city. Once I was certain no prying eyes could observe me, I retrieved my mask and placed it back on, resuming the anonymous identity that allowed me to move freely without drawing attention to the Blackwood heir.\nThe night’s work had been extraordinarily successful. My power had increased dramatically through multiple rank advancements and soul power absorption.\nThe new Strong Body aspect provided constant defensive enhancement that would prove invaluable in future combat.\nThe blacksmithing materials from Transcendent beasts - bones, tendons, carapaces, represented resources that money couldn’t easily buy. And the monetary returns from selling processed Thornback materials would generate substantial wealth for the family coffers.\nMore money was never something to reject, even as the son of a Duke. Wealth translated to influence, resources, and opportunities that pure combat strength alone couldn’t provide. The excavation team would convert tonight’s massacre into tangible financial gains that could fund future projects and acquisitions.\nAs I walked through the darkened forest paths, my thoughts turned to my father’s mission. I retrieved the Book of Hints from my storage and opened it carefully, focusing my intent on his current status.\nNew text materialized across the page:\nDuke Marcus Blackwood continues travel toward Thornhaven. Combat encounters with scouting beasts eliminated efficiently. Royal-rank footwork technique integration progressing well. Physical condition: excellent. Morale: determined.\nProbability of survival: 62%\nA genuine smile formed on my face beneath the mask. The survival chance had increased by three percentage points since my last check. That meant my father was actively strengthening himself during the journey, likely through his continued practice with the Royal-rank secret art.\nSixty-two percent wasn’t perfect, but it represented a dramatic improvement from the original five percent death sentence. My intervention had mattered, transforming an impossible situation into one with realistic survival odds.\n’Keep getting stronger, Father,’ I thought. ’Come back alive.’\nOnce inside the city walls, I made my way back toward the academy through the quieter late-night streets.\nAs I approached the district near the academy gates, my enhanced senses detected two familiar presences ahead. My eyes landed on Kyle and Seraphina standing near the entrance to one of the upscale establishments that catered to wealthy students and young nobles.\nThey both looked noticeably drunk - not stumbling or incoherent, but carrying the relaxed posture and slightly unfocused gazes that indicated significant alcohol consumption. Given their Elite-rank constitutions and awakened abilities, getting genuinely intoxicated wasn’t easy. It required deliberately suppressing their natural immunity systems to allow the alcohol’s effects to take hold, which meant they’d gone deliberately heavy with their drinking.\nMy eyes crossed with Kyle’s for a brief moment. I caught the subtle smirk that formed on his face - calculated and deliberate rather than the loose expression of genuine drunkenness.\nWithout breaking eye contact with me, Kyle casually grabbed Seraphina’s waist and guided her toward a nearby hotel entrance. The gesture was possessive and theatrical, clearly performed for my benefit rather than genuine romantic intent.\nI looked at the scene with cold indifference, my expression remaining completely neutral. The transparent attempt at provocation was almost amusing in its childishness.\nKyle was obviously trying to antagonize me by taking my former fiancée to a hotel directly in front of my eyes. The psychological warfare was crude but targeted - attempting to trigger jealousy, anger, or some emotional response that would compromise my judgment.\nIgnoring the manufactured scene before me, I continued walking toward the academy without pause or reaction. My pace didn’t change, my expression didn’t shift, and I gave no indication that Kyle’s performance had registered as anything beyond mildly tedious background noise.",

      "content": "Chapter 151: Exam Results\nIt seemed the pressure I’d been applying through consistent victories and demonstrated superiority wasn’t sitting well with the protagonist. Kyle usually maintained his composed, heroic demeanor with everyone - but those he felt genuinely threatened by received this kind of juvenile provocation instead.\nTrying to antagonize me by flaunting possession of something I had voluntarily discarded was... funny, actually. The old Adrian had been obsessed with Seraphina, making a fool of himself through transparent pursuit. Whilst I had broken that engagement without hesitation and never looked back.\nKyle was attempting psychological warfare using ammunition that had lost all its power the moment I’d awakened and transformed. He was fighting a version of me that no longer existed, which meant his tactics were fundamentally flawed from the start.\nThe tension between us was clearly escalating beyond simple academic rivalry. Kyle recognized me as a genuine threat to his position and narrative, and this crude display was his opening move in what would likely become increasingly direct confrontation.\nBut if he thought taking my discarded ex-fiancée to a hotel would somehow shake my composure or cloud my judgment, he had severely miscalculated who he was dealing with.\nI had Transcendent beasts to hunt, businesses to manage, and approaching doom to prepare for. Kyle’s performances barely registered as distractions worth acknowledging.\nThe next day arrived with my usual morning routine, though I felt noticeably stronger after the previous night’s extensive soul power absorption. Classes proceeded normally until Instructor Sylvia’s afternoon session, where I noticed an unusually large stack of papers on her desk.\nThe examination results had arrived.\nSylvia waited for everyone to settle before addressing the class with an expression that mixed approval with mild surprise.\n\"I’ve reviewed your written examination results, and I must say you’ve all performed surprisingly well. It’s quite shocking, actually, given that this was a comprehensive surprise test covering extensive material.\"\nShe paused for effect, scanning the room before delivering the most important news.\n\"First, I’m pleased to announce that everyone in this class has passed the examination. This means that when the end of the month approaches, you will all be receiving your standard monthly allocation of 100,000 points.\"\nThe classroom erupted in excited murmurs and relieved expressions. Even students who had been worried about their performance relaxed visibly at the confirmation that they’d met minimum standards.\nElen’s face lit up with obvious relief and satisfaction. Given her family’s financial struggles, that monthly point allocation was crucial for both her development and her ability to support her father.\nSylvia raised her hand for silence before continuing. \"Additionally, the top three performers will receive bonus rewards of 10,000 points each for their exceptional rankings.\"\nThe atmosphere shifted immediately to competitive tension as everyone wondered who had claimed the top positions.\n\"In third place,\" Sylvia announced, \"we have Marcus Ironhold.\"\nThe result was met with understanding nods - Marcus was known for his approach and solid academic foundation. His Ironhold family emphasized comprehensive education alongside combat training.\nMarcus accepted the recognition with his characteristic calm composure, showing neither excessive pride nor false modesty.\n\"In second place,\" Sylvia continued, \"Adrian Blackwood.\"\nI maintained a neutral expression as several classmates glanced my way with mixed reactions. Some looked unsurprised given my recent combat achievements, while others seemed to reassess their understanding of my capabilities. Being a monster in combat was one thing, but excelling in theory demonstrated well-rounded development.\nSylvia paused deliberately before announcing the final ranking, building anticipation.\n\"And in first place... Elen Brightwater.\"\nThe classroom fell into shocked silence.\nEveryone turned to stare at Elen, whose face showed genuine surprise mixed with pride. She clearly hadn’t expected to claim the top position, especially against competitors like myself and Marcus.\nThe shock was understandable. While Elen was respected for her alchemy knowledge and water manipulation abilities during the examination, most students had underestimated her academic capabilities. She’d maintained a relatively low profile compared to the more prominent combat-focused students, like myself, emmet and Marcus.\nBut the results spoke clearly - she had outperformed both me and Marcus on comprehensive theoretical knowledge, demonstrating mastery that exceeded even the strongest combat specialists in our class.\n\"It seems we’ve all been underestimating certain people,\" one student muttered loud enough to be heard.\n\"Elen’s not just good at alchemy,\" another whispered. \"She’s our class’s scholar.\"\nI caught Elen’s eye and offered a subtle nod of acknowledgment. Her academic excellence was well-deserved, and honestly, if I hadn’t been copying her answers during portions of the exam, my score would have been noticeably lower.\nThe irony wasn’t lost on me - I’d used her superior knowledge to secure second place, while she’d earned first through pure capability.\nAfter class ended, Emmet approached while Elen and I were walking together discussing the examination results.\nWhat surprised me more was that instead of ignoring Elen as he usually did, he spoke two simple words.\n\"Well done.\"\nA smile formed on my face at the unexpected gesture. For Emmet, who rarely acknowledged anyone beyond combat challenges, offering congratulations was practically effusive praise.\nElen, who had grown accustomed to his aloof behaviour, looked genuinely shocked by the recognition. She recovered quickly and responded with sincere warmth.\n\"Thank you. You did well too, Emmet.\"\nEmmet nodded in acknowledgment before turning his attention to me with his typical directness.\n\"Spar.\"\nI nodded without hesitation. \"Let’s go.\"\nThe sparring session proceeded as usual, drawing substantial crowds of spectators eager to watch two of the Elite class’s strongest students test themselves against each other. Emmet fought with his usual aggressive intensity, though I noticed he was incorporating more defensive techniques - perhaps learning from his loss against Seraphina.\nThe match ended without clear victor, both of us calling it off after some time.\nAfterward, I walked with Elen toward the training facility section to book our respective practice rooms. Surprisingly, Emmet joined us rather than departing immediately as he typically would.\nThe three of us approached the booking station together - an unusual trio that drew curious glances from other students.",

      "content": "Chapter 152: Level 4 Blood Control!\n\"Blacksmithing room, two hours,\" I requested, preparing to continue my crafting projects.\n[-2,000 Points]\n\"Alchemy room, two hours,\" Elen said, clearly planning to capitalize on her recent academic success with additional practice.\n[-2,000 Points]\n\"Standard training room with combat dummy, two hours,\" Emmet stated simply.\n[-1,000 Points]\nThe attendant processed our bookings efficiently, assigning us adjacent facilities in the same corridor. We walked together toward our respective rooms, the silence comfortable rather than awkward.\n\"See you in two hours?\" Elen suggested as we reached her alchemy room entrance.\n\"Sure,\" I agreed.\nEmmet grunted acknowledgment before disappearing into his training space without further commentary.\nI entered my blacksmithing facility and immediately began setting up materials for my next project, satisfied with how the day had developed despite Kyle’s juvenile provocations the previous night.\nFour hours passed in focused training rather than the two I’d initially booked. The additional time cost more points, but the investment proved worthwhile as I systematically worked through skill refinement, secret art practice, and bloodline trait development.\nDuring an intense Blood Control exercise, a familiar notification pulsed through my consciousness.\n[Your Blood Control trait has reached level 4]\nThe advancement was immediately noticeable. My manipulation precision increased dramatically - I could now control blood at distances I’d previously struggled with, form more complex constructs with less concentration, and execute techniques that had required significant effort with relative ease. More importantly, my fundamental understanding of blood itself had deepened. I could sense its composition, detect subtle variations in quality, and manipulate its properties in ways that transcended simple physical control.\nCurious about how my accumulated improvements had affected overall combat effectiveness, I decided to test against the training dummy one final time.\nI activated all my enhancements - blood manipulation, supernatural physique, the new level 4 Blood Control - and delivered a maximum power strike combined with blood weapon projection.\nIMPACT! Measurement...\n[TOTAL DAMAGE OUTPUT: 36,250]\nI stared at the number in genuine surprise. My previous maximum which had been recorded just a few days ago, had been 24,725 combat units, which had placed me at low Transcendent equivalent power. This new result of 36,250 represented a massive leap - nearly a 50% increase in raw combat effectiveness.\nThe combination of trait advancement, accumulated soul power from the Thornback massacre, rank progression to high-Elite, and the Strong Body aspect had synergized into exponential rather than linear improvement.\nI was now operating at mid-Transcendent equivalent combat power while still technically being at high-Elite rank - not even peak Elite yet. The gap between my official rank and actual capabilities continued widening through my optimization of every advantage.\nA satisfied smile formed on my face. This level of power meant I could now engage genuine mid-Transcendent opponents on relatively equal footing, and lower Transcendent threats were essentially guaranteed victories.\nOnce my training session concluded, I cleaned up and exited the facility. Emmet and Elen were waiting outside their respective rooms as we’d agreed.\n\"Good session?\" Elen asked, noting my satisfied expression.\n\"Productive,\" I confirmed simply.\nEmmet grunted acknowledgment, which I’d learned to interpret as his version of approval.\nAfter brief conversation, I excused myself from their company with a plausible excuse about needing to handle administrative matters. Emmet departed without comment, while Elen headed toward the dormitories.\nI made my way toward Instructor Sylvia’s office, my purpose clear and focused.\nIt was time to bring Kael into the academy through the special admission process I’d been planning. My accumulated points and top-ranked status provided the leverage necessary to sponsor an exceptional candidate, and Kael’s development over the past weeks had prepared him adequately for the assessment requirements.\nI reached Sylvia’s office and knocked firmly on the door, preparing to navigate whatever bureaucratic procedures were necessary to execute this next phase of my plans.\n-----------\n\"Come in,\" Sylvia’s voice called from within her office.\nI entered to find her reviewing what appeared to be student performance reports, her desk organized with characteristic precision. She looked up and her expression showed mild surprise at the late visit.\n\"Adrian. What brings you here at this hour?\"\n\"I want to sponsor a student for special admission to the academy,\" I stated directly, seeing no point in elaborate preamble.\nSylvia sighed heavily and set down her papers, her expression shifting to one of resigned understanding.\n\"I heard from the Commander that you somehow discovered points can be utilized for such purposes. That information isn’t exactly advertised to first-year students.\" Her tone carried both disapproval at the leaked information and acknowledgment that I’d found it regardless.\nAs my homeroom teacher, she had access to detailed records of my point accumulation and expenditures. She clearly understood I possessed substantial resources despite being relatively new to the academy.\n\"Let’s go straight to the point,\" she continued. \"The candidate must have absolutely no criminal record. If any criminal history exists, the sponsorship price becomes something even you cannot afford, regardless of your recent examination winnings.\"\nI nodded calmly. \"He has no criminal record.\"\nThe incident where Kael had accidentally killed Tom during self-defense had been thoroughly covered by my self. Official records showed Tom’s death as an unfortunate accident inside the orphanage.\n\"Secondly,\" Sylvia continued, \"the candidate must pass an entrance examination. If he fails, you will still be required to pay the sponsorship points without him gaining admission. Alternatively, you can pay significantly higher fees to bypass examination requirements entirely, but even with your accumulated wealth, you don’t possess that amount - not even if you’d saved every point you’ve ever earned.\"\n\"I understand. The candidate will take the examination,\" I confirmed.\nSylvia pulled out official forms and began preparing the necessary documentation. \"Very well. I’ll need complete details about this candidate - full name, background, current capabilities, and reasons for seeking special admission outside normal enrollment periods.\"\nI provided the identity information carefully. \"His name is Kael Rivermist. Orphan background, recently awakened with ice-affinity bloodline. He is currently training independently but showing exceptional potential that would benefit from academy resources.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 153: Kael’s admission\nThe surname \"Rivermist\" was entirely fabricated, a generic name my father’s people had created specifically to avoid connection with the Blackwood family. Official documentation supported the orphan background story, and nothing in the records indicated any relationship to our duchy.\nSylvia recorded the information without visible suspicion. \"Kael Rivermist. And his current rank?\"\n\"Elite rank. Newly advanced but with solid fundamentals.\"\n\"The examination will be comprehensive - combat assessment, theoretical knowledge, and magical aptitude evaluation. When would you like to schedule this?\"\n\"As soon as possible. Within the next few days if the academy can accommodate it.\"\nSylvia made notes on her forms. \"I’ll coordinate with the examination committee. The sponsorship fee is 300,000 points, payable now regardless of examination outcome. Are you certain you want to proceed?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n[-300,000 Points]\nThe substantial deduction registered, but I’d anticipated the cost. Kael’s admission was worth the investment for multiple reasons beyond mere point value.\n\"The examination will be scheduled within three days. I’ll send notification through your communication crystal with specific time and location. Your candidate should be prepared for rigorous testing across all disciplines.\"\n\"He will be ready.\"\nSylvia stamped the official documentation and filed it appropriately. \"Is there anything else?\"\n\"No. Thank you for accommodating this, Instructor.\"\nShe nodded dismissively, already returning to her previous work. I exited the office satisfied that the process was underway.\nNow I just needed to inform Kael that his academy admission examination was imminent.\n--\nAs I made my way back to my dormitory, the familiar notification pulsed through my consciousness indicating my daily reward had become available.\n[Daily Login Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your daily reward?]\nI pressed yes without hesitation, curious what the system would provide after the recent string of valuable acquisitions.\n[Congratulations! You have received: Bloodline Evolution Card]\nA card materialized in my hand, its surface shimmering with iridescent colors that seemed to shift and flow like living aurora. The moment I touched it, information flooded into my mind.\n[Bloodline Evolution Card]\n[Rank: ???]\n[Details: This card can evolve the bloodline of any being. The bloodline rank must be below Mythical rank. The card can be used on self or others. Single use only. Cannot be stopped once activated.]\nI stared at the card in genuine shock, my mind racing through the implications of what I was holding. This wasn’t just a powerful item - this was potentially world-changing depending on how it was utilized.\nImmediately, multiple candidates appeared in my thoughts. I could use it on my parents, elevating their bloodlines to higher tiers and dramatically increasing their combat potential. But that seemed excessive and would raise questions about the source of such a miraculous transformation.\nI could use it on Kojiro, elevating whatever bloodline traits he possessed and making him an even more formidable guardian. That had genuine tactical merit.\nOr... the egg.\nI carefully retrieved the mysterious egg from my storage space, its swirling colors as mesmerizing as always.\n[Mysterious Egg]\n[Rank: King]\n[Details: Mysterious egg of an unknown species containing a beast that can reach King rank at maturity.]\nWhile the egg’s maximum potential was King rank, already extraordinary, that didn’t necessarily mean its bloodline was at the absolute peak. Supreme rank bloodlines like my vampire heritage were almost non-existent and the limits were certainly not king-rank. The egg’s creature likely possessed Legendary or Mythical-rank bloodline heritage.\nIf the bloodline was Legendary rank, the Evolution Card would upgrade it to Mythical - a substantial improvement that would enhance the hatched creature’s capabilities. If the bloodline was already Mythical, the card simply wouldn’t activate and I could save it for another candidate.\nTesting it on the egg seemed like the optimal strategy. Either I’d enhance an already powerful companion to even greater heights, or I’d confirm the creature possessed maximum bloodline potential and could consider other uses for the card.\nWith my decision made, I activated the Bloodline Evolution Card. The crystalline surface began glowing intensely as magical energy gathered.\nA prompt appeared in my consciousness:\n[Select target: Self or Other]\nI focused my intent on the egg held in my other hand.\n[Target: Mysterious Egg]\nThe card dissolved into pure light that flowed like liquid toward the egg’s surface, wrapping around it in spiraling patterns of brilliant illumination that made me shield my eyes against the intensity.\nThe transformation had begun.\nThe moment the light from the dissolved card made contact with the egg’s surface, I felt something profound happening. The transformation wasn’t subtle or gradual - it was immediate and dramatic.\nPulse! Expand!\nThe egg began growing rapidly, its size increasing at a visible rate that made me take several steps back to give it space. Mana started radiating outward in powerful waves that distorted the air around it, creating ripples of energy that made my enhanced senses tingle with recognition of enormous power being channeled.\nFlare! Surge! Intensify!\nLuckily, I was inside my private dormitory room rather than a public space. The magical disturbance would have been impossible to explain to curious onlookers or concerned instructors. The privacy wards I’d activated earlier contained most of the energy signature, though I could feel them straining against the pressure.\nThe egg continued expanding until it reached twice its original size - now roughly the dimensions of a large watermelon rather than the melon-sized object I’d been carrying. The swirling colors across its surface became dramatically more vibrant, the purples deeper, the crimsons brighter, the golds more lustrous, and the blues more intense.\nConnection... forming...\nBut what truly shocked me was the sudden sensation of a link establishing itself between the egg and my consciousness. It wasn’t verbal communication or even clear imagery - more like an instinctual awareness that transcended normal perception.\nI could feel the heartbeat of the creature developing inside. The rhythm was slow but powerful, each pulse radiating life force that resonated with my own vampiric bloodline. The connection wasn’t intrusive or controlling - more like becoming aware of a presence that had always been there but was only now making itself known.\nThump... thump... thump...",

      "content": "Chapter 154: The egg hatching\nThe heartbeat carried emotions alongside its physical sensation. Warmth. Contentment. Recognition. The creature inside knew me somehow, acknowledged me as something significant even before hatching.\nThe mana fluctuations finally began stabilizing as the transformation completed. The egg settled at its new size, the colors still shifting but no longer creating the chaotic energy surges that had filled the room moments earlier.\nI stood there holding the enlarged egg carefully, feeling that mysterious heartbeat connection and trying to process what had just occurred. The Bloodline Evolution Card had clearly worked - meaning the creature’s original bloodline had been Legendary rank and was now elevated to Mythical tier.\nWhatever hatched from this egg wouldn’t just be King-rank potential anymore. This was something that could potentially transcend even that limitation, reaching heights that few beasts in history had achieved.\nThe bond forming between us suggested something else too - this wouldn’t be a simple tamed beast or contracted familiar.\nThis would be a genuine companion, connected on a level that went beyond normal master-pet relationships.\nAs the egg settled at its new size and the mana fluctuations finally stabilized, another notification appeared in my consciousness.\n[Bloodline Evolution Successful]\n[Mysterious Egg bloodline has evolved from Legendary rank to Mythical rank]\n[Species potential elevated!]\nMy eyes widened at the information. The litgle hatchling’s potential was going beyond even King rank, a tier that only a handful of humans in recorded history had ever achieved. The Evolution Card had done far more than just improve the bloodline; it had fundamentally transformed the creature’s ultimate potential.\nBefore I could fully process the implications, the egg began trembling in my hands.\n[Hatching Process Initiated]\nCrack... crack... crack...\nFine fracture lines appeared across the vibrant surface, spreading rapidly as the creature inside began breaking free from its shell. Golden light leaked through the cracks, illuminating my darkened room with gentle radiance.\nCRACK! Break!\nA larger piece of shell fell away, followed by another, and another. The creature inside pushed against the remaining barriers with surprising strength for something just being born.\nFinally, the top portion of the egg split completely open.\nWhat emerged made me catch my breath.\nA small dragon, no larger than a house cat, tumbled out onto my desk with an adorable lack of coordination. Its scales were a beautiful light blue color that seemed to shimmer with an inner luminescence, like sunlight reflecting off tropical waters.\nThe dragon looked up at me with impossibly large, round eyes that were a deeper shade of sapphire blue. Those eyes held an intelligence far beyond what newborn creatures typically possessed, studying me with curious fascination rather than fear or confusion.\nRawr! Grrr!\nIt made a high-pitched sound that was more bird-like than the terrifying roar I associated with dragons. The tiny creature’s wings - delicate, translucent things that looked almost like stained glass fluttered experimentally as it tried to figure out how they worked.\nIts body was proportioned in a way that could only be described as adorable. The head was slightly oversized compared to its body, with small horn nubs just beginning to emerge. Its snout was short and rounded rather than the elongated, fearsome shape of adult dragons. Even its claws were tiny and harmless-looking, more suitable for gripping than rending.\nWaddle... stumble...\nThe dragon attempted to walk toward me and promptly tripped over its own feet, tumbling forward in a small ball of blue scales before righting itself with determined effort. It looked up at me again with those huge eyes, seemingly seeking approval or reassurance.\nThe bond I’d felt through the egg intensified dramatically now that the creature had hatched. I could sense its emotions clearly - curiosity, hunger, and an overwhelming sense of trust directed specifically at me. It recognized me as something important, someone safe and protective.\nGrr!\nIt made the adorable sound again, its tiny tail swishing back and forth with what could only be described as excitement.\nI reached out carefully and the dragon immediately climbed onto my hand, its small claws gripping gently as it settled into my palm. It was warm to the touch, radiating body heat.\nThis impossibly cute creature would one day reach a high rank and become one of the most powerful beings in existence.\nBut for now, it was just a newborn dragon looking up at me with complete trust and innocent wonder.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nI sat on my bed with the tiny dragon still perched in my palm, watching as it explored its immediate surroundings with childlike curiosity.\nEvery small movement was endearing - the way its tail curled when it was concentrating, how its wings would flutter involuntarily when it got excited, and those impossibly large eyes that tracked everything with keen intelligence.\nPat! Pat!\nThe dragon gently patted my finger with one tiny claw, as if testing whether I was real. When I moved my finger slightly, it jumped back in surprise before immediately returning to investigate again with fascination.\n\"You’re going to need food,\" I said aloud, realizing that newborn creatures\n, especially dragons, would have substantial nutritional requirements.\nThe dragon tilted its head at the sound of my voice, its expression somehow managing to convey both confusion and interest simultaneously.\nI mentally reviewed the contents of my storage ring and remembered I still had several beast corpses from recent hunts that I hadn’t yet processed for materials. The storage ring preserved items in their original state, preventing decomposition or decay, which meant the meat would still be fresh.\nI reached into my storage and withdrew the body of a forest sloth I’d killed during my early hunting, a Noble-rank beast that should provide adequate nutrition for a newborn\nThud!\nThe sloth corpse materialized on the floor, and I turned to see the dragon’s reaction.\n​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​The tiny creature looked at the offering with what could only be described as absolute disgust.\nIts small snout wrinkled, its wings folded tightly against its body, and it actually turned its head away as if personally offended by the presentation.\nMy mouth dropped open in disbelief before a wry smile formed on my face.",

      "content": "Chapter 155: Little Dragon!\n\"Oh boy, you are going to be expensive to feed, aren’t you?\"\nHmph!\nThe dragon made a dismissive sound that somehow conveyed aristocratic disdain despite coming from something the size of a house cat.\nThen another realization struck me - I had no idea whether this dragon was male or female. The thought hadn’t even occurred to me during the hatching excitement.\nI carefully examined the dragon while it was distracted by ignoring the sloth corpse. After a moment of observation and checking the relevant anatomical features, the answer became clear.\n\"A girl, then,\" I confirmed aloud.\nShe looked at me with those big eyes as if acknowledging the identification, then walked towards the Noble-rank offering before kicking it away with its tiny legs.\n\"Hey! What are you doing, that’s food. Don’t be wasteful!\" I reprimanded it although a soft smile was on my face.\nThe cute little dragon seemed to wilt at my reprimand which made me feel guilty for doing so.\nIt’s a few second old child. I need to be more gentle. Sigh, life of a caretaker is really hard.\n\"Alright, let’s try something better quality,\" I muttered, returning the sloth to storage and withdrawing an Elite-rank forest boar I’d harvested earlier.\nThud!\nThe boar corpse appeared, significantly larger and radiating more potent mana than the previous offering.\nThe little dragon’s demeanor changed immediately. Her head perked up with interest, her nostrils flared as she caught the scent, and she actually took several determined steps toward the meat.\nThough her movements still showed some reluctance - clearly this wasn’t ideal quality either - she approached the boar and took a tentative bite.\nNom... nom... nom...\nThe eating sounds were impossibly cute. Small, delicate bites accompanied by satisfied chirps between mouthfuls.\nHer tiny jaws worked relentlessly through the tough meat, and I could see her scales brightening slightly as she absorbed the Elite-rank beast’s nutritional value.\nCrunch... nom... chirp!\nShe paused eating briefly to look up at me, as if seeking approval that she was doing this correctly. When I nodded encouragingly, she returned to her meal with enthusiasm at the prospect of eating.\n\"So the quality must be at the Elite-rank minimum,\" I noted with mild exasperation. \"At least you’re not demanding Transcendent quality... yet.\"\nNom nom nom!\nThe little dragon continued eating with adorable determination, her tail swishing contentedly as she consumed what was probably ten times her current body weight in magical beast meat.\nI watched her feast and couldn’t help but smile despite the realization that feeding an Emperor-potential dragon with expensive tastes was going to consume significant resources.\nBut looking at those big sapphire eyes and listening to those cute eating sounds, I decided it was worth every golden coin it would cost.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nIf I wasn’t the son of a duke, I would find it difficult to feed this thing. Unless I continuously hunt in the forest, I would never be able to satisfy its hunger.\nWith the cute little dragon now properly fed and curled up contentedly on my desk, I turned my attention to a practical matter that would solve near future feeding concerns.\nI retrieved my communication crystal and contacted the same subordinate who had handled the Thornback nest excavation.\n\"Young Master Blackwood,\" his professional voice came through immediately. \"How may I assist you?\"\n\"The Thornback corpses your team extracted - I need you to preserve all the meat in stasis. Don’t sell any of it. Keep it fresh using preservation enchantments.\"\nThere was a brief pause as Marcus processed the unusual request. Monster meat was typically sold quickly to alchemists or restaurants specializing in magical cuisine, as maintaining large quantities in stasis wasn’t exactly profitable.\nTo his credit, he didn’t question the order. \"Understood, young master. I’ll ensure the meat from all specimens is properly preserved. Shall I arrange for regular deliveries to your location, or would you prefer to collect it personally?\"\n\"Arrange deliveries to this address... Weekly shipments should be sufficient for now.\"\nThe address that I gave him was the same mansion I had recently gotten from my daily reward.\n\"Consider it done. Is there anything else you require?\"\n\"Yes. Keep all the Transcendent Thornback materials - carapaces, venom sacs, specialized organs, everything from the three alpha specimens. Those are not to be sold. Everything else from the Elite-rank spiders can go to market.\"\n\"Excellent decision, young master. The Transcendent materials will fetch premium prices, but holding them for personal use or strategic sale timing is far more valuable. I’ll catalog everything and provide you with detailed inventory reports.\"\n\"Good. Proceed with selling the Elite-rank materials and send the revenue reports to the family accounting office.\"\n\"It will be handled immediately. If I may say so, young master, the total harvest from that operation was extraordinary. The materials alone should generate approximately 150,000 golden coins once processed and sold through proper channels.\"\nThat was decent money from a single excavation even by ducal family standards, and it would provide excellent funding for various projects and expenses - including feeding an increasingly expensive baby dragon.\n\"One final thing,\" I added. \"Discretion regarding these arrangements. The fewer people who know about the meat preservation request, the better.\"\n\"Of course, young master. Only essential personnel will be informed, and they are all bound by family confidentiality oaths.\"\n\"Thank you. That will be all.\"\nI terminated the connection and looked back at the sleeping dragon, her tiny form rising and falling with peaceful breaths.\nElite and Transcendent-rank meat would keep her well-fed as she grew, and having a steady supply meant I wouldn’t need to constantly hunt just to satisfy her dietary requirements.\nThe materials from the three Transcendent Thornbacks would also prove valuable for future blacksmithing projects or strategic trades when the right opportunities emerged.\nPurr!\nThe little dragon made a soft sound in her sleep, unconsciously responding to my presence even while resting.\nI smiled and gently stroked her small head with one finger, careful not to wake her.\nBetween the daily reward system, family connections and careful planning, I was building the foundation for challenges I knew were coming - challenges that would require every advantage I could accumulate.",

      "content": "Chapter 156: Changing Star\nAs I continued playing with the little dragon, gently rolling a small ball of condensed mana for her to chase around the desk, something unexpected happened. When I focused my attention on her with genuine curiosity about her capabilities, a translucent panel materialized in my vision.\n[Name: Changing Star]\n[Race: Dragon]\n[Growth Stage: Infant]\n[Rank: Elite]\n[Potential: ???]\n[Skills:]\n[Devour - Unique Ability]\nDescription: A skill that allows the dragon to grow at speeds that transcend any other race. Achieve rapid advancement by consuming the bodies of magical beasts. Growth rate and power absorption directly correlate to the quality and rank of consumed materials.\nI stared at the information panel in complete shock, my hand freezing mid-motion as the implications sank in.\n\"Changing Star,\" I murmured, testing the name. It suited her somehow, those shifting colors on her scales resembled stars moving across a night sky.\nGrrr!\nShe responded to hearing her name spoken aloud, those big sapphire eyes looking up at me with recognition and pleasure.\nBut what truly staggered me was the Devour skill. This wasn’t just convenient - this was absolutely overpowered beyond any reasonable balance.\nMost magical beasts required years or even decades to advance through ranks, their growth limited by natural cultivation rates and the slow absorption of ambient mana. Even awakened humans with systematic training faced significant bottlenecks between rank advancements.\nBut this dragon? She could simply eat her way to overwhelming power at speeds that would make legendary cultivators weep with envy.\nThe skill description said it all - growth that transcended other races. Not \"matched\" or \"rivaled\" but actually transcended. And the direct correlation between consumed material quality and advancement meant that feeding her Transcendent-rank meat would accelerate her development exponentially.\n\"You’re absolutely broken,\" I said with a mixture of awe and disbelief. \"This is genuinely unfair.\"\nChanging Star seemed pleased with my assessment, puffing out her tiny chest as if acknowledging her own superiority.\nThe status panel also revealed she was already Elite rank despite being literally just hatched. Most newborn creatures started at Noble rank at best, requiring months or years to reach Elite status. She’d apparently absorbed enough energy during development and the bloodline evolution to skip that entire tier.\nHer potential showed as question marks, which was simultaneously frustrating and exciting. The system couldn’t calculate her maximum limits, suggesting they exceeded normal measurement parameters. Given that the bloodline evolution had elevated her theoretical cap to Emperor rank, those question marks probably indicated she could surpass even that astronomical ceiling under the right conditions.\n\"No wonder you turned your nose up at Noble-rank meat,\" I said, understanding dawning. \"Your instincts knew it wouldn’t provide meaningful growth benefits.\"\nHmph!\nShe made that aristocratic dismissive sound again, as if vindicated in her earlier rejection of inferior offerings.\nI leaned back and processed this revelation. I’d thought acquiring an Emperor-potential companion was already extraordinary, but the Devour skill transformed her from merely powerful to genuinely game-changing.\nWith unlimited access to high-quality beast materials and feeding, Changing Star could potentially reach Transcendent rank within days rather than months.\nKing rank within years. And Emperor rank... that timeline was impossible to predict, but it would be measured in years rather than decades.\n\"You’re going to be terrifying when you grow up,\" I informed her seriously.\nRawrrr!\nShe responded happily, completely unaware of or unbothered by the implications of her own overwhelming potential.\nI had just hatched possibly the most overpowered creature in existence, and she currently fit in the palm of my hand while making adorable chirping sounds.\nThe contrast was almost absurd.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nLooking at Changing Star as she contentedly explored my desk, a concerning realization struck me. I couldn’t keep her here in the academy dormitory for long - perhaps not even overnight.\nThe Headmaster and other high-ranking faculty members regularly swept the campus with their mana senses to detect threats or unusual magical signatures. A Mythical-rank dragon, even in infant form, radiated power that would be impossible to completely conceal from someone at their level if they conducted a thorough search.\nDiscovery would lead to uncomfortable questions I had no good answers for. Where did I acquire a dragon egg? How did I hatch it? Why was its bloodline so extraordinarily pure? The interrogation would be endless and whilst I could evade it with my status it was a hassle and changing star was my ace.\n\"We need to move you somewhere safer,\" I told Changing Star seriously.\nShe tilted her head in confusion, not understanding the concern but trusting my judgment.\nThe mansion. That was the perfect solution. The property was mine, located outside academy jurisdiction, and had sufficient space and privacy for her to grow without constant oversight. I could set up proper accommodations and ensure regular feeding without arousing suspicion.\nThe challenge was transporting her there without detection.\nI examined my jacket and found a deep inner pocket that would accommodate her small size. \"Alright, little one. You need to stay very quiet and still for a while. Can you do that?\"\nChirp!\nShe seemed to understand on an instinctual level, immediately settling into a calm state as I carefully placed her in the pocket. Her warm presence against my chest was reassuring, and I could feel through our bond that she felt safe and protected.\nI left my dormitory room quickly, moving with purpose toward the academy gates. The mansion was only about ten minutes away by skateboard - I just needed to avoid any extended conversations or situations that might reveal my hidden cargo.\nFootsteps approaching...\n\"Adrian!\"\nI recognized Elen’s voice immediately as she appeared in the corridor ahead, clearly having bumped into me by accident. Her expression showed she wanted to discuss something, probably related to the examination results or upcoming training plans.\nShe reached out to grab my arm in her usual friendly manner.\nI swiftly moved away from her grasp with enhanced reflexes, creating distance before she could make contact. Physical contact might disturb Changing Star or cause her to make noise.\n\"Sorry, Elen. I have urgent business in the city. Can we talk tomorrow?\"​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nElen’s expression shifted to confusion at my sudden evasive movement, clearly not expecting me to dodge her casual gesture. Her hand hung in the air for a moment before she lowered it, studying my face with curiosity.\nBut then understanding seemed to dawn - or at least acceptance that I genuinely had something urgent to handle. A smile formed on her face as she nodded.\n\"Of course. It must be important if you’re rushing out this late. Be careful in the city at night.\"\n\"I will. Thanks for understanding.\"\nI felt Changing Star shift slightly in my pocket and immediately coughed to cover the soft sound, turning it into a clearing of my throat.\nElen didn’t seem to notice anything unusual. \"See you in class tomorrow then. Good luck with whatever you need to handle.\"\nI nodded and continued past her with measured speed - fast enough to convey urgency but not so rushed as to appear suspicious. Once I was certain she’d headed in the opposite direction, I picked up my pace toward the academy gates.\n\"Still... stay still...\" I whispered softly.\nThrough our bond, I sent calming reassurance to Changing Star, and she settled back into quiet stillness against my chest.\nJust a few more minutes and we’d be at the mansion where she could stretch her wings properly without risk of discovery.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nAt the academy gates, just as I thought I’d successfully navigated through without further delays, a familiar stoic figure appeared directly in my path.\nEmmet.\nHis intense gaze locked onto me immediately, and he spoke with his characteristic directness.\n\"Spar.\"\n’Damn it,’ I cursed inwardly. ’Everyone’s suddenly bumping into me tonight.’\nShift...\nI felt Changing Star move slightly in my pocket, reacting to my sudden spike of frustration. I needed to end this quickly before she made noise or Emmet’s combat instincts detected something unusual.\n\"Can’t. Urgent business in the city that can’t wait,\" I said firmly, already moving past him toward the gates.\nEmmet’s expression showed disappointment but also acceptance. He was direct and combat-focused, but he understood when someone genuinely had other priorities.\n\"Tomorrow then.\"\n\"Tomorrow,\" I confirmed without stopping, passing through the gates and immediately retrieving my skateboard from storage.\nWhoosh!\nI activated the propulsion system and accelerated toward the mansion, finally free from interruptions and able to focus on getting Changing Star to her new home safely.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nWhoosh! Speed!\nThe skateboard carried me through the darkened city streets at maximum velocity, my enhanced senses keeping watch for any potential followers or observers. The ten-minute journey felt longer than usual with the precious cargo hidden in my pocket.\nFinally, the mansion came into view - the elegant white structure standing pristine under moonlight, its empty grounds offering the privacy and security I desperately needed.\nI deactivated the skateboard as I approached the entrance, using the key to unlock the main doors and slipping inside quickly. Only after closing and securing the entrance behind me did I allow myself to relax.\n\"We made it,\" I said aloud, exhaling deeply in relief.\nChirp!\nChanging Star immediately poked her small head out of my pocket, her big sapphire eyes looking around the spacious entrance hall with wonder and curiosity. She’d been remarkably patient during the journey, staying completely still and silent despite probably being uncomfortable in the confined space.\nI carefully lifted her out and set her on the polished marble floor. She stretched her tiny wings with obvious satisfaction, shaking herself as if loosening cramped muscles.\nWaddle waddle!\nShe began exploring immediately, her claws clicking softly against the floor as she investigated her new surroundings with characteristic curiosity.\nI looked around the empty mansion and smiled with genuine relief. Here, she could grow safely without risk of discovery. No Headmaster conducting mana sweeps, no curious students asking questions, no instructors detecting unusual magical signatures.\nThis was the perfect sanctuary for an overpowered baby dragon who would one day reach Emperor rank.\n\"Welcome home, Changing Star.\"​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "content": "Chapter 157: Changing Star [2]\nChanging Star immediately began her exploration of the mansion with adorable enthusiasm, her tiny form waddling from room to room with boundless curiosity.\nPatter patter patter!\nHer small claws clicked rhythmically against the marble flooring as she moved through the entrance hall, her head swiveling to take in the high ceilings and elegant architecture. Everything was new and fascinating to her freshly hatched senses.\nShe discovered the grand staircase and attempted to climb the first step with determined effort. Her small legs struggled with the height, and after several failed attempts, she spread her translucent wings and fluttered upward in an awkward half-flight, half-jump that got her to the second step.\nShe looked back at me with obvious pride at her accomplishment, her tail swishing excitedly.\n\"Very impressive,\" I acknowledged with genuine amusement.\nChanging Star continued exploring, finding her way to the large reception room I’d been considering converting into a cinema. The open space seemed to delight her, and she attempted an experimental run across the floor before tripping over her own feet and tumbling in a small ball of blue scales.\nRoll roll... thud!\nShe righted herself immediately with a small indignant chirp, as if the floor had personally offended her.\nI followed her through several rooms, watching as she investigated corners, sniffed at walls, and occasionally tried to climb furniture that was far too tall for her current size. Her innocent wonder at everything made even empty rooms seem magical through her eyes.\nEventually, I knelt down to her level as she paused to catch her breath after her extensive exploration.\n\"Changing Star, listen carefully.\"\nrawr?\nShe looked up at me with those impossibly large eyes, her full attention focused on my words despite not fully understanding language yet.\n\"This mansion is your home now. You can explore everywhere inside, sleep wherever you want, and make yourself comfortable. But...\" I paused to ensure emphasis, \"you absolutely cannot leave this place. No going outside, no flying away to explore the city, no wandering off. Do you understand?\"\nHer response carried a note of confusion mixed with disappointment. She clearly wanted to explore beyond these walls eventually.\nI reached out and gently stroked her small head. \"It’s for your safety. There are people who would want to capture you or hurt you if they discovered what you are. This mansion protects you. Inside here, you’re safe.\"\nThrough our bond, I could feel her processing the emotional weight behind my words even if the specific meaning escaped her. She sensed my genuine concern for her wellbeing and the seriousness of the restriction.\ngrr.\nThis time her response was more subdued, accepting. She pressed her small head against my hand affectionately, acknowledging the boundary I’d set even if she didn’t fully comprehend why.\n\"Good girl,\" I said softly. \"I’ll visit you every day and bring you food. You won’t be alone.\"\nChirp chirp!\nHer mood brightened immediately at the mention of food, her tail resuming its happy swishing.\nI smiled and watched as she resumed her exploration with slightly less range but equal enthusiasm, investigating the rooms within her new sanctuary while respecting the invisible boundary I’d established.\nOnce Changing Star had finished her enthusiastic exploration of the mansion’s main rooms, I guided her toward one of the practical facilities I’d discovered during my initial inspection - a large temperature-controlled storage area designed for magical food preservation.\nThe room was located in the basement level, easily accessible via a wide staircase that Changing Star managed to descend with only moderate stumbling. The preservation chamber itself was spacious, easily the size of a standard bedroom, with enchanted walls that maintained freezing temperatures without requiring constant mana input.\n\"This is going to be very important for you,\" I told her as we entered the cold room.\nShe shivered slightly at the temperature drop, her small body not yet adapted to regulate against such cold environments. However, within seconds she was able to get accustomed to it.\nDespite being a few hours old, she was still an elite-rank beast.\nI began withdrawing Elite-rank beast corpses from my storage ring, materializing them one after another until approximately ten large bodies lay arranged throughout the chamber. Forest boars, mountain deer, wolves - all preserved in perfect condition and radiating the potent mana that her Devour skill would convert into rapid growth.\nChanging Star’s eyes widened with obvious interest as she recognized food, her earlier discomfort with the cold immediately forgotten.\n\"This is your fridge,\" I explained, gesturing at the arranged corpses. \"Whenever you’re hungry, you can come here and eat whatever you want. You don’t need to wait for me.\"\nShe approached the nearest boar and took an experimental bite, the familiar cute eating sounds resuming as she confirmed the quality met her standards.\n\"I’ll also arrange for people to deliver fresh supplies here every day,\" I continued. \"Servants will come by regularly to restock, so you’ll never run out. Just...do not show yourselves to them, alright?\"\nNom nom... chirp!\nShe paused eating long enough to acknowledge my words before returning to her meal with focused determination.\nI watched her feast for a moment before adding with a slight smile, \"Once you grow up and stop tripping over your own legs every five steps, I’ll take you out for proper hunting. You can catch your own prey instead of just eating what I provide. Would you like that?\"\nCHIRP!\nHer enthusiastic response was immediate and emphatic, clearly excited by the prospect of hunting despite her current physical limitations. She attempted to demonstrate her prowess by pouncing on the already-dead boar, which resulted in her bouncing off its solid body and landing on her back.\nThud!\nShe laid there for a moment looking dazed before rolling over and resuming eating as if the embarrassing display had never happened.\n\"Yes, we’ll definitely wait until you’re more coordinated,\" I said with genuine amusement. \"For now, focus on eating and growing strong. I’ll visit every day to check on you.\"\nChirp!\nChanging Star’s tail swished happily as she continued her meal, already making impressive progress through the Elite-rank meat despite her tiny size.\nI decided to stay at the mansion for the night rather than returning to the academy dormitory. Changing Star had only just hatched, and despite our bond, I wasn’t entirely certain she fully understood my instructions about staying hidden and not leaving the property. Better to spend one night ensuring nothing went wrong.\nI chose one of the smaller bedroom suites on the second floor - furnished but not overly elaborate, comfortable enough for a single night’s rest. After changing and preparing for sleep, I settled onto the bed and extinguished the magical lighting.\nPatter patter patter...\nSoft footsteps approached in the darkness, and moments later I felt a small weight climb onto the bed with determined effort. Changing Star had apparently decided where she wanted to sleep.\nNestle... settle...\nThe tiny dragon positioned herself right beside me, her warm body pressing against my side as she made herself comfortable. Her scales were surprisingly smooth and pleasant to the touch, radiating gentle heat that made the cool night air more comfortable.\nThen, unexpectedly, a soft sound began emanating from her small form - a gentle purring that was remarkably similar to a contented cat. The rhythmic vibration was soothing, almost hypnotic in its steady consistency.\nPurrrrr... purrrrr...\nA faint smile formed on my face as I listened to the adorable sound. A dragon with terrifying power and potential was purring like a house cat while nestled against her bond partner. The contrast between her ultimate destiny and current behavior was endearing beyond measure.\nI gently placed one hand on her small head, feeling her relax even further at the contact. Through our bond, I could sense her complete contentment and feeling of safety.\nSleep came easily with that peaceful purring filling the quiet room.\nI woke early the next morning as sunlight filtered through the windows, my internal clock refusing to let me sleep late despite the comfortable bed. Changing Star was still nestled beside me, her purring having stopped but her breathing steady and peaceful.\nChirp...\nShe stirred as I moved, those big sapphire eyes blinking open sleepily.\n\"Good morning. Time for breakfast,\" I said softly.\nCHIRP!\nAll sleepiness vanished instantly at the mention of food, and she was immediately scrambling off the bed with renewed energy.\nI took her back down to the preservation chamber where she eagerly attacked another Elite-rank corpse, her appetite seemingly endless despite having eaten substantially the previous evening. The Devour skill was clearly working overtime, converting consumed material into growth at accelerated rates.\nAfter she’d eaten her fill, I knelt down to her level for final instructions before departing.\n\"Remember what I told you. Do not leave this mansion under any circumstances. Stay inside where it’s safe. Servants will come by later to deliver more food, but don’t worry - they work for my family and won’t cause problems.\"\nChirp chirp.\nHer response carried understanding mixed with slight reluctance, but the bond confirmed she would obey.\n\"I’ll be back this evening to check on you and bring anything you need. Be good while I’m gone.\"\nChirp!\nShe pressed her small head against my hand affectionately, and I gave her one final gentle pat before standing.\nI left the mansion and secured all the entrances, then retrieved my skateboard for the return journey to the academy. Classes would be starting soon, and missing them wasn’t a good idea.\nAs I accelerated toward the campus, I couldn’t help but smile thinking about the purring dragon waiting for my return.",

      "content": "Chapter 158: Rising Tensions\nInside Instructor Sylvia’s classroom, the atmosphere today felt noticeably different from the previous sessions. Her usually composed expression carried a weight of solemnity that immediately put the entire class on edge.\nSomething is wrong.\nI thought to myself, as I took a seat.\nShe waited until everyone had settled before speaking, her voice serious and grim.\n\"I need to discuss something with all of you, information that’s been circulating among the faculty and will soon become public knowledge throughout the kingdom. As future defenders of this place, you all deserve to know.\"\nThe room fell completely silent, every student giving her their full attention.\n\"Over the past several weeks, we’ve received increasingly concerning reports about magical beast activity along the kingdom’s borders and in outlying territories. Attack frequencies have risen dramatically, not just isolated incidents, but coordinated assaults on towns and villages that were previously considered secure.\"\nSeveral students moved uncomfortably in their seats. Increased beast attacks were never a good sign, often indicating larger territorial shifts or disturbances in the natural magical ecosystem.\n\"Many of these settlements lack adequate defensive forces to repel sustained attacks from organized beast groups,\" Sylvia continued. \"Local militias and guard units are being overwhelmed. Casualty reports are climbing, and several towns have been evacuated entirely after defensive lines collapsed.\"\nOne of the students raised his hand. \"Are reinforcements being sent from the capital or major cities?\"\n\"Yes, but resources are finite. The Royal Army is stretched thin managing multiple crisis points simultaneously. Noble houses are deploying their private forces, but coordination remains challenging across different territories.\"\nMy thoughts immediately turned to my father and his mission to Thornhaven. The timing couldn’t be coincidental, his assignment to deal with a Transcendent-rank beast threat was likely connected to this broader pattern of escalating attacks.\nI made a mental note to check the Book of Hints immediately after class ended, to see if his survival probability had changed based on these developing circumstances.\nElen spoke up, concern evident in her voice. \"What does this mean for academy operations? Will we be deployed to assist with defensive efforts?\"\nSylvia shook her head. \"First-year students will not be sent to active combat zones. However, training protocols are being adjusted to prepare you for potential emergency scenarios. The academy itself may need to strengthen its defensive perimeter if the situation continues deteriorating.\"\nShe paused, her expression growing even more grave.\n\"If things continue progressing along this trajectory, many aspects of the kingdom will change - for good or for worse. Trade routes will be disrupted, resources will be redirected toward military efforts, and the social stability we’ve enjoyed for decades could face serious challenges.\"\nThe classroom remained silent as students processed the implications. This wasn’t just about isolated monster attacks anymore, this suggested changes that could affect the entire kingdom’s structure.\n\"The royal court is investigating possible causes for this sudden escalation,\" Sylvia added. \"Whether it’s migration patterns, disturbances in major beast territories, or something more deliberate remains unclear. But you all need to understand that the world outside these academy walls is becoming increasingly dangerous.\"\nShe looked around the room, meeting each student’s eyes.\n\"Use your training time wisely. What you learn here may determine not just your personal advancement, but your ability to protect others when the situation demands it.\"\n\"With that said, it’s time to start our lesson,\" Sylvia announced, her tone shifting from grave briefing to professional instruction. \"Everyone, follow me to Section G.\"\nThe class rose and followed her through the academy corridors toward the specialized training facilities. The somber mood from her earlier announcement lingered, but students began focusing on the immediate task ahead.\nSection G’s combat training area was extensive, multiple chambers designed for different aspects of warrior development. Sylvia led us to the main drill hall, a massive space equipped with various training stations and magical measurement devices.\n\"Today we’re conducting comprehensive combat drills covering all fundamental aspects of your capabilities,\" Sylvia explained as we assembled. \"Agility, strength, endurance, and mana control. Each station will test and push your limits.\"\nShe gestured toward different sections of the hall. \"You’ll rotate through each station in groups. I expect good effort - these assessments will identify your weaknesses that need addressing and strengths that can be further developed.\"\nThe first station focused on agility training. The obstacle courses were much more difficult than the first one that Sylvia had introduced to them. Surprisingly, my classmates were not struggling anymore. Unlike the first time where some couldn’t complete the courses, this time, they were able to, albeit the timing between them differed.\nWhen my turn came, I activated my blood enhancement moderately - enough to perform well beyond my classmates without revealing my full capabilities. The course was challenging but manageable, my vampire reflexes and practiced footwork allowing smooth navigation through the shifting barriers.\n\"Excellent form, Adrian,\" Sylvia noted as I completed the circuit. \"Your movement efficiency has improved significantly since the examination.\"\nThe strength station involved lifting and manipulating progressively heavier enchanted weights that tested both physical power and technique. Marcus excelled here, his Ironhold bloodline providing natural advantages in raw strength applications.\nStill, he did not outperform me. Using blood enhancement to augment my lifting capacity while maintaining proper form.\nEndurance training was perhaps the most gruelling for most students. They had to maintain combat-ready stances while channelling mana continuously, testing both physical stamina and magical reserves. The goal was to last as long as possible before exhaustion forced them to surrender.\nMany students dropped out within fifteen minutes, their legs trembling and mana reserves depleted. I decided to stop after an hour before my two competitors, emmet and Marcus decided to withdraw.\nThey didn’t want to completely exhaust themselves before the next station. Which was a smart move, they knew that they would lose no matter how hard they tried. So they decided to save their strength for the next test.\nThe final station tested mana control through precision exercises - creating specific shapes with pure mana, maintaining multiple simultaneous manipulations, and demonstrating fine control under pressure.",

      "content": "Chapter 159: Rising Tensions [2]\nElen absolutely dominated other students in this field, her academic excellence translating perfectly to practical mana manipulation. Her constructs were flawless in their precision and stability.\nMy mana control remained leagues above everyone else. I had much more experience when it came to creating constructs from mana, I did that with blood on a daily after all.\nThroughout the drills, Sylvia circulated among students, offering corrections, encouragement, and tactical advice. Her teaching style was demanding but fair, pushing everyone to improve without unrealistic expectations.\n\"Remember,\" she called out as we completed the final rotation, \"these fundamentals aren’t just academic exercises. In real combat situations, your agility determines if you dodge fatal strikes. Your strength decides if you can penetrate enemy defences. Your endurance determines if you survive prolonged engagements with someone of similar strength. And your mana control affects every technique you attempt.\"\nThe class was exhausted but satisfied with the comprehensive training session. Even with my enhanced capabilities, I felt properly worked out - evidence that Sylvia had designed the drills to challenge students across all rank levels.\n\"Dismissed for today,\" Sylvia announced. \"Review your performance and identify areas needing improvement. We’ll continue with specialized training throughout the week.\"\nAs students began moving toward the exits, Sylvia raised her hand to stop them.\n\"One more thing before you leave. Our next lesson will take place in the forest outside the academy grounds.\"\nThe announcement caused immediate surprised murmurs throughout the class. Forest training had never been part of the curriculum before - all previous lessons had been conducted within the academy’s controlled facilities.\nMultiple hands shot up with questions.\n\"Instructor, why the sudden change in location?\" Elen asked, voicing what everyone was thinking.\nSylvia’s expression remained serious. \"Because we’ve been focusing extensively on building your foundations - technique, fundamentals, controlled exercises. That groundwork was necessary, but now it’s time to transition toward true strength development.\"\nShe paused, letting her words sink in before continuing.\n\"Hunting. Real combat against actual magical beasts to accumulate soul power. No matter how much you train with dummies and controlled sparring, without killing beasts and absorbing their essence, you will remain stuck at a certain level of strength. There is only so much that skill and technique can amount to without genuine advancement.\"\nThe classroom atmosphere shifted as students realized the implications. This wasn’t just another training exercise - this was preparation for actual life-or-death combat.\n\"Many of you have already engaged in beast hunting independently,\" Sylvia acknowledged, her gaze sweeping across students like myself, Emmet, and Marcus. \"But guided hunts with proper instruction will also accelerate your development.\"\nElen raised her hand hesitantly. \"Will we be hunting in groups or individually?\"\n\"Both, depending on the specific lesson objectives and target selections. Some sessions will focus on team coordination against stronger opponents. Others will test individual capabilities against appropriate-rank threats.\"\n\"What rank of beasts will we be facing?\" another student asked nervously.\n\"Primarily Elite-rank specimens appropriate to your current capabilities, lower-elite targets for students still developing combat confidence. The forest has been surveyed and secured to ensure no Transcendent-rank threats interfere with training operations.\"\nSylvia’s tone became more emphatic. \"This is not optional training. Soul power accumulation is essential for rank advancement, and rank advancement is essential for survival in the increasingly dangerous environment outside these walls. The beast activity escalation I mentioned earlier makes this practical experience even more critical.\"\nShe looked around the room with sharp focus. \"Prepare appropriately. Bring weapons, protective equipment, healing supplies, and whatever tools you’ve developed for combat situations. We depart at dawn three days from now. Any questions?\"\nThe room buzzed with nervous energy and excited discussion, but no immediate questions emerged.\n\"Good. Dismissed.\"\nAs students filed out discussing the upcoming forest expedition with mixed anticipation and anxiety, Elen joined me.\nAs students filed out discussing the upcoming forest expedition with mixed anticipation and anxiety, Elen appeared beside me as I was preparing to leave.\n\"Are you heading to the training rooms?\" she asked, clearly planning to coordinate practice schedules.\nI shook my head. \"I have something to do outside the academy first. I’ll be back to train in about an hour though.\"\nElen nodded understanding, not pressing for details about my mysterious errand. \"Alright. Good luck with whatever you need to handle. I’ll probably be in the alchemy room when you get back.\"\n\"Thanks. See you later.\"\nShe wished me well and departed toward her own destination, leaving me free to slip away without drawing attention.\nI retrieved my skateboard once outside the academy gates and activated the propulsion system, accelerating toward the mansion. The journey that would take most people twenty minutes on foot took barely five with the enhanced magical device.\n’Really was a good invention,’ I thought as I navigated the city streets with practiced ease, ’even if I didn’t actually invent it myself, despite what people in this world think.’\nThe mansion appeared quickly, and I dismounted near the entrance, securing the property before entering.\n\"Changing Star?\" I called out, expecting to hear her characteristic chirping or the patter of small claws approaching.\nSilence.\nI made my way through the rooms, checking the areas she’d explored yesterday. Not in the main hall. Not in the reception room. Not in any of the bedrooms.\nFinally, I descended to the basement preservation chamber.\nWhat I found made me stop and stare in amused disbelief.\nChanging Star was inside the freezing storage room, curled up directly on the cold floor, fast asleep. And hanging from her small mouth was a partially eaten piece of Elite-rank meat, still gripped between her tiny jaws.\nShe had literally fallen asleep while eating.\n’This dragon...’\nShaking my head wryly with a soft smile on my face.\nI approached carefully and gently picked her up, intending to move her somewhere more comfortable than the freezing floor.\nThe moment I lifted her, I noticed something significant, she felt noticeably heavier than yesterday. Not dramatically so, but the difference was unmistakable. And looking more carefully, her body had grown slightly larger as well.\nPurr...\nZzZz...",

Less than twenty-four hours of eating Elite-rank meat, and she’d already shown visible growth that would take normal creatures weeks to achieve.\n\"You’re going to be enormous soon if you keep eating and growing at this rate,\" I murmured quietly.\nI stayed with Changing Star for a while longer, gently waking her and watching with amusement as she finally swallowed the piece of meat that had been hanging from her mouth. She seemed completely unconcerned about having fallen asleep mid-meal.\nKnock knock knock\nA firm knock at the mansion’s main entrance announced the arrival I’d been expecting. I carried Changing Star with me as I went to answer, finding one of my family’s trusted subordinates waiting with a large transport cart.\n\"Young Master Blackwood,\" he greeted respectfully. \"The delivery you requested.\"\n\"Bring it to the basement preservation chamber,\" I instructed, leading him through the mansion.\nThe subordinate showed no surprise at the unusual request, professionally transporting multiple large containers filled with Elite-rank beast meat. I’d ordered a substantial quantity - approximately fifty kilograms worth of high-quality magical beast corpses, all properly preserved and ready for consumption.\n\"Place them in organized sections along the walls,\" I directed as we reached the cold storage room. \"Ensure they’re easily accessible.\"\nHe worked efficiently, arranging the meat while I observed with Changing Star perched in my pocket. Her eyes sneakily tracked every piece being stored, clearly approving of the abundant food supply.\nOnce finished, the subordinate departed without unnecessary questions, maintaining the discretion expected of Blackwood family servants.\nI set Changing Star down and gestured at the newly stocked storage. \"This should keep you fed for quite a while. Eat whenever you’re hungry, but try not to make yourself sick from overeating, alright?\"\nShe seemed excited by the abundance, already approaching one of the fresh corpses with obvious interest.\n\"Remember what I told you,\" I continued seriously, kneeling to her level. \"Stay inside the mansion. Don’t leave under any circumstances. More deliveries will come regularly, so you’ll never run out of food.\"\nrawr...\nHer response carried understanding mixed with disappointment. Through our bond, I felt her reluctance at being left alone again.\nI gently stroked her head, feeling genuine regret at having to leave. \"I know. But this is necessary for your safety. I’ll visit every day, I promise.\"\nHer big sapphire eyes looked up at me with such sadness that I almost reconsidered my schedule. But staying longer would raise questions at the academy, and missing training sessions wasn’t a good idea.\n\"Be good while I’m gone.\"\nShe pressed her small head against my hand one final time before reluctantly accepting my departure.\nI left the mansion with mixed feelings, securing all entrances and retrieving my skateboard for the return journey to the academy.\nAs I accelerated toward campus, I could still feel Changing Star’s presence through our bond - content with her food supply but missing my company.\n’Soon,’ I thought. ’Once you’re stronger and the situation stabilizes, we’ll spend more time together.’\nAs I made my way back through the academy gates, the familiar notification pulsed through my consciousness.\n[Daily Login Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your daily reward?]\n[Yes | No]\nI selected yes immediately, curious what the system would provide today after the incredible Bloodline Evolution Card from yesterday.\n[Congratulations! You have received: Magical Engineering]\n[Rank: Tier 1]\n[Details: Complete knowledge of how to create and program magical items using mana-circuit design, enchantment integration, and systematic functionality implementation. This skill allows the bearer to construct complex magical devices with reproducible effects.]\nThe moment the notification completed, knowledge flooded into my mind like a dam breaking. Thousands of concepts, techniques, diagrams, and methodologies downloaded directly into my consciousness with perfect clarity.\nI understood suddenly how to design mana circuits that could store and process information. How to create enchantment matrices that responded to specific inputs. How to program conditional logic into magical constructs so they behaved predictably.\nBut what truly excited me was a specific realization that emerged from combining this new knowledge with my memories from Earth.\nI could create a smartphone.\nNot just a basic communication device, but a fully functional magical smartphone capable of taking photos, recording videos, and facilitating real-time communication using the same mana-based principles as communication crystals.\nAnd based on my new understanding, this would actually be superior to Earth’s phone technology in critical ways. There would be no signal delays or latency issues because mana-based communication was essentially instantaneous across distances. No internet connectivity problems because the devices would link directly through magical frequency attunement rather than relying on physical infrastructure. No dropped calls, no buffering, no dead zones - everything would operate on pure mana principles that transcended physical limitations.\nThe applications were staggering. Personal communication devices that anyone with mana could use. Photography and video documentation that captured magical phenomena Earth cameras could never record. Information storage and retrieval systems that operated at the speed of thought.\nAnd this magical engineering knowledge synergized perfectly with my existing blacksmithing skills. The physical construction, material selection, and durability concerns I’d already mastered through crafting weapons and equipment would translate directly to building these complex devices.\nMy mind raced with possibilities. The skateboard had already proven that introducing Earth concepts through magical implementation could create revolutionary products. A magical smartphone would be exponentially more impactful - transforming communication, documentation, and information access across the entire kingdom.\nThe commercial potential alone was astronomical. Every noble family, merchant organization, military unit, and academic institution would want these devices. The strategic advantages for coordination and intelligence gathering were obvious\nAnd as the only person with the supply, and knowledge behind this new ’invention’. I would be able to get information from all over the world, using the devices that they would use.\nI couldn’t wait to get into the blacksmithing facilities and start working on prototypes. The technical knowledge was fresh in my mind, and my hands practically itched to begin constructing the first magical smartphone this world had ever seen.\n’Training can wait an extra hour,’\nI decided, already changing direction toward the Section G workshops. ’This is too important to delay.’\nThe future had just arrived, and I was going to build it with my own hands.\nI changed course immediately and headed toward Section G’s blacksmithing facilities, my mind already racing through design specifications and component requirements. The training room could wait - this was too significant to postpone.\nAt the booking station, I reserved a premium workshop for four hours, knowing this project would require extended focus and experimentation.\n[-4,000 Points]\nThe facility I entered was one of the more advanced options, equipped with precision tools, high-grade materials, and magical forges capable of working with delicate enchantments. Perfect for what I needed.\nI began by laying out my conceptual framework. A magical smartphone required several fundamental components: a display surface that could show images and text, input mechanisms for user interaction, a power source to sustain operations, communication circuits for transmitting and receiving, and storage matrices for data retention.\nBut I quickly realized I couldn’t just start building the phone directly. The precision required for mana-circuit etching, the consistency needed for enchantment matrices, and the complexity of component assembly demanded specialized tools that didn’t exist yet.\nI needed to create the machines that would allow me to create the phone, then create more without having to start from scratch every single time.\n\"Foundation first,\" I muttered, pulling out materials and beginning to sketch designs.\nMy magical engineering knowledge provided theoretical frameworks, but translating Earth’s manufacturing concepts into magical implementation required trial and error. I was essentially inventing an entirely new production methodology.\nThe first machine I attempted was a precision mana-circuit etcher - a device that could inscribe incredibly fine pathways onto specially prepared material surfaces. My blacksmithing skills helped me forge the physical components, while the magical engineering knowledge guided the enchantment placement.\nActivate... test... failure.\nThe initial prototype failed immediately, the etching mechanism creating inconsistent line depths that would render any circuits useless. I adjusted the mana flow regulators and recalibrated the targeting matrices.\nSecond attempt... partial success.\nIt was better, but still not precise enough. The lines wavered slightly, introducing imperfections that would cause signal degradation. I redesigned the stabilization enchantments entirely, drawing on both skill sets to problem-solve the integration issues.\nThird attempt... pass!\nThe etcher finally produced clean, consistent lines at the microscopic scale required. Not perfect, but adequate for prototype development.\nNext came an enchantment stabilizer - a device that would hold magical matrices in perfect alignment while I integrated them into components. This proved even more challenging because it required balancing multiple competing force fields simultaneously.\nI spent nearly an hour troubleshooting why the stabilization fields kept collapsing, eventually discovering that my initial power distribution design created interference patterns. The solution involved completely restructuring the mana flow architecture using principles that combined blacksmithing material knowledge with engineering.\nTest... success!\nThe stabilizer held enchantments perfectly stable, allowing manipulation without degradation.\nThe third foundational machine was a component assembler - essentially a magical version of precise manufacturing equipment that could position tiny parts with perfect accuracy. This required the most sophisticated combination of both skills, using blacksmithing to create the physical manipulation arms and magical engineering to program their movement patterns.\nProgram sequence... test motion... adjust... retest...\nMultiple iterations were necessary to achieve the dexterity needed. The arms kept either moving too quickly and damaging components or too slowly to be practical. Finding the right balance of speed, precision, and force application required patient experimentation.",

      "content": "Chapter 161: Creating the First Smartphone!\nAfter three hours of intensive work, I finally had three functioning foundational machines: the precision etcher, the enchantment stabilizer, and the component assembler.\nI stood back and surveyed my creations with satisfaction. These weren’t just tools - they were the beginning of an entirely new manufacturing capability that this world had never seen.\nNow I could actually begin work on the smartphone itself.\nI pulled out refined materials and began designing the first prototype, my hands moving with confidence as both blacksmithing skill and magical engineering knowledge worked in perfect harmony.\n---\nWith my foundational machines operational, I finally began work on the smartphone itself. The first component I tackled was the display - arguably the most complex element requiring both visual output and touch input functionality.\n\"Display matrix first,\" I muttered, using the precision etcher to inscribe microscopic mana circuits onto a thin sheet of specially treated crystal glass.\nThe concept was straightforward in theory: create a grid of tiny magical nodes that could individually activate to display images, similar to pixels on Earth screens. Each node needed its own circuit pathway, power connection, and control mechanism.\nEtch... etch... etch...\nThe machine worked beautifully, creating thousands of infinitesimal circuit lines across the crystal surface. I configured it for a modest resolution - roughly equivalent to low range smartphone displays from Earth - knowing that starting too ambitious would guarantee failure.\nFailure wasn’t the only reason why I started with low range displays. The second reason was advancement, I wanted to use the same strategy that the major brands on Earth used to constantly rope in money from their customers.\nI would slowly increase the performance, display, camera and various other properties every quarter year.\nActivate... test...\nI channeled mana into the display circuits.\nFLASH! OVERLOAD!\nBrilliant light erupted from the crystal as every node activated simultaneously at maximum intensity, creating a blinding flare.\n\"Too much power distribution,\" I diagnosed immediately, examining the circuit design. \"The nodes have no individual regulation.\"\nThe problem was clear.\nI’d created pathways for power to reach each display node but hadn’t included logic gates to control when and how intensely each one activated. It was like wiring every light bulb in a building to a single switch with no dimmer controls.\nI redesigned the circuit architecture, adding branching control pathways that would allow individual node addressing. This required significantly more complex etching patterns and took another twenty minutes to implement properly.\nSecond attempt... activate...\nThis time, individual nodes lit up when I mentally commanded them through the control interface. Success! Sort of.\nThe display showed images, but they were fuzzy and inconsistent. Some nodes glowed brighter than others despite receiving identical power inputs. The image quality looked like a badly degraded photograph.\n\"Inconsistent node construction,\" I realized, examining the crystal under magnification. The etching had created slight variations in node size and depth, causing uneven light output.\nThis required recalibrating the etcher’s depth control and using higher-grade crystal with more uniform properties. The material upgrade cost significant points, but precision demanded quality materials.\nThird display attempt...\nClean, clear images! The nodes activated uniformly, creating recognizable shapes and text. I programmed simple test patterns - geometric shapes, gradients, basic text - and watched them render properly.\n\"Display functional,\" I confirmed with satisfaction.\nNext came the input mechanism. Earth phones used capacitive touch screens that detected finger contact through electrical field disruption. I needed a magical equivalent.\nI layered a thin enchantment matrix over the display that created a weak mana field. When something disrupted that field - like a finger touching the surface - the enchantment would register the location and translate it to input commands.\nTest touch input...\nI pressed my finger against the display.\nNothing happened.\n\"Field too weak,\" I muttered. I increased the mana flow to the touch-detection enchantment.\nTest again...\nThis time my finger registered, but so did my entire hand, my sleeve, and apparently the air molecules near the screen. The sensitivity was cranked too high, creating phantom touches everywhere.\nFinding the correct balance required tedious calibration. Too weak and it didn’t register genuine touches. Too strong and it registered everything. I spent thirty minutes adjusting the field strength incrementally until I found the sweet spot where deliberate finger contact registered reliably without false activations.\n\"Input functional,\" I confirmed after successful testing.\nThe communication component was next - the core functionality that would allow device-to-device contact. This drew heavily on communication crystal principles but required miniaturization and programming for selective connections.\nI created a specialized mana circuit that could broadcast and receive on specific magical frequencies, similar to how communication crystals worked but with added addressing protocols. Each device would have a unique \"signature\" that could be called specifically.\nActivate communication circuit... test...\nI built two prototype phones to test the communication function between them.\nDial connection... static... interference... failure.\nThe devices couldn’t establish clean connections. Interference from their own internal circuits was drowning out the communication signals. It was like trying to have a conversation while standing next to a running jet engine.\n\"Shielding needed,\" I realized. The internal circuits were leaking mana noise that disrupted the communication frequencies.\nI added isolation enchantments around the communication module, creating a magical \"faraday cage\" equivalent that prevented internal interference while still allowing external signal transmission.\nRetest communication...\nThis time, clean connection! Audio transmitted clearly between devices with no latency. I could speak into one phone and hear my voice emerge from the other instantly.\n\"Communication functional!\"\nThe power source proved surprisingly straightforward - a miniaturized version of the mana batteries used in larger magical devices, designed to recharge by absorbing ambient mana or through deliberate channeling. My blacksmithing experience with mana-conductive materials made this component relatively simple.\nStorage matrices for data retention were adapted from memory enchantments used in magical libraries. I created arrays that could encode information as specific mana patterns, allowing photos, videos, and recorded audio to be saved and retrieved.\nThe camera function required creating light-capture enchantments that could record visual information. This was conceptually similar to how certain magical paintings captured scenes, but engineered for instant operation and digital-style storage.\nTest photo capture...",

It was crude - the casing was simple metal rather than elegant design, the display was modest resolution, and various functions were basic - but it worked.\nI activated the device, navigated its simple interface, took a photo of my workbench, called the second prototype, and watched real-time communication occur with zero latency.\n\"It actually works,\" I said aloud, genuine amazement in my voice despite having designed it myself.\n----\nDespite the exhilaration of creating the first functional magical smartphone and wanting desperately to refine the design, add features, and perfect every component, I forced myself to stop.\nI looked at the crude but functional prototype in my hands, then at the various improvement ideas already forming in my mind. Better display resolution. Enhanced camera quality. Sleeker casing design. Additional applications and features. The possibilities were endless and genuinely exciting.\nBut strength was still more important.\nCreating these devices brought me genuine joy - the problem-solving, the innovation, the satisfaction of bringing Earth concepts into this magical world. However, that enjoyment couldn’t distract me from the fundamental reality: without sufficient personal power, all the brilliant inventions in the world wouldn’t protect me or those I cared about when genuine threats emerged.\nThe increasing beast aggression Sylvia had mentioned, my father’s dangerous mission, Kyle’s escalating rivalry, the Thornback nest elimination - all of these reminded me that combat capability remained the ultimate currency in this world. Innovation was valuable, but survival required strength first.\n\"This phone is good enough for now,\" I muttered, carefully storing both prototypes and the foundational machines in my spatial ring. \"Time to focus on what actually matters.\"\nI left the blacksmithing facility and headed directly toward the standard training rooms, my mind already shifting from engineering creativity to combat development priorities.\nThree hours passed in intensive focused training.\nI worked through each of my bloodline traits, pushing them toward their next advancement thresholds. Blood Control exercises focused on precision manipulation at increasing distances and complexity. Physical Enhancement training involved maximum output intervals that left my muscles burning. Supernatural Physique work tested my body’s limits through extreme stress applications.\nMy secret art practice incorporated the Royal-rank footwork technique, refining the fluid movements I had learnt until they became second nature rather than conscious effort. Each stance transition needed to flow seamlessly, creating combat advantages through positioning and momentum.\nOf course, I practised my overlord rank secret art that Carmilla had given me too. I had gotten much better and faster at the use of my null strike.\nSkill training covered everything from swordsmanship refinement to decision-making scenarios. I sparred against enchanted combat dummies set to Transcendent-rank difficulty, accepting injuries and exhaustion as necessary costs of improvement.\nThe training was gruelling but satisfying in a completely different way than engineering work. Where creation brought intellectual excitement, combat development provided visceral confirmation of growing capability.\nThud!\nI collapsed onto a training mat after completing the final exercise set, breathing heavily and covered in sweat. My muscles ached, my mana reserves were depleted, and minor injuries throbbed throughout my body.\nBut I felt stronger. Measurably, tangibly stronger.\nAs I caught my breath, I remembered I hadn’t checked on my father’s status today. With everything happening - Changing Star’s hatching, the smartphone creation, intensive training - I’d been distracted from monitoring his mission progress.\nI retrieved the Book of Hints from my storage ring and opened it with focused intent.\nNew text materialized across the page:\nDuke Marcus Blackwood approaches Thornhaven territory. Advance scouts report heavier monster presence than initial intelligence suggested. Combat encounters increasing in frequency and intensity. Royal-rank footwork integration continues improving combat effectiveness. Morale remains strong despite challenging conditions.\nProbability of survival: 60%\nA frown formed on my face as I processed the information.\nSixty percent. That was down two percentage points from the previous 62% reading.\nThe survival rate had been climbing steadily as my father trained and prepared, which had provided genuine relief. Seeing it drop, even slightly, was concerning because it indicated external factors working against him rather than internal capability issues.\nThe increased monster presence mentioned in the report aligned with Sylvia’s classroom briefing about escalating beast aggression across the kingdom. Whatever was driving the coordinated attacks wasn’t limited to Thornhaven - this appeared to be a pattern affecting multiple regions.\n\"External factors,\" I muttered, analyzing the tactical situation. \"Something beyond his control is making the mission more dangerous.\"\nThe two percent decrease wasn’t catastrophic, but it represented a negative trend that could continue worsening if the underlying causes weren’t addressed. My father’s personal strength was improving through secret art practice, but if the enemy forces kept growing or the situation deteriorated further, even enhanced capabilities might not be sufficient.\nI considered potential interventions. Could I send additional resources? Alert the family to deploy more support? The problem was that any significant changes would take time to implement, and my father was already approaching the target area.\n\"Sixty percent is still manageable odds,\" I told myself, though the reassurance felt hollow. \"Better than the original five percent by a massive margin.\"\nBut the downward trend bothered me more than the absolute number. If external pressures continued mounting, that sixty percent could become fifty, then forty, then lower. At what point would I need to take more drastic action?\nI stared at the book for a long moment before closing it carefully and returning it to storage.\nFor now, all I could do was trust in the preparations I’d already made - the Royal-rank secret art, the Typhoon Pendant, the troops my father had assembled. Those advantages remained valid regardless of external circumstances.\nBut I would be checking that survival percentage daily from now on, monitoring for any further deterioration that might require emergency intervention.\nMy father was walking into increasingly dangerous territory, and I could only watch the numbers and hope they didn’t fall too far.",

      "content": "Chapter 163: Kael’s Admission, Building something special.\nAs I walked through the academy corridors heading back toward the dormitories, Instructor Sylvia appeared around a corner and immediately signaled for me to approach her.\nI changed direction and walked over. \"Instructor, did you need something?\"\n\"Follow me,\" she said simply, already turning toward her office without waiting for confirmation.\nI followed her through the familiar hallways, wondering what this was about. Her expression was professionally neutral, giving no hints about the purpose of this summons.\nInside her office, she closed the door and gestured for me to take a seat before settling behind her desk.\n\"The academy administration has accepted your sponsorship request,\" she began without preamble. \"Your candidate can proceed with the examination process.\"\nRelief washed through me. \"Thank you for facilitating this, Instructor.\"\n\"However,\" she continued, \"before the pupil can be formally entered into the academy, several procedural requirements must be completed.\"\nI nodded attentively. \"Of course. What needs to happen?\"\n\"First, we need to schedule a specific time with the candidate. The examination committee requires advance notice to prepare appropriate testing materials and evaluators. Second, as previously discussed, the candidate must pass comprehensive examinations covering combat capability, theoretical knowledge, and magical aptitude.\"\n\"Understood. When would be the earliest available examination slot?\"\nSylvia consulted a schedule on her desk. \"Five days from now would be the soonest we could arrange all necessary personnel and facilities.\"\nI pulled out my smartphone to check my own schedule and coordinate timing. The device materialized in my hand naturally, and I activated the display to access my calendar function.\n\"Does the candidate need to be physically present here for scheduling, or can we contact him remotely?\" I asked while navigating the interface.\n\"You can contact him via communication crystal,\" Sylvia replied without looking up from her paperwork. \"We just need verbal confirmation of availability and—\"\nI had already accessed Kael’s contact information - I’d programmed his communication crystal signature into my phone’s address system - and initiated the call function.\n\"Adrian?\" Kael’s voice came through clearly from the phone’s speaker, the audio quality perfect despite the distance.\nSylvia’s head snapped up from her paperwork immediately, her eyes focusing on the device in my hand with obvious confusion. A frown formed on her face as she tried to reconcile what she was seeing and hearing.\nOf course she looked confused. This wasn’t a communication crystal - the standard magical item that everyone in this world used for distance communication. Those were typically palm-sized crystals that required direct contact and deliberate mana channeling to operate.\nWhat I was holding looked nothing like that. It was a flat rectangular device with a glowing display showing visual information, producing clear audio, and apparently functioning with completely different operational principles.\n\"Kael,\" I said, deliberately keeping my tone casual to avoid drawing more attention to the phone’s unusual nature. \"I’m with Instructor Sylvia at the academy. We’re scheduling your entrance examination. Are you available two days from now?\"\n\"Yes, absolutely,\" Kael’s voice came through with obvious enthusiasm. \"What time should I arrive?\"\nSylvia continued staring at my phone with that increasingly confused frown, clearly trying to understand what she was looking at. Her mind was probably running through possibilities, was this some rare magical artifact? A custom-made device? Something from outside the kingdom?\n\"Morning session, around dawn,\" I said, glancing at Sylvia for confirmation. She nodded mechanically while still focused on the phone. \"You’ll need to bring your weapon, any protective equipment you have, and be prepared for comprehensive testing.\"\n\"I understand. I’ll be ready.\"\n\"Good. I’ll send you additional details later. We’ll talk more soon.\"\n\"Thank you, Adrian. This opportunity means everything.\"\nI terminated the connection and the display went dark, leaving just the mysterious rectangular device in my hand.\nSylvia’s frown had deepened considerably. \"What... exactly was that device you just used?\"\nI considered my response carefully. Revealing too much about the smartphone’s capabilities wasn’t a good idea. But being overly secretive didn’t contribute to my plan, I had used my phone before her after all.\n\"A personal project I’ve been developing,\" I said with deliberate vagueness. \"It serves similar functions to communication crystals but with some enhanced features.\"\n\"Enhanced features,\" she repeated slowly, her instructor instincts clearly screaming that this was significant. \"Such as?\"\n\"Improved audio quality, visual interface, and more efficient mana usage,\" I offered, which was technically true while revealing minimal specifics. \"I’ve been experimenting with combining blacksmithing and enchantment techniques.\"\nSylvia studied me for a long moment, her sharp eyes trying to assess whether I was being deliberately evasive or genuinely providing complete information.\n\"That’s... remarkably advanced work for a first-year student,\" she finally said. \"The craftsmanship alone would interest the academy’s research division.\"\n\"Perhaps once I refine the design further,\" I deflected smoothly. \"This is still a prototype with various limitations.\"\nShe didn’t look entirely satisfied with my explanation but apparently decided not to press further for now.\n\"Don’t forget about your instructor when the artifact hits the market.\" She smiled brightly.\n\"Of course! You will be the first one to get it, instructor.\"\nShe nodded her head. \"Very well. Your candidate is scheduled for examination in two days, dawn session. Ensure he arrives properly prepared.\"\n\"He will be. Thank you, Instructor.\"\nI stood to leave, casually pocketing the smartphone as if it were nothing more remarkable than the communication crystal she’d assumed I would use.\nAs I exited her office, I could feel her eyes tracking my departure, her mind undoubtedly analyzing everything she’d just witnessed and filing it away for future consideration.\nThe smartphone had just made its first public appearance, and the questions were already beginning.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nI made my way back to the mansion, my mind already working through a solution to the persistent problem of being separated from Changing Star during training sessions.\nThe answer was elegantly simple: create my own advanced training facilities right here in the mansion.\nI had entered transcendent-rank training rooms earlier at the academy and used my smartphone’s camera function to capture detailed images of their construction, enchantment layouts, and equipment configurations. While our family’s workers were skilled, the academy possessed the absolute best facilities and design specifications in the kingdom. Rather than reinvent everything from scratch, I could simply replicate their proven systems.\nThe mansion had more than enough space for a comprehensive training complex. Multiple large rooms could be converted into specialized facilities for different aspects of development - combat practice, skill refinement, endurance testing, mana control exercises. Having everything available here would eliminate the constant back-and-forth travel and allow me to spend significantly more time with Changing Star while still maintaining my advancement schedule.\nI entered the mansion and immediately began searching for Changing Star to check on her condition after being alone most of the day.\nI found her in one of the second-floor bedrooms, curled up peacefully in sleep.\nBut what shocked me was her size.\nShe had grown dramatically since this morning - far more than I’d anticipated even knowing about her Devour skill’s accelerated development capabilities. Where she’d been roughly the size of a small cat when I’d left earlier, she was now approaching the dimensions of a small-sized puppy.\nHer body had lengthened, her wings had expanded proportionally, and her overall mass had increased substantially.\n\"She’s growing too quickly,\" I muttered with mixed amazement and concern.\nAt this rate of development, she’d reach a dragon size within weeks rather than the years it should take. The Devour skill’s description had mentioned growth that \"transcended other races,\" but seeing the practical results was staggering.\nHopefully it slows down a little. Having a large dragon isn’t exactly easy to hide.\nI didn’t want to wake her from what appeared to be deep, peaceful sleep. Growth required rest, and disturbing her recovery seemed counterproductive.\nBut apparently my presence alone was enough.\nHer nose twitched softly as she detected my scent, those delicate nostrils flaring slightly. Then her glittering sapphire eyes opened, focusing on me immediately with recognition and joy.\n\"RAWR!\"\nThe sound was deeper than her previous chirps, carrying actual draconic resonance despite her young age. She launched herself at me with surprising speed and coordination, her improved size and strength making the impact far more substantial than her previous cute stumbles.\nTHUD!\nI caught her reflexively as she collided with my chest, her small claws gripping my clothes while her tail wrapped around my arm enthusiastically. The weight was definitely noticeable now, she felt like holding a genuine puppy rather than the lightweight hatchling from yesterday.\nPurr purr purr!\nThat adorable cat-like purring started immediately, the vibrations stronger and more pronounced than before. She pressed her head against my chest affectionately, clearly thrilled by my return.\n\"I missed you too,\" I said with genuine warmth, gently stroking her soft head.\nThrough our bond, I felt her emotions clearly - happiness at my presence, contentment from her growth progress, and hunger that was beginning to resurface despite her recent meal.\n\"Let’s get you fed, then I want to show you something,\" I said, already planning to involve her in exploring the spaces that would become our personal training facilities.\nHaving her nearby while I worked would solve multiple problems at once - she wouldn’t be lonely, I could monitor her rapid development, and we could strengthen our bond through shared time.\nThe mansion was becoming more than just a sanctuary. It was becoming our true home.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nI carried Changing Star down to the basement preservation chamber, her purring continuing the entire way.\n\"You’ve been eating well,\" I observed, noting how much of the fifty kilograms of Elite-rank meat had already been consumed. Nearly a third of the supply had disappeared in less than a day.",

      "content": "Chapter 164: Plans for Building\nRAWR!\nShe squirmed in my arms eagerly as we approached the cold storage, clearly recognizing where we were heading. The moment I set her down, she waddled directly to one of the larger corpses and began tearing into it with noticeably improved jaw strength.\nCrunch! Nom nom nom!\nHer eating had become more efficient. Where before she’d taken delicate bites, now she consumed meat in larger chunks, her developing teeth and jaw muscles allowing her to process food faster. The cute eating sounds remained, but they carried more power behind them.\nI watched her feast while mentally reviewing the mansion’s layout and identifying optimal spaces for training facility conversion. The large empty room on the third floor would work perfectly for a main combat area. Several basement chambers could serve as specialised stations. The expansive grounds behind the mansion offered outdoor training possibilities once I established proper security and privacy measures.\nAfter Changing Star had eaten her fill - approximately ten kilograms of meat in one sitting, which was absurd given her size - I picked her up again despite her food-heavy weight.\n\"Come on. I want to show you the spaces where we’ll be training together soon.\"\nChirp?\nShe tilted her head curiously, not fully understanding but trusting my intent.\nI carried her up to the third floor and entered the massive open room I’d identified during my initial mansion exploration. The space was easily fifty feet by thirty feet with twenty-foot ceilings - comparable to the academy’s mid-tier training facilities.\n\"This will be our main combat training area,\" I explained, setting Changing Star down so she could explore. \"Once I install proper reinforcement enchantments, combat dummies, and measurement systems, we’ll both be able to practice here without me constantly travelling to the academy.\"\nWaddle waddle!\nShe began investigating the empty room with renewed energy, her claws clicking against the hardwood flooring. The open space seemed to excite her, and she attempted an experimental run, her coordination had improved considerably with her size change. She no longer fell and tumbled over her own tail, which was really good to see.\nI pulled out my smartphone and reviewed the photos I’d taken of the academy’s Transcendent-rank training rooms. The enchantment matrices were visible in the images - complex patterns etched into walls, floors, and ceilings that provided structural reinforcement, energy absorption, and safety failsafes.\n\"The workers should be able to replicate most of this,\" I muttered, analysing the designs with my combined blacksmithing and magical engineering knowledge. \"The materials will be expensive, but the family resources can cover it.\"\nI’d need specialized components: reinforced flooring that could withstand Transcendent-level impacts, wall enchantments that absorbed kinetic energy, ceiling arrays that prevented structural damage from upward force, and integrated measurement systems to track combat effectiveness.\nThe project would take significant time and gold, but having private facilities meant I could train without schedule restrictions, equipment competition, or curious observers documenting my techniques.\nRAWR!\nChanging Star’s call drew my attention. She’d discovered she could generate small bursts of frost breath - tiny puffs of cold mist that crystallized the air in front of her face. She seemed delighted by this new ability, repeatedly exhaling freezing breath and watching the effects with obvious fascination.\n\"Ice affinity,\" I noted with interest. \"Makes sense given your colouring. I wonder who has a stronger bloodline, you or Kael. \"\nHer draconic abilities were beginning to manifest alongside her physical growth. Soon she’d develop genuine combat capabilities rather than just adorable party tricks.\nI spent some more time exploring the mansion with Changing Star, identifying additional spaces for specialised training. A medium room would work for skill practice and technique refinement. A basement chamber had perfect conditions for meditation and mana control exercises. The outdoor grounds could accommodate large-scale movement training and eventually flight practice once Changing Star’s wings developed sufficiently.\n\"This is going to be perfect,\" I said, feeling genuine excitement about the project. \"Our own private training complex where we can develop without limitations.\"\nChirp chirp!\nChanging Star responded enthusiastically, her tail swishing as she continued exploring with boundless curiosity.\nI made mental notes about material requirements, estimated costs, and construction timelines. Converting these spaces into functional training facilities would take at least a few days of focused work, possibly longer depending on component availability and enchantment complexity.\nBut the investment would be worth it. Having Changing Star nearby while training, avoiding academy schedule conflicts, and maintaining complete privacy for experimental techniques would accelerate both our developments significantly.\nI settled onto the floor of what would become our combat training room, and Changing Star immediately curled up beside me, her purring resuming as she pressed against my side.\nI pulled out my smartphone and contacted the same family subordinate who had handled the Thornback nest operation.\n\"Young Master Blackwood,\" his professional voice came through promptly.\n\"Marcus, I wanted to check on the status of the Thornback materials sale. How much have we generated so far?\"\n\"Excellent timing, young master. The Elite-rank materials have been processed and sold through our merchant networks. Total revenue reached approximately 70,250 golden coins, and we still have additional materials in processing that should sell within the next few days. The final totals will likely exceed 80,000 once everything is liquidated.\"\nI nodded with satisfaction. Nearly eighty thousand gold from a single night’s work - that was decent income even by ducal standards.\n\"Good. I have a new project that will require those funds and your organizational capabilities.\"\n\"Of course, young master. What do you need?\"\n\"I want to convert several rooms in my mansion into advanced training facilities - combat areas, specialized practice chambers, equipment installations. I will tell you detailed specifications based on the academy’s Transcendent-rank facilities.\"\nAfter listening to everything I told him about, and noting it down, he said. \"These are... quite comprehensive, young master. You’re essentially requesting academy-quality construction in a private residence.\"\n\"Exactly. Can it be done?\"\n\"Absolutely. We have craftsmen and enchanters capable of this work. However, the cost will be significant given the materials and expertise required.\"\n\"How much?\"\n\"Approximately 150,000 golden coins for complete implementation of everything in these specifications. That includes reinforced flooring, wall enchantments, ceiling arrays, combat dummies at various rank levels, measurement systems, and safety failsafes.\"\nI considered the number briefly. It was high but not unreasonable given what I was requesting. The Thornback sales would cover roughly half, and family resources could easily provide the remainder.\n\"That’s acceptable. Get started as soon as possible.\"\n\"I can have crews mobilised by tomorrow morning if you approve immediate commencement. The location is the mansion where we’ve been delivering meat supplies, correct?\"\n\"Correct. You’re already familiar with the property.\"\n\"Indeed. With proper crew allocation and working in shifts, we can complete everything within two days. The enchantment work is the most time-intensive component, but our enchanters can handle it efficiently.\"\nTwo days. That was remarkably fast for such construction, but the Blackwood family employed the best craftsmen in the duchy specifically for rapid, quality work.\n\"Excellent. Begin tomorrow.\"\n\"Understood, young master. I’ll coordinate everything personally and provide progress updates. Is there anything else you require?\"\n\"Just maintain discretion about this project. The fewer people who know about my private training facilities, the better.\"\n\"Of course. Only essential personnel will be informed, all under family confidentiality oaths.\"\n\"Good job, Marcus. Proceed with the work.\"\nI terminated the connection and looked at Changing Star, who was still purring beside me.\nTwo days of construction, and then we’d have everything we needed. Private facilities where I could push my limits without observation, where Changing Star could develop her abilities freely, and where we could both grow strong enough to face the challenges ahead.\n150,000 golden coins were in a way, expensive, but strength was priceless.\nAnd with the training complex operational, I’d be able to accelerate both our developments far beyond what the academy’s shared facilities allowed.\nI waited patiently until Changing Star had fallen asleep, her gentle purring gradually fading as she drifted into deep rest. Her body was curled protectively around herself, wings folded neatly against her sides, completely at peace in our new sanctuary.\nOnce certain she wouldn’t wake, I carefully slipped out of the mansion and made my way to where I’d arranged for a carriage to wait. The driver asked no questions as I gave directions toward the eastern hunting grounds - family servants understood that the young master’s business was not their concern.\nDespite my steadily increasing strength and recent advancements, I couldn’t afford to stop accumulating soul power. Soul power was the fundamental currency of advancement in this world. Combat skills, bloodline traits, and equipment all mattered, but without sufficient soul essence absorption, true rank progression remained impossible.\nMore importantly, once I reached Transcendent rank, I would finally be able to unlock the second stance of the Overlord-rank secret art that Carmilla had given me. That technique represented power beyond anything I currently possessed, but it remained sealed until I met the prerequisite advancement requirement.\nI hadn’t lost track of my ultimate goal: gaining enough strength to survive the ordeal that I knew the novel had warned me about. And once I did survive, I still had to fulfill my promise to Carmilla- a blood oath bound directly to my heart that would definitely kill me if broken. The progress was promising so far, but complacency would be fatal.\nThe carriage deposited me at the forest edge, and I proceeded on foot into the deeper territories where Transcendent-rank beasts typically roamed.\nSilence... emptiness...\nTwo hours of hunting passed, and my growing frustration deepened with each passing minute.",

      "content": "Chapter 165: Creating my own Training Facilities\nI had only encountered two Transcendent-rank beasts in the entire area, a region that was supposed to be rampant with such creatures.\nThe first had been a Flame Wolf that I’d eliminated quickly. The second was a Stone Badger similar to the one I’d killed previously, dispatched with ease.\nBut after those two kills? Nothing.\nJust empty forest and the occasional low Elite-rank specimen that ventured too deep, they weren’t worth the effort.\n\"Where are all the Transcendent beasts?\" I muttered, scanning the darkness with my enhanced senses.\nThe scarcity wasn’t natural. These hunting grounds had always maintained healthy populations of powerful creatures, that’s what made them valuable training areas for experienced awakeners.\nFinding only two Transcendent specimens in two hours of active searching suggested something was wrong.\nCould this be related to the increased beast aggression Sylvia had mentioned? Were Transcendent creatures being drawn elsewhere by whatever was coordinating the attacks on settlements? Or had something even more powerful moved into the region and driven them away?\nThe implications troubled me. If Transcendent beasts were becoming scarce in established hunting grounds, accumulating the soul power I needed would become significantly more difficult and time-consuming.\nI continued searching for another thirty minutes without success before finally accepting that tonight’s hunt had reached its limit of productivity.\n\"Two Transcendent kills will have to be enough,\" I decided reluctantly.\nThe soul power from those eliminations would contribute to my advancement, but it wasn’t the harvest I’d hoped for.\nAt this rate, reaching Transcendent rank would take longer than my calculations had projected.\nI made my way back to where the carriage waited, my mind already considering alternative hunting locations and strategies for finding adequate prey.\nThe forest felt wrong somehow - too quiet, too empty of the powerful presences that should dominate these territories. Something was changing in the ecosystem, and I didn’t like the implications.\nAs the carriage carried me back toward the mansion, I resolved to investigate this phenomenon more thoroughly.\nUnderstanding why Transcendent beasts were becoming scarce could provide critical information about whatever larger forces were moving in the kingdom.\nEarly the next morning, workers had already begun arriving at the mansion in organized crews. Today was an off-day from the academy, which worked out perfectly for overseeing this major construction project without missing classes.\nMy first priority was ensuring nobody discovered Changing Star’s existence. I’d moved her to a secure upper floor bedroom with strict instructions through our bond to remain absolutely quiet and hidden.\nThe door was locked, enchanted with privacy wards, and positioned in a section of the mansion I’d explicitly told workers was off-limits for \"personal storage.\"\nKnock knock knock\n\"Young Master Blackwood,\" The subordinate greeted as I opened the main entrance. \"The construction crews are ready to begin. Senior Enchanter Aldric and Master Blacksmith Torven are here to oversee the specialized work.\"\nBehind him stood two elderly craftsmen whose weathered appearances belied their sharp, intelligent eyes. These were the family’s most skilled specialists, men who had served the Blackwood duchy for decades and possessed expertise that commanded respect throughout the kingdom.\n\"Gentlemen, thank you for coming on short notice,\" I said, leading them inside. \"Let me show you exactly what needs to be constructed.\"\nI pulled out my smartphone to display the reference photos I’d taken of the academy’s training facilities. The moment the device activated and images appeared on the glowing display, both elderly craftsmen froze.\n\"What... is that?\" Enchanter Aldric asked, his voice carrying genuine shock.\nMaster Blacksmith Torven leaned closer, squinting at the smartphone with obvious fascination. \"I’ve never seen anything like it. Is that some kind of projection device?\"\n\"It’s called a smartphone,\" I explained, navigating through the photos to show them various angles of the training room designs.\n\"A personal project combining magical engineering and blacksmithing techniques. It can capture images, transmit communication, and store information.\"\nBoth craftsmen’s eyes widened progressively as I demonstrated the device’s capabilities, zooming in on specific enchantment details, switching between multiple photos, even playing back a short video I’d recorded of combat dummy operation.\n\"Extraordinary,\" Aldric breathed. \"The enchantment matrices required for image capture and storage alone would be... I can’t even conceptualize how you’d miniaturize them to this scale.\"\nTorven was examining the phone’s physical construction with interest. \"And the materials? The casing appears to be refined metal, but the internal components must be incredibly complex.\"\n\"I can provide you both with specimen units once I’ve refined the production process,\" I offered, knowing this would secure their complete enthusiasm for the project.\nBoth elderly craftsmen’s faces lit up with genuine excitement, not because they wanted communication devices, but because they recognized an opportunity to learn something entirely new.\nThese were men who had dedicated their lives to mastering their crafts, and the prospect of understanding revolutionary techniques was more valuable than gold.\n\"You have our complete commitment, young master,\" Aldric said with renewed energy. \"We’ll ensure this training complex exceeds even academy standards.\"\nTorven nodded vigorously. \"Any project from someone capable of creating such innovation deserves our absolute best work.\"\nTheir enthusiasm became immediately apparent as they began organizing their teams with increased vigor. These were loyal Blackwood family workers who had served for generations, I wasn’t concerned about leaks or harmful intentions. Their discretion was guaranteed by both family loyalty and confidentiality oaths.\nLarge carriages began arriving in steady succession, each one filled with specialized equipment and premium materials. Reinforced flooring materials, enchantment-grade metals, arrays for measurement systems, mana-conductive wiring, and various other components were carefully unloaded and organized.\nThe blacksmiths immediately established a temporary forge in one of the mansion’s courtyards, their hammers beginning the rhythmic work of shaping metal components for equipment frames and structural supports.\nThe sound of skilled craftsmanship filled the air.\nCLANG! CLANG! CLANG!\nMeanwhile, the enchanters began their meticulous work on the designated training spaces. Aldric personally supervised the installation of structural reinforcement enchantments, his experienced hands tracing complex patterns onto walls and floors with absolute precision.",

      "content": "Chapter 166: Soul Stone\n\"These enchantments will absorb impacts up to mid-Transcendent levels,\" he explained as I observed. \"Beyond that threshold, you’ll need commander-rank specifications which would triple the cost.\"\n\"Mid-Transcendent is sufficient for now,\" I confirmed, knowing I could upgrade later if necessary.\nAdditional enchanters worked on privacy and security measures - wards that would prevent magical surveillance, barriers that blocked unauthorized entry, and detection systems that would alert me to any intrusion attempts.\n\"The spy-proofing enchantments are military grade,\" one enchanter noted with professional pride. \"Even Royal-rank observation techniques would struggle to penetrate these wards without triggering alarms.\"\nThroughout the day, I moved between work areas, answering questions, providing clarifications from my reference materials, and ensuring everything proceeded according to specifications. The smartphone proved invaluable for quick reference - I could pull up specific details instantly rather than relying on memory or physical drawings.\nBy late afternoon, the basic structural work was well underway. The main combat training room had received its reinforced flooring and was being fitted with wall enchantments. Specialized equipment chambers were taking shape in the basement. The outdoor training grounds were being prepared with proper boundary wards.\nThe speed and quality of work reflected both the craftsmen’s expertise and their genuine enthusiasm for the project. Having promised them smartphones had apparently transformed this from routine construction into a personal investment in learning new techniques.\n\"We’ll work through the night in shifts,\" Marcus informed me as evening approached. \"At this pace, everything should be completed by tomorrow evening.\"\nI nodded with satisfaction, watching dozens of skilled workers coordinating seamlessly to transform a small portion of my mansion into a world-class training facility.\nThis investment would pay for itself many times over through the training efficiency and privacy it provided.\nToday had been relatively calm with the workers managing construction independently, so I decided Changing Star deserved a change of scenery. She’d been cooped up in the mansion since hatching, and while the space was comfortable, a young dragon needed stimulation and new experiences.\nThe challenge was taking her outside without revealing her true nature.\nI retrieved a specialized concealment enchantment I’d prepared earlier, a small charm that would suppress her draconic aura and make her appear as a common magical pet to casual observation. Nothing too sophisticated could penetrate the disguise, but it would fool normal people and elite-rank awakeners easily enough.\n\"Hold still,\" I instructed as I carefully attached the charm to a simple collar around her neck.\nHer distinctive dragon presence immediately dampened to something resembling a Noble-rank magical creature - unusual enough to be interesting but not alarming.\nI also donned my mask, the one that transformed my appearance to show my original Earth features. No point in Adrian Blackwood being seen walking around the city with a mysterious pet when that would just invite questions and attention.\nDespite the construction activity at the mansion, there was no risk of connecting this property to the Blackwood family. Our workers were hired by dozens of wealthy clients throughout the capital, and one more private residence receiving renovations wouldn’t draw unusual scrutiny.\nWearing my Earth face and casual clothing, I left the estate through a side entrance and made my way into the city proper.\nChanging Star’s small head peeked out from my jacket pocket, positioned so she could observe everything while remaining mostly concealed. Her big round eyes glinted with fascination as she took in the urban environment for the first time.\nShe made soft sounds of wonder as we walked through the bustling streets. The capital was alive with afternoon activity - merchants calling out their wares, carriages navigating cobblestone roads, awakeners in various ranks going about their business, street performers entertaining crowds.\nEverything was new and exciting to her. The smells of food from street vendors made her nose twitch. The sounds of conversation and commerce captured her attention. The visual spectacle of colorful buildings and diverse people kept her eyes constantly moving.\n\"Stay quiet and still,\" I reminded her gently through our bond. \"We’re just observing today.\"\nHer acknowledgment was soft and obedient, though her tail swished excitedly inside my jacket.\nWe passed through the merchant district where shops displayed everything from magical equipment to exotic fabrics. Changing Star’s eyes widened at a jewelry store’s glittering display, the precious stones apparently triggering some instinctive draconic appreciation for treasure.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nThe day ended with me carrying several bags of purchases that totaled nearly a thousand golden coins - an amount that would make most people wince, but felt entirely justified given Changing Star’s reaction.\nI’d bought her a collection of polished gemstones from the jewelry district that she’d been absolutely mesmerized by.\nHer draconic instincts had been drawn to them like a magnet, and watching her eyes light up with pure joy as I allowed her to select which ones she wanted had been worth every coin.\nThere was also a magical cushion enchanted for comfort that she’d shown interest in, several high-quality meat treats from a gourmet beast provisions shop, and a decorative collar with protective enchantments that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.\nThe look on her face throughout the shopping expedition - pure happiness radiating through our bond with each new acquisition - made every purchase worthwhile.\nOur connection was deeper than I’d initially anticipated. This wasn’t just a strategic partnership or a master-pet relationship. There was genuine affection developing between us, a bond that transcended simple utility.\nAs we headed back toward the mansion, weaving through the evening crowds with Changing Star contentedly nestled in my pocket with her new treasures, the familiar notification pulsed through my consciousness.\n[Daily Login Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your daily reward?]\n[Yes | No]\nI selected yes mentally while maintaining my walking pace, curious what the system would provide after yesterday’s magical engineering knowledge.\n[Congratulations!

      "content": "Chapter 167: Soul Stone [2]\nI nearly stopped walking in the middle of the street.\nReading through the details, I was shocked once again by the system and its rewards. The rewards were consistently surprising, but this one was particularly extraordinary.\nI had never imagined that soul power could be extracted, crystallized, and stored in physical form.\nThe concept itself was revolutionary - soul power wasn’t a material substance that could be bottled or preserved. It was absorbed directly from defeated creatures through some mysterious metaphysical process that nobody fully understood.\nIn other terms, soul power was as mysterious as mana itself. Nobody knew exactly how either force existed or functioned on a fundamental level.\nAwakeners could manipulate mana and absorb soul power, but the underlying mechanisms remained complete enigmas even to the most advanced scholars and researchers.\nEven Kyle in the original novel, with his powerful golden finger advantage, had never truly understood soul power’s nature.\nOn the way back to the mansion, I continued contemplating what to do with the Soul Stone. The temptation to use it myself remained strong, but practical considerations kept surfacing.\nI could hunt outside whenever needed. The scarcity of Transcendent beasts was concerning, but I had mobility, resources, and the ability to travel to different hunting grounds if necessary. Finding prey was difficult but not impossible for me.\nChanging Star, however, was confined to the mansion. She couldn’t leave to hunt her own food or seek out stronger creatures to accelerate her growth. Her advancement depended entirely on what I could provide - and while I’d stocked Elite-rank meat generously, Transcendent-level resources were far more difficult to supply consistently.\nThe Soul Stone represented an opportunity I couldn’t easily replicate for her. For me, it was a convenient shortcut. For her, it was a transformative leap that might take months to achieve through normal feeding.\n\"She needs it more than I do,\" I concluded as the mansion came into view.\n-----\nInside the mansion, I found Changing Star in her claimed bedroom, contentedly arranging the gemstones from our shopping trip. She looked up as I entered, her tail swishing in greeting.\n\"I have something special for you,\" I said, manifesting the Soul Stone from my inventory.\nThe moment the crystallized sphere appeared in my palm, Changing Star’s entire demeanor transformed.\n*CHIRP!*\nHer eyes locked onto the stone with laser-like intensity, growing impossibly wider as she recognized something profoundly desirable. She immediately abandoned her gemstones and rushed toward me, her small body practically vibrating with excitement.\n*Chirp chirp chirp!*\nShe began making the most adorable begging sounds - high-pitched, urgent chirps mixed with small plaintive whines. Her front claws lifted off the ground in a begging gesture I’d never seen from her before, her big sapphire eyes staring at the Soul Stone with desperate longing.\n*Rawr... chirp... pleeeease...*\nThe way she tilted her head, the trembling excitement in her tail, the absolute focus of her attention - it was impossibly cute. She wanted this more than anything I’d ever shown her.\n\"Alright, alright,\" I said with an amused smile, kneeling down to her level. \"This is very powerful soul energy. It’s going to make you much stronger, but it might feel intense. Ready?\"\n*RAWR RAWR!*\nHer enthusiastic affirmation was immediate and emphatic. She practically lunged toward my hand, barely restraining herself from snatching the stone immediately.\nI placed the Soul Stone on the floor in front of her.\n*CHOMP!*\nChanging Star didn’t hesitate for even a fraction of a second. She dove forward and swallowed the crystallized soul power whole in one swift gulp, her small throat visibly bulging as the marble-sized stone went down.\nFor a brief moment, everything seemed normal.\nThen her body erupted with light.\n*GLOW! INTENSIFY! RADIATE!*\nBrilliant luminescence burst from her scales, so bright I had to shield my eyes. The light wasn’t just reflecting off her surface - it was emanating from within, as if she’d swallowed concentrated starlight. Prismatic colors swirled around her small form, creating kaleidoscopic patterns that filled the entire room.\nThe intensity increased rapidly, the glow pulsing with rhythmic waves that seemed to match a heartbeat. Changing Star’s body trembled as the massive influx of Transcendent-rank soul power flooded her system.\n*THUD!*\nShe collapsed suddenly, her small body hitting the floor with alarming finality. The glowing continued but her eyes had closed, her limbs going completely limp.\n\"Changing Star!\"\nFear spiked through me immediately. I rushed to her side and carefully lifted her unresponsive body, my heart racing with worry. Had the Soul Stone been too powerful? Had I just killed her by giving her energy she couldn’t process?\n*Check... assess... please be okay...*\nI frantically examined her through our bond, searching for any signs of distress or damage. My enhanced senses checked her breathing, her heartbeat, any indication of what was happening internally.\nRelief flooded through me as the bond revealed the truth.\nShe was fine. Completely fine.\nHer breathing was deep and steady, her heartbeat strong and rhythmic. Through our connection, I could sense the Transcendent soul power being systematically processed by her Devour skill, integrating into her body and spirit with remarkable efficiency.\nShe wasn’t injured or dying - she was simply asleep.\n\"She couldn’t handle staying conscious while digesting this much energy,\" I realized, my panic subsiding into understanding.\nIt made perfect sense. The Soul Stone contained the equivalent of an entire Transcendent creature’s worth of soul power - a massive amount of essence that even her specialized Devour ability needed time to fully integrate. Her body had essentially shut down all non-essential functions to focus entirely on processing and absorption.\nLike eating such an enormous feast that immediate sleep became unavoidable, except on a metaphysical level with soul energy instead of food.\nThe glowing gradually stabilized from chaotic surges into steady, rhythmic pulses. Her small face looked peaceful rather than pained, her body relaxed despite the intense internal transformation occurring.\nI carefully carried her to the magical cushion and arranged her comfortably among her beloved gemstones. The prismatic light from the soul power integration made her look almost ethereal - a small dragon surrounded by treasure, glowing with inner radiance.\n\"Rest well,\" I whispered, gently stroking her head. \"When you wake up, you’re going to be so much stronger.\"\nI settled nearby to keep watch, unwilling to leave her alone during this vulnerable state. Through our bond, I monitored the integration progress - steady, systematic, and remarkably efficient.\nThe Soul Stone had found its perfect recipient, and Changing Star was about to undergo a transformation that would dramatically accelerate her path toward her ultimate potential.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nThe next morning arrived with the sounds of final construction activity echoing through the mansion. I’d woken early to check on Changing Star - still peacefully asleep and glowing softly as she continued processing the Soul Stone’s massive energy - before heading to one of the newly completed basement training chambers to work through my morning exercises.\nI was in the middle of practicing blood manipulation techniques, sweat coating my skin from the intensive workout, when I heard footsteps approaching.\nKnock knock\n\"Young Master Blackwood?\" His subordinate’s voice called from outside the training room.\n\"Enter,\" I responded, pausing my exercise and grabbing a towel to wipe away the perspiration.\nMarcus entered accompanied by Enchanter Aldric and Master Blacksmith Torven, all three looking satisfied but tired from the accelerated construction schedule.\n\"The project is complete, young master,\" Marcus announced with professional pride. \"All facilities have been finished according to your specifications and are ready for immediate use.\"\n\"Already?\" I checked mentally - they’d promised two days, and it had been exactly that. \"Excellent work. Show me.\"\n-----\nOver the next thirty minutes, they guided me through a comprehensive tour of the completed facilities.\nThe main combat training room was identical to the academy’s Transcendent-rank facilities - reinforced flooring that could withstand devastating impacts, wall enchantments that absorbed kinetic energy, ceiling arrays providing structural protection, and integrated measurement systems displaying combat power readings in real-time.\nThe specialized practice chambers in the basement offered perfect environments for skill refinement, mana control exercises, and technique development. Each room contained appropriate equipment - combat dummies at various rank levels, enchanted targets for precision training, and meditation platforms for cultivation work.\nThe outdoor training grounds had been secured with military-grade privacy wards and boundary enchantments that would prevent surveillance while containing any energy releases from intense practice.\n\"This is perfect,\" I said with genuine satisfaction, examining the craftsmanship. \"Everything matches the academy specifications exactly. You’ve exceeded my expectations.\"\nAldric and Torven exchanged pleased glances at the praise, though I noticed both men seemed hesitant about something. They kept glancing at each other as if debating whether to speak.\n\"Young master...\" Torven began uncertainly, then trailed off.\nAldric cleared his throat. \"We were wondering if... that is to say, you had mentioned...\"\nThey were clearly too shy to directly ask about the smartphones I’d promised, despite their obvious eagerness.\nI smiled, understanding their hesitation. \"Don’t worry, I didn’t forget what I promised you.\"\nBoth elderly craftsmen’s faces immediately lit up like excited children, their professional dignity momentarily forgotten in favor of genuine enthusiasm.\n\"The specimen units will be ready within the week,\" I continued. \"I need to refine a few components and establish proper production protocols, but you’ll both receive fully functional smartphones as thanks for this excellent work.\"\n\"Thank you, young master!\" they said almost in unison, nodding happily with barely contained excitement.\nThe contrast was amusing - these were master craftsmen with decades of experience, respected throughout the kingdom for their expertise, yet they were grinning like youngsters who’d been promised special treats.\n\"The opportunity to study such revolutionary enchantment work is payment enough,\" Aldric added, trying to regain some composure. \"But we are genuinely grateful for your generosity.\"\n\"Your craftsmanship deserves proper recognition,\" I replied. \"And I suspect having two of the kingdom’s best specialists familiar with smartphone construction will prove valuable for future projects.\"\nThat made them both straighten with renewed purpose, clearly already thinking about potential collaboration opportunities.\nAfter they departed with Marcus to finalize documentation and arrange payment processing, I stood alone in my new personal training complex.\nPerfect facilities, complete privacy, and the ability to train alongside Changing Star once she woke.\nThe investment had been worth every golden coin.\nNow I just needed to put these rooms to proper use and accelerate my advancement toward the strength required to survive what was coming.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

You have received: Soul Stone]\n[Rank: Transcendent]\n[Details: A crystallized stone containing soul power equivalent to a complete Transcendent-rank creature. Can be absorbed directly to advance cultivation and strengthen soul foundation. Single use consumable.]\n\"Again?\"\nI stared at the notification in genuine surprise. The exact same reward two days in a row - that had never happened before. The system typically varied its offerings dramatically, cycling through different categories of items, skills, and resources with seemingly random distribution.\nGetting duplicate Transcendent Soul Stones on consecutive days was unprecedented in my experience with the daily reward system.\nNot that I was complaining, a smile formed on my face as I considered the benefits. If the system wanted to shower me with concentrated soul power, I certainly wouldn’t object.\nThe first stone had gone to Changing Star and was clearly producing dramatic results based on her ongoing integration process. This second one presented an interesting opportunity.\nI could use it myself this time, or...\n\"Kojiro.\"\nI summoned the echo swordsman from his card form. The Swordsman materialised smoothly, his presence solidifying into the familiar armored figure carrying his sword on his hip.\n\"Master,\" he acknowledged with a respectful nod.\n\"I have something for you,\" I said, manifesting the Soul Stone. \"This contains Transcendent-rank soul power that will strengthen you significantly. You haven’t fully solidified your soul power after your recent advancement, this will help you.\"\nKojiro examined the sphere with obvious interest, his experienced warrior instincts recognizing its value immediately.\nBefore giving it to him, I gestured around the newly completed training complex. \"Also, welcome to our new base. This mansion is now my primary residence and training facility. These rooms match academy-level specifications - you’ll be staying here permanently unless I’m out hunting and need to bring you along in card form or if you want to go buy something etc.\"\nKojiro’s gaze swept across the combat training room with professional assessment, noting the reinforced construction, enchantment arrays, and quality equipment.\n\"Impressive facilities, master. You’ve invested significantly in proper development infrastructure.\"\n\"The Blackwood family resources have their advantages,\" I acknowledged. \"But yes, having private facilities means we can train without schedule restrictions or observers documenting our techniques. We also don’t need to worry about people finding about your existence in the academy, now we can spar without worry.\"\nI handed him the Soul Stone. \"Consume this.\"\nKojiro accepted the stone with a slight bow.\nHe consumed the Soul Stone without hesitation, the crystallized soul power disappearing as his form briefly flared with enhanced energy. Unlike Changing Star’s dramatic glowing collapse, Kojiro simply stood still as the Transcendent essence integrated smoothly into his spectral existence.\n\"The power is substantial,\" he noted after a moment. \"I can feel measurable advancement occurring. This will enhance my combat effectiveness considerably.\"\n\"Good. Once the integration completes, I want you to familiarize yourself with these training facilities. Test the combat dummies, assess the equipment quality, and identify any additional resources that would improve our practice efficiency.\"\n\"Understood, master.\"\nI decided that from now on, Kojiro would remain summoned at the mansion unless I specifically needed him in portable card form for external hunts. Having a Transcendent-rank swordsman as permanent security would protect Changing Star during her vulnerable growth phases and provide valuable training partnership.\n\"One more thing,\" I added. \"There’s a young dragon upstairs currently in deep sleep while processing similar soul power. Her name is Changing Star. Don’t be alarmed when you encounter her, she is with us. She is usually nice, not sure how she will react to you, but if she is hostile do not hurt her and simply leave the mansion or inform me.\"\nKojiro’s eyebrows rose slightly at the mention of a dragon, but he simply nodded acceptance. \"A dragon companion.\"\n\"She hatched recently and is growing rapidly. Once she wakes, I’ll introduce you properly.\"\nWith Kojiro now enhanced and stationed at the mansion, my overall security and training capabilities had improved significantly. The second Soul Stone had found an excellent recipient who would make immediate practical use of the power boost.\nTwo consecutive Soul Stones, both distributed to allies who would maximize their benefit.\nIf the system wanted to continue this pattern, I certainly wouldn’t complain.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n***\nI made my way to the Blackwood family mansion in response to my mother’s summons. She’d sent a communication crystal message earlier saying she missed me and wanted to see me - a request I couldn’t reasonably refuse even with my busy schedule.\nThe truth was, I’d been so focused on training, hunting, and managing various projects that I’d neglected visiting home for some time now. For someone who had watched the original Adrian grow up under her care for years, my sudden absence after moving to academy housing and acquiring a private mansion probably felt jarring.\nI decided to visit for several interconnected reasons.\nFirst and most importantly, my mother was likely struggling with Father’s departure on his dangerous mission. They’d been married for years, building a partnership that went beyond political arrangement into genuine affection. With her husband gone to face Transcendent beasts and her son barely visiting, she was essentially alone in this massive estate with only servants for company.\nDespite not being my biological mother - this body’s original soul having been replaced by my transmigrated consciousness - I treated her with complete sincerity. She deserved that respect for the genuine love and effort she’d invested in raising Adrian Blackwood. Her maternal care had been authentic, and I wouldn’t dishonor that by treating her as merely a convenient relationship.\nSecond, I needed to bring Kael to the capital for his academy entrance examination tomorrow. He was currently staying at our duchy’s territory estate, and coordinating his travel meant visiting the family mansion regardless.\n-----\nI arrived at the familiar grounds and was immediately greeted by household staff who informed me that Duchess Elena was waiting in the main sitting room.\n\"Adrian!\" My mother’s face lit up the moment I entered, and she rose to embrace me warmly. \"It’s been too long. Look at you - have you been eating properly? You look thinner.\"\nI smiled at the predictable maternal concern. \"I’m eating fine, Mother. Academy training just keeps me active.\"\nShe studied my face with the scrutiny only mothers possessed, clearly trying to assess my wellbeing through sheer observation. \"Sit, sit. Tell me everything about your studies. How are your classes? Are you making friends? Is the dormitory comfortable?\"\nWe spent the next hour in comfortable conversation as I provided carefully edited updates about academy life. I mentioned my examination rankings, training progress, and interactions with classmates while omitting details about Thornback nest exterminations, dragon companions, and creating revolutionary smartphones.\n\"Your father was so proud of your academic performance,\" she said with genuine warmth, though I caught the slight sadness in her eyes at mentioning him.\n\"How are you managing with Father away?\" I asked gently.\nHer composure wavered slightly. \"I’m fine, of course. He’s on important duchy business, and I trust in his capabilities completely. But the house does feel... empty.\"\nThe admission was understated but honest. She missed him deeply but maintained the dignified bearing expected of a duchess.\n\"He’ll return safely,\" I said with more confidence than I actually felt. \"Father’s stronger than people realize.\"\n-----\nDinner was served in the formal dining room, an elaborate affair with multiple courses that household staff had clearly prepared with extra care to welcome the young master home.\nThis presented my ongoing challenge - maintaining the illusion of normal eating while being unable to consume regular food due to my vampire bloodline.\nFortunately, my increased strength and control made the deception easier now. I’d developed techniques for making it appear I was eating without actually consuming anything. Small bites moved to my mouth but were discretely redirected using minor blood manipulation. Chewing motions without swallowing. Strategic use of napkins and conversation timing to cover gaps in the performance.\nMy mother noticed nothing unusual, chatting pleasantly about estate management and duchy affairs while I performed my carefully choreographed fake eating routine.\n\"You seem more mature somehow,\" she observed during the main course. \"Academy life is clearly good for your development.\"\n\"The experience has been educational in many ways,\" I agreed truthfully, thinking about everything from combat training to engineering innovation.\nAfter dinner concluded successfully without revealing my dietary restrictions, I excused myself to my old room under the pretense of resting before tomorrow’s busy schedule.\nOnce alone, I retrieved the Book of Hints to check on Father’s mission status.\nI opened the book with focused intent, and new text materialized:\nDuke Marcus Blackwood engages forward beast patrols near Thornhaven. Combat intensity increasing beyond initial projections. Multiple Transcendent-rank creatures detected in coordinated formations. Royal-rank footwork proving invaluable for survival. Morale strained but holding. Physical condition: good despite accumulated fatigue.\nMy jaw tightened as I processed the information. Another one percent decrease.\nThe downward trend was becoming a genuine concern.\nThe current percentage meant his survival was essentially a coin flip at this point. One bad tactical decision, one unexpected powerful enemy, one moment of bad luck, and those odds could tip into the negative.\nI closed the book carefully, my expression neutral despite the worry churning inside.\nWhen I returned downstairs to spend the evening with Mother, I maintained perfect composure. She didn’t need to know that Father’s mission was becoming increasingly precarious. Her worry wouldn’t help him, and adding to her stress served no purpose.\n\"Everything alright, dear?\" she asked, noting my brief absence.\n\"Perfect,\" I lied smoothly. \"Just needed to handle some quick academy correspondence.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 169: Kael’s Examination\nI departed the Blackwood mansion later in the day with Kael seated beside me in the carriage. The young man looked noticeably different from when I’d first found him - cleaner, better fed, and carrying himself with growing confidence despite his humble origins.\nHis ice-affinity awakening had progressed well under the basic training regimen my father had arranged, and he’d reached Elite rank through dedicated practice and the resources provided. Still, sitting in a luxury carriage heading toward the kingdom’s most prestigious academy clearly made him aware of how far he’d come from his previous hell.\n\"How are you feeling about tomorrow’s examination?\" I asked as the carriage rolled smoothly through the duchy roads toward the capital.\nKael was quiet for a moment, staring out the window at the passing countryside. \"Good, but nervous.\"\nThe honesty was refreshing. Most people in his position would try to project false bravado or excessive confidence to impress their patron.\n\"Nervous about what specifically? The combat assessment? The theoretical knowledge portion?\"\n\"Both, I suppose.\" He turned to face me directly. \"I know I’ve gotten stronger thanks to your help, Adrian. The training, the resources, everything you’ve provided has transformed my capabilities beyond what I ever imagined possible. But the academy accepts the kingdom’s best awakeners. What if I’m not good enough? What if I fail and waste the opportunity you gave me?\"\nI could hear the genuine concern in his voice - not just fear of personal failure, but worry about disappointing me after everything I’d invested in him.\nI reached over and tapped him firmly on the shoulder. \"You’ve got this.\"\nKael looked at me with surprise at the simple, direct encouragement.\n\"I wouldn’t have sponsored you if I didn’t believe you could pass,\" I continued. \"Yes, the academy has high standards. Yes, the other students come from privileged backgrounds with years of proper training. But you have something many of them lack, training under a commander rank warrior, genuine hunger to improve, and the discipline.\"\n\"I just don’t want to let you down.\"\n\"Then don’t,\" I said simply. \"Show them exactly what you’re capable of. Fight like your life depends on it, because in a way, your future does. This examination is your gateway to resources and training that will determine your entire trajectory as an awakener.\"\nKael nodded slowly, some of the tension leaving his shoulders. \"You’re right. I’ve come too far to fail now.\"\n\"Exactly. And remember - I’ve seen you fight. I know your capabilities firsthand. Trust in the strength you’ve already developed.\"\nThe carriage continued toward the capital as evening approached, carrying a nervous but determined young man toward an opportunity that would change his life forever.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nWhen we arrived at the mansion, Kael’s eyes widened as he took in the elegant white structure. This was clearly far beyond anything he’d experienced before - the architecture alone spoke of wealth and status that his street-survival background couldn’t have prepared him for.\n\"This is... yours?\" he asked with obvious disbelief.\n\"One of my properties,\" I confirmed casually, leading him inside. \"Come on, let me show you around.\"\nI gave him a comprehensive tour of the facilities, starting with the residential areas before moving to what would really matter for his preparation.\nWhen I opened the door to the main combat training room, Kael stopped dead in his tracks.\n\"This is incredible,\" he breathed, staring at the reinforced flooring, enchantment arrays, and professional-grade equipment.\n\"It’s built to the same specifications as the academy,\" I explained. \"I wanted private training space that wouldn’t compromise on quality.\"\nI showed him the specialized practice chambers in the basement, the outdoor training grounds with their privacy wards, and the various combat dummies set to different rank levels for testing.\n\"You can use any of these facilities tomorrow morning before your examination,\" I offered. \"Get some practice in, warm up your techniques, make sure everything feels sharp.\"\n\"Thank you, Adrian.\" The gratitude in his voice was genuine. \"For everything - the sponsorship, the training, bringing me here. I won’t waste this opportunity.\"\n\"I know you won’t.\"\nI led him upstairs and showed him to a comfortable guest bedroom I’d designated for his use. The room was well-furnished with a proper bed, private bathing facilities, and everything he’d need for a restful night.\n\"This is your room while you’re here,\" I said. \"Make yourself comfortable.\"\nKael set down his belongings.\n\"Get some good sleep,\" I advised, turning toward the door. \"Tomorrow is an important day. You’ll want to be well-rested and mentally sharp for the examination.\"\n\"I will,\" Kael promised. \"Good night, Adrian. And thank you again.\"\n\"Good night, Kael. You’ve got this.\"\nI left him to settle in and made my way back through the mansion, checking on the other occupants of my increasingly crowded household. Kojiro was training in one of the training rooms, and Changing Star remained peacefully asleep, still processing the Soul Stone’s energy.\nTomorrow would determine if my investment in Kael paid off - if he could pass the academy’s rigorous examination and become another piece in the complex network I was building.\nThe next day arrived with early morning light filtering through the mansion windows. I woke before dawn, my internal schedule refusing to allow lazy starts regardless of how comfortable the bed was.\nMy first priority was checking on Changing Star, who remained in deep sleep on the highest floor where I’d established my personal quarters. I’d deliberately chosen the top floor to minimize the chance of Kael accidentally discovering her existence - at least until I decided how to handle that particular revelation.\nShe was still glowing softly, curled up on her magical cushion with her gemstone treasures arranged around her like a miniature dragon’s hoard. Her breathing was steady and deep, accompanied by that gentle purring sound that indicated contentment even in unconscious rest. A soft smile graced her small face, suggesting pleasant dreams rather than distress.\n\"Still devouring that energy...it must’ve been alot.\" I murmured, gently stroking her head. The worry I’d felt initially had largely faded - through our bond, I could sense she was perfectly fine, just requiring extended time to integrate such massive soul power.\nI left her to rest and made my way to the training facilities for my morning workout. Two hours of intensive practice covering blood manipulation, combat techniques, and secret art refinement left me properly warmed up and energized for the day ahead.\nAfter a quick shower to wash away the training sweat, I descended the stairs from my top-floor quarters. The vertical separation wasn’t a permanent solution - if Kael was going to live here during his academy enrolment, he’d eventually need to know about Changing Star’s existence. But that was a complication I decided to think about later.\nFor now, maintaining separation was simpler.\nI made my way to Kael’s guest room and knocked firmly on the door. \"Kael, time to wake up. You’ve got an examination today.\"\nKnock knock knock\nNo response.\nI knocked again, louder this time. Still nothing.\nFrowning slightly, I opened the door and peered inside. The bed was neatly made, and Kael’s belongings were organized on the dresser, but the room was empty.\n’Where is he? Is he training?’\nI made my way toward the training facilities, and sure enough, found Kael in one of the practice chambers working through an intensive exercise routine.\nHe was drenched in sweat, pushing through body conditioning exercises with focused determination - the same regimen I’d taught him, variations of what my father had drilled into me and from my previous experience on earth. Push-ups, core work, footwork drills, combat movements. His form was good, showing the discipline he’d developed through consistent practice.\n\"Training well?\" I asked with a smile, leaning casually against the doorframe. \"Make sure you don’t tire yourself out before the exam.\"\nKael immediately paused his routine and wiped the sweat from his face with his sleeve. \"Of course,\" he said, slightly breathless but maintaining composure. \"Just wanted to warm up and clear my nerves. I couldn’t sleep much anyway.\"\nI pulled a small leather pouch from my storage ring and tossed it to him.\nClink!\nThe sound of coins jingling was unmistakable as Kael caught it reflexively.\n\"What is this?\" he asked with confusion, opening the pouch to peer inside. His eyes widened at the contents - easily several dozen golden coins, far more than necessary for a simple meal.\n\"Some coins for you to buy breakfast,\" I said simply. \"I don’t have anyone cooking in this house, so get yourself some proper food before the examination. You’ll need the energy.\"\n\"This is... too much for food, isn’t it?\" Kael looked at me with uncertainty, clearly uncomfortable with what he perceived as excessive generosity.\nI ignored the question entirely. \"See you at the academy.\"\nI turned and departed before he could protest further or try to return the excess money. Whether he spent it all on an elaborate breakfast or saved most of it for future needs was his decision - the point was ensuring he had resources available without needing to stress about finances on an already nerve-wracking day.\nAs I left the mansion and retrieved my skateboard for the journey to campus, I reflected on the strange household I was accumulating. A sleeping dragon on the top floor, a swordsman patrolling the training facilities, and now a sponsored student preparing for his entrance examination.\nThe mansion was becoming far more than just a private residence - it was transforming into the operational base for everything I was building in this world.\nArriving at the academy entrance, I was once again given the looks that I always perceived from the fellow students. This time, the looks had increased, as for the reason...I knew it well.",

      "content": "Chapter 170: The Official Release of Skateboards\nAs I skateboarded through the city streets toward the academy, I noticed something that brought a satisfied smile to my face.\nYesterday, my business team had officially launched the skateboard for public sales after a period of controlled distribution and testing.\nThe product had moved from exclusive academy curiosity to commercially available transportation device.\nThe results were immediately visible.\nWhen I approached the academy grounds, the concentration of skateboards increased dramatically. Students glided along pathways and through campus corridors with the distinctive whoosh of mana-propulsion systems, their movements fluid and confident from practice.\nConversations floated past as I navigated through the crowds.\n\"This skateboard invention is absolutely incredible. I used to waste so long walking between my dormitory and the training facilities - now it takes a few minutes!\"\n\"The mana efficiency is brilliant too. Barely feel it’s affect on my reserves even with constant use.\"\n\"I heard the inventor is actually a first-year student. Can you imagine creating something this revolutionary at our age?\"\n\"My father wants to purchase an entire fleet for our family’s estate guards. The tactical mobility applications are obvious.\"\nThe discussions continued everywhere - students comparing their experiences, discussing features, and expressing genuine appreciation for how the device had improved their daily convenience.\nSeveral students even approached me directly as I dismounted near the main building.\n\"Hey, you’re Adrian Blackwood, right?\" a second-year student asked with friendly enthusiasm. \"I just wanted to say thank you for inventing this. The skateboard has literally changed how I manage my busy schedule.\"\n\"Glad it’s useful,\" I replied with a smile.\nAnother group of first-years clustered nearby, one brave enough to speak up. \"The craftsmanship is really impressive! Everything feels solid and well-designed. Worth every coin.\"\n\"We appreciate the feedback,\" I said, maintaining the approachable demeanor. \"Let us know if you encounter any issues with functionality.\"\nMore students offered similar thanks and compliments as I made my way through campus. Some were clearly hoping to make a positive impression with the inventor, while others seemed genuinely grateful for the practical benefits.\nI made sure to respond warmly to each interaction - smiling, thanking them for their support, and occasionally asking about their experience with the product.\nThese weren’t just random students. These were current customers and future customers. Every positive interaction strengthened the brand reputation, increased word-of-mouth promotion, and established goodwill that would translate to continued sales and market expansion.\nBrand perception mattered enormously in business. Being seen as approachable, responsive to feedback, and genuinely invested in customer satisfaction would pay dividends far beyond any individual skateboard sale.\nAs I entered the main building and headed toward Instructor Sylvia’s classroom, I calculated mentally. If this morning’s concentration was representative, at least sixty percent of academy students had already purchased skateboards, with adoption rates climbing daily.\nThe revenue must be substantial, and this was just the beginning. Once the product expanded beyond the academy into broader commercial markets - nobility estates, merchant organizations, military applications - the profits would be astronomical.\nBut more than the money, I’d successfully introduced Earth innovation into this world and watched it transform daily life.\nThe skateboard was just the first product. The smartphone would be next.\nAnd with each successful introduction, my influence and resources would grow exponentially.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nInside Instructor Sylvia’s classroom, I found my usual seat and settled in alongside the other students who were gradually filtering in for the morning session.\nSylvia entered precisely on time as always, her professional demeanor intact as she surveyed the classroom. Her eyes immediately landed on the collection of skateboards propped near students’ desks - easily two dozen of them scattered throughout the room, a dramatic increase from the handful that had existed just weeks ago.\nHer gaze shifted to me with an expression that mixed resignation, mild exasperation, and perhaps a hint of grudging respect. She sighed audibly.\nShe knew very well that I was the reason behind this new phenomenon sweeping through the academy. The skateboard invasion was entirely my doing, and there was no point pretending otherwise.\nI simply smiled at her reaction and remained quiet, offering no commentary or explanation. What could I say? The product spoke for itself through its obvious popularity.\nSylvia shook her head slightly - the gesture of an instructor dealing with a student who kept finding ways to disrupt normal academy operations, even if the disruptions were technically beneficial.\nAfter a moment, she turned her attention to the full class and adopted her usual authoritative tone.\n\"It’s time to proceed to the forest as I mentioned in our previous session,\" she announced clearly. \"This will be your first guided hunting expedition outside academy groups for soul power accumulation. Let’s head out.\"\nWithout waiting for questions or discussions, she turned and began walking toward the classroom exit with purposeful strides.\nThe students immediately began gathering their equipment - weapons, protective gear, supply packs, and various other combat necessities they’d been instructed to prepare. The atmosphere carried mixed energy - excitement from students eager for real combat experience, nervousness from those less confident in their abilities, and focused determination from the competitive ones like Emmet, Elen and Marcus.\nEveryone filed out of the classroom following Sylvia’s lead, forming a loose procession as we made our way through the academy corridors toward the main gates.\nI joined the flow of students, already anticipating what this forest expedition would reveal about everyone’s true combat capabilities when facing actual beasts rather than training dummies.\n\"Hey, how are you doing?\" Elen’s friendly voice came from beside me as she matched my pace through the academy corridors.\nI nodded with a soft smile. \"Doing well. Ready for the forest expedition. How about you?\"\n\"Nervous about it, honestly,\" she admitted, adjusting the strap on her supply pack. \"I’ve done some controlled hunting with my family before, but never as part of academy curriculum. Do you think it’ll be group work or solo assignments?\"\nI considered the question for a moment, analyzing what I knew about academy safety protocols and Sylvia’s teaching methodology.\n\"Most likely group projects,\" I said. \"They won’t let us go out alone on our first guided hunt, even though most of the Elite students here have some experience from their own families. It’s still safer to operate as teams, especially with varied skill levels in the class.\"\nElen nodded thoughtfully. \"That makes sense. I was hoping for group work anyway - my combat abilities are better suited for support roles rather than solo encounters.\"\n\"Your water manipulation and knowledge would be valuable assets to any team,\" I assured her.\nWe walked in comfortable silence for a moment before she spoke again, her tone carrying genuine admiration.\n\"Your skateboards are really cool, by the way. I see them everywhere now. I’ll buy one someday when I have enough saved up.\" She smiled. \"Your work at blacksmithing has really paid off.\"\n\"Thank you,\" I acknowledged before reaching into my storage ring. \"Actually...\"\nI withdrew one of the skateboards and held it out to her. Around us, most students either carried their skateboards or were already using them to glide along behind Instructor Sylvia, who maintained her walking pace at the front.\n\"Here. For you.\"\nElen’s eyes widened in shock as she stared at the offered skateboard. \"Adrian, I... I can’t accept this. These cost hundreds of golden coins! That’s way too expensive a gift!\"\n\"It’s a gift,\" I said simply. \"And gifts shouldn’t be rejected.\"\n\"But—\"\n\"Elen.\" I kept my tone gentle but firm. \"You’ve helped me considerably since we met. You’ve been a good friend without ulterior motives, and you’ve never treated me differently despite my family name or previous reputation. This is just a skateboard. Accept it.\"\nThe real reason I was comfortable giving her such an expensive item was because I knew about her financial situation from the time I saw her speaking to her father outside the academy gates.\nWhile she’d never mentioned it directly, I could see the careful way she managed resources. A few hundred golden coins would be difficult for her to spare for something she’d consider a luxury rather than necessity.\n\"Adrian, this is... I’ve never received such an expensive gift before,\" she said quietly, still hesitant to take it.\n\"Then it’s about time someone gave you one. Take it. You deserve nice things too.\"\nAfter several more moments of internal conflict visible on her face, she reluctantly but excitedly reached out and accepted the skateboard with both hands.\n\"Thank you,\" she said sincerely, holding it a bit awkwardly as if unsure what to do with such a valuable item. \"Really, thank you so much.\"\n\"Don’t just hold it,\" I encouraged with amusement. \"Use it. That’s what it’s for.\"\n\"Right now?\" She looked uncertain, glancing at the skateboard then at the moving crowd of students around us.\n\"Why not? Everyone else is.\"\nElen took a breath, placed the skateboard on the ground, and carefully stepped onto it. As an Elite-rank awakener, she had more than enough dexterity and balance to stand on the platform - it just required a moment of adjustment to get used to the sensation.\nShe channeled a small amount of mana into the propulsion system, and the skateboard smoothly accelerated forward.\n\"Oh!\" Her expression transformed from uncertainty to delight. \"This is really cool!\"\nShe began gliding alongside me with increasing confidence, her movements becoming more natural as she adapted to the device. The excitement on her face was genuine and almost childlike - pure joy at experiencing something new and enjoyable.\n\"It responds so smoothly to mana input,\" she said with enthusiasm. \"And the balance enchantments make it much easier than I expected. This is amazing, Adrian!\"\nI smiled at her reaction, satisfied that the gift had been well-received. \"Glad you like it. Now you won’t have to walk everywhere like before.\"\n\"This is going to save so much time,\" she said, still grinning. \"Thank you again. Really.\"\nWe continued toward the academy gates together, Elen now confidently skateboarding alongside me as we followed the rest of the class toward whatever awaited us in the forest.",

      "content": "Chapter 171: Forest Groups\nWe arrived at the designated location that Instructor Sylvia had led us to - a cleared area at the forest’s edge that served as a staging point between academy grounds and the actual hunting territories.\nMultiple instructor assistants were already positioned throughout the perimeter, their Transcendent-rank auras providing a reassuring presence. These were experienced awakeners assigned to protect students if anything went catastrophically wrong - strong enough to handle most threats that could appear in this relatively controlled region.\nSylvia waited until all students had assembled before speaking with her characteristic authority.\n\"Everyone, form groups of three. Choose your teammates wisely based on complementary capabilities.\"\nImmediately, students began clustering together. The more social ones had obvious friend groups, while competitive students like Marcus sought partners with strong combat reputations.\nElen looked at me with shy uncertainty before gently nudging my arm. \"So, um...\"\nI chuckled at her indirect approach. \"Want to join me?\"\nHer head bobbed up and down enthusiastically like a chicken pecking grain, the nervous energy transforming into obvious relief.\n\"Sounds good,\" I confirmed, already mentally reviewing potential third members.\nI glanced around, considering candidates. Emmet stood alone near the edge of the gathering, clearly uninterested in team formation. That wasn’t surprising - Emmet preferred operating independently and disliked being directed by others. Once he joined someone’s team, he’d lose the freedom to act as he pleased. Especially when the goal of the class was to kill as many beasts as possible.\nMarcus had already formed a group with two other combat-focused students from noble families.\n\"Hey... can I join you guys?\"\nA hesitant voice interrupted my assessment. I turned to see who had spoken.\nThe speaker was a male student with average looks and an extremely low profile - someone I’d seen in class regularly but whose name I couldn’t recall. He maintained such a low-key presence that he practically blended into the background during most activities.\nIt was quite surprising that he would approach our team proactively. I’d expected someone with his reserved demeanour wouldn’t have the courage to initiate contact, especially with students who had gained some notoriety.\nI nodded and glanced at Elen, who simply shrugged with acceptance.\n\"What’s your combat role?\" I asked, wanting to understand his capabilities before finalizing the arrangement.\n\"Support role,\" he answered quickly, as if he’d prepared the response. \"I’m a healer with ability amplification skills. I can provide small buffs to strength, speed, reaction time, and endurance. Nothing dramatic, but it helps in sustained combat.\"\nThat was actually valuable. Support specialists were rare compared to direct combat awakeners, and having healing capabilities could prevent minor injuries from becoming serious complications during extended hunts.\n\"Works for me,\" I decided. A balanced team with combat, magical support, and healing would function well together.\n\"What’s your name?\" Elen asked, saving me from the awkward admission that I’d been classmates with this person for nearly a month without learning his identity.\n\"My name is Loko. Nice to meet you properly, Elen, Adrian.\"\nElen looked at him with genuine disbelief, pointing at herself. \"You know my name?\"\nLoko smiled wryly. \"How could someone not know the number one student in theory? Or the number one in combat in the entire first-year class?\" He gestured between us. \"You two are probably the most talked-about students in our year.\"\nElen’s face flushed with embarrassment at the recognition. \"I’m not that special,\" she said humbly. \"I just study hard and got lucky on the examination.\"\n\"Luck doesn’t get you perfect scores,\" Loko countered respectfully.\nThis time, Elen didn’t try to deny it, and simply remained silent.\nWith our team of three assembled - myself as primary combat, Elen as magical support with her water manipulation, and Loko providing healing and buffs - we turned our attention back to Instructor Sylvia as she prepared to deliver the mission parameters.\nOnce all teams had finalized their formations, Sylvia raised her voice to address the entire class.\n\"Listen carefully. Your mission parameters are straightforward: obtain ten mid-Elite rank beast kills per team. Do not venture too deep into the forest - stay within the designated zones marked by the red boundary flags. The instructor assistants will maintain perimeter security, but if you deliberately ignore safety protocols and go beyond approved areas, you’re on your own.\"\nSeveral students exchanged nervous glances at that warning.\n\"For proof of kills, you may bring back heads or specific body parts from your prey,\" Sylvia continued. \"However, once you choose a body part - such as claws or tails - you must bring back that same body part from every subsequent kill. This prevents students from harvesting multiple parts from single creatures and claiming inflated numbers.\"\nBeside me I heard a few students murmur.\n\"Damn it...I wanted to do that, I thought we could ace the exam and perhaps get some sort of record.\" One students said to his teammate.\nThe teammate chuckled before whispering. \"You are in the best academy in our kingdom, you would be foolish to believe that others before you didn’t try it, or that the academy didn’t take account for such things.\"\nThat made sense. Without that rule, someone could kill one or two beasts and return with ten different body parts, falsely claiming they’d completed the mission.\n\"Mid-Elite rank means creatures that pose genuine challenge without being overwhelming threats,\" Sylvia added. \"Low-Elite specimens are too weak for meaningful evaluation since you are a group. High-Elite or above are prohibited targets unless you’re in genuine danger and fighting for survival. The goal is hunting practice, not reckless glory-seeking.\"\nShe swept her gaze across the assembled students with stern emphasis.\n\"Work as teams. Communicate clearly. Don’t take unnecessary risks. This is a controlled training exercise, not a competition to see who can be most reckless. You will not gain any rewards for finishing first, nor any punishments for finishing last. Also, the assistants are here for emergencies, not to rescue students who ignore common sense.\"\nStudents nodded understanding, the nervous energy shifting toward focused determination.\n\"You have until sunset to complete your missions. Use your time efficiently. Any questions?\"\nThe clearing remained silent - everyone understood the parameters.\n\"Then begin. Dismissed.\"\nImmediately, teams began moving into the forest proper, spreading out to claim different territories and avoid competing for the same prey.\nOur team of three - myself, Elen, and Loko - moved together into the treeline. I naturally took point position given my combat focus, with Elen beside me and Loko maintaining position slightly behind where he could observe and provide support without being immediately vulnerable.\n\"Stay alert,\" I said quietly as we entered deeper forest. \"Mid-Elite beasts in this region are usually forest wolves, steel-hide boars, or serpents. All dangerous if we’re careless.\"\nOf course, these beasts weren’t dangerous for me, but for those with me, like Elen and Loko.\n\"I can detect water sources, which often attract prey,\" Elen offered. \"My sensing range is pretty good.\"\n\"And I’ll maintain light buff enchantments on both of you,\" Loko added. \"Nothing dramatic, but about a few percent improvement to reaction speed and physical output.\"\nI felt the subtle enhancement take effect - a gentle increase in responsiveness that would provide meaningful advantage in combat without being overwhelming.\n\"Good team composition,\" I noted with satisfaction. \"Let’s find our first target.\"\nWe moved deeper into the hunting grounds, our first academy group mission officially underway.\nAs we moved deeper into the forest, both Elen and Loko naturally deferred to my leadership without any discussion. The dynamic established itself organically - they’d both witnessed my performance during the previous class examination where our team had dominated every other class with an overwhelming difference.\n\"You’re leading, right?\" Loko asked, confirming what was already obvious.\n\"Unless you have objections,\" I replied.\n\"None at all,\" Elen said immediately. \"You know what you’re doing.\"\nWith that settled, we continued into the hunting grounds with clear role assignments.\nHonestly, I wasn’t particularly invested in try-harding this examination. Mid-Elite rank beasts wouldn’t provide meaningful soul power for my advancement - I was already high-Elite rank, and reaching peak would require at least peak-Elite or Transcendent-rank kills. These mission targets were essentially worthless for my personal cultivation.\nBut that didn’t mean the expedition was pointless.\nInstead, I decided to focus on strengthening my two teammates. Elen had become a genuine friend over the past weeks, someone I valued beyond simple utility. And Loko, while less familiar, was still a classmate who’d shown courage by approaching us. Helping them gain combat experience and soul power seemed like better use of time than rushing through for personal benefit I didn’t need.\n\"Elen, use your water detection abilities periodically,\" I instructed. \"Check every two hundred meters or so. That should give us good range coverage without wasting excessive mana.\"\n\"Got it,\" she confirmed, already focusing her senses.\nWe moved through the forest, maintaining steady pace while Elen performed regular scans. The detection technique allowed her to sense moisture sources - streams, ponds, underground springs - which typically attracted prey animals and the beasts that hunted them.\nAround six hundred meters into our expedition, Elen suddenly perked up with excitement.\n\"There’s a water source ahead!\" she announced, pointing slightly northeast. \"Pretty substantial flow, probably a creek or small stream. About a hundred and fifty meters in that direction.\"\n\"Perfect,\" I said. \"That’s exactly where we want to go. Predators will be hunting near water sources, and mid-Elite beasts are smart enough to establish territories around reliable resources.\"\nWe adjusted our heading and approached it carefully, our weapons ready and senses alert for potential encounters.\nThe hunt was beginning properly, and my teammates would get the experience they needed to grow stronger.",

      "content": "Chapter 172: Class Mission Complete [1]\nArriving at the water source that Elen had led us to, we were greeted by an unexpected sight - a group of four mid-Elite rank monsters gathered near the creek’s edge, drinking and resting in the dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy.\nWe maintained a safe distance behind thick vegetation, observing without alerting them to our presence.\nElen looked at me with concern. \"What should we do? They outnumber us. There are four of them.\"\nI smiled confidently. \"Don’t worry. This is actually a good opportunity to finish forty percent of the examination at once. Four kills means we’re almost halfway done already.\"\nBefore committing to engagement, I wanted more information about what we were facing. The creatures looked like some kind of horned cattle, but I couldn’t identify the specific species from this distance.\nElen, however, immediately recognized them. Her academic knowledge proved valuable as she began explaining in a hushed voice.\n\"I recognize these - they’re Bicorns. Dangerous cattle-like magical creatures that possess two prominent horns.\" She pointed carefully at the distinctive paired horns jutting from each creature’s skull. \"Those horns shed annually and are highly valuable as potion ingredients, particularly for vitality increase concoctions.\"\n\"So they’re hunted primarily for materials?\" I asked.\n\"Exactly. Weaker awakeners typically wait until the horns shed naturally and gather them when the Bicorns aren’t looking, avoiding direct combat. Stronger awakeners subdue them and establish farming operations, harvesting the horns annually without killing the creatures.\"\nThat explained why these beasts were valuable beyond just soul power - they represented renewable resource generation if managed properly. Of course, for someone like me, their monetary value was low considering my background and sources of income, but to others they were indeed valuable.\n\"What about combat capabilities and weaknesses?\" I pressed, wanting more information. I was helping Elen establish a reasoning before attacking, to help her in combat.\nI could kill the beasts with a single hit, but the two with me couldn’t so they needed to establish weak points and a plan before engaging.\nElen’s expression grew more serious. \"Their primary weakness is their belly - it’s not well-protected compared to the rest of their thick hide. The horns themselves are extremely powerful weapons capable of goring through metal armor. Some evolved Bicorns can even channel elemental magic through their horns if they have appropriate affinities.\"\nLoko leaned in to listen, clearly appreciating the detailed briefing.\n\"Their bloodline rank is Uncommon,\" Elen continued, \"and their maximum potential is usually peak-Elite if they’re exceptionally lucky. Most specimens like these are low to mid-Elite rank, which matches what we’re seeing.\"\nI assessed the four Bicorns more carefully with this information. They were roughly the size of large bulls, with muscular builds and those distinctive paired horns that could easily impale an unwary opponent. Their thick hides would resist casual strikes, but targeting their vulnerable underbellies provided clear tactical approach.\n\"Good intel,\" I acknowledged.\n\"Here’s the plan,\" I said, studying the four Bicorns while formulating our approach. \"We’ll use coordinated tactics that play to each of our strengths rather than trying to overwhelm them with brute force.\"\nI pointed at the creatures systematically. \"Elen, your water manipulation gives us excellent crowd control capabilities. Once we engage, I want you to use the creek water to create barriers and obstacles that separate the herd. Bicorns are herd animals - they’ll be more dangerous if they can coordinate charges together. If you can isolate them into pairs or individuals, we dramatically reduce the threat.\"\nElen nodded, already focusing on the abundant water source nearby.\n\"Loko, maintain your buff enchantments on both of us throughout the engagement. More importantly, I need you watching for injuries. If either of us takes a hit from those horns, immediate healing response. Don’t wait for us to call for help - use your judgment.\"\n\"Understood,\" Loko confirmed.\n\"I’ll serve as frontline attacker and support,\" I continued. \"My role is subduing the beasts and ensuring neither of you gets seriously injured, but I won’t be delivering killing blows. This is about you two gaining combat experience and soul power, not me rushing through for quick completion.\"\nBoth teammates looked surprised at that declaration.\n\"You’re... not going to kill them yourself?\" Elen asked with confusion.\n\"Mid-Elite beasts won’t give me meaningful advancement,\" I explained honestly. \"I’m already high-Elite rank. But you two can benefit significantly from these kills. So I’ll create openings, protect you from counterattacks, and handle battlefield control - but the actual elimination strikes are yours to make.\"\nUnderstanding dawned on both their faces, followed by determination.\n\"Here’s the detailed execution,\" I continued. \"Elen, once I engage the first Bicorn and draw its attention, immediately raise water barriers to cut off the other three from supporting it. Doesn’t need to be walls - even ankle-deep flowing water will disrupt their charging momentum and make them hesitate.\"\n\"I can do that,\" she confirmed.\n\"Loko, position yourself where you have clear sightlines to both of us but aren’t directly in the beasts’ path. Your buffs and healing are more valuable than trying to contribute damage.\"\n\"Got it.\"\n\"Once Elen has isolated the first target, I’ll force it to expose its vulnerable belly. Elen, that’s when you strike with concentrated water pressure - aim for penetration rather than blunt impact. Think water jet cutting through the unprotected hide.\"\nHer eyes widened slightly at the tactical specificity, but she nodded with growing confidence.\n\"After the first kill, we repeat the pattern with the remaining three. Each time, I create the opening, Elen delivers the finishing strike, and Loko maintains our combat effectiveness. We work as a coordinated team rather than three individuals fighting separately.\"\nI looked between them seriously. \"The reasoning behind this approach is simple: good teamwork multiplies effectiveness far beyond individual capabilities. One strong fighter supported by two specialists can accomplish more than three decent fighters acting independently. You’re learning to leverage synergy - using each member’s strengths to cover others’ weaknesses.\"\n\"That makes sense,\" Loko said thoughtfully. \"Most teams just... attack together without real coordination.\"\n\"Which is why most teams are inefficient,\" I confirmed. \"Questions about the plan?\"\nBoth shook their heads, their expressions showing focus and readiness.\n\"Then let’s begin. Elen, be ready with that water manipulation the moment I engage. Loko, buffs active. On my signal.\"\nI drew my sword and prepared to initiate contact with the nearest Bicorn, my teammates positioned strategically behind me.\nThis would be good experience for both of them - learning how coordinated tactics and clear role assignment created overwhelming advantages even against numerically superior opponents.\n\"Now,\" I commanded, surging forward from our concealed position.\nMy movement drew immediate attention from the nearest Bicorn. Its head snapped up from drinking, water dripping from its muzzle as it registered the threat. The creature bellowed - a deep, resonant sound that alerted the entire herd.\nSTOMP! CHARGE!\nThe first Bicorn lowered its twin horns and charged directly at me with surprising speed for something its size. The ground trembled under its hooves as it built momentum.\nI sidestepped at the last moment using my enhanced footwork, my blade flashing out to strike its flank - not to kill, but to redirect its momentum and create an opening.\nSPLASH! RISE!\nBehind me, Elen executed perfectly. Water from the creek surged upward in response to her manipulation, forming flowing barriers that cut between the charging Bicorn and its three companions. The barriers weren’t solid walls, but the rushing water and sudden obstacles disrupted the other beasts’ attempts to support their herdmate.\n\"Good control!\" I called out while keeping the first Bicorn’s attention focused on me.\nThe isolated creature wheeled around for another charge, frustrated and aggressive. I could see Loko’s buffs working - my reaction speed felt sharper, my movements more fluid as the enhancement magic took effect.\nCHARGE! DEFLECT!\nI met the second charge head-on this time, using my sword to deflect the dangerous horns away from my body while simultaneously forcing the Bicorn to rear up slightly, exposing its vulnerable underbelly.\n\"Elen, now! Target the belly!\"\nWHOOSH! PIERCE!\nElen’s water manipulation concentrated into a high-pressure jet that lanced forward like a spear. The technique struck the exposed underbelly with devastating precision, the pressurized water cutting through the unprotected hide and penetrating deep into vital organs.\nThe Bicorn collapsed with a final bellow, its life already fading.\n\"One down! Maintain the barriers!\" I directed.\nBut as I moved toward the second target, I noticed Loko’s positioning had drifted too far forward in his excitement. He was nearly in the path of one of the separated Bicorns, which had noticed the vulnerable support member.\n\"Loko, fall back ten meters! You’re too exposed!\" I called sharply.\n\"Sorry!\" He immediately retreated to safer distance, realizing his mistake.\nThe second Bicorn had broken through part of Elen’s water barrier and was charging toward her position now, recognizing her as the primary threat.\nINTERCEPT!\nI moved with blood-enhanced speed, positioning myself between Elen and the charging beast. My blade struck its horn at an angle, redirecting the momentum enough that it stumbled past us rather than connecting with full force.\n\"Elen, barrier to your left! Third one’s flanking!\"\nShe responded instantly, raising a wall of churning water that stopped the third Bicorn’s attempted surprise attack from the side. Her battlefield awareness was improving rapidly.\nThe second Bicorn recovered and charged again. This time I didn’t just deflect - I used my superior strength to actually grapple one of its horns mid-charge, using the beast’s own momentum to flip it partially onto its side.\n\"Exposed! Strike now!\"\nSLASH! PIERCE!\nElen’s water jet combined with a direct sword strike from her backup weapon, targeting the vulnerable belly with lethal precision. The second Bicorn went down, and her soul power increase again through the successful kill.",

      "content": "Chapter 173: Class Mission Complete [2]\n\"Loko, buff refresh on Elen! She’s using a lot of mana!\" I directed, noticing her breathing becoming heavier.\n\"Already on it!\" Loko’s hands glowed as he channeled enhanced stamina recovery into Elen, helping her maintain output.\nThe third and fourth Bicorns had now fully committed to the fight, both charging from different angles in a coordinated pincer attack.\n\"Elen, can you handle the left one’s charge?\"\n\"Yes!\" Her confidence had grown significantly from the previous two successes.\nBARRIER! REDIRECT!\nShe raised a angled water wall that forced the left Bicorn’s charge to veer off course, buying crucial seconds.\nI engaged the right one directly, my blade work precise and controlled. Each strike forced the creature into defensive positioning, preventing it from building momentum for another dangerous charge.\n\"Loko, watch Elen’s right side - fourth one’s circling!\"\n\"I see it!\" Loko had learned from his earlier mistake and maintained proper awareness of all battlefield elements.\nThe coordination was flowing smoothly now. Elen manipulated water to control spacing and momentum, I created tactical openings through direct engagement, and Loko maintained our combat effectiveness through buffs and battlefield observation.\nThe third Bicorn made a desperate lunge toward Elen, but I was already there, catching its horns with blood-enhanced grip and forcing its head down to expose the belly.\n\"Finish it!\"\nSTRIKE! PENETRATE!\nElen’s water jet pierced through with precision now, having executed the technique successfully twice before. The third Bicorn collapsed, its soul power flowing into her.\nOnly one remained.\nThe final Bicorn, seeing its entire herd eliminated, bellowed with rage and fear mixed together. It charged with reckless abandon, all caution abandoned.\n\"Together!\" I commanded. \"Elen, barrier to slow it! I’ll force the opening! You deliver the kill!\"\nCOORDINATED EXECUTION!\nWater barrier slowed its charge, my sword strikes forced it off-balance, and Elen’s finishing technique penetrated the exposed vulnerability with lethal efficiency.\nThe fourth Bicorn fell, and silence returned to the creek side.\n\"Combat complete,\" I announced, sheathing my blade. \"Excellent work, both of you.\"\nElen stood there breathing heavily, staring at the four fallen beasts with obvious shock on her face.\n\"That was... so much easier than I expected,\" she said with disbelief. \"Four mid-Elite beasts and we handled them without anyone getting injured.\"\n\"That’s the power of coordination and clear tactics,\" I explained. \"Individual strength matters, but team synergy multiplies effectiveness exponentially.\"\nShe nodded slowly, then her eyes widened as full realization hit. \"I can feel myself getting stronger! The soul power from four mid-Elite kills - that’s significant advancement!\"\n\"You did well,\" I confirmed. \"Both of you executed the plan properly.\"\nLoko approached with obvious relief and satisfaction. \"Sorry again for that positioning error early on.\"\n\"You recognized it and corrected immediately,\" I said. \"That’s what matters. Leaders provide direction, but good team members adapt and learn.\"\nWe spent a few minutes harvesting the Bicorn horns - valuable materials that would serve as proof of our kills and could be sold or used for potion crafting. Each horn was substantial, and collecting all eight would represent significant material wealth alongside the soul power gains.\n\"Four down, six more to go,\" I noted. \"And we’ve only been hunting for about thirty minutes. At this rate, we’ll finish well before sunset.\"\nWe continued trailing along the creek, using the water source as our navigation landmark. Elen periodically scanned ahead with her detection abilities while Loko maintained light buffs to keep us combat-ready.\nAfter about twenty minutes of searching, Elen suddenly froze.\n\"Wait,\" she whispered urgently, her hand raised in a halt signal. \"There’s something ahead. Movement near the treeline, but... it’s strange. The presence keeps disappearing and reappearing.\"\nI immediately focused my eys in the direction she indicated. At first, I saw nothing but trees and shadows. Then a flicker of movement - something tall and pale that vanished the instant I tried to focus on it directly.\n\"What is that?\" Loko asked nervously, clearly sensing the unnatural quality of whatever was ahead.\nElen’s face had gone pale, her academic knowledge apparently providing unwelcome recognition. \"I... I think that might be a Hidebehind.\"\n\"A what?\" I kept my voice low, not taking my eyes off the area where I’d seen the movement.\n\"The Hidebehind,\" Elen explained quietly, her voice carrying genuine concern. \"It’s a nocturnal, forest-dwelling, specter-like beast that specifically preys on humanoid creatures. It can shift its shape and possesses natural invisibility, allowing it to hide behind almost any object regardless of size.\"\nThat explained the flickering presence - the creature was using its abilities to remain partially concealed even in broad daylight.\n\"Combat capabilities?\" I pressed, wanting tactical information.\n\"Those who’ve survived encounters describe it as tall with silver hair, similar to a skinny bear but able to contort its body into different shapes to better lurk behind objects. It’s patient, intelligent, and prefers ambush tactics.\" Elen’s hands were trembling slightly. \"Its prey of choice is specifically humans and other humanoid species.\"\n\"Weakness?\"\n\"That’s the problem - there isn’t much documented information because most encounters end fatally for the prey. The ones that were previously spotted were all at commander rank, but this one seems weaker. It must be really young and ventured outside then got lost.\"\nI continued observing the treeline, catching another glimpse of silver-gray fur before it vanished behind a tree that was far too narrow to conceal something that large. The shape-contorting ability was clearly active.\nThen something else occurred to me - something that made this situation far more serious than a simple hunt.\n\"Elen,\" I said carefully, \"you mentioned it’s a ’specter-like beast.’ This isn’t a natural beast, is it?\nHer face somehow went even paler. \"No. That’s what makes this so concerning. Hidebehinds don’t exist naturally in the world. They’re only created through deliberate breeding between a Demiguise and a ghoul - two completely different species that would never mate naturally.\"\nThe implications hit immediately.\n\"Someone is breeding these things,\" I stated flatly.\n\"And breeding them near the city,\" Loko added with growing alarm. \"This forest is within vicinity of our city. If Hidebehinds are appearing here...\"\nWe all understood what that meant. This wasn’t just a dangerous beast we’d stumbled upon - this was evidence of illegal magical creature breeding operations close to the capital, deliberately creating predators that specifically targeted humans.\n\"We need to inform the instructors immediately once we’re done here,\" I decided.\nElen nodded \"But first, we need to deal with this one. It’s already detected us, and Hidebehinds are persistent hunters. If we try to leave, it’ll follow and ambush us when we’re less prepared.\"\n\"Can we even fight something with invisibility?\" Loko asked nervously.\nI considered our options. The creature had significant advantages - invisibility, shape-shifting, ambush instincts, and specific adaptation for hunting humanoids. But we had advantages too.\n\"Elen, can you sense its position through water detection? Everything living has moisture in its body.\"\nOf course, I had similar ability using my blood control, but once again. I was trying to ensure that Elen was able to critically think and act.\nShe concentrated, her eyes closing briefly. \"Yes! It’s harder than detecting water sources, but I can track it. About forty meters ahead, moving slowly to our right - probably trying to circle around for a better ambush angle.\"\n\"Perfect. That’s our counter to its invisibility.\" I turned to Loko. \"Maximum buffs on both of us. This fight is going to be faster and more dangerous than the Bicorns.\"\n\"Already channeling,\" he confirmed, his hands glowing brighter as he increased the enhancement intensity.\n\"Here’s the plan,\" I said quickly. \"Elen tracks its position and calls out movements. I engage directly to prevent it from targeting either of you. Loko maintains buffs and healing readiness. Elen, once I force it to commit to attacking me, you use water manipulation to physically reveal it - drench it completely so it can’t maintain invisibility even if it tries.\"\n\"Like throwing water on an invisible person to show their outline?\" Elen asked.\n\"Exactly. Once visible, we use the same tactics as before - I create openings, you deliver finishing strikes to vulnerable points.\"\nI drew my sword and began advancing carefully toward where Elen sensed the creature.\n\"It’s moving again,\" Elen warned. \"Thirty meters, shifting left now. It knows we’re tracking it somehow - it’s getting more aggressive.\"\n\"Good. Aggressive means it’ll attack rather than playing patience games.\" I kept my stance ready. \"Call out its position continuously.\"\n\"Twenty-five meters... twenty meters... it’s stopped moving. I think it’s preparing to charge.\"\nThe forest had gone eerily quiet, that unnatural silence that preceded predator attacks.\n\"Fifteen meters and closing fast! It’s coming straight at you, Adrian!\"\nI saw it then - a barely visible distortion in the air, like heat shimmer but moving with predatory intent. Silver-gray fur flickered in and out of visibility as the Hidebehind abandoned stealth for direct assault.\nIts prey of choice was humans.\nUnfortunately for it, I was a vampire.\n\"Now, Elen! Drench it!\"​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nJust as the Hidebehind charged with terrifying speed, a thought struck me that made me instantly revise our approach.\n\"Wait - change of plan!\" I called out urgently. \"Don’t kill it! We’re subduing this one!\"\n\"What?!\" Both Elen and Loko responded with shock, clearly thinking I’d lost my mind in the face of the charging predator.\nBut my reasoning was sound. Killing a Hidebehind for an academy examination would be foolish - wasteful even.\nThis creature was evidence of illegal breeding operations near the kingdom. It was rare, valuable for investigation purposes, and represented a threat that the instructors and authorities needed to know about immediately.\nA corpse would provide some information. A living specimen would provide far more.\nCHARGE!",

      "content": "Chapter 174: Capture [1]\nThe distorted air-shimmer closed the distance rapidly, silver fur flickering in and out of visibility as it committed to its attack.\n\"Elen, drench it now! Make it fully visible!\"\nSPLASH! SURGE!\nWater from the creek responded to Elen’s manipulation, forming a massive wave that crashed over the charging Hidebehind. The creature became instantly visible as water clung to its fur and body - exactly as I’d predicted, like revealing an invisible person by throwing liquid on them.\nNow fully revealed, the Hidebehind was disturbing to behold. Tall as a large bear but impossibly thin, with silver-gray fur matted against its contorted frame. Its body seemed wrong somehow, joints bending at unnatural angles as it maintained its charge toward me.\nI met its lunge with my blade, not aiming to kill but to deflect and control. My blood-enhanced strength allowed me to redirect its momentum, sending the creature stumbling past me rather than connecting with its intended strike.\n\"Loko, maximum strength buffs on me! Elen, keep it drenched and use water bindings to restrict movement!\"\nThe Hidebehind recovered with disturbing speed, its body contorting as it tried to circle around for another attack. But Elen was already responding.\nBIND! WRAP! CONSTRICT!\nWater from the creek formed tendrils that wrapped around the creature’s limbs, restricting its movement. The Hidebehind shrieked - a horrible sound that was part human scream, part animal howl - as it struggled against the bindings.\n\"It’s strong!\" Elen strained to maintain the water restraints. \"I can’t hold it long!\"\n\"You don’t need to hold it long - just keep it restricted for a few seconds!\"\nI moved in quickly while it was partially immobilized. Rather than striking with lethal intent, I used precise techniques designed for subduing rather than killing. My blade struck nerve clusters and joint points, causing temporary paralysis without permanent damage.\nThe Hidebehind’s left foreleg went limp as I severed the nerve connection. Another strike disabled its right rear leg. The creature collapsed partially, still thrashing but losing coordination.\n\"Elen, more bindings! Wrap its entire body!\"\nShe responded with impressive control, the water manipulation creating a cocoon-like restraint around the struggling beast. Combined with the nerve strikes I’d delivered, the Hidebehind’s movements became increasingly weak and uncoordinated.\n\"Loko, do you have any sleep or sedation abilities?\" I asked while maintaining pressure on the partially subdued creature.\n\"Minor sleep enchantment, but it’s weak and might not work on something this strong!\"\n\"Try it anyway. Even partial sedation will help.\"\nLoko channeled magic carefully, his hands glowing with soft blue light as sleep enchantment flowed toward the restrained Hidebehind.\nThe creature’s struggles gradually weakened further, eyes becoming unfocused as the combination of physical restraint, nerve disruption, and magical sedation took cumulative effect.\nAfter several tense minutes, the Hidebehind finally went still not dead, but thoroughly subdued and barely conscious.\n\"Is it... secure?\" Elen asked nervously, maintaining her water bindings just in case.\nI checked carefully, confirming the creature was breathing but completely incapacitated. \"Secure. Well done, both of you.\"\n\"Why didn’t we kill it?\" Loko asked the obvious question. \"That would have been safer and counted toward our mission.\"\n\"Because killing it for an exam would be stupid,\" I explained. \"This creature is evidence of illegal breeding operations. Someone is creating Hidebehinds near the capital - beasts that specifically hunt humans. The instructors and kingdom authorities need to investigate this immediately.\"\nUnderstanding dawned on both their faces.\n\"A living specimen is worth far more than a corpse,\" Elen said slowly. \"They can interrogate it magically, trace its origins, potentially identify the breeders...\"\n\"Exactly. This is bigger than our examination. We need to signal the instructor assistants immediately.\"\nI looked around and spotted one of the Transcendent-rank assistants positioned on a nearby ridge for perimeter security. I raised my hand and channeled a burst of mana - the universal distress signal for ’situation requires immediate instructor attention.’\nThe assistant noticed instantly and began moving toward our position with enhanced speed.\n\"We just turned a simple hunt into a major incident report,\" Loko noted with a mix of anxiety and excitement.\n\"Better that than ignoring evidence of illegal operations that could threaten students and civilians,\" I replied.\nThe subdued Hidebehind lay bound and sedated at our feet - living proof that something dangerous was happening in the forests near the kingdom’s heart.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nLooking at the subdued Hidebehind, the assistant’s eyes widened noticeably. A hidden glint formed in his expression - something that made my instincts prickle with unease, though I couldn’t immediately identify why.\nHe pulled out a small device from his robes and examined it briefly before looking back at us with what appeared to be professional composure.\n\"I will take care of this,\" he said with calm authority. \"You three can leave and continue your examination. Good work identifying the threat.\"\nHis tone was perfectly reasonable, his demeanor appropriate for a Transcendent-rank assistant handling a situation beyond student capability.\nElen, Loko and I nodded in acknowledgment, turning to leave the area and return to their hunt for the remaining examination targets.\nAs I turned my back and began walking away with my teammates, every combat instinct I’d honed through countless battles suddenly screamed danger.\nI activated Stone Echo instantaneously - the defensive trait that I’d kept as backup insurance - and whirled around with my sword raised.\nCLASH!\nA blade strike that would have heavily damaged my spine connected instead with my weapon, the impact force so powerful it drove me back several steps. The assistant had attacked with full Transcendent-rank power, no holding back, pure killing intent behind the blow.\nBehind him, I saw the water bindings around the Hidebehind dissolve as he released some kind of counter-enchantment. The creature, suddenly freed and still partially conscious, fled into the forest with disturbing speed.\n\"What are you doing?!\" I snarled, my expression ugly with shock and fury.\nElen and Loko had frozen in complete disbelief, their minds struggling to process that an academy instructor - someone meant to protect students - had just attempted murder.\nThe assistant’s face showed momentary shock that I’d blocked his supposedly surprise attack, but he didn’t stop or explain. Instead, he pressed the assault with ruthless intent.\nSlash!\nHis blade work was professional and lethal, each attack targeting vital points with Transcendent-rank speed and power. He was genuinely trying to kill me, without holding an ounch of strength back.\n\"Elen, Loko, move away and find help NOW!\" I commanded while desperately defending against the onslaught. \"Signal the other assistants! GO!\"\nThey hesitated for only a split second before Elen grabbed Loko’s arm and both began running toward where other instructor assistants were positioned, Elen already channeling mana for an emergency signal flare.\nThe corrupted assistant noticed their escape but couldn’t pursue. I was keeping him fully engaged despite being lower in rank.\nCLASH!\nI used every advantage available. Blood manipulation enhanced my physical capabilities beyond normal high-Elite limits. The Royal-rank footwork technique from my father’s secret art allowed me to dodge attacks that should have connected. Stone Echo absorbed impacts that would have otherwise injured me seriously.\n\"You should have died quietly,\" the assistant hissed, his attacks becoming more desperate and aggressive. \"Why do noble brats always have to complicate things?!\"\nHe was panicking now, realizing his ambush had failed and that help was coming. His strikes became more reckless, sacrificing technique for raw power.\nThat desperation created openings.\nWhen he overcommitted on a particularly vicious slash, I saw it - a gap in his defense that my enhanced perception could exploit even if normal students couldn’t.\nHe tried to flee.\nThe moment he recognized his assassination attempt had failed completely and reinforcements were approaching, survival instinct overrode whatever orders he was following. He disengaged and turned to run with Transcendent-rank speed enhancement.\nBut I didn’t allow it I chased after him.\nI activated blood enhancement to maximum output, combined with the unfinished first stance Royal-rank footwork, and chased after him with speed that touched the threshold of Transcendent capability. The gap closed in seconds.\nWhen I was within striking distance, I swung my blade and the attack landed squarely on his back, blood manipulation adding power to the strike.\nThe attack wasn’t enough to kill a Transcendent outright, but it was enough to wound seriously.\n\"ARGH!\" He cried out in pain, stumbling forward before whirling around to retaliate.\nHis desperate counterattack was wild and uncontrolled. I dodged cleanly, then pressed my advantage with relentless strikes that prevented him from regaining composure or escaping.\nBlood flowed from his back wound - substantial damage that was slowing him down and degrading his combat effectiveness with each passing second.\n\"Why?!\" I demanded while continuing the assault. \"Why attack students? Who are you working for?!\"\nHis expression twisted with rage and fear. He knew he was caught, knew he couldn’t escape, knew that capture meant interrogation that would reveal everything.\nI heard them - multiple Transcendent-rank presences converging on our location at high speed. Elen and Loko had successfully signaled for help, and the legitimate instructor assistants were responding to what appeared to be a genuine emergency.\nThe corrupted assistant’s eyes widened with recognition that time had run out.\n\"You’ve ruined everything,\" he spat with venom, then suddenly his jaw moved strangely.\n\"No!\" I lunged forward, recognizing the motion too late.\nHe bit down hard on something concealed in his mouth - a hidden pill that assassins and spies carried for exactly this situation. Poison capsule, suicide measure, last resort to prevent interrogation.\nHis body convulsed immediately, foam appearing at his lips as the fast-acting toxin flooded his system.\n\"Damn it!\" I caught him as he collapsed, but it was already too late. Whatever poison he’d consumed was catastrophically effective.",

      "content": "Chapter 175: capture [2]\nInstructor Sylvia arrived first, moving with incredible speed that left afterimages. Her eyes took in the scene instantly - the dying assistant convulsing on the ground, my blade drawn and bloody, the obvious signs of recent combat.\n\"Adrian! What happened?!\"\n\"He attacked me, freed the Hidebehind we’d captured and tried to kill me. When I subdued him, he bit a suicide pill.\"\nMore arrived, three additional Transcendent-rank assistants all looking shocked at finding one of their colleagues dying on the ground.\nSylvia immediately knelt beside the corrupted assistant, checking his vitals. Her expression grew grim as she confirmed what I already knew.\n\"He’s dead. The poison is high-grade, designed for this exact purpose - fast-acting, no antidote, ensures no possibility of interrogation.\"\nShe looked up at me with an expression mixing shock, concern, and calculation.\n\"How were you able to subdue a Transcendent-rank opponent?\" The question was direct and demanding. The implications were obvious, a first year elite student shouldn’t have been capable of defeating and subduing someone an entire rank above them.\n\"He was trying to kill me,\" I said flatly. \"I fought to survive.\"\nBefore she could press further, Elen and Loko arrived with several more in tow, all looking horrified at the scene.\n\"Adrian’s telling the truth!\" Elen said immediately, her voice carrying conviction despite obvious shock. \"That assistant freed the Hidebehind we captured and attacked Adrian from behind without warning! We saw it happen!\"\n\"He told us to run for help while he held him off,\" Loko added, still pale from witnessing the violence.\nSylvia stood slowly, her expression hardening as the full situation crystallized. \"This examination is over. All students return to the academy immediately. This area is now under full security lockdown until we determine how deeply this corruption has penetrated.\"\nShe looked at the dead assistant’s body with cold fury. \"Someone has infiltrated our instructor staff. Someone is breeding illegal magical creatures near the capital. And someone just tried to murder a student to cover it up.\"\nHer gaze fixed on me again. \"Adrian, you’ll need to provide complete testimony about everything that happened. And we’ll need to discuss exactly how you managed to defeat a Transcendent-rank opponent.\"\nI met her eyes evenly, knowing this incident had just complicated my life significantly.\nBut I was alive, my teammates were safe, and a traitor had been exposed even if he’d escaped interrogation through suicide.\nThe examination had become something far more dangerous than anyone had anticipated.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\nShortly after arriving at the academy, I was summoned for immediate testimony. The gravity of the situation was evident from the location - not a standard office, but the Headmaster’s private council chamber, a room reserved for the most serious academy matters.\nAll the senior instructors were present, their expressions ranging from concerned to deeply troubled. Instructor Sylvia stood near the entrance. Victor Castellane, the combat instructor of the second elite class, positioned himself with arms crossed. And at the centre, seated behind an ornate desk, was the headmaster himself - a royal-rank awakener whose mere presence carried weight that made the air feel heavier.\nTheir eyes fixed on me as I entered, the collective attention of so much power creating palpable pressure.\n\"Adrian Blackwood,\" the Headmaster began with measured tone. \"Please explain exactly what happened during today’s examination, from the moment you encountered the Hidebehind until the assistant’s death.\"\nI took a breath and provided the account.\nFinding the Hidebehind near the creek. Recognizing it as evidence of illegal breeding operations. Subduing it alive to preserve evidence. Signaling the assistant for help. His suspicious behavior upon seeing the creature. The moment I turned my back and he attacked with lethal intent. His freeing of the Hidebehind. The desperate combat that followed. His attempt to flee and his suicide by poison pill.\nThe room remained silent as I finished, multiple instructors processing the implications.\nVictor Castellane leaned forward, his sharp eyes narrowing with dissatisfaction.\n\"There is more to your story,\" he stated bluntly. \"How did you fight the assistant? What happened during the period where you were alone fighting him? How were you able to overpower a Transcendent-rank opponent when you’re only high-Elite?\"\nThe question cut to the heart of what everyone was really wondering. My capabilities had exceeded what should be possible, and that demanded explanation in their minds.\nI waited for a moment, considering my response carefully.\n\"I don’t think that matters,\" I said evenly.\nVictor’s expression hardened. \"It absolutely matters. A student defeating someone an entire rank above them suggests either you’ve been concealing your true strength, you possess abilities that—\"\nInstructor Sylvia interrupted sharply. \"Or Adrian fought desperately to survive an assassination attempt and we should be grateful he’s alive rather than interrogating his combat techniques,\"\nAll eyes turned to her.\n\"The relevant facts are clear,\" she continued with authority. \"An instructor assistant attempted to murder a student to cover up evidence of illegal operations. The student defended himself successfully. Whether he used family techniques, emergency items, or simple determination is his private business unless he voluntarily shares those details.\"\nVictor looked at her calmly. \"We need to understand—\"\n\"We need to understand how our security was compromised,\" Sylvia countered. \"How a traitor infiltrated our instructor staff. How illegal breeding operations established themselves near the capital without detection. Those are the urgent questions, not dissecting Adrian’s survival tactics.\"\nThe Headmaster raised his hand, and both instructors fell silent immediately.\n\"Instructor Sylvia makes valid points,\" he said thoughtfully. \"However, Instructor Castellane’s concerns are not without merit either.\"\nHis royal-rank gaze fixed on me directly, and I felt the weight of his assessment.\n\"Adrian Blackwood, I will not compel you to reveal family techniques or personal abilities. Your privacy in such matters is protected by academy regulations. However, I must ask: do you possess any knowledge about the breeding operations, the assistant’s affiliations, or related threats that would aid our investigation?\"\n\"No, Headmaster,\" I answered honestly. \"I’d never heard of Hidebehind breeding operations before today. The assistant didn’t explain his motives before attacking, and he killed himself before interrogation was possible.\"\nThe Headmaster nodded slowly. \"Then we have learned what we can from this testimony. You are dismissed, Adrian. However, you will remain available for additional questions should the investigation require clarification.\"\n\"Understood, Headmaster.\"\nAs I turned to leave, Victor Castellane spoke again, his tone still probing.\n\"Your father taught you well, it seems.\"\nI met his eyes without confirming or denying. \"Indeed, my father has been generous with his instruction.\"\nA slight smile crossed his face - acknowledgment that he’d received as much answer as he was going to get.\nI left the council chamber, aware that while the immediate interrogation was over, questions about my capabilities would linger in the minds of the instructors who’d witnessed the aftermath.\nAfter everything was settled and I was dismissed from the council chamber, I returned directly to my academy dormitory room rather than the mansion. Eyes would be on me following today’s incident, and I didn’t want anyone tracking my movements to discover my private residence and the secrets it contained.\nInside the dorm room, I sat on the bed and allowed myself to truly process everything that had happened.\nThe implications were deeply concerning.\nIn the original novel that this world was based on, there had been no mention of Hidebehinds appearing during academy training. No traitors among the instructor staff. No assassination attempts on students during routine examinations. These events represented significant deviations from the storyline I remembered.\nEither my presence and actions had created butterfly effects that were altering the timeline, or there were threats operating in this world that the original novel had never revealed. Neither possibility was comforting.\nThe most immediate problem was exposure. After today’s incident, my enemies - whoever they were - now knew about my combat capabilities. There was no possible way to hide what had happened. Too many instructors had seen the aftermath, too many students would hear about a first-year defeating a Transcendent-rank opponent. The information would spread rapidly through academy gossip networks.\nIf there were small fry enemies like that corrupted assistant operating within the academy, logic dictated there must be larger fish as well - more dangerous operatives, perhaps even among the senior faculty or administration. Someone had to be coordinating these illegal operations, and that someone likely had significant resources and influence.\nAlthough I still had no idea who specifically was behind it all.\nEverything was happening faster than I’d anticipated. The threats were escalating, the timeline was accelerating, and I needed to get stronger immediately for whatever was coming next.\nI stepped out of my dorm room with renewed determination and made my way toward the combat training facilities. Physical exertion would help process stress while simultaneously advancing my development.\nSeveral hours of intensive training passed. I pushed my body to absolute limits - blood manipulation exercises until my reserves nearly depleted, enhancement techniques at maximum output until muscles screamed, supernatural physique conditioning through extreme stress applications.\nThe familiar notifications appeared in my consciousness:\n[Your trait Supernatural Physique has reached Level 4!]\n[Your trait Blood Enhancement has reached Level 4!]\nA genuine smile formed on my face as power flooded through my body. The advancement was immediately tangible - muscles felt denser and more efficient, blood circulation carried enhancement more effectively, overall physical capabilities increased measurably.\nLevel 4 represented significant progress. Each trait level provided exponential rather than linear improvements, meaning the gap between Level 3 and Level 4 was substantial.\nI tested the new capabilities with experimental movements - my speed had increased noticeably, strength output was higher, and the efficiency of blood enhancement meant I could maintain powered states longer without exhausting reserves.\nThis was progress. Real, measurable advancement that would help me survive the accelerating threats.\nBut even as satisfaction at the level-ups settled in, I knew this wasn’t enough. I needed to reach Transcendent rank to unlock Carmilla’s second secret art stance. I needed to continue advancing rapidly to stay ahead of whatever conspiracies were unfolding around me.\nThe training would continue. The advancement would continue.\nBecause standing still in this increasingly dangerous world meant dying.",

      "content": "Chapter 176: Arena Begins [1]\nA week had passed since the incident with the corrupted assistant and the Hidebehind. During that time, many significant developments had occurred throughout the academy.\nKael had successfully completed his entrance examination, passing with flying colors. Not that I’d expected anything less from him - the training and resources I’d provided, combined with his natural talent and determination, made success almost inevitable. His combat performance and theoretical knowledge had impressed the evaluation committee enough to grant immediate admission despite the unusual timing.\nHe’d been assigned to my classroom, which created quite a stir among the other students. Entry this late into the academic term simply wasn’t done under normal circumstances. The fact that he’d been accepted anyway made everyone curious about his identity, his connections, and what power he possessed to warrant such exceptional treatment.\nI’d endured numerous subtle and not-so-subtle inquiries about my relationship with the mysterious new student, all of which I’d deflected with vague responses about recognizing potential talent.\nDuring this same week, I’d also carefully introduced Changing Star to Kael. The growing dragon had reached the size of a medium dog now, her rapid development continuing at an alarming pace thanks her powerful skill. She could no longer be easily hidden, which meant anyone living in the mansion needed to know about her existence.\nShe had also reached the transcendent rank and gained a new offensive skill.\nI’d presented her to Kael as \"my pet with low draconic bloodline\" - not a full dragon, just a magical creature with distant dragon ancestry that gave her impressive size and abilities. It was a half-truth that seemed more believable than the reality of harboring an actual Mythical-rank dragon destined for power that nobody could fathom.\nKael had accepted the explanation without excessive questioning, though I could tell he suspected there was more to Changing Star than I was revealing. He was smart enough not to press for details I clearly wasn’t offering.\nThe most significant development affecting everyone, however, was the announcement of the upcoming Arena Tournament.\nFor the entire week, the academy had been preparing for this major event - a comprehensive combat tournament where all first-year students would battle to determine rankings and demonstrate their growth since enrollment. It was simultaneously a learning opportunity, entertainment for upper-year students and faculty, and a way to identify standout talents deserving special attention or advanced training.\nThe atmosphere in class had shifted noticeably as students prepared. Competitive ones like Emmet and Marcus trained with increased intensity. Strategic students like Elen researched opponent capabilities and planned tactical approaches. Even normally reserved students showed signs of nervous anticipation.\nThis morning, Instructor Sylvia entered the classroom with her usual demeanor, though I detected an undertone of excitement in her expression that suggested even she found tournaments engaging.\n\"As you all know,\" she began without preamble, \"for the past week, the academy has been preparing for the Arena Tournament where you will all battle it out to determine the strongest first-years.\"\nThe room immediately filled with focused attention, conversations cutting off as students turned toward her.\n\"The tournament format is straightforward: single-elimination bracket with randomized initial pairings. You’ll face opponents of varying skill levels, which tests adaptability rather than just raw power. Matches continue until one participant yields, becomes unconscious, or the referee determines they can no longer safely continue.\"\nSeveral students exchanged nervous glances at the \"unconscious\" specification.\n\"Victory demonstrates superior combat capability,\" Sylvia continued. \"But the evaluation isn’t solely about winning. We assess tactical decision-making, technique execution, adaptability under pressure, and sportsmanship. A student who loses honorably against a stronger opponent can still earn recognition for excellent performance.\"\nThat seemed to relax some of the more anxious students slightly.\n\"Medical staff will be present for immediate healing of injuries. Lethal techniques are strictly forbidden - this is educational combat, not warfare. Anyone who deliberately attempts to kill or permanently injure an opponent faces immediate expulsion and criminal charges.\"\nHer tone made clear that rule was non-negotiable.\n\"The tournament takes place over three days. Today features preliminary rounds to reduce the initial bracket. Tomorrow continues with quarterfinals and semifinals. The final day concludes with championship matches and awards ceremony.\"\nSylvia’s gaze swept across the classroom. \"This is your opportunity to demonstrate everything you’ve learned, to test yourselves against peers, and to identify areas requiring improvement. Approach it seriously, but remember it’s ultimately a learning experience.\"\nShe turned toward the door with purposeful energy.\n\"So without much more to say, let’s head to the arena. Your combat awaits.\"\nStudents immediately began standing and gathering their equipment. The nervous energy that had been building all week crystallized into focused anticipation as everyone filed out of the classroom.\nI noticed Kael positioning himself near me in the general flow of students moving through the corridors. He looked determined but controlled, showing none of the excessive nervousness that afflicted some others.\n\"Ready for your first official academy tournament?\" I asked quietly.\n\"As ready as I’ll ever be,\" he replied with honest assessment.\n\"You’ll do fine. Remember - tactics and adaptability matter as much as raw power.\"\nElen appeared on my other side, her expression mixing excitement and strategic calculation. \"I’ve been analyzing the class combat capabilities all week. There are some genuinely dangerous opponents in our year.\"\n\"Including present company,\" I noted with slight amusement.\nShe smiled. \"Especially present company. Though I’m hoping the bracket randomization keeps us from facing each other too early.\"\nWe emerged from the main building into bright sunlight, following Instructor Sylvia and the stream of first-year students toward the massive arena structure that dominated the academy’s southern grounds.\n....\nThe arena was a magnificent structure - a massive circular amphitheater with tiered seating that could accommodate thousands of spectators. Magical barriers separated the combat floor from the audience, ensuring safety while allowing clear viewing. The architecture spoke of both function and grandeur, designed to showcase combat while protecting observers.\nAll first-year students assembled on the arena floor while upper-year students, faculty, and invited guests filled the surrounding seats. The atmosphere buzzed with anticipation and competitive energy.\nHeadmaster Aldric Thornhaven stood at the central platform, his King-rank presence commanding immediate attention. His voice, enhanced by projection magic, filled the entire arena clearly.\n\"Welcome to the First-Year Arena Tournament,\" he began with formal gravitas. \"This event represents a critical milestone in your development as awakeners. Combat reveals truth - about your capabilities, your character, and your potential.\"\nHe paused, allowing his words to resonate.\n\"To incentivize excellence and reward achievement, the academy offers substantial prizes for top performers.\"\nInterest sharpened dramatically throughout the assembled students.\n\"First place receives two hundred thousand academy points.\"\nAudible gasps and excited murmurs erupted. Two hundred thousand points was an astronomical sum - equivalent to roughly four hundred thousand golden coins if converted through academy exchange systems. That amount could genuinely change someone’s life trajectory, elevating a commoner to minor nobility or funding years of advanced training and equipment.\n\"Second place receives fifty thousand points,\" the Headmaster continued. \"Third place receives ten thousand points.\"\nEven third place represented decent wealth for most students. Ten thousand points could help with training resources, or living expenses.\n\"These rewards are not trivial,\" Thornhaven emphasized. \"They represent genuine opportunity for those with skill and determination to claim them. Let the tournament begin.\"\nThe preliminary matches started immediately, with multiple combat rings operating simultaneously to process the large bracket efficiently.\nElen’s first match was against a student from one of the weaker classes - someone who’d barely passed entrance examinations and showed minimal development since enrollment. The matchup was unfortunate for her opponent but fortunate for Elen.\nThe fight lasted less than three minutes. Elen’s water manipulation controlled the battlefield completely, creating barriers that prevented approach while launching pressurized water strikes that forced her opponent into defensive positions. When the hapless student attempted a desperate charge, Elen simply encased his legs in frozen water and struck with a concentrated blast that knocked him unconscious.\n\"Winner: Elen!\"\nThe crowd applauded politely. It had been clinical and efficient, though not particularly exciting given the power disparity.\nEmmet’s match followed shortly after, pitting him against an Elite-class student from Kyle’s classroom - someone with decent capabilities and solid training who might have defeated average opponents.\nAgainst Emmet, he lasted perhaps four minutes.\nEmmet fought with his silent intensity, his attacks were overwhelming. He didn’t waste movement or energy, simply dismantling his opponent’s defense. The Elite student tried various tactics - aggressive offense, defensive positioning, tactical retreat - but nothing worked against Emmet’s straightforward dominance.\n\"Winner: Emmet!\"\nThe crowd responded with more enthusiastic applause. Emmet’s combat style was less flashy than some, but his pure skill commanded respect.\nThen came a matchup that shocked everyone watching.\n\"Next match: Kyle versus Marcus!\"\nStunned silence followed the announcement, then explosive conversation as students realized what this meant. Both competitors were widely recognized as among the absolute strongest first-years - Kyle with his mysterious golden finger advantages, Marcus with his powerful Ironhold bloodline and noble combat training.\nFor them to face each other in preliminary rounds rather than semifinals or finals was incredibly unlucky. One of these powerhouses would be eliminated early, denied the opportunity to showcase their full capabilities in later matches.\nI leaned forward with intense interest. This would be revealing regardless of outcome.\nKyle entered the ring with confident composure, his expression calm and focused. Marcus approached from the opposite side with grim determination, clearly recognizing the challenge ahead.\nThe referee signaled start, and both exploded into immediate action.\nCLASH! STRIKE! COUNTER!\nTheir combat was several levels above what previous matches had displayed. Kyle’s attacks were refined and precise, enhanced by whatever advantages his golden finger provided. Marcus wielded his family’s technique with brutal efficiency, his Ironhold bloodline granting enhanced durability and strength that allowed him to match Kyle’s speed with raw power.",

      "content": "Chapter 177: Arena Begins [2]\nThe fight lasted nearly fifteen minutes - an eternity compared to earlier matches - as both competitors pushed each other hard.\nKyle demonstrated impressive versatility, adapting tactics when initial approaches failed.\nMarcus showed why his family’s reputation for resilient warriors was well-earned, absorbing punishment that would have eliminated weaker opponents while continuing to pressure relentlessly.\nBut gradually, Kyle’s advantages accumulated. His system-enhanced perception allowed him to predict and counter Marcus’s patterns. His energy efficiency remained superior despite the extended engagement. His technique execution stayed crisp while Marcus began showing signs of fatigue.\nThe finishing sequence came when Marcus committed to a powerful overhead strike that Kyle redirected with minimal effort, using Marcus’s own momentum against him. A follow-up combination struck multiple vulnerable points in rapid succession, and Marcus went down.\n\"Winner: Kyle!\"\nThe crowd erupted with appreciation for the high-level display. Both fighters had demonstrated capabilities that justified their reputations.\nAs I watched Kyle leave the ring with barely a scratch despite the intense fight, I analyzed what I’d observed carefully.\nHe hadn’t revealed everything. Maybe seventy percent of his true capabilities, I estimated. He’d won convincingly but held back enough that opponents in later rounds wouldn’t have complete intelligence about his full arsenal.\nSmart strategy. Classic Kyle thinking - win efficiently while preserving mystery about ultimate limits.\nMarcus’s early elimination was genuinely unfortunate. Under different bracket luck, he might have reached semifinals or even finals. Instead, he’d drawn the worst possible opponent in round one.\nThe tournament was already proving interesting, and we’d barely begun.\n\"Next match: Adrian Blackwood versus Thomas Crane!\"\nI stepped into the combat ring with measured composure while my opponent - a nervous-looking student I vaguely recognized from one of the mid-tier classes - approached from the opposite side. His movements were hesitant, and his face had gone pale the moment our names were announced together.\nThomas Crane. I knew virtually nothing about him except that he’d maintained low profile throughout the term, avoiding attention and controversy. Now he stood across from me, and judging by his expression, he was absolutely terrified.\nAs the referee prepared to signal the match start, Thomas raised his hand.\n\"I...\"\n\"Wait,\" I interrupted quickly, moving closer before he could complete the formal surrender declaration.\nThe referee paused, looking confused. The audience murmured with curiosity about the delay.\nI approached Thomas until I was close enough to speak quietly without the crowd overhearing.\n\"Don’t worry,\" I whispered. \"I won’t go too hard on you. Dont surrender, you will not be given any opportunity by guilds.\"\nHis eyes widened with surprise, clearly not expecting mercy or consideration from someone of my ranking and reputation.\n\"But... everyone knows you’re one of the strongest,\" he said quietly, his voice trembling. \"I can’t possibly—\"\n\"You entered this tournament to learn and improve, didn’t you?\" I kept my voice low and reassuring. \"Surrendering without fighting teaches you nothing. Let’s have a proper match. You’ll get experience, I’ll get practice teaching, and your future won’t be ruined by a humiliating instant forfeit that everyone remembers. We are comrades after all.\"\nUnderstanding slowly dawned on his face, followed by cautious hope.\n\"You... you’re serious?\"\n\"Completely. Just fight to the best of your ability. I’ll respond appropriately.\"\nThomas took a shaky breath and nodded, lowering his surrender hand and moving back to his starting position with renewed - if still nervous - determination.\nThe referee, seeing both fighters ready, signaled the match start.\n\"BEGIN!\"\nThomas launched into a cautious offensive, his sword strikes competent but predictable. His form was textbook academy training - nothing innovative, but fundamentally sound.\nI defended easily, blocking his attacks while observing his technique carefully. He telegraphed his movements too obviously, left his guard slightly open after commits, and his footwork needed refinement.\nRather than simply overwhelming him, I engaged at his level.\n\"Your stance is too wide,\" I said casually while deflecting a strike. \"It gives you stability but reduces mobility. Try narrowing it slightly.\"\nThomas blinked in surprise at receiving coaching during combat but adjusted his footing as suggested.\n\"Better. Now watch your guard after you attack - you’re dropping your blade too low.\"\nThe fight became less traditional combat and more instructional sparring. I matched his pace, allowed him opportunities to attempt techniques, then provided immediate feedback on execution and improvements.\n\"Good attempt at that feint, but you committed too early. Try again - I’ll give you the opening.\"\nThomas attempted the feint sequence again, this time with better timing, and actually managed to land a glancing strike on my shoulder that wouldn’t have hurt even without my supernatural physique.\nHis face lit up with genuine surprise and satisfaction.\nThe crowd was watching with growing interest now, recognizing this wasn’t the quick domination they’d expected. Some seemed confused, others appeared thoughtful about the unusual dynamic.\nAfter about eight minutes of instructional combat where Thomas showed visible improvement from applying my real-time coaching, I decided to conclude the match properly.\n\"Alright, that’s good progress. Final exchange now - give me your best technique.\"\nThomas nodded with appreciation, took a proper stance, and launched his strongest combination attack with everything he’d learned during our brief session.\nI deflected the sequence smoothly, then countered with a precise strike to his chest that used just enough force to knock him backward and signal clear defeat without causing injury.\nThomas fell to one knee, breathing heavily but unharmed.\n\"Winner: Adrian!\"\nThe announcement was expected, but the applause that followed carried a different quality than usual - recognition not just of victory but of how it had been achieved.\nI extended my hand to help Thomas up. He accepted gratefully, his expression showing genuine respect rather than the humiliation he’d feared.\n\"Thank you,\" he said quietly. \"That was... I learned more in those few minutes than weeks of regular training.\"\n\"Keep practicing what we covered,\" I replied. \"You have solid fundamentals. Just need refinement and confidence.\"\nAs we left the ring together, I noticed several instructors watching with thoughtful expressions. Teaching during combat wasn’t common, and doing so while maintaining complete control demonstrated capabilities beyond just winning fights.\nBut more importantly, Thomas’s future hadn’t been ruined by instant surrender or humiliating defeat. He’d fought, learned, and lost with dignity.\nThe day continued with each advancing contestant participating in their second match. The preliminary rounds were designed to quickly filter the bracket from hundreds of students down to a manageable number for tomorrow’s more focused competition.\nKael’s second match drew considerable attention, particularly from the Elite-class students who’d been curious about the mysterious late-entry student since his arrival.\nHis opponent was a solid Elite-rank awakener from one of the other premier classes - someone with good bloodline advantages, formal training, and respectable combat record. Not a pushover by any measure.\n\"Next match: Kael versus Daniel!\"\nThe fight began with Daniel attempting to establish dominance through aggressive offense, clearly intending to overwhelm the newcomer quickly and decisively.\nKael responded with ice manipulation that proved how powerful. Ice barriers formed defensively while frozen projectiles launched with precision timing. His movements were economical and tactical, showing the street-fighting instincts refined by proper training.\nWhat made the Elite students lean forward with interest was how Kael adapted mid-combat. When Daniel broke through his initial ice constructs with brute force, Kael immediately shifted tactics - creating slippery frozen patches on the arena floor that disrupted his opponent’s footing, then capitalizing on the instability with perfectly timed offensive strikes.\nThe match lasted nearly ten minutes before Kael secured victory with a combination technique that froze Daniel’s sword arm and followed with a decisive ice-enhanced strike to the chest.\n\"Winner: Kael!\"\nThe murmuring began immediately throughout the Elite student sections.\n\"Who is that guy? I’ve never seen him before this week.\"\n\"Late entry, supposedly. But his combat fundamentals are really solid - that’s not amateur level.\"\n\"Did you see how quickly he adapted when his initial strategy failed? That’s talent, not just training.\"\n\"Ice affinity with that level of control... he could be a problem in later rounds.\"\n\"Wild card for sure. None of us have intelligence on his full abilities yet.\"\nSeveral Elite students were watching Kael leave the ring with calculating expressions, clearly reassessing the tournament bracket and potential future matchups.\n-----\nThroughout the remainder of the day, the expected powerhouses continued advancing without significant issues.\nSeraphina moved through her matches with elegant efficiency, her Valkyrie bloodline creating dazzling displays that were as beautiful as they were effective. She won both matches with minimal effort, barely breaking composure.\nEmmet continued his pattern of silent dominance, dispatching opponents so easily that left no doubt about the outcome. His fights were brief and decisive, wasting neither time nor energy.\nElen demonstrated why she ranked first in theoretical knowledge by applying strategic thinking to combat situations. Her water manipulation controlled battlefield conditions so completely that opponents struggled to even reach effective striking range before being worn down and defeated.\nI advanced through my matches without revealing more capabilities than necessary. The first opponent after Thomas had been more skilled but still manageable with basic techniques. Control and efficiency remained my priorities rather than impressive displays.\nKyle, predictably, continued winning with the same calculated approach - demonstrating enough power to secure victory while holding back enough to maintain mystery about his full arsenal.\nBy the end of the day’s competition, the bracket had been reduced from the initial hundreds down to sixty-four remaining students. Tomorrow’s quarterfinals would narrow that further to the true contenders.\nThe final announcement came from the referee platform as evening approached.\n\"Preliminary rounds concluded! Sixty-four competitors remain. Tournament resumes tomorrow at dawn for quarterfinal matches. Bracket postings will be available within the hour. All participants, rest well and prepare accordingly!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 178: Arena Begins [3]\nStudents began dispersing, some heading to training facilities for last-minute practice, others toward dormitories for recovery and preparation.\nI moved through the crowd with purposeful direction, avoiding the various groups trying to engage in tournament discussion or social networking. My destination was clear - the mansion, where Changing Star waited and where I could train privately without observation.\nThe skateboard carried me through the city streets as daylight faded into evening. Academy grounds disappeared behind me, replaced by urban architecture and eventually the familiar elegant white structure of my personal residence.\nI entered through the secured entrance, immediately sensing Changing Star’s presence through our bond. She was awake and active, having grown noticeably larger even in just the past week.\nKojiro stood in the main hall, clearly having been maintaining security during my absence.\n\"Master,\" he greeted with professional acknowledgment. \"The mansion remains secure. No intrusions or unusual activity to report.\"\n\"Good. How’s Changing Star been?\"\n\"Energetic and hungry, as usual. She consumed approximately fifteen kilograms of Elite-rank meat today and appears to be entering another growth phase.\"\nI smiled slightly. That dragon was going to bankrupt me through food costs alone at this rate.\nInside the mansion, after confirming everything was secure and Changing Star was healthy, the familiar notification pulsed through my consciousness.\n[Daily Login Available!]\n[Would you like to claim your daily reward?]\n[Yes | No]\nI pressed yes immediately, curious what the system would provide after the recent string of generous rewards.\n[Congratulations! You have received: 1st Key of Endra]\n[Rank: ???]\n[Description: A dimensional key that grants access to a sealed hunting ground located in the ancient ruins of Endra. This location exists outside normal space and contains an ecosystem populated by beasts ranging from Transcendent rank to Commander rank. Time flows differently within - one day inside equals one hour outside. Single use key that binds to the first user who activates it.]\nI stared at the ornate key that materialized in my hand, its metal surface inscribed with complex runic patterns that seemed to shift when observed directly. The craftsmanship was extraordinary, clearly the work of ancient civilization with magical understanding far beyond current standards.\nThe system was not being light-handed with these rewards. A key to a personal hunting dimension filled with Transcendent and Commander-rank beasts - that was essentially a private training ground that could accelerate my advancement dramatically once I was strong enough to utilize it.\nCommander rank was two full tiers above Transcendent. Beasts at that level could devastate cities, required coordinated military responses to handle, and represented genuine existential threats. Even Transcendent-rank creatures were dangerous enough that most awakeners avoided them unless absolutely necessary or properly prepared.\nEntering that dimension at my current high-Elite rank would be suicide. The weakest prey inside would be stronger than me, and the strongest would kill me before I even registered the threat.\n\"Once I reach Transcendent rank, I’ll enter it,\" I decided aloud, carefully storing the key in my system inventory where it would remain safe and hidden.\nBut having the key made me genuinely excited about future prospects. The time dilation effect was particularly valuable - being able to spend days hunting and training while only hours passed in the real world would provide enormous advantages. I could advance rapidly without anyone noticing extended absences.\nThe path forward was clear: reach Transcendent rank as quickly as possible, unlock Carmilla’s second secret art stance, then use the Endra hunting dimension to accelerate toward King rank and beyond.\nMy gaze shifted to Changing Star, who was currently investigating one of her gemstone treasures with focused attention. She’d grown substantially over the past week - now roughly the size of a large dog, with scales that shimmered beautifully and wings that were developing proper membrane structure.\nA smile formed on my face as realization struck.\n\"Changing Star,\" I called out.\nmm?\nShe looked up immediately, those big, round eyes focusing on me with complete attention.\n\"It’s time for you to hunt.\"\nHer head tilted adorably to one side, clearly not understanding the full implications but sensing through our bond that this was something significant and exciting.\nShe’d been confined to the mansion since hatching, growing stronger through consuming stored meat but never experiencing actual combat or the thrill of pursuing live prey. Her instincts were draconic - she was born to hunt, to fight, to dominate through personal strength.\nAnd more practically, she needed soul power from genuine kills to continue advancing. The stored Elite-rank meat provided nutrition and baseline growth, but true rank progression required absorbing soul essence from defeated enemies.\n\"We’re going hunting together,\" I explained, reaching out to stroke her head gently. \"Real prey in the forest, not just meat from storage. You’ll get to use your abilities in actual combat.\"\nRAWR!\nHer enthusiastic response was immediate and emphatic, her tail swishing with obvious excitement as she understood we were finally going to do something beyond staying in the mansion.\nThis would serve multiple purposes. Changing Star would gain combat experience and soul power. I could continue my own hunting for advancement. And perhaps most importantly, I could assess her current capabilities in real situations to better understand how to develop her potential.\n\"Tonight,\" I decided. \"Once it’s fully dark and fewer people are traveling. We’ll go to the hunting grounds where I’ve been operating before.\"\nChirp chirp!\nShe practically vibrated with anticipation, already moving toward the entrance as if ready to leave immediately.\n\"Patience,\" I said with amusement. \"A few more hours. Use that time to rest and prepare.\"\nBut even as I said it, I was already planning the expedition mentally. What prey would be appropriate for her current size and capabilities? How would I ensure her safety while allowing genuine challenge? What approaches should I teach her during the hunt?\nThe 1st Key of Endra represented future potential.\n------\nNight arrived with clear skies and minimal moonlight - perfect conditions for discrete hunting expeditions. I’d already arranged for a carriage to wait outside the mansion, the driver a trusted family servant who understood discretion and asked no questions about nocturnal activities.\nBefore departing, I made the decision to bring both Kael and Kojiro along. Kael needed real combat experience beyond academy sparring to continue developing, and Kojiro’s presence would provide additional security if anything went wrong. With Changing Star also joining her first real hunt, having backup made tactical sense.\nI wore a simple black mask rather than the one that showed my Earth features. That particular disguise was reserved for my completely anonymous identity - the one I used for activities that couldn’t be traced back to Adrian Blackwood under any circumstances. Kael knowing about some of my secrets was acceptable, but that specific persona needed to remain absolutely unknown to everyone, including allies.\n\"Where are we going?\" Kael asked as we assembled in the mansion’s entrance hall.\n\"Eastern hunting grounds. You both need real combat experience, and Changing Star needs her first proper hunt.\" I gestured toward the excited dragon, who was already pacing near the door with obvious impatience.\nKael’s eyes widened slightly at the implication that the \"pet with draconic bloodline\" was coming along for active hunting, but he simply nodded acceptance.\nKojiro materialized from his echo card, immediately assessing the group composition. \"Security escort, Master?\"\n\"Exactly. Stay alert for threats beyond what Kael and Changing Star should handle. This is training for them, but I want you ready if something dangerous appears.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nThe carriage ride to the eastern forest was quiet, each of us preparing mentally for the expedition ahead. Changing Star pressed against the window, her sapphire eyes tracking the passing darkness with predatory interest that suggested her instincts were awakening properly.\nWe arrived at the forest edge within thirty minutes. I dismissed the carriage with instructions to return at dawn, leaving us free to operate without time constraints.\n\"Ground rules,\" I stated as we entered the treeline. \"Kael, you and Changing Star will handle Elite-rank prey as warm-up exercises. Kojiro and I will observe unless you’re in genuine danger. The goal is learning through experience, not being rescued constantly.\"\n\"Got it,\" Kael confirmed, drawing his sword and channeling ice mana in preparation.\nSniff sniff...\nChanging Star’s nostrils flared as she picked up scent trails, her head lowering slightly in a distinctly predatory posture I’d never seen from her before. The cute, clumsy infant who tripped over her own feet was suddenly absent, replaced by focused hunting instinct.\nWe moved deeper into the forest systematically until Changing Star suddenly froze, her attention locked on something ahead.\nLow growl...\nAbout forty meters distant, a small pack of Elite-rank Wolves had detected our presence. Three of them, each roughly the size of a large dog - perfect warm-up targets.\n\"Those are yours,\" I told Kael and Changing Star. \"Work together or separately, your choice. Show me what you can do.\"\nKael moved first, ice forming along his blade as he advanced with tactical caution. The Shadow Wolves split up, two moving to flank him while one circled wider.\nBut Changing Star had already launched into motion.\nBURST!\nShe moved with shocking velocity and coordination, nothing like the stumbling infant from weeks ago. Her draconic nature proved itself immediately as she hunted like a true predator - reading the wolf’s movements, timing her approach perfectly, then striking with claws and teeth that tore through fur and flesh with devastating efficiency.\nThe Shadow Wolf barely managed a defensive response before Changing Star’s jaws clamped onto its throat. Ice-blue energy flared around her fangs as frost breath activated at point-blank range, flash-freezing the wound site and ensuring the kill was clean and immediate.",

      "content": "Chapter 179: Hunting with Kael and Changing Star [1]\nChanging Star released the corpse and immediately pivoted toward the second wolf that had been flanking Kael, her movements fluid and purposeful. No hesitation, no uncertainty - pure predatory confidence.\n\"Impressive,\" Kojiro observed quietly from beside me. \"Her combat instincts are exceptionally refined for something so young.\"\nI nodded with satisfaction, watching as Changing Star coordinated with Kael to take down the remaining two wolves with efficient teamwork. Her draconic heritage was expressing itself beautifully - she was born for this, born to hunt and dominate through personal strength.\nWithin minutes, all three Wolves lay dead, and both Kael and Changing Star stood victorious without any injury.\n\"Good work,\" I called out. \"That’s just the warm-up. Ready for something more challenging?\"\nRAWR!\nChanging Star’s enthusiastic response made it clear she was just getting started.\nAfter about an hour of systematically hunting Elite-rank prey - allowing both Kael and Changing Star to warm up properly and gain some soul power - we ventured deeper into the forest where more dangerous creatures resided.\nKojiro raised his hand in a silent halt signal, his experienced senses detecting something ahead.\n\"Transcendent presence,\" he reported quietly. \"Single target, approximately two hundred meters northeast. Based on the aura signature, likely a Blaze Tiger.\"\nI nodded, already sensing it myself through enhanced perception. Transcendent-rank beasts represented a significant step up in danger from Elite specimens - faster, stronger, more intelligent, and often possessing specialized abilities that made them genuinely threatening.\n\"Changing Star, Kael,\" I called both of them over. \"There’s a Transcendent beast ahead. This will be your primary target.\"\nKael’s eyes widened with concern. \"I’m only low-Elite rank. Transcendents are... that’s beyond my current capabilities.\"\n\"Which is exactly why you need the experience,\" I said. \"You’re not fighting it alone. Changing Star is Transcendent rank herself, so she’ll take point. Your role is support - use ice manipulation to create tactical advantages, restrict movement, exploit openings she creates. This battle will help you gain soul power and learn how to operate against stronger opponents.\"\nHe nodded slowly, understanding the training logic even if the prospect was intimidating.\nI looked at Changing Star, who was already focused in the direction of the detected threat, her body language radiating readiness. \"You’ll lead this fight. Kael supports. Kojiro and I only intervene if you’re in genuine danger of death. Understood?\"\nRAWR!\nHer confident response suggested she had no doubt about her ability to handle this.\nWe approached carefully until the Blaze Tiger came into view - a magnificent creature roughly the size of a horse, with fur that seemed to flicker with internal flame and eyes that glowed like molten copper. Its Transcendent-rank aura pressed against the surroundings, creating that distinctive pressure that marked genuinely powerful beasts.\nThe moment it detected our presence, it roared a challenge that shook the forest around us.\nROOOAR!\nChanging Star responded immediately by launching forward without hesitation, her smaller size somehow not diminishing the predatory menace she projected.\nCLASH! ENGAGE! COMBAT!\nWhat followed exceeded my expectations dramatically.\nI’d anticipated that Changing Star, despite being Transcendent rank, would struggle due to her age and inexperience. She was barely over a week old, had never fought anything truly dangerous, and lacked the combat refinement that came from years of survival.\nInstead, she fought like she’d been doing this for decades.\nHer movements were instinctive perfection - dodging the Blaze Tiger’s flame-enhanced strikes with minimal wasted motion, countering with claw swipes and frost breath that exploited every opening, positioning herself strategically to prevent the larger creature from using its size advantage effectively.\nFREEZE! STRIKE! DOMINATE!\nWhen the Blaze Tiger attempted to overwhelm her with a massive fire blast, Changing Star responded by releasing her own frost breath at full power. The collision of opposing elemental forces created an explosion of steam and ice shards that momentarily obscured the battlefield.\nShe emerged from the cloud already moving, launching herself at the momentarily disoriented tiger with claws extended.\nSLASH! TEAR! PENETRATE!\nHer talons raked across the tiger’s flank, tearing through Transcendent-rank hide that should have been far more resistant. Dragon claws were apparently effective even at her young age.\nKael had positioned himself to support with ice manipulation, creating frozen patches on the ground to disrupt the tiger’s footing and launching ice projectiles during openings. But honestly, his contribution was minimal - Changing Star was handling the fight almost entirely on her own.\nThe battle lasted approximately five minutes, which was remarkable given the rank parity. Changing Star’s combination of draconic physical advantages, instinctive combat brilliance, and elemental frost abilities proved overwhelming against a creature that should have been her equal.\nThe finishing sequence came when she feinted a frontal assault, baited the Blaze Tiger into a fire-enhanced charge, then used her superior agility to dodge at the last instant and strike the exposed throat with both claws and frost breath simultaneously.\nThe Transcendent beast collapsed, its life essence fading as frost spread from the lethal throat wound.\nChanging Star stood over her kill, breathing heavily but clearly triumphant. Her scales gleamed in the moonlight, and her eyes held predatory satisfaction that was purely draconic.\nI stood there somewhat shocked. She was supposed to struggle, supposed to need support, supposed to show her inexperience. Instead, she’d demonstrated combat capability that rivalled experienced Transcendent-rank awakeners with years of training.\nKael looked equally stunned, staring at the young dragon with obvious disbelief.\n\"She’s... super strong,\" he finally managed, his voice carrying genuine awe.\nI nodded slowly, reassessing my understanding of Changing Star’s current capabilities. \"Yeah. She really is.\"\nHer draconic heritage wasn’t just providing physical advantages - it came with instinctive combat knowledge that bypassed the need for traditional learning. She understood how to fight at a fundamental level that humans spent years developing through practice and experience.\nMythical-rank bloodline advantage,\nI thought, watching as Changing Star began devouring parts of her kill with obvious satisfaction.\nEven as an infant, her baseline capabilities exceed what normal creatures achieve at similar ranks as adolescence.\nKojiro approached the scene, examining the defeated Blaze Tiger with professional assessment. \"Her technique was remarkably refined. The feint-and-counter finishing sequence showed tactical thinking beyond what age would suggest possible.\"\nChanging Star looked up from her meal, frost still coating her muzzle, and made a pleased chirping sound.\nChirp! Proud!\nShe knew she’d done well and wanted acknowledgment.\n\"Excellent work,\" I said genuinely, approaching to stroke her head. \"You fought better than I expected. Much better.\"\nPurr purr...\nThe adorable purring started immediately, her tail swishing with happiness despite being covered in blood and frost from the recent battle.\nKael recovered from his shock enough to speak again. \"If she’s this strong already... what’s she going to be like when she’s fully grown?\"\nThat was an excellent question. If Changing Star was casually defeating Transcendent beasts at barely a week old, her potential once she reached maturity was almost frightening to contemplate.\nAnd watching her devour a Transcendent beast like it was nothing more than a satisfying meal, I believed it completely.\nAfter dealing with the Blaze Tiger and allowing Changing Star to consume her fill of the valuable Transcendent-rank meat, we continued deeper into the hunting grounds in search of additional prey.\nI wanted to maximize soul power gains for both Changing Star and Kael while the night was still young, and Transcendent beasts - while dangerous - represented the most efficient advancement opportunities available in these forests.\nKojiro moved ahead as scout, his spectral nature allowing him to detect threats without revealing our position. After about twenty minutes of searching, he returned with an unusual report.\n\"Master, I’ve located another Transcendent presence. But... it’s strange.\"\n\"Strange how?\" I asked, immediately alert.\n\"It’s a sloth. Transcendent-rank sloth.\"\nI blinked in genuine surprise. \"A sloth? Are you certain about the rank assessment?\"\n\"Absolutely certain. The aura signature is unmistakably Transcendent level.\"\nThat was genuinely shocking. Sloths were typically Noble-rank beasts at best - slow-moving herbivores that relied on camouflage and minimal activity to avoid predators rather than combat capability. They possessed some defensive adaptations, but nothing that would normally allow advancement to Transcendent rank.\nFor one to reach that level represented a serious anomaly. Either it had consumed extraordinary resources, possessed unusual bloodline mutation, or had survived long enough through pure luck to accumulate sufficient soul power for rank advancement.\nRegardless of how it happened, a Transcendent-rank sloth was genuinely powerful and potentially very dangerous despite its species’ typically docile nature.\n\"I’ll handle this one myself,\" I decided, wanting to assess its capabilities.\nWe approached carefully until the creature came into view - hanging from a massive tree branch about fifteen meters above the forest floor. It looked deceptively harmless, its fur mossy and overgrown with plant matter that provided natural camouflage. But the Transcendent aura was unmistakable, pressing against my senses with that distinctive pressure.\nThe moment we stepped into its awareness range, the sloth moved.\nNot with the legendary slowness its species was known for, but with shocking speed that belied every stereotype about these creatures.\nMassive claws that could tear through stone extended as it launched from the tree directly toward me, moving faster than many Elite-rank predators could manage.\nBut I was ready.\nSLASH!\nMy sword left its sheath in one fluid motion, blood enhancement flooding my muscles with power as I met the charging beast head-on. I didn’t bother with complex tactics or elaborate techniques - just pure swordsmanship refined through countless hours of practice and enhanced by supernatural physique.\nThe sloth’s claws met my blade and were deflected aside with superior technique. I used its own momentum against it, redirecting the force while simultaneously positioning for the killing strike.\nOne clean strike severed the sloth’s head from its body before it could recover from the deflected attack. The Transcendent beast fell dead before it even realized the fight was over, its body collapsing to the forest floor with a heavy thud.\nTotal combat duration took less than one minute.\n[Transcendent-rank soul power absorbed]",

      "content": "Chapter 180: New Aspect\nI sheathed my sword calmly, the entire sequence having been executed in a way that made it appear almost effortless.\nBehind me, I heard Changing Star’s impressed chirping and sensed Kael’s shocked reaction through the sudden silence.\nI turned to find both of them staring at me with obvious amazement.\n\"That was...\" Kael started, then trailed off, apparently unable to find appropriate words.\nChirp chirp!\nChanging Star’s vocalizations carried clear admiration, her tail swishing with excitement at having witnessed the display.\n\"You killed a Transcendent beast in seconds,\" Kael finally managed. \"Just with... your body and sword skills.\"\n\"Pure fundamentals,\" I finished. \"Strength, speed, technique, and positioning. Sometimes the most effective approach is the simplest one.\"\nKojiro nodded with professional approval. \"Clean execution, Master. The deflection-counter combination was textbook perfect, and the killing strike showed no wasted motion or energy.\"\nIt was a good reminder for both Kael and Changing Star to witness. Flashy abilities and special powers had their place, but fundamental combat excellence - refined through discipline and practice - remained devastatingly effective regardless of circumstances.\n\"Remember this,\" I told them both. \"Magic and special abilities are tools, but your foundation is physical capability and technique mastery. Never neglect the basics in favor of flashy powers.\"\nKael nodded seriously, clearly taking the lesson to heart.\nChanging Star tilted her head thoughtfully, then approached the sloth’s corpse and began investigating it with obvious interest in consuming more Transcendent-rank prey.\n\"Go ahead,\" I permitted.\n----\nChanging Star needed no further encouragement. She immediately began devouring the Transcendent-rank sloth with enthusiastic appetite, her enhanced jaw strength tearing through flesh and bone that would have resisted normal predators. The Devour skill was working overtime, processing the powerful essence contained within Transcendent-rank meat.\nWhile she ate, I surveyed the surrounding forest with enhanced senses. The night was still young - we’d only been hunting for a few hours, and I hadn’t yet accumulated sufficient soul power to push meaningfully toward peak-Elite rank. More hunting was necessary if I wanted to maximize tonight’s expedition.\nTranscendent beasts were scarce compared to lower-rank prey, but they were out here. The recent aggressive behavior patterns meant more powerful creatures were active than usual, which created opportunity alongside danger.\nOnce Changing Star finished her meal and looked satisfied, we pressed deeper into the forest. Kojiro ranged ahead as scout while I kept Kael and Changing Star close enough for immediate support if needed.\nThe forest grew darker and denser as we ventured into territories where only the strong survived. Large trees blocked moonlight almost completely, creating an atmosphere of primal danger that made even experienced awakeners cautious.\nAfter nearly thirty minutes of careful advancement, Kojiro returned with a hand signal that meant significant threat detected.\n\"Four Transcendent presences ahead,\" he reported quietly. \"Pack hunters, coordinating their movements. Based on behavior patterns, likely Steel-Fang Wolves - evolved variants of wolves with metallic hide enhancement.\"\nFour Transcendents working together. That was slightly dangerous even for me if they were mid-tier or higher, and represented serious overkill for Kael and Changing Star operating alone.\n\"Perfect,\" I said, drawing my sword. \"Changing Star and I will engage directly. Kael, you provide support from range - ice manipulation to create tactical advantages, restrict movement, exploit openings. Don’t try to fight them head-on.\"\n\"Understood,\" Kael confirmed, already channeling ice mana in preparation.\nI looked at Kojiro. \"Stay within range to extract Kael if things go wrong. He’s the most vulnerable in this fight.\"\n\"Acknowledged, Master.\"\nWe approached the detected threat carefully until the pack came into view - four massive wolves with fur that seemed to have metallic sheen, each one easily the size of a small horse. Their coordination was immediately apparent as they spread into tactical formation the moment they detected us.\nPack hunters with Transcendent intelligence. They wouldn’t make this easy.\nHOWL!\nThe alpha wolf signaled, and all four launched into synchronized assault from different angles - classic pack tactics designed to overwhelm through simultaneous pressure from multiple directions.\nBut they were dealing with two Transcendent-rank opponents now, not helpless prey.\nChanging Star and I split immediately, each taking two wolves to prevent them from concentrating force. Her draconic agility allowed her to engage the pair moving toward the left flank while I intercepted the right pair with blade already moving.\nMy sword met the first wolf’s bite attempt, deflecting its metal-hard fangs with enhanced strength before countering with a precise slash across its shoulder. Blood Enhancement flooded my muscles with power while Royal-rank footwork kept me positioned perfectly between both opponents.\nBehind me, I heard Changing Star engaging her pair with ferocity - frost breath colliding with steel hide, claws tearing through enhanced defenses, instincts guiding every movement.\nKael’s ice manipulation created frozen patches across the battlefield, disrupting the wolves’ mobility and preventing them from executing coordinated charges effectively. Icicle projectiles launched toward eyes and joints, forcing defensive reactions that created openings.\n\"Good support!\" I called out while engaging both wolves simultaneously.\nThe Steel-Fang Wolves were powerful - their metallic hide resisted casual strikes, their speed was high, and their pack coordination meant they covered each other’s vulnerabilities effectively.\nBut I had advantages they couldn’t match, a supreme bloodline and an overlord secret art.\nMy swordsmanship was honed through countless hours of practice and actual combat experience. Every strike targeted vulnerable points - joints, eyes, throat, belly - places where even metal-enhanced hide showed weakness. Blood manipulation enhanced not just strength but also reaction speed, allowing me to respond to pack tactics faster than they expected.\nWhen one wolf lunged for my exposed back while I engaged its partner, I used footwork to pivot at the last instant, making them collide with each other instead. The momentary confusion created the opening I needed.\nSLASH! PENETRATE! KILL!\nMy blade found the first wolf’s throat in a perfectly executed strike that severed major blood vessels despite the metal-hard fur. It collapsed with a dying howl, soul power already beginning to flow into me.\nThe second wolf, seeing its packmate fall, became more desperate and aggressive. It charged with reckless abandon, abandoning tactical caution for raw fury.\nI used its momentum against it exactly as I had with the sloth, deflecting the charge and following with a killing strike that removed its head cleanly.\nI immediately pivoted to assist Changing Star, but found she’d already eliminated one of her opponents and was finishing the second with brutal efficiency. Her frost breath flash-froze the wolf’s legs, immobilizing it, before she closed distance and tore out its throat with dragon fangs.\nThe final wolf fell, and sudden silence returned to the forest battlefield.\nFour Transcendent beasts eliminated in approximately five minutes of coordinated combat. Kael stood at safe distance, breathing heavily from the mana expenditure but unharmed thanks to Kojiro’s protective positioning.\nChanging Star looked energized rather than tired, her draconic constitution apparently thriving on combat intensity. She immediately began investigating the corpses with obvious interest in more food.\nI felt the accumulated soul power settling into my core - four Transcendent kills providing substantial essence that pushed me noticeably closer to peak-Elite rank. The progress was tangible, my foundation strengthening with each absorption.\nThen something unexpected happened.\nA new notification appeared in my consciousness:\n[Aspect: Swift Essence]\n[Rank: Transcendent]\n[Effect: Permanently enhances movement speed by 10%. This bonus applies to all forms of motion including combat speed, reaction time, and travel velocity. Passive ability, always active.]\nI paused, processing this new development. Aspects were rare bonuses that awakeners could occasionally acquire from defeated powerful enemies - permanent enhancements that transcended normal cultivation advancement. They were essentially distilled characteristics taken from prey and integrated into the hunter’s own capabilities.\nA 10% speed increase didn’t sound dramatic, but in combat where milliseconds determined life or death, that advantage was genuinely significant. Combined with my existing Blood Enhancement and Royal-rank footwork, this would push my mobility into territory that few high-Elite awakeners could match.\n\"Everything alright?\" Kael asked, noticing my momentary stillness.\n\"Better than alright,\" I replied, testing the new enhancement with a few experimental movements. \"I just gained an aspect from those kills. Speed enhancement.\"\nHis eyes widened. \"An aspect? Those are incredibly rare! I’ve heard some awakeners go entire careers without acquiring even one!\"\n\"Consider it good fortune,\" I said, though privately I suspected the system might have influenced the drop rate. Four Transcendent kills yielding an aspect was unusually lucky by normal standards.\nKojiro approached the fallen wolves, examining them with professional interest. \"Steel-Fang Wolves are valuable for material harvesting. Their metallic hide can be processed into armor and weapon components.\"\n\"Harvest what’s practical to carry,\" I decided. \"The rest Changing Star can consume.\"\nWhile Kojiro efficiently removed valuable materials - fangs, claws, hide sections - Changing Star began her increasingly familiar routine of devouring Transcendent flesh with enthusiastic appetite. Her growth rate was already remarkable, and feeding her multiple Transcendent corpses in one night would likely trigger another visible size increase.\nFour Transcendent kills plus the earlier sloth meant I’d absorbed five Transcendent-rank essences tonight. That was substantial progress, though still not quite enough to push me over the threshold into peak-Elite.",

      "content": "Chapter 181: Large Mammoth\n\"How much longer are we hunting?\" Kael asked, clearly tired but trying to maintain readiness.\nI considered the question while watching Changing Star eat. Dawn was still several hours away, but pushing too hard risked exhaustion that would compromise safety.\n\"One more encounter if we find appropriate prey,\" I decided. \"Then we extract and return to the mansion before sunrise.\"\nChirp!\nChanging Star’s enthusiastic response suggested she was ready for more hunting despite having already fought multiple battles.\nThat dragon’s stamina was truly absurd.\n\"Rest while she eats,\" I told Kael. \"Recover your mana and prepare for potentially one more engagement.\"\nHe nodded gratefully and sat down to meditate, channeling breathing techniques to accelerate recovery.\nI stood watch while my team recovered, the Swift Essence aspect already making my perception feel sharper as enhanced reaction time allowed faster processing of sensory information.\nTonight had been highly productive. Soul power gains, combat experience for my allies, and now a permanent speed enhancement that would serve me for the rest of my life.\nIf we could find one more strong target before dawn, this would rank among my most successful hunting expeditions yet.\n------\nAfter Changing Star finished consuming her fill and Kael recovered his mana reserves, we pressed deeper into the forest in search of one final worthy opponent before returning home.\nKojiro ranged ahead as scout, venturing into territories where only the strongest beasts established domains. When he returned after fifteen minutes, his expression carried unusual seriousness.\n\"Master, I’ve located a significant threat. Transcendent Mammoth, mid-tier based on aura density. It’s alone but extremely powerful.\"\nI felt a spark of interest mixed with caution. Mid-tier Transcendent meant it was roughly halfway between low and high Transcendent rank - substantially stronger than anything we’d encountered tonight. That would be genuinely challenging even for me.\n\"Perfect. That’s exactly what I need.\"\n\"Adrian, are you sure?\" Kael asked with obvious concern. \"Mid-tier Transcendent is...\"\n\"Dangerous, yes. But necessary if I want to reach peak-Elite rank tonight.\" I checked my equipment and prepared mentally. \"You three stay back and observe.\"\nChanging Star made a concerned chirping sound, clearly wanting to help despite recognizing the threat level exceeded what she should engage.\n\"I know, but this one’s mine,\" I told her gently. \"Watch and learn.\"\nWe approached carefully until the creature came into view, and I understood immediately why Kojiro had emphasized the threat level.\nThe Transcendent Mammoth was absolutely massive - easily five meters tall at the shoulder with tusks that could impale a building. Its hide looked thick enough to stop most weapons, and the mid-tier Transcendent aura radiating from it pressed against my senses like physical weight.\nThis wasn’t prey that could be dispatched in seconds. This was a genuine fight.\nThe moment I stepped into its territory, the mammoth bellowed a territorial challenge that shook the surrounding forest.\nROOOAAAAR!\nI responded by drawing my sword and flooding my body with Blood Enhancement at maximum output. The Swift Essence aspect activated automatically, sharpening my perception and reaction speed by that critical ten percent. Every advantage would matter in this engagement.\nThe mammoth launched forward despite its massive size, moving with shocking speed as it lowered those enormous tusks toward me in a devastating charge.\nWhoosh!\nI activated the Royal-rank footwork, my enhanced speed allowing me to dodge aside at the last possible moment. The mammoth’s charge carried it past my position with unstoppable momentum, its tusks missing by centimeters.\nSlash!\nI counter-attacked immediately, my blade striking the mammoth’s flank as it passed. The steel connected but barely penetrated - that hide was incredibly thick, requiring far more force than normal Transcendent beasts to damage meaningfully.\nThe mammoth wheeled around with surprising agility for something so large, its trunk swinging toward me like a massive club.\nWHOOSH! IMPACT!\nI raised my arms defensively and activated Stone Echo just before impact. The trunk connected with devastating force, but the stone armor absorbed most of the kinetic energy. I still flew backward several meters from the sheer power, but avoided serious injury.\nThud!\nI landed and immediately rolled aside as the mammoth’s foot crashed down where I’d been a moment before. The ground crater formed from the impact showed what would have happened to my body.\nThis beast wasn’t just strong - it was fast, intelligent, and knew how to use its massive frame as a weapon.\nSlash! Slash! Dodge!\nI engaged in a deadly dance, attacking vulnerable points whenever openings appeared while constantly moving to avoid the mammoth’s devastating counter-attacks. My blade work targeted eyes, joints, the softer hide near the belly - anywhere that offered hope of meaningful damage.\nBut progress was frustratingly slow. The mammoth’s natural defenses were extraordinary, and its combat experience showed in how it protected vulnerabilities while pressing offense relentlessly.\nI needed more power.\nActivate: Silent Predator\nMy presence suddenly diminished, becoming harder for the mammoth to track accurately. The aspect that masked my killing intent created momentary confusion in the beast’s responses, making its attacks slightly less precise.\nSlash!\nI exploited the confusion to land a deeper strike across the mammoth’s front leg, finally drawing substantial blood. The creature bellowed in pain and rage, its attacks becoming more aggressive and less controlled.\nThe massive trunk swung with enough force to shatter stone, but Silent Predator’s masking effect combined with Swift Essence’s speed boost allowed me to slip past the attack and strike the extended limb.\nSlash!\nAnother wound opened, blood flowing from the damaged trunk. The mammoth was accumulating injuries now, but it was still far from defeated.\nCHARGE! DESPERATE!\nThe beast launched another full-power charge, apparently deciding to crush me through overwhelming force regardless of damage taken.\nThis was it - the moment requiring my strongest technique.\nActivate: Null Strike\nI channeled the ability through my blade, feeling the defensive-negating power flow into the steel. This technique ignored physical resistances and armor, striking directly at the target’s life force.\nWHOOSH!\nI used footwork to slip aside from the charging mammoth at the last instant, positioning perfectly for a counter-strike at its exposed side as it passed.\nSLASH!\nNull Strike activated blade connected with the mammoth’s ribcage, and this time the technique lived up to its reputation. The strike penetrated far deeper than normal, bypassing the thick hide entirely and damaging vital organs beneath.\nThe mammoth screamed and wheeled around, but I could see the critical damage had registered. Its movements were less coordinated now, breathing labored from internal injury.\nBut it wasn’t done yet.\nThe massive trunk wrapped around my torso before I could fully dodge, lifting me off the ground with crushing pressure. Stone Echo activated reflexively, stone armor forming to prevent immediate death from the constriction.\nCrack!\nEven with the protection, I felt ribs threatening to break from the overwhelming pressure. The mammoth was trying to crush me to death, and despite my defenses, it might succeed.\nActivate: Null Strike\nI twisted my sword arm despite the constriction and drove the blade into the trunk holding me, channeling another Null Strike through the weapon.\nThe defensive-ignoring strike pierced deep into the trunk’s flesh, causing such intense pain that the mammoth reflexively released its grip. I fell and immediately rolled away, gasping for breath despite Stone Echo having prevented the worst of the damage.\nNo time to fully recover. The mammoth was preparing another attack, and I was running low on stamina from the extended high-intensity combat.\nThe wounded beast launched what appeared to be a last desperate charge, throwing everything into one final attempt to kill the persistent threat that had caused so much pain.\nI set my stance, gathering power for one more Null Strike - my third of the fight. Using the technique this frequently was draining, but this needed to end now.\nWHOOSH!\nThe mammoth closed distance with terrifying speed despite its injuries. I waited, watching its approach, timing the moment perfectly.\nI dodged aside at the absolute last instant, using Royal-rank footwork to position perfectly at the mammoth’s exposed side as it committed fully to the charge with no ability to change direction.\nActivate: Null Strike - Maximum Power\nI channeled everything into this strike - Blood Enhancement at full output, all my physical strength, perfect technique execution, and the defensive-negating power of Null Strike flowing through the blade.\nSLASH!\nThe sword struck the mammoth’s side at the exact vulnerable point where ribs met belly, driving deep into vital organs with power that ignored all physical resistance. The blade penetrated so deep it emerged partially from the opposite side.\nThe Transcendent Mammoth’s charge faltered, momentum carrying it forward several more meters before its legs gave out completely. It crashed to the ground with earth-shaking impact, blood pooling rapidly from the catastrophic wound.\nFinal breath... stillness... death.\nThe massive beast exhaled one last time and went completely still, its mid-tier Transcendent aura fading as life left its body.\n[Transcendent-rank soul power absorbed]\nBut this wasn’t a normal Transcendent kill - this was mid-tier, containing substantially more essence than the earlier prey.\nThe soul power flooded into me with overwhelming intensity, far more concentrated and potent than previous absorptions. I felt my foundation shake as the massive influx of essence pushed against my current rank limitations.\n[Advancement Complete: Peak-Elite Rank Achieved]",

      "content": "Chapter 182: Peak Elite Rank\nEnergy surged through every cell of my body as the advancement took hold. My muscles restructured to handle greater power output. My mana channels expanded to accommodate increased flow. My very essence condensed and refined to peak-Elite density.\nThe transformation lasted perhaps thirty seconds, but when it completed, I felt fundamentally stronger than moments before.\nI stood there breathing heavily, my body covered in sweat and minor injuries from the intense fight, but victorious and measurably stronger.\nBehind me, I heard Changing Star’s excited chirping and Kael’s amazed exclamation.\n\"You actually killed a mid-tier Transcendent!\" Kael said with obvious awe. \"And you just advanced rank right here!\"\nI smiled tiredly, sheathing my blade and allowing the various enhancement aspects to deactivate. \"That’s what we came here for.\"\nKojiro approached with professional assessment. \"Excellent combat execution, Master. The final strike combination was perfectly timed.\"\nI nodded acknowledgment, then looked at the massive mammoth corpse. \"Changing Star, this one’s all yours. Eat well.\"\nRAWR!\nShe needed no further encouragement, immediately approaching the enormous feast with dragon enthusiasm.\nI sat down heavily, allowing myself to rest while she ate. The fight had been genuinely challenging, pushing me to use multiple cards and nearly getting crushed in the process.\nBut I’d won, advanced to peak-Elite rank, and accumulated the power necessary for the next phase of my development.\nNow I just needed to reach Transcendent rank to unlock Carmilla’s second secret art stance.\n--------\nAs we headed back toward the city in the pre-dawn darkness, I glanced at Changing Star sleeping peacefully beside me in the carriage. After that massive devouring session - consuming most of a mid-tier Transcendent mammoth - she’d started growing drowsy, her eyes gradually closing despite her best efforts to stay alert. Eventually she’d succumbed completely to sleep, curled up on the carriage seat with her tail wrapped around herself and soft purring indicating contentment.\nKael sat across from us, also exhausted from the night’s intensive hunting but forcing himself to stay awake. Kojiro had returned to card form to conserve energy, leaving just the three of us in the quiet carriage as it rolled through empty streets.\nI took the opportunity to review my system inventory, checking the various items I’d accumulated from the past week’s daily rewards. The system had been surprisingly generous lately, providing a steady stream of useful equipment and resources.\nSeveral enhanced weapons occupied inventory slots - a backup sword with sharpness enchantments, a dagger with poison coating capabilities, a spear with penetration bonuses. I kept these as emergency equipment or potential gifts for allies who needed better gear.\nDefensive items included a cloak with physical damage reduction, boots that enhanced jumping ability, and gloves that improved grip strength. Nothing spectacular, but all useful for specific situations.\nThe most valuable items were the healing potions - three of them, each one graded as Rare quality. These weren’t common academy medical supplies but genuine high-grade alchemical creations capable of healing grievous wounds within minutes. At my current rank, one of these potions could probably regenerate a severed limb or repair catastrophic internal damage. I intended to keep them strictly for life-threatening emergencies when conventional healing wouldn’t suffice.\nBut today’s daily reward was what truly surprised me.\nThe notification had appeared before, but only during the carriage ride, and I’d claimed it.\n[Congratulations! You have received: Ragnar’s Hammer]\n[Grade: Superior]\n[Details: The first smithing hammer that was once wielded by Ragnar the Forgemaster, an ancient dwarf craftsman whose works were said to rival the best of artifacts. This hammer enhances the wielder’s blacksmithing capabilities significantly, allowing them to work with materials that would normally be too difficult to shape and imbuing creations with superior durability and magical conductivity. The hammer itself is nearly indestructible and can be used as both crafting tool and devastating melee weapon when necessary.]\nI stared at the description with growing appreciation. A superior blacksmithing tool that enhanced crafting capabilities and could double as a weapon - that was genuinely valuable for someone pursuing both combat and engineering advancement.\nThe timing was particularly apt given my recent smartphone development and plans to expand into more complex magical engineering projects. Having superior crafting tools would accelerate that work significantly.\nI manifested the hammer briefly to examine it - the weapon appeared in my hand with substantial weight, its head carved with intricate runic patterns that seemed to shift when observed directly. The craftsmanship was extraordinary, clearly the work of a master who understood both function and artistry.\n\"What’s that?\" Kael asked, noticing the sudden appearance of the ornate hammer.\n\"A new crafting tool,\" I explained, dismissing it back to inventory. \"Will be useful for blacksmithing projects.\"\nHe nodded tiredly, not pressing for details about where I’d acquired such an item.\n---\nArriving at the mansion as morning light began filtering through the windows, I carefully carried the sleeping Changing Star up to her designated room and placed her gently on the large magical cushion she’d claimed as her favorite resting spot. She barely stirred, completely exhausted from the night’s hunting and the massive amount of Transcendent-rank essence she was currently digesting.\nDespite the intensive combat and extended hunting expedition, I felt almost completely recovered already. My vampire physiology’s regenerative capabilities were remarkable. The supernatural constitution combined with vampiric bloodline advantages meant my recovery speed far exceeded human limitations.\nRather than sleeping, I found myself energized and eager to test the new crafting tool I’d received.\nI made my way to the mansion’s blacksmithing workshop - a well-equipped facility I’d established in one of the basement chambers specifically for private engineering projects. The room contained a proper forge, anvil, tool racks, material storage, and workspace large enough for complex fabrication.\nI manifested Ragnar’s Hammer, feeling its substantial weight and examining the intricate runic patterns covering the hammerhead. The craftsmanship was extraordinary, and I could sense the magical enhancement flowing through the tool even before using it.\n\"Time to test what you can do,\" I murmured, setting the hammer aside momentarily while I prepared materials and reviewed my project plans.\nThe crossbow.",

      "content": "Chapter 183: Mark II Crossbow\nEver since its release several weeks ago, the weapon had taken the kingdom by storm. Sales had exploded beyond even my optimistic projections as both military organizations and private awakeners recognized its tactical value. The ability to deliver powerful ranged attacks without requiring years of archery training made it appealing to everyone from city guards to merchant company security forces.\nOur family’s reputation had soared immensely on the back of this success. The Blackwood name, already prestigious due to ducal status, had gained new recognition as innovators and thinkers rather than just traditional nobility. And more practically, our income had increased dramatically.\nThe crossbow sales had reached cumulative revenue of nearly one million golden coins in just a short span - an astronomical sum that represented genuine wealth even by royal standards. Market analysis suggested sales would continue climbing as production scaled and distribution networks expanded further.\nThe engineers and blacksmiths working on production had been begging me for days to create an improved version. The current model was good, but everyone recognized that refinement and enhancement would capture additional market segments willing to pay premium prices for superior performance.\nNaturally, I held exclusive rights to any improvements or modifications. I’d claimed ownership of the core design through family patent systems, ensuring that nobody could legally build enhanced versions without my explicit authorization.\nEven though improving the crossbow would be relatively simple given my knowledge and capabilities, I’d allowed absolutely nobody else to attempt it - not even our family’s master blacksmiths who had decades of experience and unquestionable loyalty.\nNot because I didn’t trust them with the work. Their skill and discretion were beyond question.\nBut because this was my bread and butter. This was what helped me improve my crafting abilities, test new techniques, and push the boundaries of what magical engineering could achieve in this world. And fundamentally, these were my creations - well, not really since I’d essentially stolen the concepts from Earth’s technological development, but they were still my implementations in this world, my contributions to its advancement.\nThe intellectual property and creative process belonged to me, and I intended to keep it that way.\nI began laying out materials systematically, planning the improved crossbow’s specifications.\nThe original model had used relatively common materials - decent steel for the bow mechanism, standard wood for the stock, basic enchantments for durability and power enhancement. Not because I couldn’t make it better, but because for its price point, that was exactly what customers should receive. The weapon needed to be affordable enough for mass adoption while still profitable to produce.\nNow I was making something different. A premium model - the Mark II Crossbow that would target elite awakeners and powerful forces rather than general market consumers.\nThis version would use superior materials throughout. High-grade steel alloys for the mechanism that could handle significantly greater tension forces. Enchanted wood from magical trees that wouldn’t warp or crack under stress. Advanced runic arrays that enhanced both power output and accuracy. Improved trigger mechanisms for smoother operation.\nMost importantly, dramatically increased penetration power.\nThe original crossbow could reliably kill Noble-rank beasts and weaker Elite-rank opponents. Useful for common threats, but insufficient against genuinely dangerous enemies.\nThe Mark II would be capable of killing peak-Elite rank targets and potentially even low Transcendent opponents if the shot placement was perfect and the target wasn’t heavily armored. That represented a fundamental leap in lethality that would justify premium pricing and attract serious professional buyers.\nI activated the forge and began heating metal stock to working temperature while reviewing the mechanical design improvements I’d planned.\nThe bow mechanism needed reinforcement to handle higher tension without deforming. I’d use a composite layered approach - multiple thin strips of enhanced steel bonded together rather than single-piece construction. This would provide superior strength-to-weight ratio and allow the mechanism to store more energy without adding excessive bulk.\nThe trigger assembly required precision manufacturing to ensure smooth, consistent release even under high-tension conditions. I’d incorporate ball bearing components and carefully balanced springs to achieve professional-grade performance.\nThe stock needed both structural integrity and ergonomic refinement. I’d shape it from Ironwood - a magical tree species with density approaching metal while retaining wood’s workability. Enchantments would further enhance durability and provide minor recoil dampening, but that wasn’t my field.\nClang! Strike! Shape!\nI began working the heated metal with Ragnar’s Hammer, and immediately felt the difference compared to standard tools. Each strike landed with perfect weight distribution, the hammer seemingly guiding my hand toward optimal impact points. The metal responded beautifully, shaping faster and more precisely than I’d achieved with conventional equipment.\n\"This is incredible,\" I muttered, watching as complex curves formed with minimal effort.\nThe legendary hammer wasn’t just a tool - it was almost like having a master craftsman’s muscle memory transferred directly into my hands. Techniques I’d struggled with before suddenly felt natural and intuitive.\nClang! Clang! Clang!\nI lost myself in the rhythm of creation, hours passing as I fabricated each component with obsessive attention to detail. The bow mechanism took shape with mechanical precision that would have been impossible using standard equipment. The trigger assembly came together with watchmaker-level accuracy. The stock was carved and shaped into ergonomic perfection.\nBetween metalworking sessions while components cooled, I inscribed enchantment arrays using specialized tools and magical inks. The patterns were far more complex than the original crossbow’s simple durability enhancement - these arrays would increase projectile velocity, improve accuracy through minor trajectory correction, and enhance penetration against magical defenses.\nI incorporated knowledge from both Earth’s physics understanding and this world’s magical engineering principles, creating hybrid designs that leveraged advantages from both systems.\nThe sun had fully risen and was approaching noon when I finally assembled all components into the completed weapon.\nThe Mark II Crossbow was noticeably more refined than its predecessor. Sleeker lines, superior materials visible in every component, and an aura of lethal capability that the original model lacked. This was a weapon for serious professionals, not general market consumers.\nI loaded a test bolt - also improved with reinforced shaft and enchanted tip - and aimed at the reinforced target I’d set up at the workshop’s far end.\nClick... THWACK!",

      "content": "Chapter 184: Mark II Crossbow [2]\nThe crossbow fired with smooth precision, the bolt crossing the distance almost faster than my enhanced perception could track. It struck the target dead center and penetrated so deeply that the reinforced materials barely slowed it.\n\"Perfect,\" I said with satisfaction, examining the results.\nThis weapon could genuinely threaten peak-Elite opponents and possibly harm low Transcendents if circumstances favored the shooter. Combined with the original model’s ease of use, this represented a revolutionary advancement in ranged combat capabilities.\nThe Mark II would command premium pricing - probably five to ten times the original model’s cost - but elite awakeners and military special forces would pay gladly for this level of performance. Of course, this was going to be for my family’s experienced team to decide.\nI set the completed crossbow aside carefully and began planning the production specifications. Unlike the mass-market original, this premium model would be limited production with stringent quality control. Each weapon would be individually crafted rather than assembly-line manufactured.\nRagnar’s Hammer had proven its worth spectacularly. What would have taken days of painstaking work with conventional tools, I’d completed in hours with superior results.\nThe legendary crafting tool would accelerate all my future projects dramatically.\n---\nThe second day of the arena tournament arrived with clear skies and an atmosphere of heightened anticipation. I made my way to the massive amphitheater early, wanting to review the day’s bracket postings before the crowds became overwhelming.\nYesterday’s preliminary rounds had narrowed the field from hundreds down to sixty-four competitors. Today would be even more selective - by the end of these matches, only sixteen students would remain in contention for the championship.\nEach surviving competitor would face two fights today, which meant the intensity and difficulty would escalate dramatically compared to yesterday’s relatively straightforward matchups.\nThe bracket postings were displayed on large enchanted boards near the arena entrance, updated magically as soon as the random drawing concluded. Students clustered around them, searching for their names and analyzing potential opponents.\nI pushed through the crowd to examine the listings.\nThe chance of fighting classmates increased rapidly as the pool narrowed. With only sixty-four students remaining and the Elite class representing a significant portion of that number, facing familiar opponents became statistically likely.\nThough I doubted anyone apart from Emmet would willingly engage me with genuine competitive intent. Most students recognized the capability gap and would either fight defensively hoping to avoid humiliation, or approach it as a learning experience rather than serious contest.\nMy eyes scanned the bracket systematically, noting key matchups:\nKyle Reinhardt vs Jason Mark\nJason Mark was a powerful student from one of the lower-tier classes who had made it this far through solid fundamentals and determination. His advancement to the round of sixty-four was genuinely impressive given his starting disadvantages. But facing Kyle meant his tournament run would almost certainly end today.\nEmmet Stone vs Richard Thorne\nRichard was from Kyle’s class - one of the stronger Elite students with respectable combat capabilities. This would be more competitive than Emmet’s previous matches, though I still expected Emmet to win.\nElen Brightwater vs Catherine Wells\nCatherine was from our class, a mage like Elen. This matchup favored Elen significantly, though Catherine’s familiarity with Elen’s capabilities might create complications.\nThen I found my own name, and immediately understood why the surrounding students were murmuring with excitement.\nAdrian Blackwood vs Seraphina Rosewood\nThe moment that matchup had been posted, the crowd had erupted. Even now, students were discussing it with obvious enthusiasm, recognizing this as potentially the most significant fight of the entire tournament.\n\"The uncrowned king versus the uncrowned queen,\" someone said nearby with anticipation.\n\"Both from ducal families, both ridiculously powerful. This is going to be incredible.\"\n\"I heard Adrian and Seraphina had a past together, I wonder how this fight will play out...It’s going to be epic!\"\n\"Her close combat is absurdly strong. But Adrian’s combat record is flawless, he also holds the record for the strongest attack in the entire history of the academy.\"\nThe unofficial titles made me grimace slightly - \"uncrowned king of the academy\" was flattering but cringe. Still, I understood why students viewed the matchup this way.\nBoth Seraphina and I represented the absolute top tier of first-year capabilities. Both came from ducal families with prestigious bloodlines and superior resources. Both had dominated every previous encounter. And neither had faced a truly challenging opponent yet in this tournament.\nThe arena filled rapidly as the scheduled start time approached. The atmosphere carried electric anticipation, students and faculty alike recognizing that today’s matches would be far more competitive than yesterday’s preliminary rounds.\nHeadmaster Aldric Thornhaven took his position at the central platform, his King-rank presence commanding immediate attention as the crowd settled.\n\"Welcome to day two of the First-Year Arena Tournament,\" he began with formal gravity. \"Yesterday, we witnessed the determination and capability of our students as they fought to advance. Today, the competition intensifies. Sixty-four have become your elite survivors. By day’s end, only sixteen will remain.\"\nHe paused, allowing the significance to resonate.\n\"The bracket has been randomly determined through impartial magical drawing. Some matchups may seem fortunate, others challenging. Such is the nature of competition - adapting to circumstances beyond your control separates the merely skilled from the truly exceptional.\"\nHis gaze swept across the assembled students.\n\"Several particularly notable matchups will occur today. I encourage all spectators to observe carefully - you will witness the future elite of this kingdom demonstrating their capabilities.\"\nThe Headmaster’s eyes lingered briefly on certain sections where I, Seraphina, Kyle, and other top competitors were positioned. He clearly recognized which fights would draw the most attention.\n\"The tournament will proceed with multiple rings operating simultaneously for efficiency. However, certain high-profile matches will be featured in the primary arena to allow proper observation.\"\nThat meant my fight with Seraphina would almost certainly be showcased rather than relegated to a side ring. Maximum visibility, maximum pressure, maximum opportunity to impress or fail spectacularly.\n\"Competitors, prepare yourselves with honor and discipline. Spectators, appreciate the dedication these students have demonstrated. Let the second day commence!\"\nThe crowd erupted with applause and excited conversation as students began moving toward their designated rings.",

      "content": "Chapter 185: Tournament\nThe tournament began with multiple combat rings operating simultaneously to process the large bracket efficiently. I positioned myself where I could observe several key matches while waiting for my own fight with Seraphina, which had been scheduled for later in the day to maximize spectator attendance.\nKyle Reinhardt vs Jason Mark - Ring Two\nKyle’s match drew considerable attention despite not being the headline fight. Of course, his power and status in the academy was known.\nPeople wanted to see how he’d handle his next opponent, even though they knew that he would win.\nJason Mark entered the ring with visible determination, clearly aware he was the underdog but refusing to be intimidated. He was a solid fighter - good fundamentals, respectable combat instincts, and the mental fortitude required to advance this far despite coming from a lower-tier class.\nThe referee signaled start, and both competitors engaged immediately.\nClash! Strike! Exchange!\nJason fought intelligently, using defensive positioning and tactical retreats to avoid Kyle’s superior speed and technique. He wasn’t trying to win through overwhelming offense - instead, he was attempting to frustrate Kyle’s rhythm and create opportunities through patience and precision.\nFor the first few minutes, the strategy appeared somewhat effective. Jason managed to avoid serious damage while landing occasional strikes that demonstrated he belonged in this tournament.\nBut Kyle was simply operating on a different level.\nAround the five-minute mark, Kyle shifted tactics because he began predicting Jason’s defensive movements with uncanny accuracy.\nEach exchange saw Kyle’s attacks coming closer to connecting despite Jason’s best evasive efforts. The pressure accumulated relentlessly until Jason made an inevitable mistake - overcommitting to a dodge that left him briefly off-balance.\nKyle exploited the opening instantly with a combination strike that broke through Jason’s guard and connected solidly with his chest, sending him sprawling backward.\nJason tried to recover and continue fighting, showing commendable resilience, but Kyle pressed the advantage without mercy. Three more rapid exchanges ended with Jason on the ground, unable to rise quickly enough to defend.\n\"Winner: Kyle Reinhardt!\"\nThe crowd applauded respectfully. Jason had fought well and lost honorably against a superior opponent. Kyle had demonstrated efficient dominance without revealing more capabilities than necessary - exactly the same calculated approach he’d used against Marcus.\nTotal fight duration: approximately eight minutes.\nKyle left the ring with barely a scratch, conserving energy for subsequent matches while providing minimal intelligence about his true limits.\nEmmet Stone vs Richard Thorne - Ring Four\nEmmet’s match began shortly after Kyle’s concluded, and I moved to observe from a better vantage point.\nRichard Thorne was genuinely skilled - one of the stronger students from Kyle’s Elite class with solid bloodline advantages and formal combat training. He wielded a sword with competent technique and approached the fight with tactical awareness rather than reckless aggression.\nUnfortunately for Richard, he was facing Emmet.\nThe referee signaled start, and Emmet moved with his characteristic silent intensity.\nEngage! Pressure! Dominate!\nWhat struck me immediately was how Emmet’s continued improving even since our last sparring session. His blade work was exceptionally refined - each strike precise, each defensive movement minimal, each tactical decision optimal.\nRichard fought admirably, using everything in his arsenal to create advantages. He attempted feints, tactical retreats, aggressive combinations, defensive counters - demonstrating versatility and adaptability.\nNone of it mattered.\nEmmet dismantled every strategy with his powerful bloodline and combat experience.\nClash! Deflect! Counter! Strike!\nThe fight lasted about two minutes.\nWhen Emmet finally decided to end it, the conclusion came swiftly. A perfect counter sequence that Richard couldn’t possibly defend against, followed by a precise strike to the chest that knocked him unconscious instantly.\n\"Winner: Emmet Stone!\"\nThe crowd’s applause carried genuine appreciation for the display of pure technical excellence.\nEmmet left the ring without visible emotion, his expression as stoic as ever. But I detected subtle satisfaction through his body language.\nElen Brightwater vs Catherine Wells - Ring Three\nElen’s match was the last of the three I observed before my own scheduled fight.\nCatherine Wells was from our class, which meant she’d witnessed Elen’s capabilities firsthand during training sessions and previous tournament matches. That familiarity could theoretically provide tactical advantages - knowing an opponent’s preferred techniques and common patterns allowed preparation of specific counters.\nIn practice, it didn’t help much.\nThe referee signaled start, and both water mages immediately began manipulating the moisture in the arena air.\nSurge! Clash! Control!\nWhat followed was essentially a demonstration of why Elen ranked first in theoretical knowledge. Her water manipulation was simply more refined, more efficient, more creative than Catherine’s competent but conventional approach.\nCatherine attempted various tactics - creating ice barriers for defense, launching pressurized water strikes for offense, manipulating humidity to disrupt Elen’s control. All textbook techniques, all properly executed.\nElen responded with innovations that showed her superior understanding of magical theory. She created water constructs with complex geometries that Catherine’s simpler techniques couldn’t effectively counter. She manipulated temperature gradients to create tactical advantages. She even demonstrated a technique I hadn’t seen before - using water vapor to refract light and create optical illusions that confused Catherine’s targeting.\nThe finishing sequence came when Elen created multiple simultaneous ice constructs that attacked from different angles, overwhelming Catherine’s ability to defend all directions at once. Frozen bindings wrapped around Catherine’s limbs, immobilizing her completely before a concentrated water strike knocked her unconscious.\n\"Winner: Elen Brightwater!\"\nThe crowd applauded enthusiastically. Elen had demonstrated both technical skill and tactical creativity, showing why she deserved her reputation as one of the tournament’s top contenders.\nShe left the ring looking satisfied but not overconfident, clearly aware that future opponents would be significantly more challenging than Catherine.\nThree matches, three victories for the expected favorites. Kyle, Emmet, and Elen had all advanced without serious difficulty, each demonstrating why they were considered elite-tier competitors.\nNow it was my turn.\nThe announcement echoed across the arena: \"Main ring - Adrian Blackwood versus Seraphina Rosewood! All spectators please direct attention to the primary arena!\"\nThe crowd’s energy shifted immediately, conversations intensifying as everyone moved to get the best view possible of what promised to be the day’s most significant fight.\nTime to face the uncrowned queen and see which of us deserved the title more.",

      "content": "Chapter 186: Seraphina Vs Adrian Blackwood\nI stepped into the primary arena as the crowd’s energy reached fever pitch. The main combat ring had been cleared specifically for this featured match, ensuring maximum visibility for what everyone anticipated would be the tournament’s most competitive fight so far.\nSeraphina entered from the opposite side, and I had to admit she cut an impressive figure. Her Valkyrie bloodline expressed itself clearly in her bearing - proud, martial, radiating the warrior spirit that legendary shieldmaidens were known for. She carried a double-bladed battle axe with the easy confidence of someone who’d trained with the weapon since childhood.\nThe crowd’s anticipation was palpable. Two ducal heirs, both at peak-Elite rank, both undefeated in the tournament so far. This was the matchup everyone had wanted to see.\nI noticed Kyle in the spectator section, watching intently. His expression carried possessive pride as he observed his girlfriend prepare for combat. He clearly expected her to win or at least put up an incredible fight.\nSeraphina’s eyes met mine across the arena, and I saw the calculation there. She was assessing, strategizing.\nAfter all, she’d dumped me specifically because she’d thought I was weak and lacked ambition.\nThe referee raised his hand. \"Competitors ready?\"\nWe both nodded.\n\"BEGIN!\"\nCHARGE! IMMEDIATE AGGRESSION!\nSeraphina exploded forward with Valkyrie-enhanced speed, her battle axe already swinging in a devastating arc designed to end fights quickly through overwhelming offense. The legendary bloodline granted her superior physical capabilities and martial instincts that made her naturally formidable in close combat.\nI didn’t retreat or dodge.\nCLASH!\nMy sword met her axe with Blood Enhancement flooding my muscles, the impact creating a shockwave that rippled across the arena floor. I deflected the strike aside with superior strength that clearly shocked her - her eyes widened momentarily as she realized I’d stopped her charge completely.\n\"You’ve gotten stronger, again.\" she acknowledged, immediately flowing into her next attack sequence.\nSWING!\nHer axe work was genuinely impressive - brutal efficiency combined with technical refinement that showed years of dedicated training. Each strike carried devastating power backed by Valkyrie bloodline enhancement, and her tactical positioning demonstrated combat intelligence beyond simple berserker fury.\nAgainst most opponents, she would be absolutely overwhelming.\nAgainst me, she was outmatched.\nI defended with minimal movement, my Supernatural Physique trait providing the foundation while Blood Enhancement amplified strength and speed to levels that exceeded her capabilities. The Swift Essence aspect made my reactions ten percent faster, allowing me to read her patterns and respond before attacks fully developed.\nI wasn’t using Null Strike, wasn’t activating Stone Echo, wasn’t even employing my half of my arsenal. Just physical enhancement and swordsmanship fundamentals refined through countless hours of practice.\nAnd it was enough. More than enough.\nMy blade work began systematically dismantling her offense. Each of her attacks was deflected or parried, and my counters started landing with increasing frequency. A cut across her shoulder. A strike against her ribs that made her grunt. A slash along her thigh that drew blood and affected her mobility.\n\"Fight back properly!\" she snarled, her Valkyrie pride clearly stung by being pushed onto the defensive.\n\"I am fighting properly,\" I replied calmly while deflecting another desperate combination. \"You’re just not strong enough to make me use anything more.\"\nHer expression twisted with fury and humiliation. The crowd’s murmuring grew louder as they realized this wasn’t the competitive showcase they’d anticipated - it was becoming a one-sided demonstration.\nSeraphina abandoned caution and threw everything into pure offense, her axe becoming a whirlwind of devastating strikes powered by maximum Valkyrie enhancement. The attacks came from every angle with brutal intensity that would have shredded most defenses.\nI matched her escalation effortlessly.\nMy sword moved with precision, deflecting each strike while simultaneously countering with attacks that accumulated damage relentlessly. More cuts appeared across her arms and torso. Her breathing grew labored as exhaustion and injury degraded her combat effectiveness.\nFrom the spectator section, I heard Kyle’s voice rising above the crowd noise.\n\"Seraphina! Focus! Use the that technique!\"\nShe heard him and attempted to execute what was apparently a special bloodline ability - a devastating overhead strike that channeled maximum power into a single blow designed to break through any defense.\nThe axe descended with enough force to crack the reinforced arena floor, her entire body behind the attack.\nI sidestepped, making her miss completely, then struck her exposed side with a powerful counter that sent her stumbling several meters.\n\"SERAPHINA!\" Kyle’s shout carried genuine alarm now as he watched his girlfriend being thoroughly dominated.\nShe recovered and charged again, refusing to yield despite the obvious capability gap. Her Valkyrie bloodline wouldn’t allow retreat - the legendary warrior spirit that made her formidable also created a fatal weakness.\nNever back down from a fight. Never surrender. Never show weakness even when outmatched.\nIt was a curse disguised as pride.\nShe kept attacking despite accumulating injuries, despite exhaustion making her movements sloppy, despite every tactical indicator screaming that continuing was futile. The Valkyrie bloodline compelled her forward, warrior instinct overriding rational assessment.\nI knew the truth even if the crowd didn’t - she literally couldn’t stop fighting until rendered unconscious or killed. The bloodline’s compulsion wouldn’t permit voluntary surrender.\n\"Kyle, stop the match!\" someone near him suggested as Seraphina’s condition deteriorated further.\n\"She can still win!\" he insisted, though his expression showed growing desperation. \"She just needs to land one good hit!\"\nBut that hit would never come.\nI continued methodically breaking down her defense and offense simultaneously. My strikes targeted specific points - nerve clusters to degrade mobility, joint strikes to reduce power output, precise cuts that accumulated blood loss without being immediately lethal.\nThis wasn’t brutality. This was precision designed to end the fight as efficiently as possible while minimizing permanent damage. Although, I didn’t like her as a character in the novel, she was still a powerful character that could change events in the future. Hurting her permanently was akin to killing a future ally that would protect this city.\nSeraphina’s axe grew heavier in her grip as strength faded. Her footwork became stumbling rather than tactical. Her eyes showed recognition that she was beaten, but the Valkyrie bloodline wouldn’t release its hold.\n\"Adrian...\" she gasped, still trying to raise her weapon for another attack. \"I won’t... surrender...\"\n\"I know,\" I said quietly, positioning for the finishing sequence. \"Your bloodline won’t let you.\"\nUnderstanding flickered in her eyes - recognition that I knew about the compulsion, that I understood why she couldn’t stop.\nI executed a three-strike sequence that disarmed her completely - blade knocking the axe from weakened grip, follow-up strike to her shoulder that numbed her arm, final precise blow to her temple with the flat of my sword that had just enough force to render her unconscious without causing serious injury.\nSeraphina collapsed, finally released from the bloodline’s compulsion by unconsciousness.\n\"WINNER: ADRIAN BLACKWOOD!\"\nThe crowd erupted, though the applause carried mixed tones. Excitement at witnessing such dominant performance, but also discomfort at how one-sided the \"featured match\" had turned out to be.\nMedical staff rushed to attend Seraphina while I sheathed my sword and walked calmly from the ring.\nIn the spectator section, Kyle’s face was a mask of barely controlled fury. His girlfriend - the powerful Valkyrie bloodline heir who was predicted to reach at least the semifinals - had been eliminated in the round of thirty-two. Thrashed so thoroughly she’d never landed a meaningful strike. Dominated so completely that her legendary bloodline had been exposed as insufficient.\nAnd the person responsible was her ex-boyfriend, the \"weak\" one she’d dumped for lacking ambition.\nI met Kyle’s furious glare with complete calm. Let him be angry. Let him recognize that the natural order he’d assumed - where he and Seraphina stood above everyone else - was a fiction.\nThe \"uncrowned queen\" had fallen.\nAnd the message was clear to everyone watching: there were levels to this game that legendary bloodlines alone couldn’t overcome.\nAs I left the arena ring, Kael and Elen immediately approached from where they’d been watching in the competitor section.\n\"That was incredible!\" Kael said with genuine enthusiasm. \"I’ve never seen someone dismantle an opponent like that. She couldn’t land a single meaningful hit!\"\nElen nodded in agreement, though her expression carried analytical appreciation rather than simple excitement. \"Your control was exceptional. You could have ended it much faster, but you systematically broke down her capabilities instead. That showed more skill than a quick knockout would have.\"\n\"Thanks,\" I acknowledged. \"Seraphina’s strong, but she isn’t invincible.\"\n\"Still,\" Kael added, \"the way you fought was amazing. You made a legendary bloodline heir look... ordinary.\"\nBefore I could respond, Emmet joined our group. His expression was its usual stoic mask, but I detected subtle frustration in his body language.\n\"I wanted to fight her,\" he stated bluntly.\nI nodded in understanding. Emmet had lost a 1v1 against Seraphina earlier in the term - one of his rare defeats that had clearly bothered him despite his outward composure. He’d been training specifically to get a rematch and prove the loss was a fluke or that he’d improved enough to overcome her Valkyrie advantages.\n\"I know,\" I said. \"But she’s not going to make it to where you could fight her now. She’s out of the competition.\"\nEmmet’s jaw tightened slightly - the only visible sign of disappointment. \"You eliminated my opportunity for redemption.\"\n\"Sorry about that.
