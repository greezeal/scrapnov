      "content": "Chapter 1 - That's Just The Way It Is\n\"Waiter!\" A woman with horrendous make-up bellowed.\nHer action caused the other diners to frown deeply but they chose not to say anything, as they continued eating their meal.\n\"Here it comes again,\" one of them muttered, taking the spoonful of food into his mouth and watching the woman from the corner of his eyes with familiarity.\nThe next moment, a young man dressed in the establishment's uniform rushed to the woman's table.\n\"Ma'am, you called for me. How may I help?\" He asked politely, making sure to spot the best customer-friendly smile he could muster.\n\"Yeah,\" the woman nodded and glared daggers at the boy, \"You can help me by calling for your manager!\"\n\"I'm sorry, Ma'am, but the manager isn't available. If you have any complaint, please tell me and we will take note of it,\" the boy said, with a short and respectful bow.\n\"Your manager isn't around, huh?\" The woman asked.\nThe young man gave a polite nod.\nHe was watching the woman and he noticed a faint smirk flash her face immediately after he nodded.\n\"I see that's the reason why staffs like you can just make something so terrible and dangerous to the body, and serve it to your precious customers? Do you not care for the lives of other humans? The people that come here to spend their hard earned money? You really don't care about them, huh?\" The woman asked with raised voice.\nEven a fool could understand what she was trying to do.\nThe young man, who had just been barraged with questions, gave another polite nod.\n\"I'm sorry if our services weren't to your liking, Ma'am. If you won't mind, can you tell me exactly what the problem is so that we can work on it. Our outmost desire at Royal Gray ia to give our customers a very enjoyable experience through our menu,\" he said.\n\"Enjoyable experience, my ass,\" the woman bellowed and slammed her hands on the table, \"I'm telling you that food you guys cook here are dangerous to the human health. And you're talking to me about enjoyable experience. What's enjoyable about it? Is paying hospital bills enjoyable?\"\nThe young man's eyes twitched when he heard this. He clenched his fist tightly and unclenched it the next moment.\nIt was evident that he was about to lose and was doing his best to control himself.\n\"Ma'am, what exactly is the problem?\" He asked with a firm voice.\n\"The problem, you ask. The problem is that your food contains poisonous ingredients. That's the problem,\" the woman said.\nThe young man bit his lower lip in frustration when he heard this. He scoffed inwardly as he looked at the multiple empty plates on the table.\nIt's poisonous and you are everything that you were served? Not one plate or two. But 8! What load of nonsense.\nThe young man didn't hold back on his curiosity as he asked, \"Ma'am, you said the food are harmful but you ate everything. Why!\"\nThe woman stiffened for a few seconds, clearly caught off guard by the question. She had never expected the kid who like he could be blown away by her breath, to actually have the courage to ask such bold question.\nBut who was she? She was someone that has been terrorising businesses like this for sometime now. There was no way that she will allow herself to be bested by a kid.\nImmediately, she flared up and sprang up from her seat. Due to her slightly huge body, the table was overturned as she stood up and the plates on it fell to the floor, breaking and shattering into pieces.\n\"What do you mean by what you said, boy? I dare you to repeat it!\" She growled into the young man's face.\nClearly, her action was an act of intimidation but contrary to her expectations, the young man didn't lower his head.\nBut instead, he raised it and looked at her with a sharp, cold look on his eyes.\nThis caused the woman to be flustered for a moment and she flared up even more. She raised her hand and was about to slap the young man across the face, when suddenly another hand stopped her hand on place.\n\"That's enough, Ma'am. I'm the manager of the place. Come to my office and let us talk,\" the owner of the second hand, middle-aged man, said.\nThe woman seeing the manager of the establishment, knew that she has to put an end to her show. But she wasn't willing to let things go just like that.\n\"Fine. But before that, I want you to sack this disrespectful runt immediately. If not, I won't come with you but leave immediately. And when I do, I will get my friends and we will bombard you with negative reviews,\" she said, with a cold and threatening voice.\nThe middle-aged man seeing that the woman has no intention to back down, decided to do as she wants.\nHe turned to the young man and said with a firm voice, \"You're fired. Remember the leave behind the uniform before you leave. Every necessary payments would be made to you. You don't need to worry about that.\"\nThe young man didn't say anything when he heard this. He simply nodded and walked back to the kitchen.\nMeanwhile, a sinister smile could be seen on the woman's face.\n\"Excellent decision,\" she said with satisfaction clearly written on her face.\nThe middle-aged man nodded.\n\"Please follow me,\" he said and started leading the woman to his office.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\n***\nThe young man, who had just been fired, walked out through the back door of the restaurant.\nHe looked at the time on his phone and sighed. He turned and started slowly walking down the street, looking out of it as he trudged his way home.\nThe young man's thought was filled with a lot of philosophical questions about life and it's meaning.\nHe didn't bother to think about the job he had just been fired from, as he had already seen it coming.\nHis boss, now former boss, has been looking for a good excuse to fire him. And the incident with that woman gave him the excuse he needed.\nThe young man wouldn't surprised if his former boss planned everything together. And he wouldn't care.\nAs for his philosophical questions? At the end, just like everyone else, he got no answer to any of them.\nWhat's the use of asking all those questions? Even if I get the answers to them, what would it change? All my life, I've always been at the bottom, experiencing one bad thing after another and never truly experiencing anything worthwhile.\nBut it's not anyone's fault, neither is it that of the indifferent world I'm living in. Rather, it's because I'm without any talent whatsoever. Which means I can only live life as it flows.\nThat's just the way it is, Liam.\nLetting out a lengthy sigh, he cut off the unnecessary thoughts and focused on the street ahead.\nAs he walked down the street, he turned and walked into an old residential units building.\nFew minutes later, Liam unlocked the door, opened it and walked into his apartment. He threw a bunch of envelopes he has picked at the door, on the old table and collapsed onto his bed.\nThe bedframe creaked furiously and the worn-out bed was pressed flat, almost becoming one with the bedframe.\nLiam winced slightly at the pain but he didn't focus too much on it. Instead, he focused his thoughts on something else.\nHe has just been sacked and with just taking a look at his current living conditions, it's a no brainer that he needs to get another job immediately.\nThe envelopes he had picked up are eviction letters and notice for some of his unpaid bills.\nExcluding the contents of the envelopes, there was nothing edible at all to eat in the one room apartment.\nAs for Liam's bank account? He barely has $20 in it. Though his boss said that he will be sending his severance pay and whatnots, Liam wasn't banking on it.\nBesides, even if he does get it, it would only be a drop in the vast ocean of debts he's currently in.\nBut what exactly do I do?\nThe next moment, a sound echoed in Liam's head.\n[Ding!]",

      "content": "Chapter 2 - Ultimate Sign-in System\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host. Ultimate Sign-in System has been has been activated. Would you like to bind the system?]\nLiam was quite shocked and confused by the voice in his head. He found the whole situation to be very strange but as someone who has gone through so much in life at such a very young age, nothing can faze him anymore.\nThe next moment, his shock and confusion gave way to curiosity.\n\" Ultimate Sign-in System? Can you tell me about yourself and what will happen after I bind with you?\"\n[Absolutely, Host. After binding with the system, you can perform sign-ins, which include daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly sign-ins. Through the sign-ins, you will receive rewards of varying kinds—cash, assets, skills and slight physical improvement etc.]\n[The system has other functions but they are all locked and you will have to unlock them as you progress.]\n[The system's ultimate goal is to make you the wealthiest and the most powerful being in all *********.]\n[Would you like to bind with the system?]\n\"Before that, the money and assets I will receive as rewards...\" Liam said, intentionally allowing his voice to trail off.\n[You don't need to worry about the legality of any of the rewards, Host.]\n\"I see... Ok, then... Begin the binding process.\"\nWith the system's assurance, there was no need to delay any longer. He finally got something that can fix his miserable situation without risk, there was no way that he would refuse.\nEven if there was any risk to it, he would still accept.\nThere's that saying too...\nHe felt that there was something he was forgetting but he couldn't remember it no matter how he tried to.\n[Congratulations, Host, on binding the system.]\n[Would you like to sign-in, Host?]\n\"Yes, please.\"\n[Congratulations, Host, on obtaining a condo apartment in Blue Valley residential complex, $100,000, Maserati GranTurismo. Pro-level Vehicular Operating Skill.]\n[Host, the money has been transferred to your account. The apartment's documents, and car key are in the system's inventory. The car is parked in front of your current residence building. To learn the skill, please let me know.]\nJust as the system said, the next moment, Liam's phone buzzed. He picked it up from the bed and looked at the screen, and he saw something wonderful.\nHis previous balance of $18.69 has increased to a crazy amount of $100,018.69!\nA bright smile graced his face when he saw his new balance. He couldn't help but open his bank app to confirm further.\nHe refreshed his dashboard multiple times but the amount never changed no matter how many times he refreshed it.\nThe next second, he burst out into laughter.\nIt was a full minute before he finally stopped laughing.\nWith a bright smile on his face, he decided to focus his attention on the other rewards.\n\"A condo apartment in Blue Valley?...\"\nLiam wasn't familiar with the complex. He quickly opened his phone's browser and searched for it online.\nIt didn't take him long and he found the information he was looking for.\nBlue Valley residential complex, a high-end residential building located in Palm Ville Estate—an upscale neighbourhood.\nFrom what he saw online about complex, apartment aren't sold but rented out and the rent are extremely expensive, with the cheapest there costing a minimum of $8,000 monthly.\nThis was a staggering amount for Liam who can barely afford to pay rent of $500 monthly.\nIf renting the cheapest apartment costs so much, then how much did it cost the system to purchase one?\nThɪs NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nLiam was already starting to feel how amazing the system was.\nBut the building wasn't the end of the rewards, there was still the car and the skill he got.\nCurious, he asked the system how to access the inventory.\n[Just think of what you want to retrieve from it and it will appear in front of you.]\nWithout hesitation, Liam thought about retrieving the car key and the next moment, it magically appeared in his hand.\nHe smiled when he saw the car key in his hand. He squeezed it, getting a feel of it.\nLiam wasn't knowledgeable about cars but as a lover of cars, he decided to check for the car's information online.\nThe car cost close to $192,000, comes with a twin-turbocharged V-6 in two states of tune—the more powerful belting out 542 horsepower—paired with an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive.\nWhy Liam's limited knowledge on cars, all he could say was that if was great car.\nIt's true when they say that you must be knowledgeable about something to truly appreciate it.\nLiam took another look at the car in his hand, smiled and stood up from his bed, and left his apartment.\nHe remembered the system saying that the car was parked in the front of his current residence building, which means it's right outside the old building he's living in.\nLiam hastened his steps and arrived at the entrance of the building. He stepped out and sure enough, he saw a red car parked right in front of him.\nThe car was sleek and beautiful, and it's color was very eye-catching, causing it to grab the attention of those around and anyone that walked by.\nLiam pressed the unlock button on the car key and the car beeped, an indication that it has been unlocked.\nWith the smile still on his face, he walked to the driver's side of the car, opened the door and got in.\nSeated, Liam caressed the steering, the leather seat and the dashboard, getting a feel of its material.\nThough he has no idea what sort of material was used to make the leather seat, but the comfortable feeling it gave him when he caressed it and as he was seated, told him all he needed to know.\nSuch a high-end material.\nLiam kind of felt bad seated on such quality material with his worn-out and dirty clothes\nBut that feeling quickly disappeared just as it came.\nWho cares? It's my car and I can do whatever I want with it.\nHe was kind of curious about how the system made something as big as the car to appear in the street, in broad daylight but he decided to stop thinking about it.\nHe doesn't want to waste his time thinking about something he might never understand. Instead, he wants to use his time to enjoy what the system has given him.\nWell, let's learn the driving skill.\nImmediately, Liam thought of learning the skill and the next second, a vast amount of information flooded his brain, causing him headache.\nThe flood of information stopped after a couple of seconds and the headache disappeared along with it.\nAs for the use of the skill? Just as the name suggests, the Pro-level Vehicular Operating skill gives him unparalleled operational ability over any vehicle—cars, aircrafts, ships, military aircrafts too, bikes, etc.\nIn other words, it was a god level skill.\nCurious to see what had changed, Liam placed his on the steering and he was surprised to find out that the feeling of it in his hand was now second nature to him.\n\"It's nice how the skill work,\" he said to himself.\nWithout wasting anymore time, he started the car and drove off to his new apartment.",

      "content": "Chapter 3 - Blue Valley Residential Complex\nBlue Valley Complex, Palm Ville Estate.\nA red Maserati GranTurismo slowly came to a stop in front of the complex.\nInside the car, a wide, bright smile could be seen on Liam's face.\nThe drive from his old neighbourhood to this place has been very enjoyable. Even with how terrible the road is, with the nonstop bumps, he hadn't felt a thing.\nIt was like he was flying.\nThough Liam was aware that he also has the Pro-level Driving Skill to thank. Because without it, he would had already damaged the car a long time ago.\nLiam turned off the car's engine off and took out the apartment's documents from the system's inventory.\nThe documents materialised on his lap and the first thing he saw was a black key card with gold stripes.\nLiam picked up the key card and examined it. He felt that the gold stripes on the card was real gold, and that the card was made of special material due to the high-class feeling it was giving him.\nAfter a few seconds of examining the card, he stopped as he found nothing.\nActually, it wasn't that he found nothing. He has no idea what he was looking for or how to look for it.\n\"I better not give myself brain aneurysm,\" he smiled, as he picked up the document from his lap, opened the door and stepped out of the car.\nStepping out of the car, Liam raised his head and looked at his surroundings and his jaw dropped a little in shock.\nAll around, all he could see are luxury cars. Every single brand was here—Mercedes, Maybach, Roll Royce, Lamborghini...\nThe sight of all these cars made Liam feel like he had stepped into paradise—an expensive one.\nIt wasn't just the cars, even the air he was now breathing was clean, refreshing and free of any stench whatsoever.\nHe looked around and he couldn't see any form of dirt. It was even the open garage where he stood had always been meticulously maintained.\nThen, there was the multiple beautiful complexes around him and he was left speechless.\nIt was now that he finally understood why he was stopped at the estate's gate by the security guards.\nJust the sight of the cars alone already told him all he needed to know.\nLiam sighed and smiled, as he closed the car door and walked into the building.\nInside, he walked to the exclusive elevator designated for his condo.\nYes, the condo has its own exclusive elevator. It was one of the perks that comes with the condo apartment.\nLiam was already at the elevator and was about to use the key card to open the elevator, when the general elevator opened up and someone stepped out of it.\n\"Hey, that elevator isn't for public use. Use this one,\" a female voice said.\nLiam turned to look at the owner of the voice and he was surprised to see who out was..ɴet\nStacy?\nStacy was Liam's former classmate. They went to middle school and high school together, before he dropped out in his early second year.\nThough they weren't familiar with each other as then they both lived in complete different worlds.\nStacy was from a rich home, while Liam was from a struggling family. Also, she was the smart, talented, beautiful and popular high school kid, while he was the dumb and introverted high school kid.\n\"Hey, didn't you hear what I said?\" Stacy asked, her voice bringing Liam out of his thoughts.\n\"Yeah, I did. Thanks,\" Liam replied and turned to his private elevator.\nHe saw that she didn't recognise him. Not like he was expecting her to, especially with how invisible he always was in class.\nStacy shook her head when she saw that the delivery person wasn't going to listen to her. She decided that it wasn't her problem and walked away.\n\"People these days. Tsk. You tell them something and they make it feel like you're looking down on them,\" she said, clicking her tongue in exasperation.\nJust as she spoke, she was stunned to hear an unfamiliar elevator sound. She sharply turned to look and she saw the private elevator that hasn't opened in ages, opened.\nHer eyes widened in shock and she looked at the young man who looks to be the same age as her, in confusion.\nHer eyes roamed all over him, trying to find out what she has missed and that was when she saw it.\n\"Th-That card?!\" She muttered in shock.\nShe thought she saw it wrong and she look looked again.\n\"It-It's really it. But how?\" She asked herself in shock.\nAs someone that has been living in the estate and this particular complex for more than a year now, she knew what that card is and what it means.\nBut what she couldn't understand is why someone that looks like a delivery person would be holding it. And then, there was the papers in his hand too.\nDid he buy it? How's that possible?\nShe felt that something was wrong and decided to ask this mysterious person herself.\n\"Hey! I want to talk to you,\" she said, running to the closing elevator door.\nUnfortunately for her, the mysterious person didn't even stop it from closing but nonchalantly watched her as she ran to it.\nMeanwhile, in the elevator, Liam was all smiles and filled with anticipation to see his new apartment.\nHe felt that it would be special due to the fact that it has an exclusive elevator but he has no idea what the difference between his own apartment and others. And he was curious about it, as he felt that it was related to the reason why he has a private elevator.\nHe did take a guess and felt that it might be because it's located on the top floor. But he wasn't exactly sure.\nAs for Stacy's action, he didn't even give it a second of thought.\n***\nFew minutes later, the elevator came to a stop and its doors slid open.\nLiam was shocked by what he saw when the doors slid open.\nIn front of him was a long, empty hallway and at the end of it, was a huge double door. But this wasn't the shocking part.\nThe shocking part was the fact that this wasn't just any condo but rather, it was a penthouse!\nThe fact that his apartment was located on the top floor should had already told him this but Liam hadn't thought that far.\nAlso, he hadn't gone through the property documents in the hand.\nOr rather, he didn't want to think about it as he felt that he would be overreaching. Even now, he still had the thought that this wasn't a penthouse.\nLiam kept his emotions under control, as he stepped out of the elevator and walked down the hallway.\nAs he walked, he was starting to become even more convinced that this was a penthouse.\nThe glass walls that allows him to see the city on both sides and the hallway ceiling lined up with very expensive looking chandeliers.\nLiam's heartbeat increased as he slowly came to a realisation. He let out a deep breath, as he finally arrived at the door.\nWith trembling hands, he placed the key card on the card reader and he heard a beep, and a click as the door unlocked.\nLiam took a moment to relax himself, as he closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, before exhaling slowly.\nHis eyes snapped open and with a smile, he turned the door handle, slowly opened the door.\nWhat came into view Liam's view was a very magnificent sight and it took his breath away.\n\"It's really a penthouse...,\" he muttered slowly, as he stepped into it.\nHe took off his shoes and walked to the living area, and he was left speechless.\nBig, comfortable and expensive looking cushions with gold trimmings. Exquisite side and middle glass tables, also with good trimmings. Beautiful artworks on the wall. Vases that looks like they were imported from ancient times. And there's the floor that clearly reflects him like a mirror.\nEverything around him from the ceiling to the painting on the walls, and even the floor screamed luxury.\nLiam smiled and turned back and he was shocked to see a 115-inch 4k QLED TV on the wall.\n\"This really is paradise,\" he said with bright smile.",

      "content": "Chapter 4 - Paying Off Debts\nIt has been over half an hour since Liam walked into the penthouse. He had used the time to take a comprehensive tour of the mansion.\nAs for the result of his tour? His current state of speechless.\nAt first, just the fact that he got a penthouse had left him speechless but the amenities in it made him even more speechless.\nInstead of calling it a penthouse or an apartment, it would be more appropriate to call it a house because it comes with everything and anything he wants.\nA living room with a dining area adjoined to it, and the kitchen overlooking it. Then a bedroom with an adjoining bathroom.\nThese things are basics, yes. But what aren't basic are the furnitures, decorations and the amenities in the penthouse.\nEverything's so high-class and expensive looking that Liam felt that he might lose his mind.\nAs for the price of the place? He didn't dare to check. He had already checked on the internet and saw that the prices of penthouse in areas around Palm Ville Estate cost a minimum of $4.5m.\nUsing that and the fact that his penthouse is special because it's a condo, and also the fact that Palm Ville Estate doesn't sell their units, he can already deduce that the price of his penthouse would cost at least $10m-$15m.\nThat was a staggering amount of money for someone who barely had $20 in his account an hour ago.\nInsane!\nEverything was still a lot for Liam to take in but he was sure that he would get used to it. Though it would definitely take some time.\nSeated on one of the cushions, Liam smiled from ear to ear, as he savoured the feeling of its comfort.\nHe picked up the TV remote and was about to turn the TV on when his stomach growled, reminding him that he has yet to eat anything for the day.\nLiam dropped the TV remote back on the glass centre table, picked up his car key and the key card, stood up from the cushion and left the penthouse.\n***\nImperial Kitchen, Palm Ville Estate.\nLiam parked his car and walked into the establishment.\nImmediately, his clothes attracted the attention of the customers around, as he was still wearing his worn-out clothes that has a quite a bit of holes in it.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ\nA man in a tailored suit glanced at Liam's threadbare shirt, then at his Maserati keys resting on the table. His brows furrowed in confusion.\nAs for Liam? He was used to stares and he used to shrink under them. But now, he didn't care to be bothered with the stares the man or everyone were giving him. They are entitled to their opinion and ge has nothing to prove to anyone.\nYes, his clothes aren't appropriate for a place like this but it can't be helped. He has nothing else to change into and he was too hungry and weak to start going shopping for clothes.\nHe would definitely get some clothes later today or tomorrow, but all he wants to do now was to eat.\nLiam picked up the menu, went through it and called the waiter, and a waitress arrived at his table to take his order.\nNot wanting to say too much, Liam pointed to the things he wants on the menu.\nThe waitress nodded respectfully and walked back to the kitchen.\nWith his order taken, Liam would have to wait for a few minutes before it's ready. Having free time, he decided to use it to pay up his debts.\nHe transfered the due rents to his former landlord and texted him, telling him that he has moved out.\nHe also paid all the bills that had pilled up on his head and the $48,000 debt both his parents left him, before running off with a rich man.\nAs he paid off the debt, he remembered his parents. His dad divorced his mom when he was still in middle school and right before he got into high school, his mom remarried and left him.\nHe had no idea why she has done that but two years later, he found out that the man she remarried didn't want him and his mom had no choice but to leave her own child.\nLiam smiled mockingly when he thought about this. The truth was thatthe only reason why he paid off the debt was because he doesn't want to have anything to do with either of his parents.\nThey can go and burn in hell for all he cares. Nothing would ever make him acknowledge them in his life again.\nLiam wasn't saying this because of the money he now has. Neither did he just make the decision.\nNo, he has already made the decision a long time ago. If not, he wouldn't had taken on the debt as his own. There was also the crazy interest he had been paying for years—one of the contributing cause to his previous miserable situation.\nBut no more. With the system, he definitely won't have to worry about money anymore and would continue to become even wealthier in the future.\nAs for him? All he just wants to do was to enjoy this life of his and everything that comes with it.\nHe will do the things he hadn't been able to do before. He will live the life he wasn't able to live before and he make sure that going forward, no one ever looks down on him again.\nMoney gives confidence, they say. This was true for Liam. Though he currently has less than $40,000 in his account after paying off all his debts, he wasn't worried.\nLiam was brought out of his thoughts by the voice of the waitress, as she served him his meal.\nAfter she was done, he thanked her and started eating. He took a bite of the chicken and nearly moaned due to how delicious it was.\nLiam took his time enjoying his meal. After he was done, he paid his bills and left.\nWhile paying, he saw that the cashier was looking at him strangely and was quite surprised after he paid the bill of more than $1,000 without issue.\nAlso, he noticed some of the other customers looking at him strangely as he walked out of the restaurant without having any issue with the staffs\nHe understood their reasoning but he didn't care. Liam checked his balance again. Still over $38,000 left. It was time to bury the old him—for good.\nHe got into his car and drove off towards the shopping area of the estate.",

      "content": "Chapter 5 - Decisions\n\"Good afternoon, sir. Welcome to Armani,\" a female sales associate greeted, bowing slightly as Liam stepped into the store.\nThe polished interior glistened under warm lights. Everything smelled like cologne, luxury, and quiet confidence.\nWithout hesitation, Liam spoke. \"Please get me some clothes, shoes, and the necessary accessories. I want something simple. My budget is $30,000.\"\nThe associate's brows lifted just slightly, the professional smile never leaving her face. \"Understood. Please follow me, sir.\"\nShe turned and led him toward a private waiting room, where clients of a certain status were usually seated.\n***\nInside, Liam relaxed in a plush, cream-colored chair, scrolling through his phone while waiting. His mind wasn't on social media or random videos. It was on his future.\nHe now had a system—a mysterious power promising to make him the most powerful and wealthiest man alive. And honestly, he had no plans of chasing grand ambitions. Not yet.\nFor the past four years, while others his age partied and dreamed, Liam was buried in double shifts and manual labor. He worked through sickness, slept through hunger, and existed more than lived. Every penny he earned vanished into bills, loans, and the debt his parents dumped on him like trash.\nNow he had a chance to breathe.\nA chance to live.\nAnd that's all he wanted for now.\nIf the system wants to make me powerful, then fine. But for now... I'm going to enjoy this ride. For once, I'll let life be easy.\nHis thoughts were interrupted when the associate returned, arms full with curated selections. She laid out the clothing, shoes, and accessories with practiced grace.\n\"These were chosen to your budget and request. Do let me know what you think.\"\nLiam looked over the neatly presented pieces—tailored suits, casual designer wear, handmade leather shoes, wristwatches, belts. All neutral tones. Clean cuts. Nothing flashy, but everything screamed wealth.\n\"I'll take all of it,\" he said.\n\"Of course. I'll prepare the packaging and payment terminal.\"\nA few minutes later, bags in hand, Liam left the store. He opened the door to his red Maserati GranTurismo, tossed the bags onto the passenger seat, and slid in behind the wheel. The leather welcomed him like a throne. He started the engine and drove back toward his penthouse in Palm Ville Estate.\n***\nBack in the penthouse, Liam walked straight into his bedroom. He placed the shopping bags on the bed, undressed, and stepped into the marbled bathroom.\nWarm water poured over him, washing away more than dirt. It felt like it was rinsing off every bad memory, every unpaid bill, every insult, every time someone told him he wouldn't make it.\nAfter the bath, he dressed in one of his new outfits—a dark navy dress shirt tucked into light grey slacks, paired with matte black leather shoes and a matching belt. He chose a simple silver wristwatch to complete the look.\nHe turned to the full-length mirror by the closet and paused.\nThe reflection looking back at him almost startled him.\nHe was eighteen, with short dark hair neatly combed to the side. His face wasn't the most handsome, but it was well-shaped and clean. His ocean-blue eyes, normally dulled by exhaustion, now looked sharp and alert.\nHis body still looked skinny and tired but that would change very soon.\nAs for new clothes? It hugged him perfectly, outlining his slim frame with precision. He looked elegant, rich, and capable.\nIt was hard to believe he was the same guy who, just yesterday, had been cleaning dishes and getting screamed at by customers.\n\"It's true what they say,\" Liam muttered. \"Clothes really do maketh the man.\"\nHe gathered his old clothes—worn, torn, and stained—and tossed them into the trash.\nHe wasn't going back to that version of himself.\nEver again.\n***\nLiam walked into the living room, planning to lounge on the sofa and watch a movie. Just as he reached for the remote, his phone buzzed.\nHe looked at the screen.\nIt was his former boss—the same man who had fired him just earlier today.\nLiam stared at the name for a few seconds, then pressed the lock button and placed the phone face-down on the couch. He wasn't in the mood for whatever excuse or insult the man was ready to spew.\nInstead, he scrolled through the streaming options and picked a random action movie. The loud gunfire and explosions on-screen felt oddly soothing.\nHours passed. The sun dipped below the horizon. The city skyline shimmered through the penthouse windows.\nBy the time Liam turned off the TV, it was well past 9 p.m. He picked up his phone again and checked it—seven missed calls and three messages, all from his ex-boss.\nHe opened the messages. As expected, they were a mix of excuses and veiled accusations.\n\"We can't process your severance now. Business has been terrible. Especially after what happened with that woman. She's threatened legal action.\"\n\"You shouldn't have said what you did. You know the rules. Don't make this harder than it already is.\"\nLiam chuckled dryly.\nHe hadn't expected to receive the money anyway, but the way the man twisted the situation into his fault still made his blood simmer.\nAlmost a year of working under that petty tyrant. Always walking on eggshells. Always having his pay cut for the most minor \"infractions.\" Always being threatened with dismissal like it was a sword over his head.\nA bitter memory surfaced—his boss once deducting half his salary because a customer complained he didn't smile \"warmly enough.\"\nLiam gripped the phone tightly.\nHe inhaled.\nExhaled.\nAnd tossed the phone onto the couch.\nLet it go, he told himself. He's no longer worth your anger.\nIf he sought revenge on every person who used or stepped on him, he'd spend the rest of his life chasing shadows.\nThat wasn't living.\nThat was a different kind of prison.\nBut as for his parents?\nHe would never forgive them.\nNot now. Not ever.\n---\nThe next morning, Liam woke refreshed. The sunlight poured into the penthouse through the full glass windows.\nThe system's daily sign-in hadn't appeared yet, but Liam was already anticipating what reward might come next.\nAfter a quick bath, he dressed in another new outfit—white sneakers, slim dark jeans, a fitted charcoal polo shirt, and a new black leather wallet in his back pocket.\nHe wanted to pick up groceries today. It might sound odd to some—why cook when you could order anything? But Liam had always wanted to cook in a beautiful kitchen, not the cramped fire hazard he used to rent.\nThe elevator ride was smooth, silent. He felt calm.\nBut as the elevator door slid open, he was startled to find someone standing directly in front of it.\nIt was a familiar face.\nStacy's.",

      "content": "Chapter 6 - System Upgrade?\nThe soft chime of the elevator faded behind him as Liam stepped off the penthouse elevator onto the lobby.\nSunlight filtered in through the glass façade, painting the marble floor in golden streaks.\nHe ignored Stacy, as he adjusted the grocery list in his hand and made his way toward the entrance—only to hear her voice behind him.\n\"Hey, umm... I'm sorry about yesterday.\"\nLiam paused.\nShe stood a few steps away, her posture hesitant. Her eyes darted briefly to the floor, then back up to him, and she gave a soft, apologetic smile.\n\"I didn't mean the things I said yesterday in a bad way,\" she continued. \"I was just trying to help. I thought you were... you know, someone who got lost or—well, I didn't mean to sound rude.\"\nLiam blinked, momentarily caught off guard. He had expected her to throw out a sarcastic comment or maybe continue acting entitled like she had the day before. But an apology? That was unexpected.\nStill, he didn't feel any lingering irritation.\n\"It's fine,\" he said with a slight smile and resumed walking toward the exit.\nBut before he could take more than a few steps, he heard her hurried footsteps catching up behind him.\n\"Wait!\"\nLiam turned, raising a brow.\nStacy stood there, phone in hand, trying her best to maintain a polite and casual expression—but he could see the curiosity bubbling behind her eyes.Google seaʀᴄh No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n\"My name's Stacy,\" she said, brushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear. \"I live on the seventh floor. If you don't mind, I'd like to have your number. Just in case I ever need help or... we bump into each other again. Maybe we can get to know each other better?\"\nShe extended her phone toward him.\nLiam didn't answer right away. He held her gaze for a second long and it made her shift slightly under the weight of his silence—then took the phone from her hand.\n\"Sure,\" he said simply.\nHe tapped his number into her contacts and handed the device back.\n\"Anything else?\" he asked, tone still even.\nStacy blinked. \"No. Thanks.\"\nShe gave him a small smile—less confident this time—and walked back toward the elevator, her heels clicking softly against the polished floor.\nLiam watched her go.\nHe knew exactly why she wanted his number. She wasn't being flirty, not really. She was intrigued. Curious. The penthouse had been empty for a long time—until now. And now, some guy in beat-up clothes suddenly had exclusive elevator access and drove a luxury Maserati?\nShe was curious about the identity of the person that's living in the penthouse.. And he intends to humour her.\nLiam smiled faintly to himself as he walked out of the complex.\n***\nThe drive to the nearest high-end grocery store took only ten minutes. Liam parked the car, grabbed a cart, and stepped inside.\nThe interior was spotless, with soft music playing in the background and the scent of fresh bread and roasted coffee lingering in the air. It was nothing like the budget stores he used to shop in. There were no long lines, no stale air, no harsh fluorescent lighting.\nHe walked through the aisles, casually selecting items. Everything from fruits, vegetables, dairy, and spices, to imported oils, meats, and a bottle of vintage wine he picked just because he could.\nHe paid for everything without blinking, even though the bill crossed the $2,000 mark. The cashier gave a professional smile, but he could tell she was surprised. Liam, dressed casually, didn't look like someone who'd drop that much on groceries.\nHe loaded the bags into his trunk, drove home, and returned to his penthouse with multiple bags of food and ingredients.\nIt felt surreal.\nNot long ago, he couldn't even afford ramen noodles.\nNow, he had a luxury kitchen, marble countertops, and enough ingredients to cook like a private chef.\nHe put everything away and prepped a simple breakfast—eggs, toast, grilled mushrooms, and fruit juice. Nothing fancy. Just real food. Food he didn't have to stretch or ration. Food he could enjoy.\nHe plated it carefully and sat by the wide window in the living room, the city skyline stretching before him.\nEach bite tasted better than the last.\nFor the first time in years, Liam wasn't eating to survive.\nHe was eating because he wanted to.\n---\nThe rest of the day drifted by like a breeze.\nHe watched movies. Took a nap. Browsed online for furniture additions—maybe a sound system, maybe a massage chair. He even tried to read a book but dozed off halfway through.\nIt was peaceful.\nThere was no pressure, no boss to yell at him, no bills to fear.\nIt was the kind of lazy day rich people took for granted.\nSo this is what it's like to live, Liam thought, reclining on the sofa.\nNight came.\nThe sky darkened, and the city lights below twinkled like a sea of stars. He poured himself a glass of cold juice and leaned back, staring at the ceiling.\nThere was just one thing bugging him.\nThe sign-in.\nHe hadn't seen the option pop up all day.\nWas there a delay?\nA cooldown?\nHe was about to start panicking as the thought that system was just a one-off thing, and he might go back to the way the things were before.\nOr maybe the sign-in option won't appear tonight and when he goes to bed, and wakes up tomorrow, he will find out that everything was all a dream.\nThat would really hurt. Just the thought alone was already causing his chest to tighten.\nHe was just about to call out to the system and ask about the sign-in option when the highly anticipated notification finally chimed in his head.\n[Ding!]\n[Would you like to sign in, Host?]\nLiam sat up with a grin. \"Yes.\"\n[Congratulations, Host. You have received $300,000, +5 attribute points]\n[Host can now view status info screen. Say \"status\" to view.]\nHis phone buzzed almost immediately.\nLiam grabbed it, opened the bank app, and laughed softly when he saw the balance:\n$309,018.69.\nA new influx of cash—and stat points now too?\nHis smile widened. So the system gave more than money.\nAnd now there was a new feature.\nStatus screen, huh?\n\"Status,\" Liam said aloud.",

But for now, he would enjoy what comes with it.\nMaking that decision, Liam stopped thinking of the \"unnecessary things\" and focused his attention on the screen.\nQuite a bit of information was being displayed on it—his name, age, system level, the quantification of his physical stats, his skills, the system's inventory and its functions.\nLiam understood some of them but some he didn't understand and quite curious about. For example, the system level. He was curious about that.\nUnable to hold himself back, he decided to ask the system about it but before he could answer, it gave him the answer.\n[The system has multiple levels. Each level unlocks for function for the Host and system to use. Though I currently can't tell you what the functions are, I can tell you that they are extremely valuable.]\n\"So you can read my mind, huh?\" Liam nodded slowly.\n[Yes, Host.]\n\"Not bad, I guess.\"\n[Host does not need to worry as I won't hurt you or allow anyone or anything to do so. My ultimate still remains the same.]\n\"Thanks,\" Liam smiled.\nHe has actually been genuinely scared.\nBut of what exactly? Even he has no idea but the system's words has reassured him that he has nothing to worry about.\n\"So, how do I increase the level?\" He asked.\n[There are no set of definite actions or methods to do so. The system will automatically level up when it meets the criteria but it will still be based on your actions.]\n\"My actions?\" He asked in surprise.\n[Yes, Host.]\n\"So, the leveling up method is defined or standard but you will level up when you meet the criterias which are based on my actions?\"\n[Exactly.]\n\"That's vague... Well, I'm really looking forward to the functions that will be unlocked in the future,\" he smiled.\nWith his question answered, Liam decided to make use of the attribute points he just received.Googlᴇ search Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nHe allocated three points to his Stamina and one each to his Strength and Agility.\nImmediately after adding the points, he felt a strange warmth flowing through his body and it disappeared just as fast.\nEven without being told, he already knew that the warmth of whatever it was meant that his strength has improved.\n\"Perfect. Now, I can get some sleep,\" he muttered, as he snuggled into his bed.\nHe was about to about to fall asleep when he remembered something.\n\"System, will the sign-in option arrive late tomorrow too?\"\n[Host, the sign-in option arrival isn't fixed. Or do you want me to make it fixed?]\n\"Can you do that?\" Liam asked curiously and with a look of anticipation.\n[I can. What time of the day so you want the sign-in option to appear?]\nLiam took a moment to mulled over the system's question. He thought about the best time he would love for the sign-in option to arrive and he made his decision immediately.\n\"Let me call it myself. Is that possible?\"\n[Definitely, Host.]\n\"Good. Perfect,\" Liam smiled from ear to ear in satisfaction.\nEven though it was for a moment, he had thought about it and he felt that this was the best option.\nLiam yawned tiredly, as he closed his eyes, with a genuinely happy smile and fell asleep.\n***\nThe next morning, Liam woke up feeling very refreshed and happy.\n\"System, sign-in\"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host. You received $500,000, White Clover Residential Complex located in Yellow Creek Avenue.]\n[The money has been sent to your account. The paperworks to the property can be found in the inventory.]\n\"Huh? Wait a minute. An entire complex?\" He asked in a mix of shock, confusion and disbelief.\n[Yes, Host.]\n\"That's insane!\"\nLiam had never expected this. Receiving an entire complex was something that he never imagined.\nWhat was a residential complex? It's a building that has multiple units. And the complex he just received is one that's located in an upscale neighbourhood—which is like a three to four hours drive from Palm Ville Estate.\nAnd if there was one thing that both neighbourhoods and all upscale neighbourhoods has in common, it was that they don't sell their units.\nAt least, to be able to buy a unit, having enough money wasn't enough. You need to be someone with a bit influence in the country or have a connection to someone like that.\nBut now, without any sort of connection to anyone, he now owns not just a unit, a couple or a few of them, but an entire complex!\n\"Thank you, system. I love you. You're the best!\".\n[You're welcome, Host. I'm just here to serve.]\nLiam was very excited to start his day. Who wouldn't be after receiving such incredibly valuable rewards?\nWith the $500,000 he received this morning, he now has more than $800,000 in his account. And it will keep increasing everyday.\n\"What a beautiful day,\" Liam smiled from ear to ear, as he walked into the bathroom.\n***\nFew minutes later, Liam was done freshening up and was now in the kitchen making himself something to eat.\nWhile on that, he thought about the complex and his plans for it. He would naturally be renting it out but to do that, he needs a real estate agent or company to help him manage it.\nHe could go online, browse through the list of reputable real estate companies and choose one of them to manage the property for him.\nLiam thought about it and decided to do it like that. But that would be after he's done eating the delicious breakfast he's making for himself.\nWhat was a residential complex? It's a building that has multiple units.\nEach unit in that building could rent for thousands monthly. Multiply that by ten, twenty... he didn't even know how many there were. But one thing was clear—he had just unlocked passive income.\nJust the thought of making so much monthly gave him a very sweet feeling in his chest.",

      "content": "Chapter 8 - Renting Out The Property\nAfter finishing his breakfast, Liam grabbed his phone and car key, ready to leave for the nearest branch of one of the real estate companies he had looked up online.\nJust as he was locking his door and heading toward the elevator, his phone buzzed. It was an unknown number.\nHe frowned slightly. He wasn't expecting any calls.\nThen he remembered—Stacy had collected his number yesterday.\nHis expression relaxed as he answered the call and brought the phone to his ear.\n\"Hey, good morning. It's me,\" a cheerful female voice said. \"The girl who took your number in the lobby yesterday.\"\nLiam smiled.\n\"Yeah, I remember. Stacy, right?\"\n\"Yup! You remembered my name. Seems I made an impression yesterday,\" she said, teasing slightly.\nHe didn't reply to that line, though he found her approach a little amusing. It was still early, and her tone was already light and inquisitive. He could guess what this was about.\n\"So, Miss Stacy,\" he said with mock politeness, \"you have anything for me?\"\n\"Umm, not really. I was just wondering if we could go out. You know... Talk and stuff.\"\nLiam's smile widened.\nSo that's how she wants to get closer. Interesting.\nTruth be told, he didn't mind. He had no friends, no one to call or hang out with. A little distraction wouldn't hurt. But he had something more important to do this morning.\n\"I'd love that,\" Liam said warmly. \"But I'm a little busy right now. Why don't I call you some other time and we can go out for dinner? What do you think?\"\n\"Sure. That would be nice. I'll be waiting for your call, Mr...\"\n\"It's Liam.\"\n\"Okay, Mr. Liam. I'll be waiting,\" she said playfully and hung up.\nLiam tucked the phone into his pocket just as the elevator doors slid open. He stepped in with a satisfied smile.\n***\nThirty minutes later, Liam parked his Maserati in front of a large glass-paneled building in downtown Westbridge, California—a peaceful and upscale city on the western coastline, known for its tech influence and elite real estate.\nHe looked up at the imposing sign fixed above the entrance:\nSilverStone Realty\nIt was one of the largest and most reputable real estate companies in the country. Their Westbridge branch handled dozens of premium clients and specialized in property management for luxury estates.\nLiam nodded to himself, satisfied with his choice.\nHe stepped out of the car, straightened his collar, and grabbed the folder holding his property documents from the passenger seat. The moment he entered the lobby, he was greeted by cool air conditioning, minimalist decor, and a scent of expensive polish. A front desk attendant looked up as he approached.\n\"Good morning, sir,\" she said politely.\n\"Good morning,\" Liam replied. \"My name's Liam Scott. I'm here to speak with someone about managing my property.\"\n\"Of course. May I ask what kind of property it is?\" she asked, already reaching for her tablet.\nLiam handed over the folder. \"It's the White Clover Residential Complex. Located in Yellow Creek Avenue.\"\nThe receptionist's eyes widened slightly.\nShe blinked, then blinked again, before slowly taking the folder. Her hands trembled ever so slightly as she flipped it open to confirm the contents.\n\"...White Clover?\" she repeated.\n\"Yes,\" Liam said simply.\nA beat passed, and she quickly reached for the phone.\n\"Please wait just a moment,\" she said, voice now noticeably more polite. She picked up the receiver and spoke quickly, her eyes flicking back to Liam now and then.\n\"Mr. Newman, good morning. A Mr. Liam Scott is here. He's looking for someone to manage his property—yes, White Clover Residential Complex at Yellow Creek Avenue.\"\nEven from across the desk, Liam could hear the reaction from the other end of the line. The receptionist winced slightly and nodded.\n\"Understood,\" she said and placed the receiver down. \"Someone will be right with you shortly, Mr. Scott. Please make yourself comfortable.\"\nLiam gave a small nod and stepped aside.\nHe didn't even have time to sit when a tall man in a sleek grey suit came walking briskly from one of the glass offices in the back. His gait was confident, and his eyes scanned Liam with professional interest.\n\"Mr. Scott?\" he asked, smiling as he extended his hand. \"I'm Trevor Newman. Vice President of this branch.\"\nLiam shook his hand firmly. \"Nice to meet you.\"\n\"Please, come with me. Let's talk in my office.\"\n***\nInside Trevor Newman's office.\nThe space was bright and modern, filled with tasteful wooden finishes and neatly organized files. A few plaques hung on the wall—awards, recognitions, and certifications.\n\"Would you like something to drink? Coffee? Tea?\"\n\"I'm good,\" Liam said, setting the folder of documents on the table. \"Let's get straight to the point.\"\n\"Of course,\" Newman said with a professional smile, though Liam could sense the curiosity in his eyes.\nHe opened the folder and began flipping through the documents carefully.\nEven though the receptionist had already informed him, seeing the name White Clover on official deed papers stunned him again. That complex wasn't just prestigious. It was a fortress of exclusivity.\nAnd yet... the boy in front of him—well-dressed, but undeniably young—had handed it over with the same calmness someone might hand over a parking ticket.\nTrevor glanced up from the papers and studied Liam for a moment.\nWho is he? Some heir to an old-money family? A hidden tycoon's son?\nHe had dealt with rich clients before, but there was something about Liam's presence—quiet, composed, detached—that made him think there was more beneath the surface.\nBut he didn't ask.\nNot when the opportunity to manage White Clover had just landed in his lap.\n\"This is quite a property,\" Newman said, closing the folder. \"We'll take great care of it.\"\nHe straightened in his seat.\n\"After we assess and list the available units for rent, the revenue—minus our management fee—will be transferred directly to your account. We'll assign a top-tier team to handle maintenance, tenant screening, financial audits, and any regulatory filings on your behalf.\"\nLiam nodded. \"That works. Let's go ahead with it.\"\nNewman pulled out some additional documents. \"Then all I'll need are your signatures here and here. Also, if you could write down your preferred bank for deposits.\"\nLiam signed calmly and handed over the necessary details.\nBy the time they were done, Trevor had already sent an internal memo to his senior team. Liam Scott was now a VVIP client of SilverStone Realty.\nNewman stood and escorted him back to the lobby personally.\n\"Mr. Scott,\" he said, opening the door, \"if there's anything you need—anything at all—just give me a call.\"\n\"Thanks,\" Liam said, shaking his hand again.\nAs he walked back to his car, Liam felt oddly pleased. He saw how Mr Newman had treated him and he wouldn't lie, it felt nice.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nWith he property taken care of and no other plans for the day, and since he doesn't want to go back home and just lounge on his sofa and bed, he decided to call Stacy.\nLet's see the distraction she's going to bring.",

      "content": "Chapter 9 - Stacy Burton\nThe mid afternoon sun cast a soft amber glow over the wide glass windows of\nCrown Ivy Lounge\n, one of Westbridge's most exclusive upscale cafés. Located on the top floor of the\nMonarch Pavilion\n, the lounge was a known spot for the city's wealthy youth—an oasis of quiet refinement, fragrant imported blends, and velvet-draped privacy booths overlooking the ocean skyline.\nWhen Liam had called Stacy and told her he was free, she'd practically lit up. She offered to pay and selected the meeting spot herself. And now, here they were.\nSeated across from each other in a private booth, Liam watched as Stacy raised her cup delicately, took a sip, and let out a satisfied sigh.\n\"Mmm,\" she smiled. \"They really know how to make a perfect honey-lavender latte here.\"\nLiam merely offered a small nod as he cradled his own drink—an iced black citrus brew served in a frosted glass, the kind of beverage that looked like it belonged more at a Michelin-starred bar than a café.\nHe hadn't taken more than two sips, but he liked the taste.\nUnfortunately for the beverage, Liam was still new to high-class things like it and couldn't fully appreciate it.\nBut what stood out more than the drink, however, was the look in Stacy's eyes.\nShe was smiling, speaking softly, even leaning forward a little—but Liam could see through all of it. She was curious. Starving, even.\nAnd she was doing her best to hide it behind carefully measured charm.\nAfter so long dealing with people—on both the low and high ends of society—Liam had learned something simple: people lie with their eyes more than their mouths.\nStacy, despite all her composure, had been waiting for this moment. And now that she had it, she didn't want to waste time.\n\"So,\" she leaned in slightly, resting her forearms on the table, \"Mr. Liam, I'm really curious about you. But first—let me introduce myself properly. I'm Stacy Burton.\"\nLiam sipped his drink, his eyes never leaving hers. Direct. No name-dropping yet. That's unexpected.\nHe had half-expected her to lead with who her father was or which board her mother sat on. But she didn't.\n\"Liam Scott,\" he said simply.\nShe tilted her head with a soft smile. \"Liam Scott. That's a nice name. I like it.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nHe didn't elaborate as there was nothing else to say.\nHe was watching her now—not out of suspicion, but out of curiosity. He wanted to see what she would do with the silence.\nAnd just as he expected, she filled it.\n\"Umm,\" she began again, shifting her cup in her hands. \"I still want to apologize for the other day. I didn't mean anything I said in a bad way or intend to be rude. I was just... surprised.\"\nLiam gave her the same smile he had in the elevator the first time they met—polite but distant.\n\"Don't overthink it,\" he said. \"Like I said, it's fine.\"\nThe truth was, her comments that day hadn't left the slightest dent in him. People's opinions were currency—they could only affect you if you gave them value.\nAnd hers? It held no weight in his world.\nStill, he understood that her earlier behavior had likely been her own misguided way of offering help.\nShe meant well. Even if she was awkward about it.\nStacy exhaled softly. She noticed that Liam wasn't offering much in the way of personal detail. But rather than be discouraged, she leaned into her natural charisma.\n\"I'll just be honest,\" she said with a shrug. \"I'm curious about you, Mr. Liam. You don't talk much, and I can't find you online. Yet you own a penthouse in Palm Ville Estate? That's not exactly something normal people pull off.\"\nShe laughed lightly, but there was a deliberate weight behind her tone.\n\"You must be from some kind of family. Maybe one with a lot of influence or old money?\"\nLiam's expression didn't change. He didn't flinch. He simply took another slow sip of his drink and set it back on the table.\nThen he smiled—but it wasn't a warm smile.\nIt was calculated, icy, with a hint of amusement beneath the surface.\nAnd that smile, combined with the quiet intensity in his gaze, made Stacy freeze.\nThe moment stretched.\nShe looked away for a second, then forced herself to meet his eyes again.\n\"I'm sorry if I said something wrong,\" she said quietly. \"I didn't mean to be invasive. I was just curious.\"\nThis was only the second time she had spent more than a few minutes with Liam. And yet, both times, she had walked away feeling something she hadn't felt in years.\nSmall.\nIt wasn't the car. It wasn't the penthouse. It wasn't even the way he dressed.\nIt was him.\nHe didn't raise his voice. He didn't try to impress her and he didn't flinch under pressure.\nHe just... existed with total control.\nThat not only scared her but it also hurt her pride.\nHer father was the founder of Altimax Holdings, a diversified investment group valued at nearly $10 billion.\nHer mother owned one of the most influential boutique cosmetic empires on the West Coast of the country.\nThrough her parents' networks, Stacy had grown up surrounded by wealth, status, and access. She knew children of senators, CEOs, media barons, and she'd never once felt uncomfortable in a room.\nUntil now.\nAcross from Liam Scott, she felt like she was on trial—and she didn't even know what the case was.\nLiam, for his part, understood exactly what Stacy was feeling.\nShe had made an assumption. That his penthouse meant he came from an elite family. A child of privilege. Someone like her.Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nBut he wasn't.\nHe was just a young man with a secret that no one could comprehend. A secret that gave him more power, wealth, and freedom than most of these families could ever offer.\nStill, he had no intention of correcting her.\nLet her find out the truth in her own time.\nHe stood up smoothly, the chair making no sound as he rose.\n\"Miss Stacy,\" he said with a smile, \"thank you for the drink. But I'll be heading out.\"\nHer eyes widened slightly. \"Wait—\"\n\"I hope we get another chance to talk again,\" he added, his tone calm and final. \"Maybe next time, we can both speak less like investigators... and more like people.\"\nBefore she could respond, he was already walking away.\nHe didn't look back.\nThe door of Crown Ivy Lounge closed behind him, and Stacy sat frozen, staring at the spot where he'd been sitting just seconds ago.\nShe sighed and took a slow sip from her latte, no longer tasting the sweetness.\nA moment later, her phone buzzed. It was a call from one of her friends.\nShe answered, still staring at the table.\n\"Hey,\" she said, her voice a little distant.\n\"Stace, you okay? You sound weird.\"\n\"I just had coffee with someone. And... I can't explain it. He's different.\"\n\"Different how?\"\n\"I don't know,\" she said honestly. \"But I want to find out.\"\n\"If you say he's different, then he must be really special. Anyway, I'm with Alex and the others, and he's telling us something really juicy. Why don't you come over?\"\n\"Sure. Give me a minute.\"\n\"Don't take long, girl,\" the girl on the other end said and hung up.\nStacy sighed as dropped her phone on the table.\n\"Liam Scott. Who are you?\" She muttered to herself.",

      "content": "Chapter 10 - Bored Liam\nEvening — The Rosehill Terrace\nThe warm golden glow of vintage chandeliers lit the soft velvet interior of The Rosehill Terrace, one of Westbridge's most exclusive fine-dining establishments.\nNestled in the heart of the city's cultural district, the restaurant was known for its private booths, rare wine selection, and strict reservation-only policy—frequented mostly by the offspring of CEOs, media moguls, and legacy billionaires.\nAs Stacy opened the door to a private booth, laughter spilled into the hallway.\nInside, a group of six young men and women sat comfortably, sipping drinks and nibbling from shared platters of gourmet appetizers. Everyone in the room was either born into wealth or had connections that made doors open effortlessly.\nAt her entrance, the group greeted her casually. Kristie waved her over with a smile and patted the seat beside her.\n\"Stace! Over here.\"\nStacy smiled and slid into the open spot beside her.\n\"Hey, Kristie.\"\n\"You're just in time. Alex was about to spill something wild he heard from his dad earlier today,\" Kristie said, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.\nAcross the table, Alex Newman—the only son of the regional Vice President of SilverStone Realty—nodded at Stacy politely.\n\"Hi, Stacy.\"\n\"Hi, Alex,\" she replied.\nAs the conversation resumed, Stacy leaned back and folded her arms, her attention half-on the wine glass in front of her. But as Alex began talking, her ears tuned in.\n\"So,\" Alex started again, \"I went to see my dad at his office earlier today, yeah? And when I got there, I saw him standing outside—just... staring at the street like he was waiting for someone important.\"\nKristie frowned. \"Your dad doesn't leave his desk for anyone.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Alex said. \"So I asked him what was up. He said he had just seen off a new VVIP client.\"\nThat got a few raised brows.\n\"My interest kind of faded there,\" Alex continued. \"I figured it was another Saudi prince or aging billionaire.\"\nA couple of the group chuckled.\n\"But then he said something that completely threw me. The client?\" Alex paused for effect. \"He said the guy looked to be around my age. Maybe even younger.\"\nThat shifted the atmosphere immediately. Everyone straightened slightly in their seats.\n\"What?\" someone asked.\n\"Yup. Kid didn't look a day over twenty.\"\nKristie narrowed her eyes. \"A VVIP client at SilverStone? But that means—\"Thɪs updatᴇd by NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nAlex nodded. \"Property worth at least ten mil. Minimum. I asked my dad what kind of property it was, and he didn't give me a number, but he did give me the name.\"\nHe let the suspense hang, knowing he had them right where he wanted them.\nFinally, he said, \"White Clover Residential Complex. Yellow Creek Avenue.\"\nThe reaction was immediate.\nGasps spread around the table. A few mouths fell open in disbelief. Even the server who had just walked by did a double take when he heard the name.\n\"Wait, what?\" Kristie said, stunned. \"That's... That's like the crown jewel of that entire district.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Alex said, visibly pleased with the reaction. \"I thought the same thing. And you know how tight the ownership circle is in Yellow Creek. Even renting there is practically invitation-only.\"\nSomeone else chimed in. \"You need serious political or financial backing just to be considered. And a whole complex?\"\nAlex nodded. \"That's why I kept pressing. Of course, my dad wouldn't say anything. But I did manage to get the receptionist to give me something.\"\nThe table leaned in collectively.\n\"She didn't give me the full name, obviously. But after a lot of persuading—and a small bribe—she told me the guy's first name. Just one word: Liam.\"\nAt that moment, Stacy froze.\nHer grip tightened slightly on the stem of her wine glass, and she turned her head toward Alex.\nHe caught her reaction and smiled knowingly. \"Stacy,\" he said playfully, \"looks like you know something. Curious, are we?\"\nShe tried to keep her expression calm. \"Just surprised, that's all. It's... unexpected.\"\nAlex leaned back. \"Wish I could dig more, but you all know how SilverStone operates. VVIP clients are practically ghosts. I don't want to cause problems for my dad.\"\nEveryone nodded in understanding.\nBut Stacy didn't respond.\nHer mind was racing. Liam... The name was still echoing in her ears.\nShe remembered their conversation from earlier. He had told her he was busy. That he had something important to take care of.\nCould it be...?\nCould that Liam be her Liam?\nThe one who sat across from her this afternoon with such calm composure...?\nShe sipped her drink slowly, trying to appear unfazed. But inside, a storm was brewing.\n***\nLater That Evening — Liam's Penthouse\nLiam lounged on the large sectional sofa, one arm stretched behind his head, the other scrolling lazily through his phone.\nA movie played in the background—something lighthearted he wasn't really watching. He had returned from his outing nearly an hour ago, and time had passed sluggishly since then.\nTruth be told, he was bored.\nAs someone who had spent most of his life working to survive, and had no opportunity to truly live his life, Liam had never truly learned how to have fun. Even now, with nearly a million dollars in his account and a system that gave him passive rewards, he felt strangely... unequipped.\nFor the first time in years, he had no schedule. There was no boss breathing down his neck and no overdue rent or mounting bills to stress over.\nHe was free from everything and yet, here he was, scrolling between news, memes, and online store listings, trying to feel something.\n\"Should I try clubbing tonight?\" he muttered, barely convincing himself.\nThe thought felt foreign. He had never been to a club before. The idea of flashing lights, loud music, and shoulder-to-shoulder crowds didn't appeal to him. At least not alone.\nMore importantly, he didn't want to walk into something unfamiliar without at least one person who knew the scene.\nScratch that idea.\nHis eyes drifted to the screen again.\n\"Maybe I should get a new phone,\" he said aloud.\nThe one he was using was several years old—an Android with a cracked edge and sluggish response times. It had served him faithfully, but it didn't reflect who he was now.\n\"iPhone or Android?\" he pondered.\nHe wasn't loyal to either, and now that he could afford anything he wanted, he decided he'd just walk into a store tomorrow and buy whatever felt good in his hand.\nNo more overthinking.\nEventually, night fell. And despite the luxury surrounding him, the evening passed quietly.\nHe had scrolled through tech articles, played a few rounds on the PS5, and reheated leftovers from earlier. It wasn't thrilling—but it was peaceful.\nStill, the emptiness lingered.\nAs he climbed into bed and pulled the soft, high-thread-count blanket over his shoulders, he stared at the ceiling.\n\"This can't be all I do,\" he murmured.\nHe knew that if he kept isolating himself like this, even paradise would feel like a cage.\n\"Guess I'll have to start socializing. That shouldn't be hard... right?\" he muttered to himself.\nNot wanting to overthink it, Liam closed his eyes and slowly drifted off to sleep.\nTomorrow was another day and he was curiously looking forward to the rewards he would receive. Maybe he will receive a surprise like today. He can only wait and see.",

      "content": "Chapter 11 - Custom Items\nThe soft glow of morning sun spilled through the glass-paneled windows, painting golden streaks across the minimalist interior of Liam's penthouse.\nA faint breeze drifted in through the cracked balcony door, carrying with it the distant sound of the waking city.\nLiam stirred, yawned, and sat up in bed with a calm, easy smile.\nEver since the system had entered his life, mornings had taken on a different tone—no more rush, no alarms, no anxiety.\nI guess this is the effect of having inner peace and no longer having to worry about anything. It feels like freedom.\n\"System,\" he said, voice still groggy. \"Sign-in.\"\nA soft chime rang in his head.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host. You received a custom-made watch: Patek Philippe Calatrava 5196P \"Monarch Edition\", a custom-made suit: Savile Row \"Langford Model\" Two-Piece, a custom-made shoe: George Cleverley \"Churchill Last\" Wholecut.]\n[Items are in the wardrobe.]\n***\n\"...What?\"\nLiam blinked. He had to reread the notification twice before it sunk in.\n\"A custom watch... suit... and shoes?\"\nHe chuckled in disbelief and rubbed his eyes. \"I guess the system's really trying to get me out of the house.\"Thɪs\nStill slightly dazed, he slid out of bed and made his way to the nearly empty, large walk-in wardrobe .\nAs he opened the wardrobe doors, he was greeted by an elegant trio of items that exuded wealth, refinement, and old-world craftsmanship.\nTo the far right sat a modest dark brown cardboard box with a subtle embossed logo and the word Patek printed underneath it in soft ivory. Beside it was a charcoal cotton garment bag, neatly zipped, with Anderson & Sheppard stitched discreetly in white thread on the upper flap. And to the left—a dark green rectangular shoebox with a quiet gold-foil logo that read George Cleverley.\nLiam felt like a kid staring at gifts on Christmas morning.\nHe picked up the Patek Philippe box first.\nLifting the outer shell revealed a polished lacquered presentation box inside, its high-gloss mahogany finish gleaming in the morning light. He opened it, and there it was—the watch.\nIt rested gently on a soft cushion, its platinum case glinting, the slate-grey dial calm and elegant, the white gold Breguet numerals subtle but refined.\nBut what caught his eye even more was what surrounded it: a gold-plated nameplate engraved with the words Monarch Edition, a sealed envelope bearing the Patek seal, and a letter printed on thick cream-colored paper.\nHe opened the envelope and unfolded the certificate within.\n\"Certificate of Origin — Commissioned Piece No. 1 of 1.\nCalatrava 5196P - Monarch Edition\nCreated for: Liam Scott.\"\nThe second letter was from Patek themselves—handwritten, thanking him for \"commissioning a legacy heirloom.\"\nLiam couldn't help but smile.\n\"This is... insane.\"\nHe picked up the watch and slipped it around his wrist. As soon as the clasp snapped into place, information streamed into his mind.\nIt felt... perfect. Balanced. The strap hugged his wrist like it was meant to be there. Not heavy, but definitely present. Every tick felt precise, deliberate—like time itself was moving at Liam's pace now.\nHe took it off gently and placed it back in its case.\nNow for the suit.\nHe unzipped the Anderson & Sheppard garment bag and slowly pulled out the suit resting inside. Midnight navy. Wool so soft it almost felt like cashmere, and yet there was a strength in the weave that spoke of legacy.\nHe nodded, impressed despite himself.\n\"Never thought I'd wear something like this.\"\nLastly, he turned to the shoebox.\nHe lifted the lid to reveal two flannel bags, oxblood in color, soft to the touch. Inside were a pair of breathtaking wholecut oxfords—smooth, seamless, and flawless.\n\"System,\" he muttered, \"you're really outdoing yourself.\"\n[I'm glad you like them, Host.]\n\"Like them? I love them.\"\nFor a moment, he just stood there, staring at the items like they were museum pieces.\nHe didn't need to know luxury to understand quality. He could feel it.\nAs for their costs? Watch: $600,000+, Suit: $14,000, Shoes: $8,000. This brings everything to a total cost of $622,000 in custom craftsmanship resting quietly in his wardrobe.\nAnd not a dollar had left his account.\nIt really feels good to have nice things.\nWith a gleam in his eye, he headed to the bathroom. He wants to take his bath and try on the suit.\n***\nForty Minutes Later\nLiam stood in front of the full-length mirror.\nThe suit fit like it had been sewn on his body thread by thread. The midnight navy color complemented his skin tone, giving him a mature, composed look.\nThe subtle sheen of the wool caught the light just enough, never loud, always reserved. The shoulders framed him perfectly, and the forward-cut sleeves gave him a commanding silhouette.\nThe George Cleverley wholecuts grounded the look—giving him an elegant, yet quietly powerful look.\nAnd on his wrist, the Patek Philippe Monarch Edition completed the ensemble. Making him look refined, regal and unapologetic.\nOverall, he looked... timeless.\nHis short dark hair was neatly styled. His ocean-blue eyes seemed sharper, more piercing in contrast to the deep navy of the suit. His build—slender but athletic—carried the suit well.\nFor the first time, he didn't just look like he belonged in the room.\nHe looked like he owned the room.\nLiam adjusted his cuffs, glanced down at his shoes, then back at the mirror.\n\"Damn,\" he murmured, smirking. \"I clean up nice.\"\nNice. I have the outfit, all I need is an occasion.\nThen, unbidden, a face flashed in his mind.\nStacy's.\nHe chuckled softly and shook his head.\n\"With the way our last conversation ended, I won't be surprised if she calls soon with another 'casual' invite.\"\nHe had no plans yet and no event to attend. But now, if something came up... he was ready.\nFor now, he slipped off the suit, the shoe and the watch and began preparing himself something to eat.\n***\nEarly noon.\nThe door to the penthouse opened and Liam walked in. He dropped small shopping bag with Apple logo on the sofa, as he equally sank into it.\nHe was about to start setting up his phone when his buzzed. He checked it and he saw that it was a message from Stacy.\n\"Hi. Sorry for yesterday. I want to invite you out for dinner or a drink, to apologize for my lack of manners. I hope you will accept my apology.\"\nHe had already expected her to send a message, so he wasn't exactly surprised. But he didn't reply immediately, as he set up his new phone first.\nAfter he was done with the phone setup, he decided to reply. He had thought about it and he decided to accept her invitation, as he has nothing to do at home.\n\"Either are fine by me. Give me a time and location, and I will be there.\"\nImmediately, he received a response from her.\n\"Thanks for replying and accepting my apology. There's a great diner downtown—Noir & Thyme. Let's meet there, 6pm?\"\n\"Sure. I will be there.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\nLiam sighed, dropping his phone on the sofa. He had already gotten himself a new phone—iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nIt felt kind of strange causally spending more than $1,000 on a phone. Just three days ago, he was at the end of his wits. But all that has changed.\nIt felt strange and surreal to say the least. But he was enjoying it.",

      "content": "Chapter 12 - Dinner With Stacy\nThe sun had just dipped below the skyline, leaving behind hues of violet and gold streaking across Westbridge's twilight horizon.\nDowntown had begun to buzz with nightlife energy with streetlamps flickering to life, valet attendants moving with very admirable skills, and luxury cars gliding into sleek parking bays.\nLiam pulled up in front of Noir & Thyme, the discreet but famous high-end diner tucked between a boutique wine cellar and a glass art gallery.\nThe restaurant's signature brushed steel signage was barely noticeable unless you knew what to look for. Only those in the know ever found their way here.\nHe stepped out of his car, adjusting the lapel of his midnight navy Langford suit. His Patek watch gleamed faintly in the low light as he tugged down his cuff.\nThe George Cleverley oxfords made not a sound as he walked toward the entrance, giving him a light-footed elegance.\nOnce inside, the atmosphere enveloped him like a velvet curtain—dimly lit chandeliers, jazz filtering in from a baby grand piano, and the subtle scent of truffle oil and aged wood.\nA hostess greeted him with a soft smile.\n\"Welcome to Noir & Thyme, sir. Did you make a reservation?\"\n\"No. Stacy Burton.\"\nThe hostess gave a knowing nod.\n\"Private Booth 3, just down the corridor,\" she said.\nLiam gave a quiet thanks and made his way through the plush aisle. He spotted the booth quickly.\nThe semi-enclosed seating offered privacy without feeling claustrophobic. Inside, Stacy sat upright, dressed in an elegant deep emerald dress that hugged her form tastefully.\nHer hair was done in loose waves, and a soft gold pendant rested just above her collarbone.\nShe looked up as the door creaked open, her posture tensing slightly—then relaxed immediately when she saw him.\n\"Hey,\" she said with a smile, her voice warm but cautious.\n\"Hi,\" Liam replied, stepping in and closing the door softly behind him. He took the seat opposite her.\n\"Thanks for coming,\" she said, sincerity in her tone.\n\"It's no problem.\"\n\"I didn't order yet,\" she added quickly. \"I wanted to wait for you.\"\nLiam nodded, reaching for the leather-bound menu.\nAs he began to glance through the options, Stacy took the opportunity to study him. Her eyes roamed his outfit, subtle but practiced—observing the fabric, the cut of the suit, the clean lines, and above all, the absence of any logos.\nThere were no peacock labels, no overdone watches with diamonds on it screaming for attention.\nAs someone that's used to high-class fashion, she didn't need to ask as she already knew. The suit wasn't off-the-rack. The watch wasn't mass-produced. She didn't even recognize the leather, but she could tell they weren't ordinary.\n\"He's either from serious money,\" she thought, \"or... something else entirely.\"\nBefore she could dwell or stare at him too long, as she didn't want a repeat of yesterday.\nThe next moment, a waitress stepped into the booth, tablet in hand.\nStacy smiled and gave her order quickly—white truffle pasta, the establishment's specialty.\nLiam ordered the honey-glazed lamb with rosemary risotto.\nWith a bow, the waitress left them in silence.\n\"You look great,\" Stacy said, her voice soft, eyes sincere.\n\"Thanks,\" Liam replied, returning the smile. \"You look beautiful.\"\n\"Really? Thank you. I wasn't sure what to wear but... I wanted to look nice.\"\nHe gave a slight nod, saying nothing more.\nStacy chuckled under her breath. \"You're not very talkative, are you?\"\n\"I don't usually have much to say.\"\n\"Fair enough,\" she said, leaning back slightly.\nShe picked up her glass of sparkling water and took a slow sip.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"thank you again for meeting me. I honestly wasn't sure you'd say yes after how I acted the other day.\"\n\"It's fine.\"\n\"No,\" she insisted. \"It wasn't. I was prying. You didn't owe me anything and I came at you like I was conducting an interview.\"\n\"You've already apologized, so it's fine,\" Liam said.\nShe laughed quietly, relieved that he wasn't holding it against her. \"I blame my curiosity. It's gotten me into trouble more times than I care to admit.\"\nLiam raised an eyebrow slightly. \"That a habit of yours?\"\n\"Kind of,\" she shrugged. \"But in my defense, Noir & Thyme has a way of loosening tongues. I was really looking forward to tonight. Their truffle pasta and honey-glazed lamb? Unreal. And I really needed a break anyway. My week has been chaos—two family dinners, three charity events, and my best friend blowing up my phone over something that probably wasn't even important.\"\n\"Sounds intense,\" Liam said.\n\"You have no idea. I nearly lost it. How about you? How was your week?\"\nLiam thought for a second, his gaze lowering slightly as flashes of the past few days crossed his mind—credit alerts, luxury deliveries, the absurdly perfect suit he's wearing, and a mysterious system changing his life.\n\"It's been great,\" he said, keeping his answer simple.\nStacy tilted her head. \"See, this is what I mean. You say one sentence and somehow I end up with more questions. You're impossible to figure out.\"\nLiam gave a slight smile. \"Is that so?\"\nShe laughed again. \"Okay, okay. I won't pry. I promise.\"\nShe paused, tapping a finger lightly on the rim of her glass. \"I'm kind of curious to know what do you do for fun.\"\nLiam blinked, then chuckled.\n\"Nothing really. I'm new here. I mostly stay indoors. My social circle is nonexistent.\"\n\"Seriously?\"\n\"Seriously.\"\nShe blinked in surprise, not hiding it. \"You don't go out? Clubs? Art walks? Beach drives?\"\n\"Nope.\"\nShe sat back, thoughtful. Then her lips curved into a sly smile. \"That's... unexpected. But lucky for you, you've just met someone who can fix that.\"\n\"Oh?\"\n\"My friends and I have a private gathering tonight. Drinks, conversation, music—nothing too crazy. If you're free, I could introduce you.\"\nLiam looked at her for a moment, considering. Then nodded. \"Sure. I'd like that.\"\nHer smile widened. \"Great. We'll head out after dinner.\"\nTheir food arrived moments later.\nThe plates were artfully arranged—Liam's honey-glazed lamb rested beside a bed of herbed risotto, with charred asparagus layered on top. A drizzle of fig reduction added color and flavor.\nStacy's truffle pasta glistened under the overhead lighting, thinly shaved white truffle curled over ribbons of handmade fettuccine in a creamy pecorino base.\nBoth dishes were fragrant, warm, and elegantly portioned.Thɪs updatᴇd by NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nThe two ate in companionable silence for the first few minutes, savoring their food. Between bites, they occasionally glanced at each other, the energy between them more relaxed now.\nStacy had kept her promise as she didn't ask any invasive questions. And Liam, enjoyed the meal and the company.\nWhen the plates were cleared and dessert was politely declined, Stacy signaled for the bill. Liam opened his mouth, but she stopped him with a quick wave.\n\"My treat. This was my apology dinner, remember?\"\nHe smiled but said nothing, allowing her the gesture. But in his mind, he made a decision that if the night goes well, he will invite her out for dinner some day.\nAs they stepped out of the restaurant into the cool evening air, Stacy turned to him.\n\"I'll drive ahead. You can follow behind me. It's not far.\"\n\"Got it.\"\nThey walked toward their cars, the street quiet save for the occasional passing vehicle. Liam slid into his seat, fired up the engine, and began to follow Stacy's silver coupe as it pulled away from the curb.\nAnd just like that, a quiet dinner had turned into something else entirely.\nLiam didn't know what the night would bring but he was curiously looking forward to it.",

      "content": "Chapter 13 - Stacy's Friends\nUnderground Parking Lot, Eclipse West Nightclub.\nThe tires of Liam's car rolled to a soft stop beside Stacy's silver coupe in the dimly lit underground garage.\nAmbient lighting glowed faintly along the ceiling beams, casting a cool hue over the polished concrete and accentuating the sleekness of the vehicles parked in the exclusive VIP zone.\nLiam stepped out, tugging lightly at the front of his midnight navy Langford suit. The motion adjusted the jacket just right over his chest, letting the soft fabric settle against his frame.\nHe exhaled slowly, still not entirely used to the idea of entering a nightclub. When Stacy told him that her friends were having a gathering, she didn't tell him that it was at a nightclub.\nIt felt kind of strange coming to a place like this and he's really looking forward to the experience.\n\"Liam,\" Stacy's voice called out warmly.\nShe stood a few feet away, her figure silhouetted against the soft parking light. She looked effortlessly chic in the dark sapphire dress she's wearing, paired with a simple clutch and heels.\nHe walked over to her, matching her pace as they approached a guarded door in the corner.\n\"This underground parking lot is for the establishment's VIP members only,\" Stacy explained, glancing sideways at him as they walked. \"You skip the main entrance and the lines this way. It's... quieter.\"\nLiam nodded. He appreciated the explanation, but more so, he appreciated the way she gave it without arrogance.\nWhen they had driven past the main entrance earlier, he'd caught a glimpse of the crowd—a long line of people waiting their turn, phones in hand, bouncers managing chaos. Compared to this private route, it looked like a different world.\nHe was slowly gaining some understanding of how things work among the rich. He did feel that it was nice though—the preferential treatment.\nMoney really does open doors\n.\nThe doorman—an older, stocky man in a sharp black suit—recognized Stacy immediately and without a word, he opened the door for both of them.\nThey stepped into a silent hallway. The space was narrow, with matte black walls and recessed lighting that lit the path without being obtrusive. At the end stood a sleek black security door, flush with the wall and completely unmarked except for a small card reader.\nStacy pulled out a slim black card with the club's logo in glossy emboss. She tapped it against the reader and soft beep sounded.\nShe opened the door and held it slightly for Liam, who stepped in behind her.\nOn the other side was a wide corridor, surprisingly well-lit, with several heavy soundproof doors lining either side. To Liam,it looked more like the luxury suite corridor at a five-star hotel than anything he'd imagined a nightclub to be.\n\"Our booth's this way,\" Stacy said.\nThey walked down a few steps and reached one of the doors, which Stacy opened with a gentle push.\nInside, the booth was a lounge suite of its own—large enough to accommodate ten people comfortably. There was a long L-shaped velvet banquette in charcoal grey wrapping around a matte black cocktail table, soft ambient lights hanging above, and a backlit bar shelf along the wall showcasing premium liquors under gold-tinted glass.\nSeated on the lounge were six other people—young men and women in their late teens to early twenties, all dressed like they'd walked out of a fashion magazine. They were mid-conversation and mid-laugh when the door opened. The room fell silent almost instantly.\nAll heads turned toward the door.\nThey saw Stacy first. Then, an unfamiliar male in elegant attire standing beside her.\nThey immediately got curious to know Liam's identity and how he's related to Stacy.\n\"Stacy...\" Kristie, her best friend, raised an eyebrow, her tone halfway between surprise and admiration.\n\"Guys,\" Stacy said brightly, turning slightly. \"This is Liam. Liam, meet my friends.\"\nA pause and all of their attention were focused squarely on Liam.\nStacy saw their expressions—the wide eyes, the flickering recognition, the hushed curiosity. She smiled faintly to herself. Just as she'd expected. After Alex told them about the owner of White Clover Residential Complex, the name Liam was beginning to mean something in their social circle. And whether this Liam was the one who owned the property or not, the way he carried himself would make people assume he was.\n\"Liam,\" she gestured to the lounge. \"Go ahead, make yourself comfortable.\"\nLiam nodded once and took a seat at the far corner beside a young man who looked a little older than him, probably twenty-two or twenty-three.\nHe gave the guy a polite nod. The other man, trying to remain casual, nodded back, though his curiosity was practically radiating off him.\nStacy slid into the open spot beside Kristie.\nKristie, for her part, was watching Liam like he was a living riddle she couldn't wait to solve.\nSensing the tension tightening like a string, Stacy gave a quick cough.\n\"Guys, you're all staring. You're going to make him uncomfortable.\"\nThe spell broke and a round of sheepish chuckles filled the booth. The guy beside Liam coughed into his fist and finally turned.\n\"Sorry, man,\" he said with a smile. \"Your name just... sounded really familiar. Didn't mean to stare.\"\n\"It's fine,\" Liam said easily, his voice calm but warm. \"I've been attracting a lot of curious gazes lately.\"\nStacy coughed again—this time awkwardly—and looked away. She definitely felt targeted.\nThe guy chuckled. \"Fair enough.\"\nHe extended a hand. \"Name's Kristopher.\"ᴛhis ᴜpdated by NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\n\"Liam,\" he replied, shaking it.\nThe rest of the group took that as their cue. One after the other, they introduced themselves—Lana, Alex, Elise, Matt, Harper, and finally Kristie.\nLiam acknowledged them all with a nod or a polite smile.\n\"You guys haven't ordered yet?\" Stacy asked after settling in.\n\"We have,\" Kristopher replied. \"They should be bringing it out in a few.\"\nStacy leaned back, crossing one leg over the other. \"Alright then.\"\n\"So, Liam,\" Kristie asked, tilting her head, \"how did you and Stacy meet?\"\nStacy winced. Of course that was the first question. It was a logical and expected one, but it didn't do anything to lessen the second-hand embarrassment that hit her when she remembered the cringiness of her first interaction with Liam.\nLiam didn't miss the subtle shift in Stacy's expression. He gave the faintest smile and answered, \"We live in the same complex.\"\nEveryone nodded subtly in understanding when they heard Liam's response. It wasn't unexpected but they couldn't help but feel that there was indeed some kind of history between the two of them.\n\"Then you must be new to the place?\" Kristie pressed, this time with a genuine smile.\n\"Yeah,\" Liam said simply.\nHearing this, everyone nodded again. But it made them even more curious and confused as to how Liam and Stacy knew each so fast.\nThis was especially so for Stacy. She was very confused.\nAs Stacy's friends, they are aware of her character and the fact that she barely interact with anyone in the complex. But since she invited Liam here, then there was something more to it.\nStill, they didn't pry further. They shifted the topic back to why they were here in the first place—a casual celebratory gathering.\nJust then, the door to the booth opened and two hostesses walked in, balancing trays lined with tall glasses of gold-flecked cocktails and artfully arranged appetizers",

      "content": "Chapter 14 - A Good Time\nThe low lighting reflected off the polished rims, casting glints onto the matte black cocktail table in the center of the lounge booth.\nEveryone fell silent, watching as the trays were gently placed on the table.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nOne tray carried a spread of luxurious appetizers: Mini Lobster Sliders, served on butter-toasted brioche buns with Maine lobster tail, tarragon aioli, and microgreens arranged like edible lace; Truffle Duck Croquettes, golden-brown crisp shells hiding the creamy black truffle béchamel center; Chilled Oysters nestled on a bed of crushed ice, paired with a yuzu mignonette and freshly shaved horseradish snow; and Wagyu Skewers, each bite-sized cube of A5 wagyu lightly glazed in sesame and topped with edible gold flakes.\nThe second tray held elegant flutes and tumblers, filled and ready to be poured: Cristal Rosé Champagne, its faint blush hue shimmering under the ambient light; Lychee Royale, pale and floral with a subtle fizz of champagne and elderflower liqueur; Black Gold Manhattans, rimmed with gold dust and served over a perfect sphere of clear ice; Noir Espresso Martinis, their rich aroma already energizing the air with cold-brewed espresso and vanilla vodka; and finally, a few Cucumber Cloud cocktails—delicate green layers topped with cucumber foam and mint sprigs.\nThe entire spread was more art gallery than meal, and Liam couldn't help but blink. He'd never seen party food this refined, and it felt surreal to sit at a table with people who thought this was normal.\nKristopher clapped his hands lightly, calling everyone's attention.\n\"Now that the drinks and food are here...\" He stood, his expression lighting up. \"It's time.\"\nHe turned slightly toward Liam. \"Liam, I'm not sure if Stacy gave you the full picture, but we're here tonight to celebrate our friend Matt.\"\nHe gestured toward a young man on the other side of the booth. Matt smiled and nodded modestly.\n\"He's graduating from Harvard next month and will be taking a position in the family business.\"\nThe announcement was met with cheers, raised glasses, and a round of enthusiastic congratulations.\nLiam also nodded and clapped in congratulations. Graduation was massive. He felt vaguely envious as he would also love to go to uni. But that feeling was vague and fleeting, as it disappeared immediately.\nKristopher sat back down and Matt stood, giving a small bow. \"Thank you,\" he said sincerely, his voice carrying clearly despite the muffled bass of music beyond the booth walls. \"It really means a lot.\"\nHe paused, lifting his glass before continuing. \"Graduation, to most people, means you're finally done with school. But for me, it means my family now expects me to be responsible. It means I've crossed a checkpoint—not a finish line.\"\nHe smiled faintly and glanced around at his friends. \"What really matters is how I perform once I'm handed the position. The pressure is real, but I'm ready. I want to earn my stripes, maybe even grow a subsidiary into something serious.\"\nA few approving claps followed, and Matt bowed his head once more. \"Thanks for being here. Let's get the party started.\"\nWith that, he took the bottle of Cristal Rosé, popped the cork with a practiced twist, and began pouring.\nHe started with himself, then moved glass by glass, making sure everyone had a pour. When he reached Liam, he smiled and offered the flute with both hands—a small but respectful gesture.\n\"Thanks,\" Liam said, accepting it with a nod.\nThe toast was unceremonious but genuine—just a collective raising of glasses before the conversation shifted back to casual chatter.\nLiam sipped only a little, more out of social decorum than interest. This would be his first time taking alcohol and he doesn't want to take too much. He was already taking in too much: the setting, the food, the people, the energy.\nHe reached for one of the Mini Lobster Sliders and took a bite. The taste was divine—sweet, briny, and buttery. The lobster practically melted against the warmth of the brioche.\nThe others were chatting, laughing, teasing Matt about what kind of suit he'd wear on his first day.\nLiam watched, listened. He smiled when he felt appropriate and nodded along when drawn into conversation. But mostly, he observed.\nTo his surprise, he didn't feel out of place.\nThey weren't performing for each other. No one was trying to impress. Despite the elite surroundings and background, the group's vibe was genuine. Even their interest in him felt natural, not forced.\nHe could read people. It was second nature to him after all he had seen and survived. And these kids, privileged or not, were sincere tonight.\nIt was wildly different from the world he knew—the cold streets filled with betrayals. People there wanted something from you.\nHere, no one asked what he did. No one asked what car he drove. Not even when he walked in wearing a suit worth more than some people's annual rent.\nHe sipped a bit more champagne, tasted a truffle croquette, and let himself settle into the plush velvet seat.\nAcross the table, Stacy caught his eye and smiled.\nHe gave her a soft nod in return.\nThe hours passed quickly.\nBetween conversations about travel, business school gossip, upcoming summer plans, Liam found himself relaxing.\nMatt remained the center of attention, as he should be. His friends toasted him, teased him, joked about him messing up his family's legacy within the first month.\nHe took it all with grace and humor, and Liam respected that.\nEventually, the food trays were mostly empty, the drinks reduced to melting ice and foam traces. The room had mellowed, the music outside slightly louder now that the night was deep.\nStacy checked the time on her phone and let out a quiet laugh. \"It's almost midnight.\"\nKristie yawned. \"I can't believe I stayed up this long without checking my messages.\"\n\"No one here's driving tonight, right?\" Kristopher asked, glancing around.\nEveryone shook their heads.\n\"Cool. Then I say we crash at the Montreve.\"\nThere was a general chorus of agreement. The Montreve was a luxury boutique hotel next door—practically part of the Eclipse West ecosystem. Most of them had pre-booked suites anyway.\nEven Liam found himself nodding. He hadn't expected to be included in the plan, but no one even questioned it.\nThey stood, stretching, chatting about who got which room when Stacy nudged Liam gently.\n\"Come on,\" she said. \"You're staying too, right?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nShe smiled, pleased.\nThey left the booth and walked out into the private hallway, the energy calmer now than when they arrived.\nOutside, the chill had deepened. The valet took their cars to be parked overnight and a staff member from the hotel helped arrange check-ins.\nWithin fifteen minutes, everyone had filed into their respective suites.\n***\nMontreve Hotel – Liam's Room\nLiam stepped out of the bathroom, a soft towel slung around his neck. The shower had helped. He felt clean, warm, and strangely... happy.\nHe hadn't expected to enjoy the night. In truth, he thought there'd be tension. Jealousy. Passive aggression.\nBut there was none of that. No family names dropped, no boasting, no hidden claws. Just a group of privileged kids treating him like one of their own.\nHe collapsed onto the bed, letting his body sink into the sheets.\nHe thought about Stacy. About Kristopher. About Matt's speech. And about how he, the guy with the mysterious system, had managed to fit in for once without effort.\nThe group's dynamic made him see Stacy in a new light.\nHe still didn't know what this new life would bring.\nBut tonight, for the first time in four years, he didn't feel alone.\nWith a content smile, Liam closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.",

He picked up his phone from the nightstand and he saw that he has a couple of missed calls from Stacy and some messages.\n\"Hey, I came to check up on you but I got no response after knocking for a while. We are already leaving. Take care of yourself. Please call me if you need anything. Once again, thank you for yesterday. And my friends like you. We hope to see you around more often.\"\nLiam smiled and dropped his phone back on the nightstand. He had no idea that Stacy had this side to her.\nDue to how popular she was back in middle school and high school, he had thought that she would be proud, narcissistic and arrogant. But surprisingly, she's of really good character.\nI guess my viewpoint was too narrow.\nHe sighed, as he slowly got out of bed and went to the bathroom to freshen up for the day.\nAfter he was done with that, he called for establishment's front desk to arrange something for him to eat.\nWhile he waited, he decided to sign-in for the day.\n\"System, sign-in.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host. You received $1,500,000, a skill: World-Class Etiquette, a skill: Formless Combat Doctrine.]\nLiam was a little taken aback by the rewards but after everything that he has experienced in the past four days, he quickly regained his composure.\nThe next moment, his phone buzzed with a credit alert from his bank. He picked up his phone, clicked on the message and checked his balance, and he saw that it has skyrocketed to more than $2.3 million!\nIt was a crazy amount—an amount that Liam never thought he would have in his life and at such a young age.\nHe couldn't help but stare at his account balance, speechless for a while.\nIt's crazy how things had changed so much in less than a week.\nLiam smiled and turned his attention to the two skills he received and he learned them. Immediately, their description flowed into his head.\n[World-Class Etiquette: This skill allows the user to instinctively embody the correct behavior, posture, manners, speech tone, dress code, and cultural nuances expected in any environment.]\n[Formless Combat Doctrine: This skill embodies the ability to adapt instinctively to any close-quarters threat using fluid, evolving techniques that draw from dozens of martial philosophies—then transcend them.]\n\"Wow!\" Liam muttered in shock when he read the description of the second skill.\nHe felt happy receiving them—even though he has no idea when he will get to use the combat skill. But it felt nice having it. It gave him a sense of security.\nBut he was especially happy receiving the first skill because he knew that he will be needing it.\nEven now, a couple of combat scenarios were going on in his head and the skill was already proving its world.\nWith how fast his wealth is growing, so will his status and that means that he will be invited to some circles. With the skill, he won't behave like a total greenhorn.\nWonderful rewards as always. The System never disappoints.\nLiam smiled and picked up his phone. He hasn't replied Stacy's messages or returned her calls since he woke up, and it was only right he did so.\nHe replied her message, thanking her for checking in on him and for the previous night. He told her that he enjoyed her and her friends' company, and he would love to meet them again.\nAfter he sent the message, he collapsed on his bed and he started thinking of what to do for the day.The most update n0vels are published on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nHis thoughts was disrupted the following moment by a series of knock on his door.\n\"Come on in. It's open,\" he said.\nThe door opened slowly and a female staff in uniform pushed a good trolley inside.\n***\nFew minutes later, Liam was done eating and had rested for a few minutes.\nIt was now time to leave the\nWith a satisfied smile on his face, he picked up his car key and his suit jacket, and left the room, and made his way to the front desk.\nHe took care of things at the front desk and left the boutique hotel, before making his way to the underground parking lot where his car was parked.\nWhen he got there, he saw this car and a couple of other cars there. He got into his and started driving home.\nWhen Liam got home, the first he did was to take off the suit and the watch, and change into something more comfortable.\nAfter he was done with that, he went to the living room to relax. He has already thought of what to do for the day and nothing came to mind.\nHe turned on the TV to continue watching the series he had been watching. But after a couple of seconds, he wasn't really into it.\nHis thoughts drifted to the system and the sign-in function, and he got curious about something.\n\"System, what happens if I don't sign-in for a day or more?\"\n[It accumulates and when you use your accumulated sign-ins, there's a higher chance for you to receive even better rewards.]\n\"Even better rewards?\" Liam was taken aback by the system's response. \"You mean there are even better rewards than what I've been receiving so far?\"\n[Absolutely, Host.]\n\"Insane!\"\nIn just five days, he has received a total of $2.4 million in cash reward, a luxury sport car, a penthouse that one would millions to dollars and connection to acquire and a residential complex of immense value!\nAnd yet, the system is telling him that there are even better rewards!\nNow, Liam was very curious to know what these rewards would be. But the question was if he would be wiling to accumulate his sign-in for them?\nAs for the answer? Well... No. Not yet, at least.\nIt could be said that Liam was still exploring the system and his curiosity for the sign-in rewards for each day was burning bright. And he's yet to receive his weekly sign-in rewards.\nMaybe after the next weekly sign-in after this, he will start accumulating. But what was certain was that he won't be doing so it anytime soon.\nBuzz!\nLiam's phone buzzed, bringing him out of his thoughts. He checked his phone and he saw that it was a message from Stacy.\nStacy: \"Thank you for accepting my invitation yesterday and I'm glad you enjoyed yourself yesterday. I will definitely invite you whenever we have a gathering next time.\"\nLiam: \"Sure, I will be looking forward to it.\"\nStacy: \"Before I forget, they want your contact. You don't mind me giving them, right?\"\nLiam: \"No. Not at all.\"\nHe likes their character and has deemed them as good people, and he wants to be friends with them. There was no reason for him to stop Stacy from giving them his contact.\nStacy: \"Thanks. They will be elated.\"\nLiam smiled at the message. He was also looking forward to meeting them again.\nA/N: Please show your support by voting for the book with power stones. Your comments and reviews are also appreciated.

Even though he had spent it doing nothing but watching movies and playing games, it was very relaxing.\nHe got out of bed and walked to the bathroom.\nFew minutes later, he was out. He put on his clothes and went to the living room to continue the game he was playing before he went to bed yesterday.\nIt was a new game that he had just bought yesterday and it has a very exciting storyline.\nHe took his seat and turned on his gaming console. While he waited for it to load, he decided to sign-in for the day.\n\"System, sign-in.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host. You received a skill: World-Class Culinary Arts, a skill: Perfect Memory, +5 Attribute Points.]\nWow!

But while he did feel that he had grown stronger, he has no idea just how strong he is and how he compares to others.\n[The highest a human can achieve without any form of enhancement is 20 Points in all attributes.]\n\"Without any form of enhancement, what does that mean?\" Liam asked curiously.\nEven without the system's answer, he already had a suspicion.\n[Enhancement likes serums for implants for boosting strengths and other attributes.]\n\"Exactly as I had suspected. But are such enhancement possible? Thing like that only only happen in movies and stories,\" he muttered slowly, as he thought of the possibility.\nWho am I kidding? I have a mysterious system that's giving me wealth and skills, and also increasing my strength. So, who said that something like that can't exist? Besides, technology has advanced so far and AI has grown to the point that things are becoming scary.\nLiam thought of this and sighed. He decided to stop overthinking things that doesn't concern him—at least for the moment.Follow current novᴇls on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nHe turned his attention back to the attribute points and assigned them accordingly. This time around, he assigned two points to his Strength and his Stamina, and one to his Agility.\nAnd just like the first time, he felt that warm current course through his body. But this time, it wasn't as vauge as before and he could almost feel it properly.\nHe felt it flow from a unknown region in his body and spreading throughout his body.\nThe feeling disappeared right after that, but Liam could feel that he had grown stronger than before.\nHe came clenched his fist and he felt like it was packed with explosive power, giving the illusionary feeling that he could punch through the wall without a problem.\nLiam naturally didn't want to test his strength on the walls of his penthouse.\nShould I visit a gym?\nHe thought about it but ultimately decided against it.\nWell, I'm hungry. Let me make myself something to eat.\nLiam smiled to himself as he stood up from the couch and went to the kitchen. Since he received a world class skill related to cooking, he definitely has to try it out.\nHe stepped into the kitchen with a new kind of confidence.\nThe moment he opened the fridge, his eyes scanned the contents with precise clarity. Ingredients he'd normally overlook now seemed full of potential. Chicken thighs. Fresh garlic. Jasmine rice. A carton of cream. Lemons. Thyme. Butter.\nHis fingers moved automatically. He grabbed what he needed and set everything on the marble countertop. There was no recipes or second-guessing, as the World-Class Culinary Arts skill had already taken over.\nHe rinsed the jasmine rice until the water ran clear, then soaked it briefly. Meanwhile, he prepped the chicken—deboning the thighs with near surgical precision, scoring the skin lightly to ensure crispness.\nHe seasoned with salt, cracked black pepper, a dash of paprika, and just enough lemon zest to lift the aroma.\nNext came the pan—he set it to medium-high and added a touch of butter and olive oil. As the pan warmed, he began slicing garlic paper-thin and dicing shallots like a chef in a Michelin kitchen.\nThe chicken went skin-side down first, the sizzle releasing a mouthwatering scent almost instantly. He didn't rush. Just let it render and crisp slowly. While that cooked, he started the rice: toasting it lightly in butter with the shallots, then adding water and a pinch of salt before covering it with a tight lid.\nHe flipped the chicken with a flick of the wrist—perfect golden brown.\nOnce done, he deglazed the pan with a splash of cream and lemon juice, tossing in the garlic and thyme to build a quick pan sauce. The fragrance alone made his stomach growl.\nTen minutes later, everything was plated with care. Not fancy, just clean and composed—seared chicken on a bed of aromatic jasmine rice, drizzled with lemon-garlic cream sauce and topped with fresh herbs.\nLiam sat at the counter, took a bite, and blinked.\n\"...Damn,\" he muttered, chewing slowly.\nThe flavors were deep yet balanced. Creamy, citrusy, savory. The rice was soft but not mushy. The chicken? Juicy and flavorful with that perfect crunch on the skin.\nThis was the best chicken he has eaten. Ever.\nHe smiled to himself. The skill wasn't just technical. It had intuition built into it.\nI love you, system.\nSystem: [.....]",

      "content": "Chapter 17 - Reminisce, Clarity\nThe day passed uneventfully for Liam and it was already evening. He stood up from the sofa and did a stretch, to loosen his stiff body.\nHe has been seated in front of the TV all day, focused on the new game and trying to complete.\nIt hasn't been easy though. The game is just as difficult as its name.\nThe people that makes these soul games are masochistics. No one can tell me otherwise.\nBut I guess I'm a bigger one for not giving up.\n\"Haaa,\" Liam let out a lengthy sigh.\nHe looked at his phone and saw that it was past 6.\nI've been playing for more than 9 hours. Wow. I should go get some fresh air.\nHe walked to the door and picked up his car key, and left the penthouse. He decided to get some fresh air by taking an evening drive around town.\n***\nLiam drove out of the estate and drove down the road, with no destination in mind. As he drove, he thought of places to go to spend a quiet evening.\nHe wasn't hungry, neither does he want to talk to anyone or really do anything in particular. What he really need is to enjoy his newfound wealth with peaceful quiet and the beautiful sound of nature.\nAs he thought of that, he decided to go to the beach. It was the best place he could think of.\nA few minutes later, he arrived there. He parked his car appropriately and walked towards the roaring ocean in the distance.\nIt was already getting late and the sun was about to set, so the beach was mostly free of people.\nLiam slowly walked towards the shore and stopped a couple of distance from it. He saw a small rock or boulder a few distance from him and walked towards it, and sat down.\nHe smiled as he watched the ocean's rhythm—the gentle swash creeping up the sand, carrying bits of the sea with it, before the backwash pulled it away again, dragging coarse grains of shore back into the waves.\nA cool breeze moved through the air, tinged with salt and the faint scent of seaweed. The cry of distant seagulls echoed overhead, sharp but not unpleasant, occasionally rising above the soft rustle of the wind.\nTo his left, the sun hovered low on the horizon, painting streaks of orange, pink, and violet across the water. The sky deepened by the minute, shifting toward a dark blue dome scattered with the first hints of stars.\nNearby, a cluster of rocks jutted from the shoreline, and the water slapped gently against them, creating a rhythmic splash like nature's slow heartbeat. Tiny crabs skittered across the wet sand, vanishing into holes as the tide swept forward again.\nHe could hear the hushed laughter of a couple walking far down the shore, their voices blurred by distance and the constant whisper of waves. The beach wasn't crowded—just a few scattered souls taking in the quiet beauty of twilight.\nIt was peaceful. Very peaceful indeed.\nLiam thought of something and he took off his footwear, stood up from the boulder, and walked barefooted to the shore.\nThe moment his soles touched the cool sand, a shiver went up his spine—but it wasn't from the cold. It was something deeper. The grains were soft in some places, compact in others, and scattered with the occasional shell or smooth pebble. Each step grounded him, pulled him further from his thoughts and deeper into the present.\nThe sand clung to his feet as he walked, and with each step closer to the water, it grew cooler, damper. He could feel it sinking slightly under his weight, hugging his heels. The breeze tousled his hair gently, and he inhaled deeply, filling his lungs with the briny air.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nA few paces more and the first wave kissed his toes.\nHe stilled.\nThe water was cold but not unpleasant—like the shock of a cold towel on a warm day. It rushed forward gently in a frothy sheet, curling around his ankles, before pulling back with a soft suction that tugged at the sand beneath his feet. He could feel the ground shifting under him, eroding with each retreat, leaving his heels more exposed, more sunken.\nThe tide came again, a little stronger, splashing against his shins this time. He closed his eyes.\nThe sensation was oddly purifying and satisfying.\nHis pulse slowed. His shoulders loosened. And for the first time in what felt like forever, his mind was completely blank, devoid of any thoughts whatsoever, as he just... stood there. In the water. Letting the ocean come and go.\nThe breeze brushed against his face, and somewhere overhead, a seagull let out a drawn-out cry that quickly faded into the wind. The orange glow on the horizon had dimmed further, and the waves caught that last bit of sunlight, flashing gold before going dark again.\nThe world was alive. Moving. Breathing. And he was here, barefooted and strangely at peace.\nBut that strange peace didn't last too long as a strange, stifling feeling filled his heart the following moment.\nHe had no idea what this feeling is but he had felt it during the first year his mother left him, technically making him an orphan.\nHe thought he had gotten rid of it but it seems like he was wrong.\nShould I go there?\nHe felt like going back to his old neighbourhood. He wants to see the house he used to live with his parents. The house he grew up in and the house he once called home.\nNo need going there won't change anything. And it's been many years now, there's a high chance that the property isn't even there anymore. And an even higher chance of it already occupied by someone else.\nAs for both his parents? It has been years since he last saw them and he doesn't care if they are dead or alive.\nThough he was sure that they are alive.\nTruth be told, Liam hates his parents. He hates them with every single cell in his body, amd he hates his father even more.\nHe feels that if his father hadn't left that day, they will still be that happy family he once knew.\nOr maybe he's deluding himself. Were they really a happy family? As far as he can remember, his parents never really acted like actual husband and wife. It was more like two strangers living under the same roof and he was just something that popped out of nowhere.\nIn other words, he was an accident...\nLiam smiled ruefully and let out a lengthy sigh. His parents are things of the past. He was already aware of this years ago, there's no need reminiscing on what would had been.\nIt's time for him to move forward and make the best out of his life. He will live his life to the fullest, enjoying the best and finest things in life because he has the money.\nHe exhaled sharply and closed his eyes. The breeze, once comforting, now felt colder making his thoughts clearer.\nThere's a saying that if money isn't solving your problem, then you're not throwing enough at it. And if you say it can't buy you happiness, then you don't have enough of it.\nMoney rules the world. It makes the world go round. It opens every single door you want open and shuts those you don't want open.\nMoney isn't power, but it buys power. And with sufficient power, everything's up for grabs.",

      "content": "Chapter 18 - Insane Level Of Rewards!\nThe next morning.\nLiam walked out of bathroom, using his towel to clean his body. He had just taken his bath after he was done cleaning the house.\nToday makes it the seventh day since he got the system and today will also be his first weekly sign-in. He was very curious and excited to see what he will get.\nHe hadn't signed-in yet, as he wanted to complete his morning routine so that he can freely take his time with the rewards he will get.\nNot that he doesn't have all the time in the world.\nWith the level of rewards he has received in the past six days, he had very high hopes for the weekly sign-in rewards.\nLiam smiled as he put on the last piece and went to the living room. He eased himself into a sofa and rubbed his hand together eagerly.\n\"System, sign-in.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, on your first weekly sign-in]\n[You received $5,000,000]\nYou received a residential building, Bellemere Mansion, located in Holmby Hills]\n[You received a Ferrari SF90 Stradale]\n[You received a Aston Martin Vantage GT3]\n[You received a Lamborghini Temerario]\n[+10 Attribute Points.]\n[The money has been transferred to your account. The key to the property and its documents are in the inventory. The cars are parked at the residential building and their keys are in the inventory.]\n\"Holy sh*t!!!\" Liam was shocked beyond words.\nHe had expected the weekly sign-in rewards to be good but he didn't expect it to be this good.\nLiam's was brought of his shock by the buzz of his phone beside him. He excitedly took a look at it and he saw it, a whopping $5 million has been transferred to his account!\nHis balance has skyrocketed from $2.3 million to an amazing amount of more than $7.3 million!\nAmazing! Incredible!\nLiam was short for words. He thought that he was slowly getting used to the surprises the system has been throwing at him but this made him realise that he was terribly wrong.\nHe smiled from ear to ear, as he continued to stare at his balance. The amount comfortable sitting there right now was an amount that can change a lot of people's life over and over again.\nHe sighed, as he tried to regain control over his emotions. With his emotions under control, so was his thoughts.\nHe looked at the name of property he received and he decided to search for it online. He doesn't know if he will see it and the neighbourhood online but he felt that he should be able to get an understanding of things from the information he would get.\n\"Wait, what?!\"\nLiam couldn't believe what he was seeing. He had just typed in property's name and its location, and he got multiple results. But the most shocking thing was the amount he's seeing on his screen by just from a casual search.\nI think I searched it wrong,\nhe thought as he closed the tab.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nHe decided to search again and this time only, he was only going to search for the location where the location where the property is located.\nA few seconds later, Liam burst into a hearty, full laughter.\n\"Hahaha! Wow!\"\nHe couldn't believe it. He had searched up the location and he saw that the first search results were correct. He also saw his new property as one of the popular searches.\nNot only that, it's actually breaking news!\n\"One of Holmby Hills crown jewels, a property valued at more $70 million, has just been sold to a mysterious buyer!\" One article read.\n\"Wow!\" Liam could only mutter again in shock.\nAt this point, he felt like a broken record. But can be really be blamed? He has received so much for doing absolutely nothing and he's going to receive even more in the future.\nAnd he would be lying if he said that he wasn't scared. But he was also excited at the same time. And his excitement overwhelms his fear.\nLiam took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, trying to get his emotions under control. It took him a few seconds but he succeeded.\nHe had thought that the $5 million was a lot but the system as always didn't surprised and gave him extra dose of surprises.\nA bright, wide smile bloomed on Liam's face as he thought of the fact that he would now be living in the same neighbourhood as some of the biggest names in the country.\nLiam decided to immediately go and see his new house. He didn't bother to search for the cars online or allocate his attribute points. He felt it's better seeing the cars in person when he gets to there and he has all the time in the world to freely allocate the attribute points.\nBut before he left, he went into his room and took the custom suit, watch and shoe.\nThe reason? He'd figured that he probably won't come back to the penthouse after he lives and so, it was better to just take these things with him.\nHe walked to the door and picked up the Maserati GranTurismo key where he left it. He opened the door and stepped out of the penthouse, but before leaving, he took one more look at the penthouse and smiled in nostalgia.\nHe had lived here less than a week but the days he had he spent here was the best in like forever.\n\"I wonder if I will come back here?\" He thought, as he closed the door and walked down the hallway to his private elevator.\n***\nImperial Continental, Bel-Air.\nLiam parked his car in front of the exclusive restaurant and walked into it. He decided to get himself something to eat before he arrives at the mansion.\nHe would be doing a very comprehensive tour of the mansion when he gets there and with how big it is—according to the pictures he saw online—he would be too tired to eat after he's done.\nAs he walked to the establishment, he thought of something crucial.\nSystem, can I sell the penthouse or rent it out?\n[No, Host. Properties and assets given by the system can't be sold or given out.]\nI see...\nHe actually had no thought of selling or leasing out the penthouse, but he was curious about the possibility. But now that he has gotten an answer from the system, then he would forget it.\nNow, let's stop thinking about unnecessary things and get something to eat.\nHe was about to open the restaurant's door, when someone collided into him. He raised his head and looked at the person, and he saw a young man who looks to be a little older than him.\n\"What the hell? Are you fucking blind? Can't you watch where you're going, dumbass?\" the young man asked with irritation.\nLiam frowned slightly when he heard the young man's unapologetic tone.\nThe young man saw the frown on Liam's face and his irritation grew. He was already angry enough that some nobody bumped into him but it's even worst, as the person is a freak.\n\"Hey, freak. Get the fuck out of my way. You bumped into me and can't apologize, but don't be stupid. I don't have time to waste on the likes of you,\" he growled and proceeds to push Liam out of the way, but he didn't bulge.\nLiam, who was already very irritated with the current situation and the fowl mouth of the beast in front of him, couldn't take it anymore and decided to take action.\nWith near lightning fast movements, he reached out and grabbed the young man's hand that was on his shoulder, and squeezed.\nCrack!\nThe sound of bone cracking echoed, followed by the blood curdling scream of the young man as he crumpled to his knees.\n\"Ah! You son of a bit*h!\"\nLiam looked at him with a bone chilling look in his eyes and he spoke slowly with an equally cold voice, \"Next time, you should really mind your manners. Or better yet, keep your mouth shut so that you won't get killed by a freak.\"\n\"F*ck you! Go to hell, freak. Do you know who I am, huh?! Do you f*cking know who you're messing with?! I'm—\"\nNot willing to listen further to noise making thing in front of him, Liam slapped him across the face, shutting him up.\nHe let go of his hand and dusted his hands, like he was getting rid of dirt. He didn't spare the person on the floor a glance as he walked over him, and walked into the restaurant.\nThe young man saw this and his face reddened in anger.\n\"You fucker! Just you wait, I will come back for you and I will make you pay for this! You son of a bit*ch. Fuck!\" He roared, as he pulled himself up from the floor.\nBut Liam didn't turn back or acknowledge any of his threats, just as he had never given a fuck about him from the beginning.",

      "content": "Chapter 19 - Bellemere Mansion\nLiam took his time, enjoying the meal he ordered. The restaurant really deserve their name and title as an upscale establishment, as the meal was simply delicious.\nThough there was something Liam noticed as he ate. Unlike before—when he would just shovel food into his mouth without much thought—he now carried himself with quiet grace. With each bite, he could casually identify ingredients and cooking techniques, as if he'd been trained in a Michelin-star kitchen. Even his posture, gestures, and the way he held his cutlery felt instinctively proper.\nIt felt strange at first but he quickly got used to it. Though he has no idea what he will use the knowledge he's getting about the meal to do, but he appreciated it nonetheless.\nAfter he was done with his meal, he called the waitress and paid his bill. With that settled, he stood and left the restaurant.\nStepping out of the restaurant, he looked up at the sky and smiled. The sun was already up and shining bright in the sky, indicating that it's going to be a wonderful day for him.\nWell, the day was already going excellently well for him. He wondered if it could get any better.\nBellemere Mansion, here I come.\nHe walked to his car and slid into the driver's seat, started the engine with a low growl of power, and began the drive toward Holmby Hills.\nThe roads slowly shifted from high-end suburban comfort to the refined opulence that only the most exclusive neighborhoods could afford. Designer homes gave way to sprawling gated estates, each one a fortress of wealth and history.\nAfter nearly half an hour, he turned onto the quiet, tree-lined street where Bellemere Mansion was located.\nHe slowed down, admiring the stretch of tall hedge-lined walls that bordered the property. The hedges were immaculate—dense, dark green, and trimmed to a perfect six feet. Their towering uniformity gave the estate a secluded, almost regal feel, broken only by soft rustling in the breeze and the occasional glint of sun through the leaves.\nAs he approached the mansion's front gates, they began to open automatically with a soft mechanical sound.\nLiam smiled.\nThe system had already logged his car's number plate into the estate's security grid. And so, there was no need for a remote or buzzer. It was like his arrival was expected.\nHe drove through the gates slowly, eyes sweeping across the wide stone-paved driveway and the expansive green lawns that flanked it on either side. The gates slid shut behind him sealing him inside his newest prize.\nIt took a moment to drive to the entrance of the mansion as the driveway was long, with a large open field on each side.\nHe parked near the front of the mansion, directly before a curved portico supported by tall white columns. The building's facade was a masterpiece of modern European design—grandeur without gaudiness. Cream-colored stone, soft-edged archways, bronze fixtures, and wide panelled windows lined with smart tint glass.\nLiam stepped out of the car, the air around him tinged with citrus from the manicured lemon trees lining the path.\nHe took a moment to admire the sheer scale of the structure before him. Then, with a quiet breath, he approached the front entrance.\nA glossy panel was set into the stone beside the large oak doors. He tapped in the six-digit passcode and placed his thumb against the biometric scanner. A brief moment passed before the device beeped, followed by the quiet click of the smart-lock disengaging.\nThe heavy door unlocked and gently eased open on its own.\nLiam reached out and gave it a small push. It swung open fully, revealing a portion of the grand interior—marble floors, sweeping staircase with a brass rail, high ceilings with inset lighting, and polished black-and-gold fixtures that gleamed in the morning light.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nHe smiled and let out another lengthy sigh, before taking a step into the mansion.\nThe moment Liam stepped through the grand entrance of Bellemere Mansion, a wave of chilled, lightly scented air greeted him—cool eucalyptus and faint lavender mixed into the atmosphere, piped discreetly through the high-end HVAC system.\nHe stood in a vast two-story foyer, flooded with natural light streaming through towering windows and a glass-panelled skylight far above. The polished marble flooring stretched out beneath his feet in a checkerboard pattern of ivory and champagne hues. In the center sat a circular inlaid design, delicate yet imposing—a stylized crest of the estate carved into the stone itself.\nTo his left, a twin staircase spiraled upward in a wide curve, both sides joining at a broad mezzanine above. The handrails were made of polished brass, paired with dark walnut steps that matched the ornate crown molding running along the ceiling's perimeter.\nEverything sparkled—from the chandelier overhead, made of custom Venetian crystal, to the door handles coated in brushed platinum.\nLiam exhaled quietly. \"This place is insane.\"\nHe took slow steps into the grand foyer, soaking it all in. He turned right and found himself in a formal sitting room—expansive and bright. It held an oversized curved sectional in soft cream, centered around a circular stone table. Floor-to-ceiling windows opened directly to the outdoor pool and garden, but were currently shaded by automatic smart-blinds that adjusted with the sun's position.\nAn alcove wall held built-in shelves filled with rare books, sculptures, and commissioned art. A fireplace was set into the far wall, with a marble mantle and a discreet touchscreen to control temperature and flame height.\nHe wandered deeper into the mansion, heading left down a corridor where recessed lighting and elegant sconces lit the way. Every hallway had its own signature aesthetic—one in deep navy tones with brass trimmings, another in soft gray with floor-length gallery pieces on either side.\nThe dining room was next: a room fit for royalty. A custom dining table made from a single slab of Carpathian elm stretched twelve feet long, surrounded by ergonomic leather chairs with gold frames. Above the table floated a sculptural lighting fixture—dozens of thin glass shards suspended like falling snow, all individually lit.\nAdjacent to it was the show kitchen—double island layout, all wrapped in honed Calacatta marble. Top-of-the-line appliances: Sub-Zero fridge, La Cornue range, built-in espresso bar, and even a concealed walk-in pantry that looked like another wall at first glance. Off to the side was the chef's kitchen, just as large but entirely separate, perfect for catering or private staff.\nA quick exploration led him to the wine cellar—tucked beneath the main level through a temperature-controlled glass door. Rows upon rows of vintage wine rested horizontally in custom racks, each bottle softly illuminated with its own tag display. It even had a tasting corner with a small bar, two stools, and a marble tasting slab with a rinse sink.\nLiam then walked to the entertainment wing. Yes, wing.\nThe theater was fully equipped with ten luxurious recliners, soft blue ambient lighting on the walls, soundproofing panels, and a 13-foot cinema screen. It had 7.2.4 surround sound, invisible ceiling speakers, and velvet blackout drapes for maximum immersion.\nAcross from it, a gaming and recreation room—a fusion of classic and modern: billiard table, retro arcade corner, and an entire wall lined with screens for console and PC gaming.\nLiam stood there for a while, grinning.\nAs he explored the backyard via the large glass sliders, the sound of a soft waterfall filled the air. The centerpiece pool sparkled under the morning sun, complete with underwater LED lighting, a swim-up bar, and a sunken lounge with a fire pit in the middle. There was a detached spa area, with a hot tub covered by a canopy and ambient mist system for warm nights.\nNext to the pool sat the cabana and outdoor kitchen. Marble counters. Ice machine. Teppanyaki grill. Built-in smoker. Multiple fridges. And a twelve-seater curved outdoor dining table with heating coils underneath for cooler evenings.\nReturning indoors, Liam made his way upstairs via the right spiral staircase. On the second floor, each hallway had art lighting and hardwood underfoot softened by Persian runners.\nThe guest rooms were more like mini suites—each one with king-sized beds, custom millwork closets, ensuite bathrooms with heated floors, and private balconies that overlooked either the gardens or the city skyline beyond.\nThen he reached the master wing.\nThe master bedroom was massive—larger than his entire penthouse. Vaulted ceiling with floating panels, hidden lighting, a fireplace built into a slate wall, and floor-to-ceiling windows with a panoramic view of LA. A soft chaise lounge sat by the windows, next to a telescope mounted on a marble base.\nThe bed was a custom platform king, framed in leather and wrapped in soft gray Egyptian cotton. On either side, nightstands with gold trim and voice-activated smart hubs.\nThe walk-in closet? It wasn't a closet. It was a boutique showroom. Glass-front wardrobes, rotating accessory displays, mirrored islands with built-in velvet-lined drawers, and even an integrated scent-diffusing wardrobe for long-term storage.\nThe master bathroom was an experience in itself. Dual vanities. A rain shower as big as a bedroom, with programmable water flow settings. A soaking tub made of hand-carved stone. Mood lighting controlled by app or panel. And a retractable skylight directly above the tub.\nLiam didn't even realize how long he had been touring the property until he made his way back downstairs.\nHe passed by a private library, a fully equipped home gym, and a hidden door that led to a secured vault and panic room.\nFinally, he returned to the living area.\nWith a content sigh, he lowered himself onto one of the ultra-soft velvet sectionals, sinking into the cushions like a king returning to his throne.\nHe leaned back, arms stretched along the backrest, head tilted slightly upward as he took in the room once more. Sunlight filtered gently through the smart-glass panels, casting warm gold across the marble floor.\nLiam chuckled softly to himself, then broke into a bright, satisfied smile.\nHe hadn't even lived a full week with the system... and yet here he was—sitting in a crown jewel of Holmby Hills, with millions in his account and an insane level of wealth.\nAnd this was only the beginning.\nHe exhaled again and closed his eyes.\n\"I could get used to this.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 20 - Inconsequential Things\nMeanwhile Liam was enjoying the tour of the mansion and taking in the wonderful view, some distance from the mansion's gate, a black car that had been packed there for a while was now pulling back.\nInside the car was a familiar young man who Liam would have recognised, and he was with two older men—the person driving the car and another seated in the passengers seat.\n\"What the f*ck are we doing out here when he's in there?!\" The young man spoke in a very angry voice, as he glared at the hedge-lined walls of the property.\n\"Are you dumb?! Will you stop barking like a dog and think properly?!\" The man seated in the passenger seat said with irritation,\"We followed him all the way from the exterior part of Bel-Air and he drove into Holmby Hills. Do you think he's an ordinary person? F*cking use your brain for once. It's not meant to be just for show.\"\n\"Besides, that's Bellemere Mansion he just drove into,\" the driver nodded and continued, \"I heard it was just sold early today to a mysterious buyer. I'm sure if the kid is that mysterious buyer but even if he's not, he's definitely related. So, we have to be careful.\"\n\"So, we are just going to let him off just like that?! He broke my f*cking arm!\" The young man yelled in anger.\n\"Will you just f*cking stop telling, Jason?!\" The man in the passenger seat yelled back at him, \"You said he broke your arm but I'm very sure that you were definitely the one that went looking for trouble. And now, you want us to take care of it? You're an adult for heaven's sake. Grow up and take responsibility for your actions. Stop being such a crybaby.\"\n\"I understand how you feel, Kevin, but it doesn't change the fact that someone laid their hands on our brother. We have to make him pay,\" the driver said.\n\"Then what do you suggest we do, Chris?\" Kevin asked.\n\"First, we will investigate him and find out everything we can about him. We have to confirm if he's the mysterious buyer or related to the person. If it's something we can easily handle, we will take care of it quietly. But it it's not, we will have to call in some help. No matter how powerful one is, there's always someone higher,\" Chris replied.\n\"Whatever. But I'm tired of taking care of Jason all the time. He has to grow up. He's no longer a kid,\" Kevin said.\n\"You hear that, Jason? Grow up,\" Chris said.\nJason clenched his fists hard and gritted his teeth at his brothers' words. He was raging inside and was trying his best to hold himself back. He wished he could rush into the property and beat the hell out of that freak, but that's impossible.\nThe truth was that he didn't expect the person he deemed a nobody to actually live in Holmby Hills. It would had been a different thing entirely if he doesn't but for him to leave here and have access to a property worth tens of millions of dollars means that he's no ordinary person.\nStill, he won't give up. An eye for an eye. A broken arm for a broken arm.\n***\nAs for the person that was the topic of discussion? He was happily lounging on the ultra comfortable sofa and enjoying himself.\nHe picked up his phone and looked at the time, and he saw that it was almost evening.\nHe arrived at the mansion early noon and it took him almost the whole of the afternoon to tour the house. This goes to show just how big the property is.\nLiam was still smiling from ear to ear at how surreal owning such a property feels. At first, he had thought that the title \"crown jewel of Holmby Hills\" was just given to it t jack up the price. But now that he has seen it in person? He feels that it really deserve the title.\nI still haven't seen the new cars.\nHe immediately stood up and walked to the garage. He has to see the three beasts he received from the system.\nThe garage is located underground and has space for more than 12 cars! The entry to the garage from outside is a sloped drive-in, with a door at the end that will automatically opened when it sense the licence plate. And it also has a biometric scanner outside the garage for when new unregistered cars are brought in, and inside for accessing it from within the mansion.\nStanding at the interior door that links the mansion to the underground garage, he pressed his thumb on the biometric scanner and he heard a beep, as the scanner glowed green.\nA beep was heard and the door made a clicking sound, telling Liam that it was now unlocked.\nLiam closed his eyes for a moment, let out a lengthy sigh as he reached out and pushed open the door.\nAs he pushed the door open, the lights began to turn on one by one in smooth succession, casting pools of warm light that spread across the polished epoxy floor like unfolding stage lights.\nEach bulb seemed to hum gently, illuminating the vast underground garage.\nAnd vast it was.\nThe first thing that hit him was the sheer cleanliness of it all. The entire space was pristine—walls paneled with brushed aluminum and matte black accents, floors gleaming under a high-gloss resin finish, and ceiling lights embedded in a grid-like pattern to minimize shadows. There was even a soft scent in the air, like expensive leather and machine oil—a showroom scent.\nThe temperature was cool and perfect, as it's controlled.\nHe stepped further inside, his heels echoing faintly in the wide chamber.\nThe garage was easily capable of housing more than twelve vehicles, with wide, clearly marked spaces, and smart ceiling mounts that could lower or lift individual lighting panels for focused detailing work. Tool cabinets and detailing stations lined the far wall, sleek and stainless, like surgical equipment for a car enthusiast.\nThere was also a EV charging station with Level 2 Charger in a corner.\nAnd in the center of it all—under direct overhead lighting—stood the three cars he had received from the system.\nLiam stopped and blinked, and then he let out a breath he didn't realize he'd been holding.\nThe Ferrari SF90 Stradale gleamed like a blade in the spotlight. Its scarlet-red bodywork looked dipped in molten metal, the curvature of its aerodynamic design capturing light and flinging it off in radiant streaks. The carbon fiber splitter at the front, the aggressive grille, and the low, predatory stance made it look like it was already in motion, even while parked. Its company's logo on the hood shone like a crown jewel—subtle but undeniably elite.\nRight beside it sat the Aston Martin Vantage GT3—a beast of an entirely different class. This one was raw. A performance machine born for the track but refined enough to belong in a billionaire's garage. Matte graphite gray with lime green accents lining the wing mirrors and brake calipers. The exaggerated rear wing, the diffuser fins, the razor-sharp lines—it looked like something that would scream across a circuit at 200 mph with no remorse.\nAnd finally was the Lamborghini Temerario.\nA machine that looked less like a car and more like something crafted by a god of speed. Its body was finished in a high-gloss obsidian black, touched with pearlescent flakes that shimmered subtly as the overhead lights danced across it. The scissor doors were currently closed, but even at rest, they hinted at the drama they were capable of. The sculpted body lines twisted like controlled chaos—every inch was form meeting function. Its front fascia was sharp, angular, a statement of rebellion and luxury fused together.Google seaʀᴄh No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nLiam stood there, speechless and in disbelief.\nThese three hypercars are all his...\nHe walked around them slowly, fingers trailing lightly over the surfaces, as he was trying to wake himself up from the sweet dream he's in.\n\"I should probably take one out for a ride,\" he muttered and fixed his eyes on the Lamborghini.\nHe smiled and immediately took out its key from the inventory, and walked to the driver side.\nHe pressed the unlock button and the car beeped, indicating that it's now unlocked. He opened the door and comfortably slid into the driver's seat.\nThe driver's seat of the car was just perfect. It felt like he was seated in a cockpit—as intended by the manufacturer.\nHis smiled widened as he placed his hand on the steering, and slowly brought his hand to the ignition button.\nLiam closed his eyes for a moment, let out a lengthy sigh and pressed the ignition button. The following moment, a beastial roar was heard as the car's engine came to life.\n\"That's what I'm talking about!\" He nodded in satisfaction and steered the car out of the garage.\nThe garage's exterior door opened up automatically and Liam drove out, down the driveway to the gate, which opened automatically on his approach, allowing him to drive out.\nOutside, he looked around and he saw that the black car that had been tailing him since he left the restaurant wasn't in sight.\nThey left? I thought they would wait for me to come and then jump me. I guess they thought things through.\nHe had noticed the car following him a few minutes after he left the restaurant. He felt that it was the young man he had a little scuffle with.\nHe had expected them to try something on the way but they didn't and followed him until he drove into the property.\nI'm curious to see what they want to pull. Whatever it is, I will tear them down.\nHe decided to stop thinking about inconsequential things, as he steered the car down the street of Holmby Hills.",

      "content": "Chapter 21 - Shopping, Lana\nRodeo Drive, Beverly Hills.\nAfter leaving the mansion and driving around the upscale neighbourhood, and enjoying the view, he finally arrived here.\nHe hadn't planned to go shopping today, but then he remembered that aside from the clothes he had on, he didn't have anything else to wear.\nAnd this prompted his decision to come here.\nRodeo Drive, one of the most expensive shopping area globally. It's a place he never thought he would had have the opportunity of not only coming but also shopping here.\nThings here aren't expensive just because of the brand names. No, it's because the whole area is filled with stores cater to celebrities, billionaires, royalty, and luxury collectors, and their prices naturally has to reflect that.\nLiam drove down and finally parked by the side of the street. Even though it was already evening, there was still a bit of crowd around.\nAs he drove down, his car grabbed the attention of some of the onlookers. Even though the whole area is is no stranger to luxury cars, the car still got people talking.\nLiam got out of his car and look at around. All he could were luxury stores around him but he has no idea which one to choose.\nHe was still looking around, when he heard a familiar voice calling his name. He turned and he saw that it was one of Stacy's friends who he bad met at the gathering that night.\n\"Liam?\" The girl asked in curiosity.\n\"Lana?\" Liam called out her name.\n\"Oh, wow. It's really you, Liam. I thought I saw wrong when I saw you get out of the car,\" Lana smiled.\n\"You surprised me too. I didn't expect to see someone familiar here,\" Liam said.\n\"Hehehe. I get that a lot,\" Lana giggled.\n\"It's nice to see. I still haven't thanked you guys for your hospitality that night. I really appreciate it,\" Liam said, with polite smile.\n\"You don't need to thank us. We also enjoyed your company,\" Lana said.\n\"So, you came for shopping?\"\n\"Yeah. Clothes and stuff. Lots of them,\" Liam replied.\n\"I see... You look like this is your first time here, do you mind me showing you around? I know which store has what around here.\"\n\"Sure. I would love that,\" Liam nodded.\nLana was right. He's new to the place and it would be a great help if she can show him around.\n\"Cool. Come on, let's go then,\" she said, and started leading him down the street.\nAs they walked, Lana started introducing him to nearly every store they passed. She chatted away, flaunting her knowledge wealth, as she told Liam about the history of nearly each store and even the high profile individuals, like celebrities, billionaires and the likes, that have patronised them.\nLiam was quite surprised by how much she knew about the stores in Rodeo Drive. Though he doesn't exactly need the information she was giving him, but he appreciated it.\nHe actually felt that it might be her way of interacting with people. But he would be lying if he said that he wasn't curious about how she knew all of this.\nLana noticed Liam's silence and turned to look at him, and she saw him staring at her in a strange way. She met his gaze but immediately turned her face away, trying to hide her embarrassment.\n\"I'm sorry. It seems like I was rambling on and on about things that aren't important,\" she said in a low voice, that was barely above a whisper.\nLiam caught what she said clearly and he smiled.\n\"You seem to know a lot about this place,\" he said.\n\"Yeah, my mom is the Store Director of the Dior store here,\" she replied.\n\"A Store Director? Wow!\" Liam said in surprise.\n\"Yeah. She's someone of status,\" Lana smiled proudly.\nLiam saw how proud Lana was of her mother and he couldn't help but smile too.He actually has no idea what a store director is but he knew that it was a position higher than store manager.\nNow that Lana had said it, he just realised how high-end the clothes she's wearing is and also that which she wore at the gathering.\nDamn, Stacy! You and your friends are form families with some monster level background.\n\"We are here. This is my mom's store,\" Lana said, as they arrived in front of a store with the Dior logo in front of it.\n\"Come on in,\" she said and opened the door, walking into the store.\nLiam nodded and followed her in.\n\"Liam, can give me a minute, please? I want to help you out with the shopping, but I have to give my mom her coffee,\" Lana said, with a pleading look in her eyes.\n\"Sure,\" Liam shrugged, \"I will just look around while I wait.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Lana said with a smile and walked to a black door.\nJust as Liam said, he decided to look around the store.\nThe air inside the store was cool and infused with a faint, refined fragrance—something floral layered with musk, luxurious and subtle. Ambient lighting from recessed LEDs highlighted every surface with a soft glow, bouncing gently off polished marble floors the color of pale champagne.\nThe boutique was laid out like a curated museum. Each section was open and spacious, allowing each item to breathe. Nothing was cluttered. No racks were overfilled. Every piece of clothing was spaced just enough to emphasize its uniqueness and value.\nLiam strolled toward the men's section, immediately noticing the tailored suits displayed on sleek matte-black hangers. One mannequin was dressed in a full navy wool double-breasted suit with subtle embroidery on the lapels—classic, elegant, and dripping with quiet power. The price tag discreetly tucked behind the lapel read $6,800.\nOn a central display table made of smoked glass and brushed steel were neatly folded knitwear and silk shirts. One shirt—an off-white piece with a muted Dior Oblique jacquard pattern—felt impossibly soft between Liam's fingers, and it had a price tag of $1,950.\nHe continued down the line, catching sight of calfskin leather jackets with minimal designs and precise cuts. One particularly clean black piece, thin as paper yet structured like armor, sat proudly on its own pedestal stand, and it costs $9,200.\nFootwear lined the wall across from the clothes: high-top sneakers with embroidered bees ($1,300), Derby shoes in patent leather ($2,100), and boots with the CD hardware subtly engraved into the heel ($2,850).\nLiam let out a low breath.\nHe wasn't shocked by the prices—he could afford all of it now—but it was still a surreal feeling. To walk in casually, browse clothes worth so much and know that he could buy everything here without denting his finances, was something he never thought possible.\nHis fingers brushed over another blazer—this one a sleek sand-colored single-breasted cut made from a cashmere-wool blend, with lean lines and slight sheen, and a price tag of $5,400.\nHe was still looking around, when he heard Lana's voice behind him.\n\"Liam, thanks for waiting,\" she said, as she walked towards him.\n\"No problem. I kept myself busy with the sights of the clothes.\"\nLana giggled sheepishly when she heard what he said. Even without him saying it outrightly, she understood what she meant.\n\"I know. They are expensive.\"\n\"They are indeed,\" Liam said, shaking his head slightly.\n\"So, what are the criterias for the clothes you want? Sneakers...\" Lana asked.\n\"Not much. I just want something comfortable and not too flashy.\"\n\"How many?\"\n\"A lot of clothes, a couple of sneakers, belts and other things.\"\n\"I see... Your budget?\"\n\"$100,000+\"\n\"Ok,\" Lana nodded, but she sharply turned to stare at him the next moment.\n\"Sorry, what?!\" She asked in shock, wanting to confirm what she heard.\n\"Yeah, $100,000+,\" Liam replied again.\nLana was a little taken aback. She couldn't help but feel like she heard wrong, but Liam has already repeated the same thing twice.\n$100,000+ for clothes???\nEven though Lana's mother works at a top luxury store, that doesn't mean Lana regularly sees people—especially young men like Liam—casually throwing around $100,000+ on clothes. Most shoppers, even the wealthy ones, tend to buy a few select items at a time.\nYes, her mom's position as a Store Director is of significant status, but while Store Directors are respected and compensated well, are still employees of the brand.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nHer family typically live comfortably, but they don't shop like billionaires. So even Lana, despite her access and exposure, still see clients with six-figure budgets as exceptional.\nAlso, Liam isn't walking around with a known public persona or a family name tied to wealth. To someone like her, he's just a charismatic guy she met through Stacy.\nBut now, he's casually treating $100,00+ like a shopping allowance. It completely broke her understanding of normal and forced her to rethink who be really is.\nWho exactly is this guy?\nShe remembered Stacy telling her that he was probably the same Liam as the one Alex spoke about, but she didn't pay much attention to it. But now, she's being forced to.\nLana noticed that she had been spacing out for too long and quickly regained her composure.\n\"I've gotten your orders. I will take care of it. You can wait in the VIP clients room. I will bring them to you for confirmation when I'm done done,\" she said.\n\"Sure,\" Liam nodded.\nLana nodded and called for one of the sales associate, and asked her to lead Liam to the VIP clients room.\nAfter that, she immediately got to work, with a very enthusiastic smile on her face.",

      "content": "Chapter 22 - Shopping, Lana's Shock\nInside the VIP clients room of the Dior store, Liam was seated in the comfortable plush seating, waiting for Lana.\nWhile he waited, he looked around the room, admiring it. The room looked more like the private lounge of an art gallery, instead of that of a clothing store, with how serene and beautiful it is.\nIts cream-toned walls framed a space of elegant minimalism, with a the company branded scented diffuser humming gently on a glass coffee table, and soft music melting into the background.\n\"Sir, would you like champagne or espresso?\" The female sales associate standing beside him, asked.\nShe was the same sales associate Lana had asked to escort him to the room, and now, she moved with elegance, doing everything she could to ensure Liam felt completely at ease. After all, he wasn't just a guest anymore. He was a high-value client.\n\"None. I'm fine,\" Liam replied, shaking his head.\nHe wasn't a fan of coffee and he can't risk taking alcohol as he has to drive himself home.\nThe sales associate nodded slightly and subtly observed Liam from the corner of her eyes.\nWhen he walked in with Lana, the Store Director's mother, she had thought that he was just someone trying to impress the girl. But when she heard how much he said his budget was and from his attitude since he walked into the VIP clients room, she felt that she might have evaluated him wrongly.Follow current novels on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\n***\nA few minutes later, the door to the room opened and Lana walked in, wheeling in a rack of clothes.\nShe stopped close to where Liam was seated and smiled.\n\"Liam, I'm done curating them. You can come check them out,\" she said, with a proud smile on her face.\nLiam nodded and stood up from his seat. He walked to the rack and started looking through the clothes Lana picked for him.\n\"Let me know whichever of them that isn't to your liking and needs to be changed,\" Lana said, standing a couple distance behind him.\nLiam nodded, as he continued to look through the rack. He tested some of the clothes and sneakers he felt might be too small for him, but the actual fitted just right.\nHe was actually surprised that Lana was able to discern his size correctly by just looking at him.\nI guess as the daughter of a Store Director of a luxury brand store in Rodeo Drive, she needs be to be able to do this much.\nIt took Liam a few minutes and he was done with confirming Lana's selection. She did a pretty good job curating them, as he didn't return anything.\nEverything was perfect as he wanted them. They weren't flashy and neither of them would make him stand out too much.\n\"I will take all of them,\" Liam said and turned to look at Lana.\nLana nodded and turned to the sales associate in the room. She immediately understood what Lana wanted and she left the VIP clients room, to call for assistance for packaging the items.\n\"Lana, can I have someone deliver them to my place?\" Liam asked.\nIt was already getting late and he has no idea how long it will take them to package everything, and he wasn't really ready to wait. Also, he wasn't sure if there was enough space in his car for everything.\nHe intends to just take a couple of clothes and a pair of sneakers, then Lana's store will deliver the rest to him.\n\"Yeah, we do home delivery. I will tell them to package it for home delivery instead,\" she said, and walked to the entrance of the VIP room.\nShe called for the sales associate and informed her, before walking back into the VIP client room.\n\"I would love to make the payment now. How much is everything?\" Liam asked.\n\"$103,000,\" Lana replied and gave him the store's account detail.\nLiam immediately made the payment and asked Lana to confirm. She nodded and walked to the entrance of the room, where she signalled for a sales associate to get her mother.\nSince the amount Liam did was in six figures, her mom, the Store Director has to be notified. It's normal procedure.\n\"We'll have your items delivered first thing tomorrow morning, unless you'd prefer a priority dispatch tonight—we can arrange that,\" Lana said.\n\"No. Tomorrow morning will be fine. Just package this and this for me,\" Liam said, as he pointed to the clothes and sneaker he wants to take him.\n\"You can deliver the rest tomorrow morning.\"\n\"Ok. First thing tomorrow morning, they will be delivered to your place at Blue Valley Complex.\"\n\"No. Not Blue Valley Complex. I move.\"\n\"Ohhh... Please give me your new address,\" Lana said, and brought out a notepad from her dress' pocket.\n\"Bellemere Mansion, Holmby Hills,\" Liam replied.\n\"Ohh, ok...\" Lana nodded.\nShe was about to write two address in her notepad, when she sharply raised her head and looked at Liam.\n\"I'm sorry. Come again,\" she asked in disbelief.\n\"Bellemere Mansion, Holmby Hills.\"\nLana's eyes widened in shock and disbelief. She pinched herself to make sure she wasn't having auditory hallucination.\n\"Wait, you mean your new address is Bellemere Mansion in Holmby Hills? Like the same Bellemere Mansion and Holmby Hills we all know?\" She asked.\nShe knew that she was being rude with her questions. It was completely against the ethics and conduct of an aspiring Store Director and Regional Supervisor, but she can't help herself.\n\"Yes. The same and same,\" Liam replied.\nHe completed understood her shock and disbelief at his words. Even he still finds the whole thing to be very surreal.\nLana involuntarily took a step back when she heard Liam's response. She couldn't believe it. She wanted to believe that he was lying to her but she knew better than anyone else that there was absolutely no need for him to do that.\nThat means he's the mysterious buyer if the property. Then he's definitely the same Liam that Alex was talking about.\nRealising this, Lana felt that she and her friends might have come into contact with someone with a monster level background.\nShe was immediately lost and confused on what to do. She suddenly couldn't treat Liam the same as before, even though she had actually being treating him as a sales associate would a VIP client.\nLana realised that she was losing control of herself and the situation, and she closed her briefly, and exhaled deeply.\n\"I've taken down your address. Please expect the delivery tomorrow morning,\" she said, and walked to the entrance of the VIP clients room.\nShe saw her mother standing there with a smile on her face and she smiled ruefully.\n\"You handled it properly. Let mana take care of the rest,\" her mom said.\nLana nodded weakly and made way for her mom.\nLiam watched a beautiful middle aged woman who bore a near uncanny resemblance to Lana, walk into the room, with a polite smile on her face.\nEven without being told, it was already obvious to him that the woman is Lana's mother, the Store Director in charge of the store.\n\"Good afternoon, Mr Liam. We have already confirmed the transaction,\" she said and clapped her hands.\nImmediately, two female sales associate walked in with shopping bags and packaged the clothes, sneaker Liam would be taking with him.\nAfter they were done, they gave a small bow and left the room, leaving only Liam and Lana's mother.\n\"Mr Liam, would you like anything else?\" She asked.\n\"No. That would be all,\" Liam said.\nThe woman gave a graceful nod.\n\"Thank you very much for your patronage, Mr. Liam,\" she said, voice calm and composed. \"It has been an honor having you here today. We truly appreciate your visit to our store.\"\nLiam gave a polite nod in return. \"I should be the one thanking you—for the service, and the experience. It was excellent.\"\nThe Store Director smiled warmly. \"We're always at your service, Mr. Liam. Should you need anything further, even outside regular hours, please don't hesitate to contact us. I'll personally see to your delivery in the morning.\"\n\"Much appreciated,\" Liam said with a small smile.\nWith that, the Store Director stepped aside and gestured politely toward the exit. Liam gave a final nod and turned toward the door.\nAs he walked out, he saw Lana lingering by the corridor, watching from a distance. Their eyes met briefly, and she gave him a slightly embarrassed smile and a short wave.\nLiam returned a nod and a faint smirk, acknowledging her silent goodbye before walking past the sleek black-framed glass doors of the Dior boutique.\nOutside, the evening glow had softened into a warm orange hue as the sun hovered low in the sky, casting long shadows across the luxury strip of Rodeo Drive.\nThe crowd had thinned slightly, though a few tourists still lingered, some sneaking glances at the storefronts, others stealing photos of luxury cars parked like exotic animals at rest.\nLiam walked to his Lamborghini Temerario, which had drawn a few admiring gazes even as it rested silently at the curb.\nThe doors open as he approached, responding to the proximity of the key in his pocket. He slid into the driver's seat, placed the two bags in the passenger side carefully, and took a moment to inhale the soft leather scent within the cabin.\nWith a smooth press of the ignition button, the car awakened. He reached for the gear, glanced once more down the avenue lined with high fashion, and then slowly steered the car away from the curb.\nAs he pulled into the street, the golden hour light reflected off the car's obsidian black surface, making it shimmer like oil on water.\nHe drove at a relaxed pace, ignoring the eyes following him—some curious, others envious—as he turned off Rodeo Drive and eased into the winding route back toward Holmby Hills.\nThe engine's rumble filled the cabin, as the Lamborghini picked up speed on the open road.\nRodeo Drive faded in the rearview mirror, as Liam adjusted his grip on the steering wheel, leaned back into his seat, and smiled faintly to himself.\nA/N: Guys, have the book been too slow lately? What are your thoughts on it so far?",

      "content": "Chapter 23 - Noticeable Changes\nBellemere Mansion, Holmby Hills.\nLiam drove through the gate and down the long driveway to the sloped drive-in of the underground garage.\nIts door opened automatically and he drove inside, parked the Lamborghini Temerario beside the other two cars. Shutting down the car's engine, he grabbed the two shopping bags in the passenger seat and stepped out of the car with a satisfied smile on his face.\n\"I should bring the Maserati inside. Can't leave it outside all night,\" he said out loud, as he walked to the garage's interior door.\nHe opened the door, stepped through it and let it close, and auto-lock itself. He didn't walk to his room, as he walked to the entrance door instead.\n***\nA couple minutes later, Liam had already parked the Maserati in the garage and was now in his room.\nHe took off his clothes and walked to the bathroom to take his bath. After he was done, he put on something comfortable for the night and collapsed on his bed, feeling quite tired.\n\"What a really blessed day,\" he muttered to himself, as he thought of the sign-in rewards he had received.\nThe mansion, the cars, the money and the attribute points.\nOh, yeah. The attribute points.\n\"I almost forgot about them. I should allocate them now that I'm free,\" he said, pushing himself up to a sitting position on the bed.\nHe was about to pull up his status screen when his stomach growled, reminding him that he hasn't eaten anything else for the day beside the breakfast at that upscale restaurant.\nI can't go out. It's already late. It's not wise to be driving around in a neighbourhood one is new to. Especially one as exclusive as this. I should order something.\nLiam picked up his phone and went online, searching for nearby restaurants that do home delivery.\nHe quickly found one and placed his order. Since it was the first time he was using the restaurant, he had to manually input his address.\nAfter he did, he made the payment and closed the web app.\n\"Hope they don't take too long though. The hunger's killing me.\"\n\"Status,\" he said, pulling up his status screen, as he dropped his phone on the bed.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ\n[Host: Liam Scott]\n[Age: 18]\n[System Level: 1]\n[Strength: 10»»12]\n[Agility: 8»»9]\n[Stamina: 12»»14]\n[Attribute Points: 10]\n[Skills: Pro-level Vehicular Operation, World-Class Etiquette, World-Class Culinary Arts, Formless Combat Doctrine, Perfect Memory]\n[Inventory: Bellemere Mansion property documents, Aston Martin Vantage GT3 key fob, Ferrari SF90 Stradale key fob]\n[System Function(s): Sign-in]\n***\nLiam immediately allocated his attribute points, assigning 3 to Strength, 5 to Agility and 2 to Stamina.\nImmediately, Liam felt that familiar warm energy flowing through his body again. But this time, it wasn't as vague as before. It seems like the stronger he gets, the better he could feel or sense the warm energy.\nIt started from his chest, spreading outward like warm tendrils threading through his body. It was consciously targeting specific part of his part.\nAs the energy flowed through his body, Liam felt some changes in his body. His muscles tightened and he felt an immense amount of dormant raw power in it.\nHe clenched his fist and he felt like he could punch through concrete — though he knew it was only an illusion.\nThat was the only changes he felt. As his stamina increased, Liam felt that his body contain an immense amount of energy.\nHe felt like it was infinite and that if he starts doing something physically taxing, he could go on forever without getting tired. But he naturally knew that this wasn't true and it was all an illusion.\nBut the biggest changes he felt was the lightness of his body . His body felt very light. Lighter than ever before. It actually made him feel like he was floating in the air.\nLiam felt like if he jump right now, he might actually float away. But yeah, it was all an illusion.\nBut he won't lie. The feeling of growing stronger felt very good.\nStrange. I felt the changes even more this time. Is it because I increased my attributes by a considerable amount of points or because I'm getting very close to the limit of what a human body can achieve?\nHe remembered what the system said about the limit a human can achieve being 20. He felt that the massive changes he felt was likely related to it.\nIt did kind of make of him curious. If he reach the limit, would he still be able to increase his strength by assigning his attributes more attribute points? Or would he need the enhancement the system talked about to continue doing that?\nHe was curious about this things but since it wasn't urgent. He decided to ask the system. He also felt that he might not get an answer if he asked.\n\"Let's see how many more points I need to hit the limit,\" he muttered.\nStatus.\n[Host: Liam Scott]\n[Age: 18]\n[System Level: 1]\n[Strength: 12»»15]\n[Agility: 9»»14]\n[Stamina: 14»»16]\n[Attribute Points: 0]\n[Skills: Pro-level Vehicular Operation, World-Class Etiquette, World-Class Culinary Arts, Formless Combat Doctrine, Perfect Memory]\n[Inventory: Bellemere Mansion property documents, Aston Martin Vantage GT3 key fob, Ferrari SF90 Stradale key fob]\n[System Function(s): Sign-in]\n***\n\"15 more attribute points to go. Curious to see what would change when I hit the limit,\" Liam smiled to himself.\n***\nGolden Kitchen, Beverly Hills.\nThe person in charge of the establishment's platform got a ping on his computer, as a new order came in.\nHe checked the order and its total cost, and confirmed if the person had made the payment. After the confirmation, he decided to print out the order and take it to the kitchen staffs.\nAs he walked to the kitchen, he curiously checked the address the client inputted for the home delivery. From the client's name in the transaction receipt, he knew that the person was new. And he was very curious to know where the person was ordering from.\nHis eyes moved down and he smiled when he saw the name.\n\"Bellemere Mansion. What a fancy sounding name,\" he smiled.\nThe next moment, his step paused as his eyes widened in shock and realisation.\n\"Bellemere Mansion. Wait... isn't that the mansion in the news?\" He muttered to himself.\nThe name of the property, Bellemere Mansion, has been in the news after it was sold to a mysterious buyer. And everyone is curious to know who this mysterious buyer is. Especially people in his line of work and those that write online articles.\nThe staffer looked at the address once again to confirm, and the name of the client.\n\"Liam... Is this the guy?\"\nThe staffer already aware of what he has to do, immediately walked to the manager's office. He knocked on the door and opened it, without receiving permission.\n\"What the hell, Damien?!\" The male manager looked at the person that intruded into his office.\n\"Sorry, sir, but you might want to look at this order. It just came in. It's for Bellemere Mansion. Under the name Liam. I think we've got something big here,\" Damien said, giving the slip to manager.\nThe manager was quite annoyed with Damien and was about to scold him but when he heard what he said, he pivoted from annoyance to sharp curiosity.\nHe reached out and picked up the slip, and went through it. Just like Damien, his eyes widened in shock when he saw the address and name.\n\"Liam... Bellemere Mansion... Are you sure that it's really the owner? It might be just someone posing,\" he said in a low voice.\n\"I doubt it, sir. You know how things are in the Platinum Triangle. Who would dare use such a high profile property to pose? They would only be trying to get themselves killed,\" Damien replied.\n\"That's true,\" the manager nodded slowly.\nDamien was right. In Beverly Hills, Bel-Air and Holmby Hills—the Platinum Triangle society, claiming a famous residence without the credentials would be social and financial suicide. No one would dare to do that. Especially in an elite area in LA.\n\"I guess we have a new VIP client. Make sure to tag him in the system,\" he instructed, \"I will oversee this order and make sure it reflects the best of our services.\"\nDamien nodded and left the office. The manager pressed the intercom on his desk and called for the establishment's most trusted delivery personnel, and told him to wait for him.\nAfter he did that, he stood up and went to the kitchen.\n\"Chef, we have a very special VVIP order. Take very special care of it,\" he said, as he handed the order slip to the head chef.\nThe chef looked at the order and he saw the address. He smiled in realisation and immediately got to work. He understood that this was a chance for him to show off his skill and secure themselves a very reputable customer.\nHe made the meal, pouring everything he had into it — a performance-level effort that turned cooking into art, and the manager oversaw everything. After he was done, the kitchen assistants diligently packaged the meal and securely loaded it into the delivery car.\n\"Ben, drive carefully. Also, if possible, try to get a view of the person's face. A picture would be better but be discreet about it. Don't be disrespectful,\" the manager said to the delivery personnel.\nHe's just trying to gather a bit of information about the so called \"mysterious buyer\".\nIn elite business circles, staff gossip and low-key intel gathering isn't uncommon — especially when a mysterious billionaire suddenly orders food from a newly purchased megamansion.\nSince he had already told Ben to not be disrespectful, it was enough to tell the delivery driver that he wasn't being sent to act like paparazzi. He's just being curious while maintaining boundaries\n\"I got it, boss,\" Ben said and got into the restaurant-branded Toyota Prius. He started the engine and drove off to the delivery address.\nAs he watched the back of the car fade into the distance, the manger muttered to himself, \"If this goes well, we might just secure the most valuable client we've ever had.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 24 - Group's Reaction\nLater that night—Lana's room\nAfter a chaotic and emotionally draining day, she could finally rest. She collapsed into her soft, pink bed and smiled tiredly.\nImmediately, the first thing that came to her mind was what happened at the store today. She'd met Liam earlier that day—and he'd casually splurged more than $100,000. And she found out that he's the mysterious buyer of the property that has been hot in the news for the whole day.\nLiam. Just who is he really? What sort of monstrous family background does he have to be able to easily afford a property of $70m+? Just how rich is he?\nShe had these questions and more going through her head, but she couldn't get an answer to any of them.\nShe sighed tiredly and rolled over on the bed, snuggling herself into it and making herself more comfortable.\nHer phone buzzed and she picked it up from the nightstand. She saw that someone had send a message to their group chat, Chaos Corner.\nShe suddenly thought of something and smiled. She opened the group chat and sent a message.\n\"Guys, guess who I saw today\"\nKristie: \"Who?!\"\nMatt: \"Come on, just tell us. Don't keep us waiting in suspense.\"\nStacy: \"Tell us, Lana.\"\nOthers: \"Yeah.\"\nLana shook her head, smiling from ear to ear, as she read their messages. She decidednkt to keep them in suspense any longer, as she sent another message.\n\"Liam.\"\nStacy: \"Liam? Where?\"\n\"Rodeo Drive.\"\nStacy: \"Ohhh...\"\n\"Guess what happened.\"\nMatt: \"Come on! Just tell us already!\"\nHarper: \"It's already obvious what she's doing 🤣🤣\"\nAlex: \"Tsk. Tsk. I had no idea when our sweet Lana became so evil. Who influenced her? I'm suspecting someone\"\nKristie: \"Come on, girl. Spill!!!\"\nLana giggled when she saw their reaction. Stacy and Elise love doing this, but she has no idea this was how good it feels.\nShe smiled, as she typed her message.\n\"He bought some clothes and stuffs from my mom's store that totalled more than $100,000.\"\nMatt: \"He's splurging. Wow!\"\nAlex: \"That's a lot of money to spend on clothes in a go. Bro is really loaded. Makes me wonder if he's actually the same Liam.\"\nElise: \"He probably changed his wardrobe or something.\"\nLana smiled and took a deep breath when she saw their messages. She wonder how they will react when she drops the bomb.\nShe was about to type out what she learned about Liam, when Alex sent a message.\n\"Talking about people with hidden identities. Someone with a mysterious and hidden identity bought one of the biggest properties in the country.\"\nElise: \"I saw that. Bellemere Mansion. I remember when you said that the property wasn't listed and had just been sitting there for years now.\"\nAlex: \"Yeah. Not only that but a lot of people had tried to purchase it, but the original owner had refused to sell.\"\nKristie: \"It's one of the reasons why the news about it sudden sale blew up when it came out. I thought they would keep it under wraps though. Considering how popular it is.\"ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nKristopher: \"That would be close to impossible. Though no one was saying anything, everyone residing in the Platinum Triangle neighbourhoods were paying very close attention to it. If they tried to keep it under wraps, those people have their own special ways of finding out things.\"\nStacy: \"Seems like whoever it is has become a celebrity, even though they might not want it.\"\nElise: \"That's true. But I'm sure that the person will be able to take care of things and handle the attention, and everything that will come. To be able to buy the property from the original owner who was so stubborn and refused to sell, whoever it is must be of high status. Maybe someone from those families.\"\nAlex: \"Probably. I actually thought that price would be higher. Considering the whole attention on it, the speculative value was already between $120m+ to $200m+. But for the official amount to be way less than that. I was really shocked.\"\nHarper: \"Who knows? It might not be actual amount. Maybe it costs more and they only disclosed this amount for some reason.\"\nKristie: \"I highly doubts it. Disclosing this much would only make people even more curious. Not disclosing it all would had actually been better.\"\nAlex: \"But then again, everything was just speculation for those in the real estate market. It was also due to how stubborn the original owner was, that actually made the price to rise so much. Maybe the original price was exactly as disclosed.\"\nKristie: \"Maybe. We will probably find out in the future. I think my dad will dig into it. But he will have to careful not to get himself into trouble.\"\nAlex: \"Same with my dad. But he will get the information from the firm's headquarters.\"\nLana was reading the messages and as she read, she realised how much of a terrifying identity Liam might have. She was finally understanding why her mother's doing her best to gather as much information as she discretely and possibly can on him.\nShe sighed heavily and decided to send the message to the group. She can't keep it to herself. It's something too heavy and scary. Besides, it would be very wrong of her to do so.\n\"Guys, Liam is the owner of the Bellemere Mansion. He's the mysterious buyer.\"\nThe group chat that was bubbling with messages, suddenly went quiet. It was like someone cast a drought spell on it.\nFew seconds later.\nEveryone: \"No f'ing way!!!\"\nStacy: \"Lana, are you serious? How did you find out?\"\nAlex: \"Lana! Please! Spill!\"\nKristie: \"Lana, please tell us what happened!\"\nLana smiled and sighed when she saw their reactions. She was expecting and it did feel good seeing how they were begging her to spill what she knew, but her heart felt equally heavy.\nShe sighed once more and typed the message.\n\"After he made the payment for the things he bought, he asked for home delivery. I told him that I was already familiar with his address since he lives in the same residential complex as Stacy, but he told me he just moved. I asked for the new address and he told me that he's now staying at Bellemere Mansion in Holmby Hills. I was really shocked to say the least. I lost myself for a moment and asked him again to confirm, and he said the same thing.\"\nHarper: \"Holy sh*t!!!\"\nKristopher: \"Wow!!! Like dayum!!!\"\nKristie: \"I'm honestly out of words. Like I really have no idea what to say.\"\nAlex: \"I'm even more shocked and speechless. My dad's is going to go crazy when he hear this. The kid that came to his office a few days ago with a multimillion dollar property documents was even more scarier than he thought. He will raise Liam's status to VVIP. Man, that's a property in the Platinum Triangle neighbourhoods!!! That's insane!\"\nHarper: \"I will say this for everyone. Who is Liam?!\"\nStacy: \"I'm the one feeling the most shocked and speechless here. I don't even know how to process everything.\"\nIt wasn't just Stacy that was feeling this emotions. Everyone in the group was. And it was even more chaotic for those that have no idea who the mysterious buyer of the property is.\nAs for the person that caused the chaos? He was enjoying the luxury of his new home.\nA/N: I've probably dragged the day for too long. Please continue to support the book with power stones. It helps with visibility on the platform. Your comments are appreciated too. I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for reading!",

      "content": "Chapter 25 - The Delivery\n\"Mmmmnhaaah...,\" Liam yawned loudly as he stretched like a cat on the ultra-comfortable bed.\nHis arms extended above his head, his back arched just slightly, and the soft sheets rustled under him. The morning sun had already flooded into the room through the tall, automated windows, casting gentle rays across the cream-toned walls and accent pieces. The warmth made the entire scene feel more like a dream than reality.\nHe yawned again, rolling over and slowly pushing himself into a sitting position on the bed.\nHis gaze drifted toward the enormous window wall that overlooked the greenery of the vast front lawn. The sun hit the freshly trimmed field just right, highlighting the vibrant hues of the grass and distant topiary edges.\nA faint smile appeared on his face.\nEven now, everything still felt surreal. But with each passing moment, he was slowly getting used to it. The World-Class Etiquette skill helped. It allowed him to naturally adapt—not just in how he spoke or moved—but in how he processed this new world around him.\nHe reached out and picked up his phone from the nightstand.\n10:22 AM.\n\"I woke up late... I guess it can't be helped since it was until past midnight before I slept.\"\nHe placed the phone back and leaned into the plush headboard, his mind trailing back to the night before.\nAfter finishing the meal delivered to him, he'd spent hours in the private home theater. The recliners were absurdly comfortable—almost more so than his bed. With surround sound perfectly tuned and an IMAX-like screen, the experience had pulled him in like a portal to another dimension.\nHe watched three movies back-to-back. Before he knew it, it was nearly 2 AM.\nA nostalgic grin tugged at the corners of his mouth.\n\"There's still so much about this mansion I haven't even touched. I'll get to them all soon. For now... I should clean up. The clothes should be arriving soon,\" he muttered, sliding off the bed and heading for the bathroom.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nAlmost half an hour later, Liam stepped out of the bathroom wearing a loose white T-shirt and navy cotton pants. His hair was still slightly damp, and his face was glowing from the warm water and skincare amenities he'd found there.\n\"What a bathroom experience,\" he said to himself, shaking his head with a quiet chuckle.\nThe bathroom at the penthouse apartment had been impressive, but this... this was something else entirely. The sheer size, the amenities, the way the room seemed to respond to his presence with automatic drawers and water settings—everything made him feel like he was living a billionaire's dream.\nNot like he wasn't.\nHe had spent the first ten minutes simply exploring the space, fascinated by it all.\nAfter finishing, he'd stood in the center of his massive walk-in wardrobe—completely empty aside from the custom suit, his shoes, and the watch.\nHe glanced at the single hanger holding his outfit from the previous day.\n\"Aren't they here yet?\"\nAs if on cue, the doorbell rang—a soft, melodious chime that echoed through the living room and gently into the rest of the mansion.\nLiam's brows raised slightly. \"Timing.\"\nHe turned and left his room, walking down the hallway toward the dual central stairs. The marble steps were cool under his feet as he made his way down to the expansive living room.\nOnce there, he approached the front door and tapped the small touchscreen panel mounted beside it. The security camera view popped up instantly, showing the front gate.\nThere stood Lana.\nLiam blinked in faint surprise, but the moment passed quickly. He knew that she was here with the delivery.\nHe reached out and pressed the silver button beneath the screen. A faint mechanical click sounded outside as the gate smoothly slid open.\nLiam opened the front door and waited.\nA moment later, the sleek white Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Van, emblazoned with Dior's minimalist logo in black, glided quietly down the driveway. The vehicle was clean, polished, and clearly custom-outfitted for high-end home deliveries. The tires barely made a sound on the paved driveway.\nAs the van came to a gentle stop near the front steps, the passenger door opened, and Lana stepped out gracefully, followed by a young female assistant whom Liam instantly recognized—the same sales associate who had attended to him in the VIP client room yesterday.\nThe driver, a tall man in a crisp black uniform, also exited the van and walked around to the rear.\nAll three of them offered polite bows and greetings.\n\"Good morning, Mr. Liam,\" Lana said, keeping her tone professional but warm. \"We've brought your items as promised.\"\nLiam nodded with a small smile. \"Perfect timing. Thank you.\"\n\"If I may ask,\" she continued, \"where would you like us to arrange the items?\"\nLiam turned slightly and gestured toward the interior. \"Yes. Come, I'll show you.\"\nLana nodded. Before following, she turned to the female sales associate. \"Please start bringing the items inside. We'll arrange them in the wardrobe.\"\n\"Yes, Miss,\" the woman responded and moved to open the rear compartment.\nLana followed Liam into the house, and the moment she stepped into the foyer, her steps paused involuntarily.\nShe wasn't prepared. The grandeur of Bellemere Mansion's interior was unlike anything she'd expected.\nThe living room opened up like a modern palace—tall ceilings with ambient lighting, an elegant mix of classic and modern interior design, and a quiet harmony that only the most luxurious spaces had.\nShe composed herself quickly and continued walking behind Liam as he led her through the corridor and up the main staircase. His presence was calm, poised. He walked like someone born into this kind of world, and she found herself admiring his ability to wear everything calmly like a natural extension of himself, without making noise about it.\nThey entered his bedroom, and Liam casually pointed at the wardrobe.\n\"This way.\"\nLana walked in and gave a soft nod of approval. It was large, clean, and empty—just as expected. She turned and offered him a confirming glance.\n\"I'll bring them up.\"\nWith that, she returned to the front door, where the assistant had already started carrying several sleek Dior garment bags and branded storage boxes up the steps.\nTogether, they transported everything upstairs, careful not to scuff anything or leave a trace behind.\nIt took them a little over thirty minutes to fully complete the task. Every item was unboxed, unwrapped, and hung or arranged in the wardrobe to perfection.\nThe shirts were lined by color gradient, the pants folded and stacked with precision, shoes aligned on glass shelves, and belts displayed neatly.\nLana oversaw everything like a practiced stylist. She adjusted hangers, smoothed fabric, and made sure each item was positioned in a way that matched VVIP presentation standards.\nAfter it was done, she turned to Liam and gave a small, graceful bow.\n\"All your items have been arranged, Mr. Liam. Thank you for trusting us with this delivery.\"\nThe assistant echoed her gratitude with a smaller nod.\nLiam, who had observed them silently for most of the arrangement, noticed how Lana had kept things completely professional.\nShe called him by a title throughout and didn't make any unnecessary interaction with him. She didn't ask him anything, neither did she say anything that didn't relate to work.\nHe smiled. \"Thank you both. Everything looks perfect.\"\nThey bowed one last time and excused themselves. Liam watched from the window of the living room as the delivery team walked back to the Sprinter, loaded the empty cases, and drove back down the long driveway. The gate closed quietly behind them.\nHe remained at the window for a moment before letting out a soft yawn and collapsing onto the living room couch.\n\"I'm starving again...\"\nHe pulled out his phone and opened the app from the restaurant he ordered from last night. And he quickly placed his order.\nWhile waiting for his food, he leaned back and relaxed into the cushions.\nFinally, time to do what he hadn't done since he woke up.\n\"System, sign-in.\"",

You received $1,000,000]ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\n[You received Rolls-Royce Ghost Black Badge]\n[The car's key is in the system's inventory.]\n***\nWow! Another cash reward today? And I even got another car. The system is really spoiling me.\nLiam had thought that after the massive sign-in rewards of yesterday, today's reward would be reduced or something along the line but he was wrong.\nNot only did it not reduce, it actually seen to have become more valuable. A cash reward of $1 million and a luxury car. This was one of the best daily sign-in rewards so far.\nLiam picked up his phone and saw that the money had already been deposited. His account balance now sat comfortably above $8 million.\nHe smiled when he saw his balance. It has been increasing nearly everyday, going from less than $20 to millions in just a week. But the only problem is that he has no idea what to spend the money on... yet.\nLet's not think about that. Even though I have no idea now, something will definitely pop up in the near future.\nThe next moment, he heard a buzzer from the gate intercom system. He stood up from the sofa and walked to the small touchscreen panel beside the front door.\nDisplayed on the screen was the familiar restaurant-branded car from last night.\nLiam opened the front door and walked down the driveway to the gate, to receive the package personally.\nWhen he got to the gate, he saw the same delivery personnel from waiting with a polite and respectful smile on his face.\nWhen he saw Liam, he gave a short, respectful bow and gave him the package, and got back into the car.\nLiam collected the package and thanked the man. As the man raised his head and walked back to his car, though it was only for a brief moment, but he could see the shock, curiosity and disbelief in his eyes.\nHe naturally understood why the man was having such emotions, as he has been getting reactions like that since yesterday.\nI wonder when it will stop?\nHe smiled to himself as he walked back to the mansion.\nInside, he sat down at the dining and enjoyed the delicious meal he had ordered.\n\"Even more delicious than yesterday, the chef is really good,\" he moaned in pleasure, as he relished the delicious taste of the food.\nAs he ate, Liam realised that he would need to employ some workers—maids to help with cleaning the house. They might not do the cooking as he can take care of that, but cleaning such a big house is something he can't do by himself.\nBut how do I find one? Should I check online? Would probably find one but I don't want just anybody, I need someone trustworthy. It would be best if it's someone recommended by someone I know.\nWell that's the problem. Liam doesn't know anone like that. He doesn't even have a y friend. He thought about it and he suddenly remembered Stacy. He also remembered that he promised to take her out for a treat to repay her kindness. There's also her friends too, which he would love to get closer to.\nWith that thought, he decided to text Stacy and invite her, and her friends to come over to his place.\nHe texted her and he got a reply immediately.\nStacy: \"Hi. Good morning.\"\nLiam: \"Good morning. Are you busy? I want to invite you guys over to my place.\"\nWithout being told, he could already guess that Lana had told her and others where he's staying now, so there was no need to tell her that he has moved.\nAfter he sent the message, it took a while for Stacy to respond.\n\"You mean your new place? Bellemere Mansion?\" She asked.\n\"Yes. I want you and everyone to come,\" Liam replied.\n\"Ummm... Sure. Sure. Just tell me when and we will be there.\"\n\"Today. 4 PM.\"\n\"Ok. Thanks. I will inform the others. We will definitely be there. Thank you again for inviting us ☺️☺️\"\nLiam smiled at her message and dropped his phone back on the dining table, and continued eating his meal.\nAfter he was done eating, he thought of what to do but nothing specific really came to mind. He checked the time and he saw that he it was nearly noon and he decided to just relax and enjoy himself by watching movies in the private home theatre.\nAs he walked to the theatre, he thought of working out and testing out his strength but he decided against it. He doesn't feel the need to.\nYes, he has been growing stronger lately but since he has surpassed 20 points in all attributes, and still within the range of what other humans can achieve, there was really no need for him to stress himself.\nBesides, he had done manual jobs for years, working as construction worker and doing other physically taxing works, before getting the job at the restaurant where he was fired.\nInside the theatre, Liam took his seat on a recliner and picked up the control tablet. He controlled the lighting, dimming it, controlled the curtains, turned on the AC, toggled the TV screen and selected a movie.\nThe movie started and he controlled the sound system, lowering and increasing the volume to the level he wanted.\nHe relaxed more comfortably into the recliner and smiled, focusing his attention on the movie playing.\nYeah, this is the life!\n***\nAfter the chat with Liam, Stacy immediately texted the group chat and telling them about his invitation.\nThe group's activity went up immediately and they all wanted to confirm from Stacy if what she said was true. When she confirmed it, they all went quiet for a while before their messages started flooding back in.\nThey were still talking about Lana's experience when she went to deliver the clothes to his place, and now he's inviting them? They actually couldn't believe it.\nThey have no idea why Liam was inviting them. Does he actually want to be friends with them or does heneed something from them?\nEither way, they were very curious to find out. At least, they know that they don't have to worry about anything bad happening to them as they didn't treat Liam bad that night. In fact, they welcomed him as one of their own, even though he was completely new. And so, their mind was at peace.\nBut they were feeling very excited to finally grace the popular Bellemere Mansion and possibly become friends with Liam. Though they don't expect the latter to happen immediately, but they are willing to show that they will be valuable to him.",

      "content": "Chapter 27 - Grocery Shopping\nLater that afternoon.\nThe second movie had just finished playing. Liam picked up his phone to check the time as he remembered that Stacy and her friends are coming over.\n3:16 PM. They should be arriving soon and I haven't even thought of preparing what they will eat.\nSince he's inviting them over and they will be his guests, then he will have to treat them. Which mean he has to cook what they will eat but his kitchen is completely empty of ingredients. He would need to go and buy groceries.\nYes, he can order something the food but Liam felt that it wouldn't be appropriate. They are coming to his house, it's only appropriate that they eat home cooked meal. It's completely different if he's taking them out or something.\nBesides, he wants to show off his World-Class Culinary Arts skill.\nFor the groceries, Liam thought of possibly ordering them online and having it delivered to his place, but he decided against it.\nHe decided to use it as an opportunity to get some fresh air. He has been stuck inside the house for half the day, he really need to stretch his legs a little.\nHe picked up the control tablet and switched off the TV, the AC and opened the curtain, allowing sunlight to flood the theatre.\nAfter he was done with that, he stood up from the recliner and left the home theatre, before making his way to the garage.\nStepping into the garage, the first thing Liam noticed was the new arrival—the Rolls-Royce Ghost Black Badge—parked there elegantly.\nAs a sucker for the color black, the car looks stunning.\nThe deep obsidian black paint absorbed garage's light more than it reflected, giving the car a mysterious, almost void-like presence. Unlike the showy gleam of most luxury cars, this one had a subtle, commanding matte gloss but it made it impossible to ignore.\nThe Spirit of Ecstasy on the hood wasn't silver—it was gloss black, stealthy and dignified. Even the grille and trim—normally polished chrome—had been darkened to a sleek blackened chrome, keeping the theme consistent and refined.\nIts long silhouette looked like it was carved from obsidian, with every curve flowing into the next. The 23-inch carbon alloy wheels were finished in a tinted gloss black, revealing deep red brake calipers that hinted at something fiercer beneath the calm surface.\nEven without seeing the interior of the car, Liam already understood why the brand is praised and loved so much by people.\nHe wanted nothing more at the moment than to take that car out for a spin but he held himself back. He was going to the grocery store, he can't drive a Rolls Royce there... Right?\nYes, he can but he doesn't want to attract any unnecessary attention to himself, so he won't.\nThe Rolls Royce Ghost Black Badge had now increased the total number of cars he has to five. And he's yet to drive more than half of them.\nHe smiled as he took out the Maserati GranTurismo key fob from the system inventory and pressed the unlock button.Follow current novels on NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nHe opened the door, slid into the driver's seat, and started the engine. The car roared to life and he steered it out of the garage, down the long driveway and through the gate.\nHe drove down the streets of Holmby Hills, making his way to the nearest grocery store being displayed on the car's GPS system.\n***\nFew minutes later, Liam parked in front of the store and stepped out of the car.\nHe looked at the store in front of him and shook his head in amusement.\nIt was just a grocery store—but only in name.\nThe store sat on a corner plot, its wide single-story structure easily three times the size of a regular supermarket. The exterior was minimalist and modern, designed with light stone, soft wood paneling, and wide vertical windows that stretched nearly from ground to roof. A single matte-gold logo sat above the entrance in small, tasteful lettering: Linden Market.\nThe clean-cut façade that blended effortlessly with the upscale surroundings.\nA uniformed valet at the side entrance nodded at Liam respectfully, even though he hadn't used the valet service.\nLiam smiled faintly and walked toward the glass doors.\nThey slid open smoothly, revealing an interior that felt more like a luxury boutique than a grocery store.\nThe floor was made of pale travertine marble, polished to a gentle gleam. Soft instrumental music played quietly through discreet ceiling speakers. The scent of fresh-cut flowers and subtle citrus cleaner lingered in the air. Lighting was soft and ambient, seemingly focused more on atmosphere than brightness.\nA concierge desk—the counter—sat to the right of the entrance. A well-dressed staff member behind it glanced up, offered a small nod, and returned to assisting a woman dressed in beige designer leisurewear.\nLiam's eyes scanned the space.\nThe aisles were wide—broader than most living rooms—and lined with neatly arranged shelves filled with imported goods, artisanal brands, and organic produce. The layout wasn't cluttered as it looked clean with its intentional design.\nHe walked past a display of fresh fruit stacked like art—each apple, pear, and pomegranate carefully arranged. To the left was a glass counter for pre-prepped meals, with staff in chef whites serving small, curated dishes like roasted duck salad and truffle pasta.\nMost of the customers didn't look rushed and one pushed carts with items piled high. Instead, they carried matte black handbaskets and took their time selecting things like wildflower honey, imported matcha powder, and $40 artisan bread.\nLiam couldn't help but smile again.\nEven the grocery shopping experience here was part of a curated lifestyle.\nHe picked up a handbasket and walked into the aisles, casually scanning the shelves. There were no prices on most items. Either you knew, or you didn't care.\nHe couldn't help but thank the system for the World-Class Etiquette skill, because without it, he would be completely lost and unable to carry himself properly in such a place.\nHe smiled to himself once more and started picking what he came for as he moved calmly through the aisles, scanning the meticulously arranged sections.\nDespite how pristine and curated everything looked, he wasn't the least bit uncomfortable. His posture was relaxed and his pace unhurried. The World-Class Etiquette skill guided his every motion subtly—how he glanced at items, how he picked up and inspected products without fumbling, how he navigated around other shoppers.\nThe skill was really shaping him up and helping him adapt quickly to the world he was suddenly thrown into.\nHe started picking the items he needed from the sections. He wants to buy enough grocery to stock his kitchen for a few days and also for what he would cook for Stacy and her friends.\nHe had already decided on what to cook. The main course would be herb-roasted chicken Thighs with saffron jasmine rice, and the side dish would be heirloom tomato & avocado salad with balsamic glaze. Then ice cream with fruit slices for desert, and for refreshments, chilled citrus-mint mocktails.\nSounds very fancy and probably hard to cook. Fancy, yes. But hard? Not at all. Liam has World-Class Culinary Arts skill, no meal is hard for him to make.\nBy the time Liam was done with picking the things he needed and made it to the checkout counter, his handbasket was full—but not exaggeratedly so. It was a curated selection, just like everything in the store.\nThe cashier, a young woman in a pale gray uniform, greeted him politely again.\n\"Good afternoon, sir. I hope you found everything you were looking for?\"\n\"Yes, thank you,\" Liam replied, and placed the basket on the counter.\nShe began scanning the items—each one sliding across the sensor with a soft beep, the price showing briefly on the screen before disappearing.\nThe total rang up on the discreet side screen: $684.32.\nLiam didn't flinch as he pulled out his card and tapped it on the terminal. The beep confirmed the payment had gone through, and the cashier bowed slightly.\n\"Would you like assistance carrying these to your car?\"\n\"No need. I'm good,\" Liam replied calmly.\nThe groceries were placed into three matte-black, reusable shopping bags with the Linden Market logo printed in small gold lettering. They were sturdy and beautifully made—likely worth a lot.\nLiam thanked the staff, took the bags, and exited through the glass doors.\nOutside, the sun had shifted to the softer tones of late afternoon. His Maserati gleamed under the gentle light, its dark curves reflecting the manicured trees that lined the store's perimeter.\nHe walked to the car, opened the trunk, and carefully placed the bags inside before climbing into the driver's seat.\nThe engine purred to life with a low, growl.\nAs he pulled out of the parking space and steered toward the exit, Liam spared one last glance at the store through the rearview mirror.\n\"Grocery shopping feels like a fashion show here,\" he said to himself with a light laugh.\nThe drive home was quiet and smooth. The streets of Holmby Hills were peaceful, the neighborhood perfectly landscaped and watched over by discreet security patrols.\nEvery home here was an estate and has a story behind them, giving them their prestige. And the same was so Liam's property.\nSoon, the front gates of Bellemere Mansion appeared ahead, and as he approached, they parted for him automatically.\nThe tires crunched softly over the drive as he pulled into the garage and parked the Maserati beside the Rolls-Royce.\nHe popped the trunk, grabbed the grocery bags, and walked toward the interior door.\nBy the time he got to the kitchen, it was 3:40 PM.\n\"They'll be here in twenty minutes...\" he muttered, placing the bags on the counter and moving quickly but gracefully.\nHe was already running out of time but he felt that he would probably be done before they arrive.\nHe unpacked the ingredients like a professional chef preparing for a TV show. The kitchen island became his stage, and the ingredients his co-stars.\nTime to show them what World-Class Culinary Arts really meant.\nA/N: Do you guys need pictures of the cars?",

      "content": "Chapter 28 - Cooking With Stacy\nOnly a few minutes had passed, but everything in the kitchen was progressing smoothly. Even though the dish he's making is something he has never made before, he didn't feel any pressure or make any mistake, as everything has been perfect so far.\nDue to the time constraints, he decided to prepare the side dish and the drink first, before the main course. He has less than twenty minutes and Stacy, and her friends would be arriving soon. He wants to make sure that when they arrive, he can offer them something while they wait for the main course.\nSince he was only dealing with vegetables and fruits, he was able to finish making it quickly.\nAnd just as he was finishing with them and putting the chicken in the oven, and getting the rice ready to cook, he heard the familiar buzzer of the gate's intercom system.\nHe turned to the small touchscreen positioned in a corner in the kitchen and he saw Stacy standing at the gate. He walked to it and pressed the gate control button and the gate opened automatically.\nHe watched as Stacy and her friends drove into the compound, and parked their cars in the visitor's parking space close to the garage, before walking to the front door.\nLiam put down the knife he was holding, washed his hands and dried it with a clean towel, and left the kitchen. He walked to the front door and opened it.\nStanding at the door were Stacy and her friends. Though Liam didn't remember all of their names, he did remember some, especially Lana, Matt, Kristie and Kristopher.\n\"Hi guys,\" he greeted.\n\"Hi,\" they all greeted slightly awkwardly.\n\"Come on in, guys. Don't stand at the entrance,\" he said as he stepped away from the entrance.\nThey all nodded at Liam respectfully and walked through the door. When inside, they paused for a moment and took in the view of the mansion's interior.\nThey had already heard from Lana about how beautiful and amazing the whole place is but words can't do it justice.\nLiam smiled when he saw their reaction. Yes, the mansion is pretty amazing. Even he, the owner, is still getting used to it.\n\"Please make yourself comfortable,\" he said, gesturing to the sofas in the living room before walking to the kitchen.\nThey nodded when they heard what Liam and they walked to the living room, but Stacy didn't as she followed behind him.\n\"Hey,\" she called out, as she chased after him.\nLiam turned back and was surprised to see Stacy following him.\n\"Hey.\"\n\"Ummm... I can smell what you're cooking in the kitchen. I was wondering if I could help out with something. If you don't mind of course,\" she said with a low voice and a polite, yet slightly nervous smile.\nLiam looked at her for a moment, slightly taken aback. He was really surprised as he never expected her to offer to help out.\nShe just keep proving to me that I saw her in a wrong perspective. Very wrong perspective. Or did she grow up?...\nHe was quite confused as she wasn't acting anything at all like the Stacy he knew. Or maybe he didn't know her at all.\nActually, now that he thought of it. He never really interacted with her and he never got to know what sort of person she was. The whole image he built about was from what he saw from the distance, what people said and how she carried herself.\nAlso, it was years ago since he last saw her. A lot of things had probably happened since then and she might had changed thanks to them.\nLiam sighed internally and made a decision to discard the previous image he has about Stacy, and start seeing her for who she actually is.\nAnd so, he decided to allow her help out in the kitchen.\n\"Sure,\" he nodded.\n\"Thank you,\" Stacy smiled, looking really happy.\nThe both walked to the kitchen and Liam continued what he was doing. But since they are already here, he decided to serve them the side dish.\nStacy's friends watched her following behind Liam and looked at each other in confusion.\n\"Is she seriously helping him cook?\" Matt whispered, wide-eyed.\n\"I think she is,\" Kristie murmured softly.\n\"Wow,\" Matt smiled in disbelief.\n***\nInside the kitchen.\nLiam dished the salad and readied the drink, before turning to Stacy who was standing behind him, looking at him with surprise on her face.\n\"Here. Can you help me serve this,\" he asked and she nodded.\nShe picked up the plates and took them to to the dining table, while Liam focused on the rice and chicken for the main course.\nAfter Stacy was done with serving the salad and mocktail, she returned to the kitchen to continue helping him.\n\"Aren't you going to eat your salad?\" Liam asked in surprise, when he saw her standing there, watching him.\nHe looked at the last plate of salad on the kitchen island and looked at Stacy.\n\"Ummm. Can I eat it here?\" She asked.\n\"Why not?\" Liam smiled.\n\"Thank you,\" Stacy said and immediately stuffed a piece of heirloom tomato and avocado into her mouth.\nHer eyes closed, as she relished the taste.\n\"This salad's so good,\" she muttered, as she stuffed more piece into her mouth.\n\"Hey. Take it slow. Don't choke yourself,\" Liam chuckled.\nHe was really happy that she was genuinely enjoying it as he could see it from her face. Who doesn't love their work being appreciated?\n\"Truthfully, I would say that this is one of the best salads I've ever had. And I'm not flattering you. I can't wait for the main course,\" Stacy said, stuffing more of the tomatoe and avocado into her mouth.\n\"Thank you for the praise,\" Liam smiled.\n\"Not at all. You're such a good cook. I can't help but be impressed. You're really just impossible to figure out,\" she smiled.\nLiam chuckled at her words but he didn't say anything.\n\"Ohhh, least I forget, congratulations on your new place. It's really cool,\" Stacy said with sincerity.\n\"Thank you.\"\n\"I'm sure you know how popular you are right now,\" smiled at him.\n\"Popular? How?\" Liam asked, quite surprised and slightly confused.\n\"Come on. Don't tell me that you don't know about the online articles about the mansion being sold to a mysterious buyer.\"\n\"Ohhh, that? I didn't actually pay much attention to them,\" Liam smiled.\nIt was just as he said. He never did pay attention to them.\n\"Of course you didn't. But who would had thought that you were the mysterious buyer. I couldn't contain my reaction when I found out. Actually, I was beyond shocked and speechless.,\" Stacy said as she thought back to what Lana revealed in the group chat last night.Follow current novels on NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\n\"I guess there are a lot of shocking things,\" Liam smiled and turned to look at her, \"Like you for instance.\"\n\"Me?\" Stacy asked in confusion.\n\"Yeah. You had no idea but we went to the same middle school and high school together,\" Liam replied.\n\"Huh?\" Stacy blinked, stunned. \"...Wait. What?\"\n\"Maple Hill Middle School, Class 2-B, 9th grade. Hillshire High, Homeroom 10A. Hillshire Spirit Squad. I wasn't noticeable back then. You probably never saw me.\"\nStacy couldn't believe it. She felt that Liam was probably joking with her. Besides, with his power, digging up information on her was far too easy. She refuse to believe that she went to the same school with him.\nLiam saw the disbelief on Stacy's face and he started calling out some names, mentioning some casual and minor things that happened in class, or at school. Something only someone who actually went to school there would know.\n\"I... You... How?\" She asked in utter disbelief.\nLiam didn't say anything as he continued what he was doing.\nTime passed as Liam got lost in what he was doing. Stacy also helped out silently with disbelief still on her face. It seems like it will take her a while to come to terms with what Liam said.\nMore than half an hour later, a very rich aroma filled and wafted out from the kitchen, spreading all over the living room and dining.\nFood was ready.",

This smells delicious,\" Kristie said with a bright smile on her face, her eyes lighting up as she stared at the dishes in front of her.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nEveryone else was already seated around the large dining table, eyes wide and focused on the perfectly arranged plates.\nThe vibrant golden rice gave off a light saffron aroma, the herb-roasted chicken thighs were perfectly crisp with a glistening glaze.\nLiam placed the last of the dishes on the table and took his seat with a soft, welcoming smile. \"Thank you all for coming. I really appreciate you being here today.\"\n\"You're the one thanking us?\" Matt chuckled. \"Liam, you invited us into Bellemere Mansion, cooked for us, and treated us like royalty. If anything, we should be thanking you.\"\n\"Seriously,\" Harper added with a light laugh. \"I don't think any of us have ever been hosted like this by someone our age. You've set the bar a little too high.\"\n\"Thank you for inviting us,\" Kristopher said, raising his glass. \"To Liam.\"\n\"To Liam,\" everyone echoed, clinking their mocktails together gently.\nWith the pleasantries out of the way, the group turned their attention to the food.\nOne by one, they picked up their utensils and took the first bite. And one by one, their expressions shifted.\nLana blinked in disbelief. Matt's eyes widened. Elise let out a small gasp. Even Alex paused mid-chew, visibly stunned.\n\"This is... incredible,\" Kristie said slowly, as though trying to confirm that her tongue wasn't playing tricks on her.\n\"Okay, I was ready to give you compliments either way,\" Harper said, shaking her head with a smile. \"But this is not me flattering you. This food tastes exceptional.\"\nThey all went back in for another bite. Then another. And soon, the table grew quiet—not out of awkwardness, but from mutual reverence for what they were tasting.\n\"This chicken is better than anything I've had at my dad's private dinner parties,\" Kristopher said. \"And he literally hires celebrity chefs.\"\n\"The rice...\" Kristie muttered, \"how is it this fluffy and fragrant?\"\nMatt gave a muffled groan. \"Bro, I'd pay to eat this again. Like, seriously.\"\nAs they ate, their eyes kept darting to Liam, curiosity bubbling behind every glance. They wanted to ask—how did he learn to cook like this? Where did he train? How was it possible that someone their age could create dishes better than half the professionals they'd encountered in their lives?\nBut none of them asked.\nIt wasn't just the taste. It was the way the food was plated, the portions, the texture, the contrast of flavors—it all spoke of someone with not just talent, but mastery. And that... was hard to question without sounding intrusive.\nSo, they simply enjoyed it.\nAfter everyone was done, they sat back, sipping the last of their mocktails with satisfied expressions and full bellies.\n\"Liam, this was honestly perfect,\" Stacy said softly, smiling at him from across the table.\n\"Yeah, man. You seriously outdid yourself,\" Alex added, giving him a thumbs-up.\nLiam nodded appreciatively. \"Thanks. I'm glad you all enjoyed it. I also got a little help from Stacy.\"\nThey all laughed when they heard this.\n\"Nahh. I didn't do much except stand around in the kitchen and cause distraction,\" Stacy laughed.\nAs the others started rising from the table and heading toward the living room to relax, Liam remained behind, quietly gathering up the plates and cutlery.\nTo his surprise, Stacy stayed behind as well.\n\"I'll help,\" she said, already reaching for a stack of dishes.\n\"You don't have to,\" Liam said.\n\"I know,\" she replied, giving him a grin. \"But let me. Please.\"\n\"Sure,\" Liam nodded.\nTogether, they cleared the table, their movements synchronized and casual. Liam carried most of the heavier dishes while Stacy grabbed the glasses and lighter items.\nOnce inside the kitchen, Stacy washed while Liam dried and put things away.\nLiam glanced sideways at Stacy and noticed that the disbelief from earlier had faded. Her face had relaxed into her usual calm expression.\nHe smiled and continued what he was doing. Though she was calm on the surface, he knew that something has changed and she was still trying to wrap her head around what he told her.\nShe will probably investigate to confirm.\nAfter the dishes were done, they both dried their hands and walked back into the living room together.\nThe rest of the group was lounging comfortably. Some on the long sectional couch, others on the armchairs, chatting softly and enjoying the relaxed atmosphere.\nLiam sat down, and everyone turned to him expectantly.\n\"So... what do you guys want to do now?\" he asked.\nEveryone looked at each other.\n\"Honestly, we didn't have anything planned,\" Lana admitted. \"We just came to chill and see the place.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Matt agreed. \"We're just vibing with whatever the host has planned.\"\nLiam nodded. \"Alright. Then let's just talk.\"\nThey spent the next thirty minutes conversing about random things—recent gossip, funny moments from the group chat, and random topics. Eventually, the conversation circled back to Bellemere Mansion.\n\"So,\" Harper said, raising a brow, \"are we allowed to ask how you managed to buy this place?\"\nLiam smiled calmly. \"I've been fortunate. That's all I'll say.\"\nThere were a few amused glances and nods. Everyone could tell he wasn't going to spill details, and they respected that.\nThere's three things that intrigue and scares the elite—things they don't know, things they don't understand and things they can't control.\nAnd Liam was all three. Everyone here knew that and it's the same reason why they want to be on his good side.\nIt's been a full day since Liam bought the mansion and moved. Some people had probably already dug up his background, but they didn't find what they were looking for.\nAnd what was that? His actual identity. Sure, they may found out about his actual parents and how they technically made him an orphan young, but there was no way that they would believe such two normal, ordinary people gave birth to someone who can easily spend tens of millions of dollars. It was something impossible to believe.\n\"You're like a mystery box,\" Alex muttered.\nKristie laughed. \"A rich mystery box.\"\nEventually, Stacy leaned forward slightly. \"Hey, Liam. You wanna join our group chat?\"\nEveryone looked up.\n\"Yeah!\" Kristie said immediately. \"You should totally join.\"\n\"It's mostly memes and nonsense, but we keep each other in the loop,\" Matt added.\nLiam smiled. \"Sure, why not?\"\nStacy pulled out her phone and tapped away quickly. Moments later, Liam's phone buzzed with the invite. He accepted.\n\"Welcome to Chaos Corner,\" Alex said grandly, and everyone laughed.\n\"If you ever need anything, any assistance, you can chat us up, we will help out if we can,\" Kristopher said and they echoes their agreement would nods.\n\"Thank you. I will hold back,\" Liam smiled.\nThey talked for a little longer, but by now, the sky outside was already beginning to darken. The rich orange glow of sunset filtered through the tall windows.\n\"I think we should head out,\" Matt said, standing.\n\"Yeah, it's getting late,\" Elise added. \"Driving around here too late might not be the best idea.\"\nOne by one, they stood and began thanking Liam again for his hospitality.\nHe walked them to the front door and held it open as they stepped out into the cool evening air.\n\"Thanks again, Liam. For everything,\" Kristopher said with a wave.\n\"See you in the chat,\" Matt grinned.\nEach of them made their way to their cars and started pulling out of the driveway, but Stacy lingered at front door for a moment longer.\nShe stood at the threshold, looking at him.\n\"Thank you,\" she said quietly.\nLiam met her gaze. \"You're welcome.\"\nShe smiled faintly, then looked away and stepped toward her car.\nLiam watched her drive off with the others, the gate closing softly behind them. He exhaled a long breath and stepped back into the quiet of the mansion.",

      "content": "Chapter 30 - Surprising Daily Sign-in Rewards\nWith everyone gone, Liam could finally get some rest and relax. He enjoyed the time he spent with Stacy and her friends, and he doesn't regret inviting them over.\nThey once again proved to him that they are good people and they are worth being friends with.\nNaturally, he noticed the curiosity they had towards him but he also loved the fact that they didn't pry. When they saw that he wasn't giving them any answer, they steered the conversation to something casual.\nAs for Stacy, Liam has no idea how his relationship with her would be going forward because of him revealing to her that he went to the same school and was in the same class as her, but he felt that it won't change much.\nHe was sure that she would investigate to confirm if what he said was true. But Liam doesn't mind. Nothing changed after she confirms it. It might change her attitude towards him. Probably. But that's of little concern to him.\nIt's not like he likes her or anything. Besides wanting to be friends with her, he doesn't want anything else from her.\nThen there's question of how he as someone who came from a modest background was able to attend the same school as Stacy.\nWell, the reason was because his mom was working as a househelp for one particularly rich family.\nFunny enough, the man his mother married was the eldest son of her employer.\nActually, thinking back to it, Liam remembered something and he couldn't help but find his mother's action of marrying that person quite suspicious.\nIf he remembered correctly, two weeks before his dad left, the person would always come to drop off his mom in his car. But he would park at the entrance and a few minutes would pass before his mom step out with a smile.\nWas she...? No, she didn't... But that could be the only explanation for everything.\nLiam sighed as he pushed the thoughts out from his mind. The past was the past. Dwelling on it won't change anything.\nThe night is still young. Might as well do something to pass the time. Should I continue the series I was watching or play some games?\nHe thought about it and finally decided on gaming for the night.\n***\nMeanwhile, as Stacy and her friends were arriving home, they were immediately bombarded with questions by parents and family members.\nTheir questions were naturally about Liam, what they were about to find out from him, what sort of person he is and a couple of other things.\nThe kids were overwhelmed at first but they quickly adjusted and smiled, as they tool their seats and started telling their parents what they knew about Liam.\nNaturally, there was nothing much to say. Their parents had already investigated Liam's background and found nothing relates to his \"actual\" identity. All they found was that he was the child of two ordinary people who abandoned him at quite an early age and since then, he had to start working for himself.\nBut how could they simply believe that those two ordinary people are Liam's actual parents and his background was so simple? If so, then how was he able to buy such a property from the original owner?\nIt was impossible for him to be into something illegal as flags would had already been raised when he bought the house. But nothing has happened so far and it doesn't look like it would happen in the future.\nAnd so, they didn't believe it literally but instead, interpreted it to fit their own narrative—what they wanted to believe. The only explanation that was more believable to them.\nWhat they interpreted Liam's identity and background to was that he was from a very powerful family. The two individuals called his parents are actually staffs from that family tasked to watch over him while he grew up.\nThey didn't abandon him but actually left him to grow up and temper himself by experiencing the world. And when the higher ups in the family felt that he had qualified, he started by giving him a little bit of money, the car and the penthouse. Then everything else followed and now it's the mansion.\nTo them, this was the only plausible explanation. It made far more sense than him being a nobody. Far better sense.\nThis was only for those who knew that Liam is the mysterious buyer of the property. As for those that has no idea, he would still keep being that mysterious buyer.\n***\nThe next morning, Liam woke up feeling quite refreshed. With the usual, bright morning smile on his face, he got into a sitting position on the bed and did his daily ritual.\n\"System sign-in.\"\n[Congratulations, Host. You received $15 million.]\n[You received 0.02 of JP Morgan shares.]\nHuh?\nLiam was little taken aback by the reward. Even though the World-Class Etiquette skill was helping him, he couldn't control his emotions when he saw how he received in cash reward.\nA whopping $15m!!!\nJust this alone was enough to widen his smile and make it brighter, and increase the glow of his face.\n\"$15m??? This...\" Liam was short for words.\nHis phone buzzed and he saw the credit alert of the amount being deposited into his account, increasing his balance to a staggering $23m!\n\"Wow!\" He muttered in shock.\nHe took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, trying to calm down his emotions. He succeeded and he turned his attention to the second reward.\n\"0.02% of JP Morgan? Is that a lot or too much?\" He asked with an incredulous look.\nHe immediately went on the internet to check the current stock price of JP Morgan and its market cap.\n\"Stock price is $289 and its market cap is $801b.\"\nUsing the data he got, he did his calculations and he found out how much his 0.02% shares is worth.\n$160m!!!\n\"Wait a minute. Is this for real?\" He asked himself, as he did the calculation again to confirm but he still got the same result.\nWanting to confirm for the final time, he inputed the data into a AI chatbot but he got the same result.\n$160m...\nThis was a huge amount even for Liam. As far as he remember, the most valuable asset he has is the mansion with its value of more than $70m.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs\nBut he now has something with more than double its value.\n\"The system really wasn't joking by its name and when it said that it intends to make me the wealthiest person in the world,\" Liam smiled to himself.\nHe really didn't expect to receive such a reward during his daily sign-in. Now, be couldn't help but be curious about his second weekly sign-in rewards and his first monthly sign-in rewards.\n\"Life's good,\" Liam smiled from ear to ear.\nWith the shares, he now has another source of passive income.\nHe was still thinking of the amount he would receive in the future as dividend, when his phone started ringing. He took a look at it and he saw that it was an unknown number.\nStrange... Who could it be? Is it one of Stacy's friends?\nHe hasn't saved their contacts so he has no idea if they were the one. He thought about who could be calling but when he couldn't guess who it was, he picked up the call.\nA/N: Hi guys! Sorry that I haven't been able to upload two Chapters for days now.

      "content": "Chapter 31 - Sorting Things Out\n\"Hello,\" Liam said, as he picked the call.\n\"Hello, Mr Liam. This is Marianne from JP Morgan Investors Relations,\" a female voice from the other end of the phone said, introducing herself.\n\"Ohhh.\" Liam was a bit surprised as he didn't expect someone from JP Morgan to call him almost immediately or even at all.\nBut he felt that it was only natural since he now has a percentage stake of the company, which is worth more than $100m.\n\"What do I owe this call?\" Liam asked.\n\"I'm calling to congratulate and thank you for investing in the company. Would you be open to discussing your investment goals and how we can assist with infrastructure or services?\" Marianne asked.\nHmmm... Infrastructure and services...\nLiam thought about what she said. He was quite curious about these two.\n\"Tell me more about the infrastructure and services,\" Liam said, his tone composed but curious.\n\"Of course,\" Marianne replied warmly. \"As a significant shareholder, Mr. Liam, you now have access to our Private Banking Division, which offers a comprehensive suite of wealth infrastructure and concierge services. These include—but are not limited to—private wealth management, real estate sourcing, ultra-secure estate management, luxury asset procurement, custom insurance packages, personal staff sourcing, security detail acquisition, and lifestyle concierge options tailored to ultra-high-net-worth individuals.\"\nLiam raised his brow slightly at the mention of staff sourcing and estate management. That sounded like exactly what he needed right now.\n\"As part of the infrastructure,\" Marianne continued, \"our private clients are assigned a dedicated banker and advisory team. You'll also receive assistance with legal and tax structuring, family office solutions, art and collectible advisory, and global mobility support.\"\n\"Wait,\" Liam interrupted gently. \"Did you say staff sourcing and security detail acquisition?\"\n\"Yes,\" she said, not missing a beat. \"We maintain partnerships with premier service firms across the globe. Whether you need a full household staff—maids, butlers, chefs, assistants—or a tailored executive protection unit, we handle everything discreetly and efficiently.\"\nThat was all Liam needed to hear.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nHe didn't even hesitate. \"Alright. Let's proceed with the conversion. I'd like to become a private client.\"\n\"Wonderful. Thank you, Mr. Liam. I'll process the request immediately,\" she said, her voice carrying a genuine tone of respect. \"A private client banker will be assigned to you and should be reaching out very soon to begin the onboarding. They'll also be available for any immediate support you require.\"\n\"Appreciate the quick response,\" Liam said. \"This is actually very helpful.\"\n\"The pleasure is ours, Mr. Liam. And thank you again for choosing JP Morgan.\"\nThe call ended with polite goodbyes. Liam sat there for a second, phone still in hand, smiling.\nFinally.\nHe'd been meaning to sort out the staffing for the mansion, but now he could do so with the backing of one of the most reputable institutions in the world. He wouldn't need to use those risky online applications or sketchy middlemen but have real professionals handling everything top to bottom.\nThe maid issue would be resolved soon. That alone took a weight off his shoulders.\nHe stood up and stretched, still grinning faintly, and walked toward the bathroom to prepare for the day.\n***\nFifteen minutes later, he stepped out of the bathroom, towel still hanging around his neck, when he heard his phone buzzing on the nightstand.\nHe walked over, picked it up, and saw an unfamiliar number.\nAnother unknown number? Could be the banker,\nhe thought.\n\"Hello,\" he answered, voice even.\n\"Good morning, Mr. Liam. This is Daniel Conley from JP Morgan Private Banking. I've just been assigned to your account.\"\nLiam nodded, even though the man couldn't see him. \"That was fast.\"\n\"Efficiency is a point of pride for us,\" Daniel replied, his voice smooth and professional. \"Would you prefer to speak over the phone, or should I arrange a visit to your location?\"\n\"In person. Come to my place—Bellemere Mansion in Holmby Hills.\"\nThere was a moment of silence.\nThen Daniel said, \"Understood. I'll be there shortly.\"\n\"I'll be expecting you.\"\nLiam ended the call and tossed his phone gently on the bed. There was no sense waiting around in his room. He dried off, got dressed in a relaxed but sharp outfit—charcoal slacks and a white Cuban-collar shirt—and made his way downstairs.\nHe figured he had a little time, so he made a quick breakfast. Nothing too complex. A couple of sunny-side-up eggs, toasted sourdough, and sliced avocado with sea salt and olive oil drizzle.\nJust as he was finishing the last bite, the gentle chime of the gate intercom echoed from the kitchen panel.\nLiam turned and walked to the small touchscreen beside the refrigerator. On the screen was the image of a middle-aged man in a fitted navy suit, standing next to a sleek black BMW parked just outside the gate.\n\"This is Daniel Conley,\" the voice came through. \"Private Banker.\"\nLiam tapped the screen and pressed the gate button and the massive iron gate began to part.\nHe watched the vehicle glide down the driveway, come to a gentle stop, and Daniel stepped out. The man adjusted his tie slightly, then walked up the front steps and rang the doorbell.\nLiam opened the door a few seconds later.\nDaniel looked composed, with a calm expression and the confident posture of someone who spent decades around wealth.\nBut even he blinked in surprise for a fraction of a second when he saw Liam.\nThe boy in front of him looked no older than twenty.\n\"You're Liam?\" Daniel asked, recovering quickly.\n\"I am,\" Liam said, extending a hand. He noticed some resemblance between Daniel and one of Stacy's friends, Harper.\nFather or brother?\nDaniel grasped it firmly. \"Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Liam.\"\n\"Come in,\" Liam said, stepping aside.\nDaniel entered and looked around as subtly as possible.\nThey walked to the living room and took their seats.\n\"I'll be brief,\" Daniel said, pulling out a sleek leather folio from his bag. \"As a shareholder of your standing, you now qualify for Priority Tier access within our private bank. This includes a dedicated support team and exclusive access to bespoke services.\"\n\"I heard that earlier,\" Liam said. \"But I'm mainly interested in staff sourcing and security. The house is... well, big. And I can't manage it alone.\"\n\"Understood,\" Daniel said with a nod. \"We can arrange an estate manager to oversee the household. We'll begin by assigning a vetted team of maids and personal assistants. You can review their profiles and conduct interviews if you'd like, or trust our recommendations entirely. For security, we offer private patrol units, on-site close protection, and remote surveillance support.\"\n\"Perfect. Let's start with that.\"\nDaniel scribbled a few notes on a tablet. \"I'll begin sourcing profiles and submit the first recommendations to you before the end of the day. Once you make your selections, we'll arrange contracts and background verification. You'll also receive access to our Client Portal app to track staff performance, billing, and requests.\"\n\"Anything else I should know?\" Liam asked.\n\"You'll be contacted soon by a relationship manager to discuss trust structures and asset consolidation. If you're open to it, we can begin forming a private holding company for your new assets to simplify management.\"\n\"I'll consider it,\" Liam replied. \"Let's focus on the staff first.\"\n\"Of course.\"\nThey continued chatting a few more minutes, confirming preferences, timelines, and scope. When it was done, Daniel stood, shook Liam's hand again, and said, \"You'll hear from me before sunset.\"\n\"Looking forward to it.\"\nLiam watched from the window as Daniel got into his BMW and drove off. He exhaled a long breath and sat back down, staring at the ceiling for a moment and thinking about what had just happened this morning.\nExactly as they say; money makes the world go round.",

      "content": "Chapter 32 - Sorting Things Out (2)\nAfter Daniel left, Liam leaned against the kitchen counter, thinking of what to do next.\nThe mansion was quiet again, the kind of silence that could feel both freeing and isolating, depending on his mood. Today, it was the latter.\nHe didn't want to stay cooped up all day again—especially not after the productive morning—but he also had no idea where to go. The usual activities didn't excite him, and the idea of walking into some luxury lounge or event just to make small talk didn't sit well with him.\nWhat is fun? What do normal people or the rich do for fun? Should I take a vacation to the Carribeans or Maldives? Sigh... Or maybe travel to Japan and watch that anime in the cinema? Sigh...\nAs he lingered in thought, his mind circled back to something Daniel mentioned earlier: setting up a private holding company for asset management. The idea had sounded abstract at the time, but now, it felt more tangible.\nHe hadn't wanted to go down the company route at first. It sounded like work. Like responsibility. But the more he thought about it, the more it made sense. He didn't need to run it himself. That's what staff were for. If he could have someone manage everything—properties, shares, trusts, all of it—then the burden wouldn't be on him. Just the oversight.\n\"I'll talk to Daniel about it again when he sends the staff list,\" he murmured, pushing off the counter.\nHe walked to the living room and dropped onto the couch, eyes trailing along the ceiling. His thoughts drifted to the system—specifically, the mysterious criteria for leveling up.\n\"I wonder what sort of rewards I'm going to receive tomorrow? And when I'll meet the criteria to level up...\" he muttered to himself.\nThe fact that the system hadn't defined the requirement gnawed at him. Everything else was so precise—why leave that part ambiguous?\nBut maybe that was the point.\nHe knew what the system was capable of even now, at just level 1. He had world-class skills, tens of millions in cash, a mansion, and now partial ownership in a global financial institution. And that was just the start.\nHe could only imagine what would happen when it levels up.\nWould it let him boost his stats manually? Access some kind of enhancements? Would he get new system functions? A shop? A skill library?\nThe thoughts bounced around wildly in his head.\nYou know what? Let's ask.\n\"System, have I met the level-up criteria?\"\nA familiar blue panel appeared in his vision.\n[Host should be able to meet the criteria after tomorrow's daily sign-in.]\n\"Oh?\" Liam blinked. \"Really?\"\n[Yes, Host.]\nHe leaned forward, hope rising. \"Can you tell me what function would be unlocked after the level-up?\"\nSilence. No response.\nOf course.\nLiam rolled his eyes with a sigh. \"Figures.\"\nStill, the confirmation was enough to make him smile. At least he had something to look forward to.\n***\nThe day moved slowly after that. Liam ended up staying home after all. He went through a couple of movies, then spent a few hours on the PS5, losing himself in a fast-paced RPG that kept his hands busy but his mind slightly distracted.\nHe cooked himself dinner—nothing fancy this time, just pasta with shrimp in a light garlic cream sauce. The system's cooking skill made even simple dishes taste like they belonged in a five-star restaurant.\nAs he finished cleaning up the dishes, his phone buzzed on the counter. He glanced at it and saw an email notification from Daniel Conley.\nHe wiped his hands quickly and opened the message.\nSubject: STAFFING RECOMMENDATION REPORT – BELLEMERE ESTATE\nLiam scrolled through the contents and saw the organized list of candidates: three maids, one personal assistant, and a five-man private security team—all carefully selected, background-checked, and vetted through JP Morgan's private partnerships.\nThe profiles were detailed. Experience. Training. Discretion history. All top-tier.\nLiam trusted JP Morgan's standards, and honestly, he didn't have the patience to interview each one himself.\nHe clicked \"Reply\" and typed a short message.\n\"Everything looks good. Please proceed with onboarding.\"\nHe hit send and took a sip of water.\nAlmost instantly, a reply came in.\n\"Thank you, Mr. Liam. We will finalize the arrangements. Staff will arrive tomorrow for orientation and residence setup.\nAlso, as requested earlier, I've scheduled a visit tomorrow morning to discuss the proposed trust structure and holding company options in greater detail if you're willing to go ahead with it.\"\n\"I am,\" Liam replied.\n\"I will be there first thing tomorrow.\"\nLiam smiled when he saw this. He placed the phone down and returned to his seat to finish his food. Knowing that the house staff and security would soon be in place gave him a rare feeling of relief. One of the few pressing needs on his mental checklist was finally being crossed off.\nAfter eating, he moved upstairs and showered, letting the warm water wash away the mental fog of the day.\nLater, as he got into bed, he wasn't in the mood to sleep. The city outside was quiet, and the bedroom—despite its luxury—still felt slightly too big for one person.\nHis phone buzzed again.\nA message popped into the group chat.\nKristie: \"Just remembered how good that food was. Liam, do you have a hidden Michelin star?\"\nMatt: \"I'm STILL thinking about that rice, bro.\"\nLana: \"We need to plan a full dinner party next time. Formal clothes, drinks, the whole thing.\"\nHarper: \"Also, I vote we kidnap Liam and make him our private chef. Thoughts?\"Thɪs updatᴇd by NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nLiam chuckled, then typed a casual reply.\n\"Glad you all enjoyed it. And Harper—good luck with that kidnapping plan.\"\nThe chat exploded.\nFor the next couple of hours, Liam found himself pulled into the chaos that was the \"Chaos Corner\" group chat.\nThe banter was light, the jokes endless. Someone dropped a funny video. Another posted a picture of their dog sleeping weirdly. Even Stacy chimed in with:\n\"Still can't believe we went to the same school...\"\nLiam responded with a smile emoji and a short message.\n\"I know. It's surprising.\"\nTheir messages sparked another round of discussion as everyone started asking Liam how Stacy was in school.\nEventually, the conversation slowed, and one by one, the others started dropping off.\nLiam stared at the last few messages, still grinning faintly. It felt... good. Simple. Light-hearted. It was moments like this he enjoy.\nHe finally put his phone aside, turned off the lights, and sank into the bed.\nTomorrow was going to be another big day—staff arrivals, trust discussions, and his next sign-in reward.\nBut for now, he need to sleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 33: New System Function Unlocked\nThe next morning, Liam woke up with his usual bright smile. The sunlight was just starting to seep through the thin gap in the curtains, washing the room in a faint golden glow.\nHe stretched lazily before sitting up against the headboard, his eyes still a little heavy from sleep.\n\"System, sign-in,\" he said casually, rubbing the back of his neck. He couldn’t hold in his excitement to see the system level up and unlock a new function.\nThe familiar blue panel materialized before his eyes.\n[Congratulations, Host. You received 0.02% shares of JP Morgan.]\n[You received a luxury super yacht: Mia]\n[You received a helicopter: Sikorsky S-92 Executive]\n[The documents on the yacht and aircraft are in the inventory. The yacht and the aircraft have been staffed. Their salaries is host’s responsibility. The yacht is parked at Marina del Rey and the aircraft is parked atop it.]\n[Host has met the system’s level up requirement]\n[Level up!]\n[New function unlocked!]\n[System Store function has been unlocked. Host can now purchase items with system points.]\n[Host can earn system points daily when he accumulates daily sign-in. Money can also be exchanged for system points; $10,000 for 1 SP.]\n[Note: To reward host for unlocking the system store, host will be given 1000 SP to purchase any item of his choice.]\n***\n\"Wait... what?!\" Liam blurted, blinking at the floating text.\nHe leaned forward, staring at the rewards again as if they might change if he looked closely enough. The yacht alone would have been enough to leave him stunned, but the helicopter? The second JP Morgan share reward? And the System Store unlocking on top of all that?\nIt was kind of too much to process in one go.\n\"Okay... breathe,\" he muttered, taking a deep inhale and slowly exhaling. \"One thing at a time.\"\nFirst on the list: the 0.02% JP Morgan shares. He grinned almost immediately. That brought his total to 0.04%—worth roughly $320 million based on the company’s current market cap. Not bad for what was essentially free.\nThen came the yacht. He pulled the documents from the inventory and his jaw dropped as he scanned them.\nMia wasn’t just a yacht—it was one of the largest and most luxurious ever built. Over 400 feet long, with multiple decks, a private cinema, two swimming pools, a spa, a small helipad, and enough cabins for more than a dozen guests and their personal staff. Price tag? Over $300 million.\nHe skimmed through the specs and laughed softly. \"This is basically a floating palace...\"\nNext was the Sikorsky S-92 Executive. A quick glance at the photos told him everything. The plush leather seating, the polished wood trim, the gold-accented fixtures—it looked exactly like the type of helicopter billionaires used in movies. The paperwork confirmed its value at over $20 million.\nLiam leaned back, letting the enormity of everything so far sink in. Less than two weeks ago, he had been sitting on a bank balance that barely scraped $20. Now? His net worth had exploded past $700 million, and he was now juggling assets he never thought he’d own in his lifetime.\nHe set the documents aside and muttered, \"The system wasn’t kidding when it said it would make me the wealthiest in the world...\"\nBefore he could get lost in his thoughts, his phone started ringing. The caller ID showed an unknown number.\n\"Probably related to the yacht or the chopper,\" he guessed, swiping to answer. \"Hello?\"\n\"Good morning, Mr. Liam,\" a polite male voice said. \"This is Captain Rodrick, head sailor of the Mia. I wanted to personally introduce myself and brief you on the yacht’s readiness.\"\n\"Go ahead,\" Liam replied, leaning back against the pillows.\nCaptain Rodrick gave a precise breakdown—the yacht’s current condition, its mooring at Marina del Rey, the size of the crew, their roles, and the onboard amenities.\nEverything was fully operational and stocked for basic use, but he recommended restocking provisions for any extended trip.\n\"Good,\" Liam said. \"I’ll wire you some money. Use it to get anything you need and fully stock the galley. I’ll be taking Mia out soon.\"\n\"Understood, sir. I’ll ensure everything is ready. Thank you.\"\nThe call ended, but before Liam could even set his phone down, it started ringing again—another unknown number.\n\"Hello?\" he answered.\n\"Mr. Liam, this is Captain Harris, senior flight captain for your Sikorsky S-92,\" the man said. \"Just checking if you have any immediate flight requests or instructions.\"\n\"Not for now,\" Liam said. \"But I’ll reach out when I need you.\"\n\"Of course, sir. I’m at your disposal anytime.\"\nWhen the call ended, Liam let out a long breath and smiled faintly. In the span of ten minutes, he had spoken to the heads of his own yacht and helicopter. That still felt surreal.\nHe had been planning to check out the new System Store function right away, but a chime from his phone interrupted his thoughts. It was a text from Daniel Conley.\nDaniel: \"On my way with the staff team for onboarding. We will be arriving in 45 minutes.\"\nLiam sighed and decided to push the System Store for later. Today was already shaping up to be a busy one.\nHe swung his legs out of bed and headed for the bathroom. \"Might as well get ready for a long day.\"\n***\nForty minutes later, Liam stepped out of the shower, steam curling around him. He dried off quickly, dressed in dark chinos and a fitted navy polo, and made his way downstairs.\nThe mansion was quiet—too quiet. But in just under an hour, it would no longer be.\nHe poured himself a glass of water in the kitchen, leaning against the counter as he thought about how rapidly his life was changing.\nYesterday, staffing the mansion had been a looming problem. Today, it was already being handled by a private banking team. Yesterday, he didn’t own a yacht or helicopter. Today, he did—and both came staffed.\nMoney really did make the world move at a different speed.\nThe sharp tone of the gate intercom pulled him from his thoughts. He tapped the small touchscreen on the wall, and the camera feed showed Daniel standing beside a black SUV, three women in uniform behind him, and a second SUV behind the first—likely the security team.\n\"Morning, Mr. Liam,\" Daniel’s voice came through.\n\"Morning,\" Liam replied, pressing the gate control. The massive iron gates swung open smoothly.\nWithin minutes, the two SUVs rolled to a stop in the driveway. The security team stepped out first—five men, dressed in discreet black tactical suits, each moving with the calmness of professionals who’d been in high-risk environments before.\nThen came the maids—three women in matching tailored maid uniforms, each carrying small luggage. They looked polished, professional, and composed.\nFinally, Daniel stepped forward, smiling. \"Everything we discussed is ready for your review.\"\nThey walked inside, and Daniel began making introductions.\nThe maids each gave a short bow and introduced themselves: Evelyn, the head maid; Clara, specializing in kitchen assistance; and Mira, a housekeeper with a background in luxury estate management.\nThe security lead, Mason, stepped forward and gave a concise breakdown of their capabilities—close protection, surveillance, and perimeter control.\nLiam nodded. \"I trust Daniel’s recommendations. Let’s get everyone settled in.\"\nDaniel oversaw the initial placement—security taking positions around the property, maids beginning light organization of the household.\nAs they worked, Liam felt an unexpected wave of relief. The staffing had been taken care of.\nOnce everything was set, Daniel approached Liam with a slim folder. \"If you have time today, I’d like to go over the trust structure and holding company we mentioned. With your recent acquisitions, asset management is going to become increasingly complex.\"\n\"Tomorrow works,\" Liam said.\nDaniel nodded, shook his hand, and departed with a promise to follow up.\nWhen the SUVs pulled away, Liam walked back inside, hands in his pockets, a small smile on his face. He now has the time to check out the new system function.The source of thɪs content is ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\n\"Status.\"",

Fully silent operation with adaptive cloaking.\nBio-Genesis Capsule\nCost: 100 SP\nDescription: A portable regeneration and enhancement chamber. Accelerates biological healing by 5,000%, removes toxins, rebuilds damaged tissue, and can enhance muscle density, neural efficiency, and immune response up to peak genetic potential. Requires 24 hours to recharge after use.\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....]\n***\nLiam stared at the glowing list, blinking a few times.\n\"...Wow\"\nThe list was endless. It was like staring into a prop catalog from a big-budget sci-fi blockbuster—except these weren’t props. They were real. Or at least, they could be real the moment he bought them.\nThe Omni-Science Foundation Package was a no-brainer in terms of value. With it, he could create, design, or reverse-engineer anything—literally anything—from starship drives to molecular nanofactories.\nThat alone could turn him into the most dangerous inventor on the planet. But it also came with a problem: if he suddenly started producing ultra-advanced tech out of nowhere, people would notice.\nLet’s not think about that\nnow.\nThe Quantum Contact Lenses caught his eye next. A completely discreet way to gain superhuman perception and intelligence-gathering ability without anyone even realizing it. They’d be invisible to the outside world—he could wear them every day.\nThe Sophron... that was a monster. He could see everything, anywhere, at any time, and transmit data instantly. That was the kind of tech that could destroy nations if used without restraint.\nThe Quantum Chrono-Band felt like something straight out of a spy thriller. The idea of being able to slow down time for himself—dodging attacks, making instant calculations, moving before anyone else could react—was insane.\nThen there was the Lightcycle V9. The little boy inside him screamed to buy it immediately. Mach 10 speed in atmosphere? Cloaking? The ability to literally fold it into a suitcase? That goes beyond just transportation\nAnd finally, the Bio-Genesis Capsule. He thought of it as the ultimate health insurance—instant healing and physical enhancement. 100 SP for that felt like a bargain.\nLiam sat back, rubbing his temples.\n\"This is... ridiculous.\"\nThe first problem was obvious: cost. The cheapest items cost 100 SP—that was $1 million in real-world money if he bought the points outright. The most expensive was a flat 10,000 SP—$100 million at the system’s exchange rate.\nSure, he could technically buy two of the cheapest items right now. But that would wipe out a large portion of his liquid cash. He only has $23 million in his account.\nThe second problem was exposure. Some of these items, if used openly, would send the entire world into a frenzy. Governments, corporations, militaries—they’d all want a piece of him. Some would try to recruit him, others would try to capture him, and a few might just try to make him disappear.\nNo. The smart move would be to keep these things quiet. Use them in ways that couldn’t be traced back to him. Or, if questioned, lean into the mystery people already believed about his background. Let them fill in the blanks with whatever story suited them.\nLiam exhaled slowly, closing the store panel. \"Calm down,\" he muttered to himself. \"Don’t overthink. One step at a time.\"\nI shouldn’t be so paranoid and start creating problems in my head when there are none.\nHe had 1,000 SP now. If he spent them recklessly, he might regret it later. But sitting on all of them felt wasteful.\n\"Now... what to do...\"\nHe drummed his fingers on the armrest of the couch. The Bio-Genesis Capsule was tempting—cheap, useful, and something he could hide in a locked room. The Quantum Contact Lenses were also calling to him. That was a kind of power he could use every day without suspicion.\nSystem\n, he said suddenly.\nAre store items permanent inventory? As in, if I buy something now but don’t take it out, it just stays in the inventory?\nSince he was in the living room, he couldn’t just talk out loud. It would seem strange and his newly hired staffs would look at him strangely.\n[Correct, Host. Purchased items will remain in Inventory until retrieved.]\nWhat about the knowledge package? Is there anything I need to know before purchasing it?\n[Due to how vast the content of the knowledge is, you will need to enhance yourself—your brain in particular—before you can assimilate the knowledge.]\nEnhancement?\nLiam curiously opened the system store again and used the search function to search for enhancement.\nHe has no idea if it would work but the next moment, a list of different types of enhancement was displayed in front of him.\nReflex Acceleration Nanites\nCost: 100 SP\nDescription: A swarm of nanites that integrate into the nervous system, sharpening reflexes and muscle response speed by 250%. Effects are permanent once integrated.\nNeural Link Interface (NLI)\nCost: 150 SP\nDescription: A subdermal neural implant that allows direct mental control over compatible electronics, vehicles, drones, and certain weapons. Comes with an encrypted firewall to prevent hacking.\nAdaptive Combat Exosuit\nCost: 250 SP\nDescription: Lightweight exoskeleton suit made from meta-composite alloys. Increases strength and agility by 200%, integrates ballistic protection, and features reactive plating that hardens instantly upon impact.\nBio-Sentinel Nanites\nCost: 300 SP\nDescription: Microscopic machines that patrol the bloodstream, eliminating viruses, bacteria, toxins, and even cancerous cells within seconds. Also accelerates wound healing by 5×.\n....\n....\n....\n....\nGenetic Serum\nCost: 500 SP\nDescription: Rewrites and optimizes a person’s DNA blueprint, enhancing natural traits like strength, speed, intelligence, and disease resistance within the limits of biology.\nMolecular Enhancement Nannites\nCost: 1,000 SP\nDescription: Reconstructs the body’s molecular structures and atomic bonds, granting durability, efficiency, and abilities far beyond natural biology, potentially integrating non-organic materials for more capabilities.\n***\nSo many options\nLiam had thought that he would only see a few options at least but he was wrong. The list was nearly endless but there were two that caught his attention.\nSystem, between the Genetic Serum and Molecular Enhancement Nannites, which option should I go with?\n[To achieve best result, going with the second would be better.]\nHmmm... I see...\nLiam sighed as he thought about it.\nActually, there was nothing to think about. The best option would be to buy MEN and exchange money for more system points, and buy the knowledge package.\nFor the next several minutes, Liam sat there, running different scenarios through his head. What would be the safest path? What would give him the biggest advantage?\nEventually, he leaned back and let out a long sigh.\nAlright. Not rush. I will take things slow and decide before night.",

      "content": "Chapter 35: Caught In A Dilemma\nLiam lay back into the sofa, his gaze drifting up toward the high ceiling as his thoughts tangled into a dense knot.\nThe interface of the System Store still floated in his mind, each glowing item and its jaw-dropping description replaying like a slideshow he couldn’t turn off.\nThe future...\nIt suddenly felt closer than ever, like he could reach out and grab it. With the things in that store, he could practically rewrite the rules of the world.\nHe could build technologies centuries ahead of anything in existence, improve himself beyond natural limits, and even create defenses so impenetrable that no one could touch him.\nBut the obstacles? Those loomed just as large.\nThe more he thought about it, the clearer they became: the suspicion that would follow if he used something too obvious; the questions from governments and corporations; the massive cost of each item; and the simple fact that his current assets—while impressive—would not last forever if he started spending recklessly.\nHe rubbed his forehead, exhaling a slow, heavy breath. The excitement that had been bubbling earlier was now tempered by the sharp edge of reality.\nThe cost alone made him pause. Even the cheaper items in the store were the kind of purchases that would raise eyebrows if they were translated into real-world money.\nIf he bought points to get them, the spending would have to be explained somehow. And the more valuable the item, the more people would notice if its effects were visible.\nThis was no longer just about \"what can I buy?\" but \"how do I sustain this long-term without burning everything too fast?\"\nAnd that’s when it hit him.\nThe trust.\nHe had been on the fence about Daniel’s earlier suggestion. Setting up a trust felt... official. Heavy. Like planting his flag in a world he hadn’t fully decided to claim yet.\nBut now? With the system store open, the need for structured asset management wasn’t just a good idea—it was critical.\nIf he could build a trust and a holding company around it, he could move money more discreetly, protect his assets, and use the corporate structures as both a shield and a tool.\nHe could turn wealth into something fluid—something that could flow between projects without attracting too much attention.\nHe reached for his phone almost without thinking, scrolling through to Daniel’s number.\nAs he pressed \"call,\" he half expected Daniel to be tied up in meetings or unavailable for the rest of the day. Private bankers always sounded busy in movies—jetting from one client to another, managing billions.\nBut to his mild surprise, Daniel picked up almost immediately.\n\"Mr. Liam,\" Daniel’s voice came through, calm and professional as ever.\n\"Daniel,\" Liam greeted. \"Hope I’m not catching you at a bad time.\"\n\"Not at all. You can call me anytime.\"\n\"Anytime?\" Liam asked, a little skeptical.\n\"Of course,\" Daniel replied without hesitation. \"I’ve been permanently assigned to you. Think of me as your direct point of contact for anything you need—financial or otherwise.\"\nLiam paused for a beat, letting that sink in. Permanently assigned. He could literally just call and have things set in motion.\n\"In that case,\" Liam said, \"I want to go ahead with creating the trust we talked about earlier. And I’d like you to come over so we can discuss the details properly.\"\nThere was the faintest sound of pages turning on Daniel’s end. \"Understood. I can be there within the hour.\"\n\"Good. I’ll be waiting.\"\nWhen the call ended, Liam set the phone down on the coffee table and glanced out the massive windows.\nAfternoon sunlight was spilling across the manicured lawns outside, the kind of serene view that might lull someone into a nap. But Liam wasn’t in the mood for rest.\nHe called for Evelyn and asked her to make him a glass of orange juice. While he waited, he went over some ideas in his head while he waited.\nThe trust wouldn’t just be a legal entity—it would be the foundation stone for everything else. It would allow him to protect his holdings, to make certain purchases invisible, and even to employ staff under its name instead of his own.\nThough there’s a misunderstanding around Liam’s identity and background, he has no idea how long that would hold. But he has to start building a name for himself before things goes awry.\n***\nExactly forty-seven minutes later, the gentle buzz of the gate intercom pulled him from his thoughts, and Mira answered the door.\n\"I appreciate you making the time,\" Liam said, leading him toward the study.\n\"Always,\" Daniel replied smoothly. \"Especially for something as important as this.\"\nThey sat across from each other, and Daniel placed the briefcase on the table, flipping it open to reveal neatly organized documents and a sleek tablet.\n\"All right,\" Daniel began, \"we’ll structure this as a discretionary trust. You’ll be both the grantor and the primary beneficiary, but the trust will own all key assets. The trustee will be an entity we control on your behalf, which keeps you insulated from direct exposure.\"\nLiam nodded. \"And the holding company?\"\n\"That will operate under the trust. It will own your properties, your vehicles, your investments—anything you want shielded. This means transactions can be handled at the company level, keeping your personal name out of it.\"\nDaniel’s tone was steady, professional, but Liam could tell he was making an effort to keep it simple. He appreciated that.\n\"What about confidentiality?\" Liam asked.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\n\"Absolute,\" Daniel said. \"We’ll use jurisdictions with strict privacy laws for registration. Any public records will show nothing beyond the company’s name and a corporate service address. Even if someone tries to dig, all they’ll see are layers of protection.\"\nThey went back and forth for nearly two hours. Daniel explained the benefits of asset segregation, the tax advantages, and even the ability to create sub-companies for specific ventures. Liam asked questions about operational control, reporting, and the process for moving assets into the structure without drawing attention.\nBy the time they wrapped up, the sun outside had begun to sink, casting warm golden light into the room.\nDaniel closed the briefcase and stood. \"I’ll begin drafting the necessary documents tonight. We should be ready to move within the week.\"\nLiam nodded. \"Appreciate the speed.\"\nWhen Liam offered dinner, Daniel smiled politely and declined. \"Tempting, but I should get started while the day’s still fresh in my mind.\"\nLiam saw him out, the dark sedan gliding away down the driveway. He sighed and walked back into the house to eat dinner.\nAfter dinner, he went up to his room, retiring for the night.\nHe changed into a loose t-shirt and lounge pants, then sat on the edge of his bed with his phone in hand.\nFor a few seconds, he just sat there, the decision looming in front of him like a doorway. He’d told himself he would wait until later to decide—and now it was night.\nTaking a slow breath, he willed the System Store interface to appear.\nThe sleek black-and-blue menu materialized instantly.\nHis thoughts lingered on the Molecular Enhancement Nannites. It was the most expensive thing he could buy right now with his starting points.\nIf he got it, he’d be physically and mentally transformed, able to handle almost anything the world could throw at him afterward.\nBut if he combined it with the Omni-Science package... The thought alone made him sit a little straighter. The problem was, that would mean dipping heavily into his real-world funds to buy more points. It was possible, yes. But was it the right move now?\nHis thumb hovered over the Purchase button.\nFor a moment, the temptation was overwhelming. He could do it. Right now. Change everything.\nAnd then he pulled his hand back.\nNot yet.\nHe closed the interface with a quiet sigh and leaned back into the pillows, staring at the ceiling.\n\"I’ll think more on it and decide what I actually want to do with the knowledge first before purchasing it,\" he murmured to himself.\nA/N: I made a mistake in the last Chapter. The exchange rate for irl money to SP is $10,000 to 1 SP. Not $100,000. I’m sorry if it caused any inconveniences for those that had already read the Chapter. Thanks for reading!!!",

      "content": "Chapter 36: Making A Decision\nLiam woke up the next morning with heavy eyes, the kind of weight that made his lids feel like they’d been glued shut. His head sank deeper into the silk pillow, but there was no comfort to be found. Sleep had been a stranger last night.\nHe wasn’t tossing and turning because of nightmares or stress in the traditional sense. No, this was something new—something strange. His mind had been buzzing with the interface of the System Store, the endless list of impossible items flashing before him like temptations in a forbidden catalog.\nEvery time he thought he was done, every time he told himself, Enough, I’ll decide tomorrow, he would open his eyes in the dark and see them again.\nBy the time he finally drifted off, it was well past three in the morning.\nNow, as he lay on the massive king-sized bed in the master suite of Bellemere Mansion, he stared at the high, crown-molded ceiling, his thoughts heavy and tangled.\nThis was the first time since getting the system that he had been this deep in thought—and it wasn’t about how to survive.\nBefore, back in the days before all this, when life had been nothing but a string of cheap meals, overdue rent, and constant anxiety, his late-night thoughts had been consumed by the same cruel loop: Where am I getting my next meal? How will I cover rent? Will I even make it through next week? How will I make it to Friday?\nThat was then.\nNow? His sleeplessness came from abundance. From the sheer scale of possibilities in front of him. From trying to figure out what to do with a store that offered the kind of technology and power entire nations would go to war over.\nIt was like suffering from success.\nHe let out a slow sigh, the sound echoing faintly in the silence of the oversized bedroom.\nThe real question wasn’t just What should I buy?—it was What do I actually want to do with these items?\nHe knew one thing for certain: the items weren’t cheap. The System’s exchange rate was brutal—$10,000 for just a single point. Some of the items in there cost hundreds or thousands of SP. Even with his growing net worth, these weren’t purchases to make lightly.\nYes, he could pick a few for personal use. That would be fine. A stealth upgrade here, a health booster there—things that made sense without drawing attention. But the truth was, even if he bought the most expensive one he could afford right now, there would always be more items that are more tempting, more powerful, more dangerous.\nAnd then there was that voice at the back of his mind.\nThe one that whispered,\nTake everything you want. Don’t choose. Don’t limit yourself. Do as you see fit. This is yours now. You earned it.\nIt was intoxicating.\nThey say money and power corrupt people. Liam knew that. He wasn’t naïve enough to think he was immune. He knew he wasn’t some saint who would always do the \"right thing.\"\nA line from an anime floated into his mind—one he’d watched years ago, in the dead of night, eating instant noodles and trying to ignore the hunger in his stomach for everything else in life:\n\"I finally know. It’s because I’m an idiot. A garden-variety idiot who got his hands on power.\"\nThat character had been self-aware enough to admit it. And Liam... wasn’t an idiot. But he also wasn’t a particularly good person.\nWith great power comes great responsibility. That old saying rattled in his head like an annoying bell. Liam knew it was true, but responsibility had never been his strong suit.\nAll he had ever wanted, for as long as he could remember, was to escape the hellish cycle of his life. To stop living from hand to mouth. To never again feel the gnawing panic of an empty wallet or an empty stomach.\nAnd the system... the system had done that. It had obliterated that version of his life in a matter of days.\nBut deep down, he was starting to realize something.\nNothing was free.\nMaybe there wasn’t an obvious \"price\" for the system’s gifts—not yet—but there was always a cost. It might come in the form of attention, enemies, or consequences he couldn’t see yet. But it would come.\nAnd now, lying here in the most luxurious bed he’d ever slept in, Liam realized something else. He’d been playing it safe. Too safe. He’d been treating the System like a streak of good luck instead of the game-changing force it really was.\nHe could go on like this—buying the occasional useful skill, upgrading his lifestyle bit by bit—or he could take a risk. A big one. And start building.\nThe items in that store weren’t just cool gadgets and impossible tech. They were building blocks. The foundations for something greater. The kind of things empires were made of.\n\"I need to build an actual identity,\" Liam murmured to himself, his voice low but steady. \"Give it substance. Make it undeniable.\"\nYes, there was a certain thrill in being \"the mysterious buyer\" or \"the young guy with an absurd mansion,\" but that was smoke and mirrors. That was other people’s perception. He wanted more than that.\nHe wanted an empire.\nAnd no, he didn’t want to start a company in the traditional sense—not one he had to run day to day. But a holding structure? Assets under his name—or rather, under the trust he was setting up with Daniel? That he could work with.\nHe couldn’t depend on the system forever. Not entirely. It was too dangerous to have all his eggs in that one basket, no matter how godlike it seemed now.\nHe needed real-world leverage to match the system’s leverage. And he was going to use the items in the store to get it.\nThe thought made something stir inside him—like a switch being flipped.\nLiam closed his eyes and took a slow, deliberate breath. Then he opened them again, a sharp smile tugging at the corner of his lips.\n\"Fuck it,\" he said aloud, his voice echoing faintly in the high-ceilinged room. \"I’ll just do as I see fit.\"\nThe hesitation, the second-guessing—that was over. It was time to take action. Time to take risks. Time to stop thinking like the boy who used to ration instant noodles and start thinking like the man who could call up a private banker and have an entire staff installed in his home in less than 24 hours.\nHe swung his legs over the side of the bed, feeling the soft carpet under his feet. There was a strange lightness in his chest now. The weight of indecision had lifted.\n\"I’ll make something out of myself,\" he murmured. \"Build my own empire. And I’ll do it with the items in the store.\"\nFor the first time in days, his mind felt clear.\nTo celebrate, he decided to start the morning with his daily sign-in.\n\"System,\" he said, his voice firm. \"Sign in.\"Googlᴇ search",

      "content": "Chapter 37: Molecular Enhancement Nannites\n[Congratulations, Host. You received 0.02% shares of JP Morgan.]\n[You received 5 stat points]\n***\nLiam’s eyes flickered open at the sound of the system’s familiar chime, and the text appeared before him in neat, glowing blue. He stared for a moment, letting the words sink in before a slow smile spread across his face.\n\"More of JP Morgan shares?\" he muttered under his breath, voice still hoarse from sleep. \"What are you trying to do, System... slowly buy me a seat on the board?\"\nIt was almost suspicious now. This was the third time in a row he had received the same percentage of JP Morgan’s shares. Once might have been a coincidence, twice could have been luck — but three times? That was a pattern. And the implications...\nHis mind raced. At the bank’s current market cap, this new 0.02% meant another $320 million to his name. That brought his total stake to 0.06% — worth nearly $1 billion just in JP Morgan equity alone. Add in his other assets — Bellemere Mansion, the fleet of luxury cars, the yacht Mia, the Sikorsky helicopter — and his total net worth had officially crossed the billionaire threshold.\nHe was eighteen.\nThe number made him pause. For years, the idea of having a thousand dollars in savings had felt like a fantasy. Now, he could casually drop millions and still be richer than almost anyone he’d ever met.\nThen his attention shifted to the second reward: 5 Attribute Points.\nThat, to him, was just as valuable. Attribute points meant direct, tangible improvement to his body and mind — and with his upcoming Molecular Enhancement Nanites purchase, those points could push him far beyond the human limit.\nYes, he’d made up his mind last night. He was going through with it. He’d use the nanites, then immediately follow up with the Omni-Science Foundation Package.\nHe got out of bed, took a hot shower, and dressed in comfortable clothes. When he came downstairs, the scent of sizzling eggs and freshly baked bread drifted in from the kitchen. The maids were already at work.\n\"Good morning, Mr. Liam,\" Evelyn greeted with a polite bow.\n\"Morning,\" he replied with a faint smile.\nBreakfast would take a few more minutes, so while he waited, Liam pulled out his phone and quickly handled something he’d promised yesterday — the payments to his yacht’s chief sailor and his helicopter’s flight captain. $500,000 each, wired instantly. A gesture of goodwill, but also a message: Work for me, and you’ll be taken care of.\nHe considered taking the helicopter out today, maybe even flying to Mia and taking her out for a cruise. But after a moment, he shook his head. No. That could wait until tomorrow — after the enhancement.\nHe wanted to go through the process today, give himself a full day to adapt to the changes, then enjoy the yacht trip as a new man.\n***\nBreakfast was light but satisfying — scrambled eggs with chives, smoked salmon on rye toast, fresh orange juice.\nWhen he finished, Liam pushed his plate aside, thanked Evelyn, and went upstairs. His expression had shifted into one of quiet focus.\nHe locked the bedroom door.\n\"System,\" he said calmly. \"Exchange $10 million for 1,000 SP.\"\n[Transaction complete.]\n[-$10,000,000 USD]\nA faint ache hit his chest as he saw his bank balance drop, but the feeling passed quickly. Money was a tool. This purchase wasn’t an expense — it was an investment.\nThe System Store interface appeared with a thought. He navigated to the Enhancements category, his finger hovering over the item he’d been eyeing since yesterday.\n[Molecular Enhancement Nanites – Cost: 1,000 SP]\nBefore he bought it, he asked,\nSystem, anything I need to know before I take this?\n[Host will need a bathtub of cold water. Expect extreme pain — bone shearing, nerve burning. The process will take 24 hours to complete.]\nLiam’s eyes narrowed slightly. That bad?\n[Pain will be beyond anything the Host has experienced. Prepare accordingly.]\n\"Noted,\" he muttered.\nHe went to the en suite bathroom and turned on the cold tap, letting water thunder into the massive marble tub. While it filled, he stepped back into the bedroom and pressed the intercom button.\n\"Evelyn,\" he said, voice steady. \"I’ll be in my room all day. I don’t want to be disturbed by anyone until I come out. Understood?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Liam,\" her voice came through immediately.\nWhen he returned, the tub was almost full, icy tendrils of steam curling from its surface. He shut off the tap.\nThe water looked calm now. In less than a minute, it wouldn’t be.\nHe undressed, folded his clothes neatly on the counter, and stepped into the tub. The shock of the cold made his breath hitch for a moment, but he adjusted quickly, leaning back until the water reached his shoulders.\n\"System,\" he said. \"Purchase Molecular Enhancement Nanites.\"\n[Purchase complete. Item sent to Inventory.]\nHe retrieved it instantly.\nA small vial appeared in his hand, filled with a faintly luminous, transparent fluid. It looked harmless — almost like purified water.\n\"So... this little thing will change my life forever?\" he murmured.\nBefore he took it, he decided to distribute his attribute points, allocating 2 to Strength and Stamina, and 1 to Agility.\nAfter that, he pulled out the stopper of the vial. A faint, sweet scent rose from the liquid. He hesitated only a second before tipping it back.\nWarmth slid down his throat, smooth and almost pleasant. For a moment, he thought, This isn’t so bad.\nThen the pain began.\nIt started in his teeth — a deep, throbbing ache that shot down his jaw and into his neck.\nThen it spread.\nThe warmth turned molten, searing through his veins like liquid fire. Every nerve in his body lit up at once, as though a thousand red-hot wires had been pressed into his skin. His breath caught, then tore free in a ragged gasp.\n\"Ahhh—!\"\nHis hands clenched the sides of the tub hard enough that his knuckles went white. His back arched involuntarily. It felt like invisible hands were breaking him apart and rebuilding him simultaneously — every bone grinding, every muscle tearing and reforming.\nHe bit down so hard his jaw ached, but it didn’t stop the guttural sound that tore from his throat.\nMinutes passed — or maybe hours — in a haze of agony. Time lost all meaning. His vision flickered between sharp, painful clarity and a fog of white static.\nThrough it all, he could feel the nanites working — crawling through his bloodstream, burrowing into bone marrow, fusing with muscle fibers, latching onto neurons.\nHis heart pounded like a war drum. Sweat and cold water mixed on his skin, but the cold no longer registered. The heat inside him was too intense.\nSomewhere in the chaos, the system’s calm voice cut through:\n[Molecular restructuring at 14%... 29%... 47%...]\nEvery percentage felt like a victory — and a sentence.\nBy the time it hit 60%, Liam’s breathing had turned ragged. Every exhale was a hiss of effort.\nHe could feel everything — the microscopic strengthening of ligaments, the densification of bone, the expansion of lung capacity. His body was being rebuilt cell by cell, and he was awake for all of it.\n[72%... 85%...]\nHis vision sharpened. The faint imperfections in the marble around the tub looked like craters on the moon. He could hear the ticking of the bathroom clock as though it were right beside his ear.\n[94%... 99%...]Thɪs ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nThe final surge hit like an explosion. A deep, bone-vibrating hum roared through his body, then cut off so suddenly it left him gasping.\n[Enhancement complete.

      "content": "Chapter 38: Extraordinary Changes\nIt had been nearly the whole day since Liam had locked himself in his room and told Evelyn, the head maid, not to disturb him. The sun had already dipped toward the horizon, its warm glow fading into the cooler hues of dusk, and still, he hadn’t emerged.\nThe atmosphere in Bellemere Mansion was... tense.\nEvelyn stood in the hallway outside the kitchen, speaking quietly to Clara and Mira. Her usually calm expression had tightened just enough to betray the concern she felt.\n\"Dinner is ready,\" Clara murmured, glancing toward the grand staircase that led up to the private suites.\n\"He’s not come down all day,\" Mira added in a low voice. \"Not even for lunch.\"\nEvelyn pressed her lips together. \"I know. But he told me very clearly not to disturb him.\"\n\"But what if something happened?\" Mira asked, her tone dropping further. \"He could be ill... or—\"\nEvelyn gave a small shake of her head. \"Only a day has passed since we started working here. The last thing we should do is overstep. We don’t know how he runs his household yet.\"\nStill, the three women exchanged uneasy glances. The guards, too, seemed to be on edge — more than one had glanced up at the darkened windows of the master suite, as if expecting to see movement. But no one dared to go upstairs.\nFor now, all they could do was wait.\n***\nUpstairs, the mansion’s stillness was broken only by a low groan.\nLiam’s eyes fluttered open. For a few seconds, he simply lay there, staring up at the faintly lit ceiling. His entire body felt heavy, almost numb, as if he’d been asleep for days. Slowly, he turned his head — and realized he wasn’t in bed.\nThe cool marble walls around him, the faint echo of dripping water... he was in the bathroom.\nMemory came rushing back in a flood: the vial of Molecular Enhancement Nanites, the cold water, the unbearable pain, the way the system’s progress counter had crawled toward completion. The last thing he remembered was that final surge, and then... nothing.\nHe blinked, sitting up slightly in the tub. The water was still crystal clear, shimmering faintly under the soft bathroom lighting.\nThat’s strange...\nHe had half-expected to see some kind of murky residue, or at least some visible trace of whatever had been purged from his body. In old-world body cleansing treatments, the water was often left a sickly yellow or black, carrying with it whatever toxins had been expelled. But this—this was as pristine as when he had filled it.\nIf anything, it looked cleaner.\nHe exhaled slowly and braced his hands on the rim of the tub, intending to push himself up. The moment his palms pressed against the marble, however—\nCrack!\nHis eyes widened as his hands shot back instinctively. He looked down and saw a spiderweb of fine cracks spreading across the spot where he’d just been leaning.Thɪs ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\n\"...Did I do that?\" he muttered, voice tinged with disbelief.\nFor a moment, he just stared. It hadn’t even been a strong push — no more than the pressure he’d normally use to get up from a chair. Yet the marble had fractured under his touch.\nShaking his head, he forced himself to be more careful this time. He eased out of the tub, moving with deliberate control, almost afraid of breaking something else. The cool air prickled against his damp skin as he padded over to the shower.\nThe moment the hot water hit him, steam rising around his shoulders, a strange realization settled in: his sense of touch was sharper. The warmth felt richer, the flow of water over his skin more distinct. It was as though his nerves had been... upgraded.\nAfter he’d rinsed off and toweled dry, he stepped in front of the large mirror above the double sink.\nAnd froze.\nThe reflection staring back at him was... him, but not.\nHis hair, once a deep chestnut, was now a darker shade — almost black under the bathroom lighting — yet it had an unmistakable sheen, like each strand had been polished. It looked thicker, fuller, effortlessly falling into place without a single tangle.\nHis skin, too, had changed. The slight unevenness of tone was gone, replaced with a smoothness that looked almost unreal. There was a faint, healthy glow to it — not the unnatural pallor of artificial treatments, but the kind of radiance that came from perfect health.\nAnd his face... the subtle asymmetries that every human had seemed to have evened out. His jawline was sharper, more defined. His cheekbones seemed higher. It wasn’t that he’d been \"beautified\" in a generic sense — he was still recognizably Liam — but there was something magnetic about his features now. A balance of elegance and strength.\nThen his gaze drifted lower.\nHis chest and shoulders were broader, with well-defined muscle that looked sculpted, not bulked. His abs had taken clear shape — a perfectly symmetrical six-pack that didn’t look like the result of endless hours in the gym, but rather like it had always been there, hidden beneath a layer of imperfection the nanites had stripped away.\nHis arms and legs held the same proportion: lean muscle, dense and corded without a hint of excess. Even the tendons in his hands looked stronger, his veins subtly more visible under the skin.\nHe inhaled deeply without even thinking about it — and froze again.\nThe breath had felt... different. Easier. Fuller. As though his lungs could take in more air than before, as though each inhale was reaching deeper into his body.\nHe didn’t know how to explain it in words, but he felt alive in a way he never had before.\nFor a moment, he just stood there, letting it sink in.\nThe Molecular Enhancement Nanites had done more than change his body. They’d rebuilt it and perfected it.\nAnd the strangest part? He didn’t feel alien. He felt... like this had always been the body he was meant to have.\nHe smiled to himself in satisfaction. There was still a lot more changes in his body that he hasn’t looked into yet, but he decided to leave them for later.\nIt would be more fun to find them out later.\nHe dressed quickly — a simple black t-shirt and dark jeans — and stepped out of his room for the first time that day.\nBy the time he reached the grand staircase, he realized just how hungry he was. It wasn’t the light, casual hunger of a skipped lunch. It was deep, primal. The kind of hunger that gnawed at him from the inside, as though every cell in his body was demanding fuel.\nWhen he reached the dining room, Evelyn appeared almost immediately.\n\"Mr. Liam,\" she greeted with her usual composure, but he noticed the way her eyes lingered on him for a fraction of a second longer than normal.\n\"Evening,\" he said simply. \"Could you serve dinner?\"\n\"Of course,\" she replied, though there was the slightest pause in her voice.\nShe returned moments later with a plated dinner — a portion more than enough for a normal person. But the moment Liam saw it, he knew it wouldn’t be close to enough.\n\"Evelyn,\" he said before she could set it down. \"Make a lot more. Five full adult servings. As fast as you can.\"\nHer eyebrows rose just slightly. \"Five?\"\n\"At least,\" he confirmed. \"And make sure it’s ready quickly.\"\nShe was worried that he might not be able to finish the foof but there was that certainty in his tone that he would finish every bite.\nEvelyn inclined her head and left without another word, though he caught the faint surprise in her eyes.\nClara and Mira appeared to help, and he could feel their curious glances as they passed. It wasn’t just his request that had caught them off guard — it was him. The man sitting at the head of the table looked like the same Liam they had met yesterday... and yet somehow entirely different.\nThey didn’t know what had changed, but the difference was undeniable.\nLeft alone, Liam pulled the first plate toward him and began eating.\nHe didn’t savor the food. He didn’t even think about it. Each forkful vanished in seconds, his hands moving almost faster than he realized. In less than half a minute, the plate was empty.\nHe leaned back slightly, frowning.\nJust as he’d thought — it wasn’t even close to enough.\nAs the distant sounds of activity came from the kitchen, Liam drummed his fingers on the table impatiently. His body was practically buzzing, each muscle fiber was vibrating with a strange combination of strength and emptiness.\nWhile he waited, he decided to do something he’d put off earlier.\n\"System,\" he murmured under his breath. \"Show me the notifications I dismissed.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 39: Mind-Blowing Information\n[Congratulations Host on achieving molecular enhancement.]\n[All attributes has increased by +10]\nLiam smiled when he saw this. He immediately called up his status screen to check how much he had grown.\n[Host: Liam Scott]\n[Age: 18]\n[System Level: 2]\n[Strength: 15»»27]\n[Agility: 14»»25]\n[Stamina: 16»»28]\n[Constitution: 9»»22]\n[Attribute Points: 0]\n[System Points: 2,000»»1,000]\n[Skills: Pro-level Vehicular Operation, World-Class Etiquette, World-Class Culinary Arts, Formless Combat Doctrine, Perfect Memory]\n[Inventory: Bellemere Mansion property documents, Aston Martin Vantage GT3 key fob, Ferrari SF90 Stradale key fob, Roll Royce Ghost Black Badge key fob.]\n[System Function(s): Sign-in, System Store]\n***\n\"There’s a new attribute?\" Liam muttered to himself, surprised.\nCurious, he decided to ask the system.\nSystem, what’s with the new attribute and what does it represent?\n[Constitution represents your overall physical health, resilience, and vitality. A higher Constitution improves endurance, recovery, resistance to disease and toxins, and can extend your lifespan.]\nI see... So, how many years do I have with my 22 Constitution Points?\n[220 years. 1 point represent 10 years.]\n220 years?! That’s.... insane!!! I can live twice as old as everyone!\nLiam’s eyes lit up at the thought of being able to live twice as much as everyone else, but his mood quickly dropped the next moment.\nLiving twice as long. It was somewhat similar to immortality. It was something that some people wish for but Liam understood that it wasn’t exactly as beautiful as it’s portrayed to be. Also, spending immortality on such a boring planet as Earth would be nothing short of torture for the person.\nBut Liam can overcome the excruciating boredom of Earth by building a spaceship and go exploring the universe.\nIt would be fun,\nhe thought as his mood brightened once more.\nBut it would also need a lot of work. Still, it’s a challenge in willing to take and an adventure I’m willing to embark on.\nAs for how he got twice the lifespan of other humans? Even without asking, he knew that it was because of the enhancement.\nLiam turned his attention back to the system. He felt that there was something that he was missing.\nSystem, anything else I should know?\nThɪs N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n[Yes, host. Due to the fact that your body has been enhanced at the molecular level and due to the nanites in your body, you can now acquire other traits and make it yours.]\nLiam blinked in confusion when he heard this.\nAcquire and make other traits mine? What do you mean by that, system?\n[It’s exactly as you heard. Let me explain further. The nanites has perfected everything about your body and brought up, and past its biological limits. You can achieve things that even the most enhanced human or lifeform in your universe can’t achieve.]\nUniverse? Lifeform? System, let’s slow down a little. Please explain further and slowly.\n[It’s just as I said, Host. You don’t know this but the items in the store are influenced by your universe’s rule.]\nUmmm... Why do I feel like things are getting more complicated all of a sudden?,\nLiam thought as he scratched his head.\n[Let me explain in simple words, Host. The items that can appear in the store are governed by the laws of the universe you’re currently in. If you go to other universe, the store will have more diverse items.]\nLiam suddenly thought of something when the system said that. He understood what it just said correctly.\nDoes that mean that I can go to other worlds or universe? Like magic and cultivation worlds?\n[Yes, Host.]\nWow!... But isn’t this too early? I mean it hasn’t been a week since everything...\n[You can’t travel to other worlds now. You will need to unlock the function.]\nI see... How many more function do I need to unlock before unlocking it?\n[One.]\nThat’s good to hear. I can’t wait. Now, please tell me more about the things I can achieve that other lifeforms can’t achieve.\n[With your body having been enhanced at the molecular level and due to the nanites in your body, you can now in a prime state and can now accept the traits of other creatures, and make it yours, giving you abilities that shouldn’t be biologically possible.]\nLiam closed his eyes, trying to process what the system just said.\nGiving me abilities that shouldn’t be biologically impossible... Does that mean that I can gain abilities like flight?\n[Yes, Host. You can have the nanites extract the genome and bio-information of flight-capable birds, infuse them into your DNA, allowing you to grow wings and fly. You can also extract the genome bio-information of other animals like cheetah to give you speed; eagle to give you sharper vision; electric eels for generating electricity and other creatures for regenerative ability; cellular immortality. Any unique ability of any creature, you can acquire it.]\nHoly shit!!! What the fuck?!!!\nFor a long moment, Liam just sat there, frozen. The words hung in his head like a detonation in slow motion.\nYou can now accept the traits of other creatures, and make it yours.\nHe blinked a few times, his pulse picking up.\nWait... wait, wait, wait. You’re telling me—,\nHe broke off, shaking his head like the act might somehow make the statement sound less insane.\nNo, I need to hear that again in my own words.\nSo you’re saying I can literally... what? Steal abilities from other living things? Merge them into my own biology?\n[Correct, Host.]\nHe leaned back into the chair, a sharp laugh slipping out — not because it was funny, but because his brain was refusing to process how absurd this was.\nThe gears in his mind spun faster. He knew enough basic biology to realize the sheer scale of what the system was describing.\nIn real science, genetic engineering had limits — immense limits. You couldn’t just take a random trait from an animal, splice it into a human genome, and expect it to work. Even with CRISPR or nanotechnology, there were compatibility issues, gene expression problems, immune responses...\nAnd here the system was, casually saying, Yeah, you can take the echolocation of a bat, the muscle density of a gorilla, and the venom glands of a king cobra, and you’ll be fine.\nThe nanites were the key.\nThey weren’t just \"in\" his body — they were his body now, integrated into every tissue, every cell. They could rewrite the blueprint of his DNA on the fly, not in a lab over decades, but instantly. They could reweave proteins, rebuild organs, and restructure muscle fibers in ways that no natural biology could ever tolerate.\nIt wasn’t adaptation — it was controlled evolution. And Liam was the one with the controls.\nHe rubbed his hands over his face, exhaling slowly.\nThis is... I mean... where do I even start?\nThe most obvious applications popped into his mind immediately:\nPredator abilities: He could take the claws and night vision of big cats, the smell sensitivity of a bloodhound, the speed of a cheetah, the raw power of a tiger.\nMarine adaptations: The hydrodynamic body traits of dolphins, the pressure resistance of deep-sea creatures. He could dive to depths submarines feared.\nAvian traits: Hollow, reinforced bones and massive flight muscles from birds of prey, fused with his already superhuman frame — the ability to actually fly.\nThat alone was already enough to make him a living impossibility. But then his mind kept going.\nWhat about regenerative abilities? Starfish could regrow limbs. Salamanders could rebuild entire organs. Certain jellyfish could revert their cells to a youthful state — biological immortality in nature. If the nanites could take that and merge it with his own biology...\nHe wouldn’t just heal fast. He might not be able to die at all unless someone vaporized him completely.\nAnd then there was electricity. He thought of electric eels generating hundreds of volts, or the bioluminescence of deep-sea organisms, the stealth camouflage of cuttlefish. He could weave that into his own body and walk into a pitch-black room invisible and glowing with his own private power grid.\nHis heart was pounding now. The scope of it was insane.\n\"System,\" he muttered slowly, \"there’s... no limit to this?\"\n[Only one, Host: The target trait must be naturally occurring in the lifeform’s biology.]\nThat stopped him for a moment.\nSo no fire-breathing dragons\n— He paused mid-thought, realizing something.\nWait... unless they actually exist somewhere.\n[Correct, Host.]",

      "content": "Chapter 40: Mind-Blowing Information (2)\nThose words hit him like a freight train.\nHe sat back hard, staring at nothing.\nHe’d already been told there were other universes. And now the system had just confirmed that if he encountered a creature in one of those worlds—no matter how impossible it seemed by Earth’s science—he could extract its traits and make them his own.\nThat meant... magic.\nWas science magic? In a way, yes. There’s a saying that goes, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"\nLiam swallowed, a nervous tingle running up his spine, but a slow grin began to creep across his face.\nSystem... does this ability work on magical creatures?\n[Yes, Host.]\nHis eyes widened, disbelief melting into pure, unfiltered excitement. He grinned so wide it almost hurt.\n\"This is ridiculous... This is so ridiculous,\" he muttered.\nHow had this escalated so fast? Yesterday he’d been thinking about an enhancement to handle a knowledge package without frying his brain, and now... now he was one step away from becoming something out of a fantasy novel.\nSo many questions bubbled up at once. There was no telling what kind of worlds and species existed beyond Earth, and the system had just told him they were all potential... donors.\nScientifically, the concept was insane. Evolution compressed into minutes? Genetic barriers shattered without consequence. The merging of traits from entirely different species should cause catastrophic rejection on a cellular level. But the nanites weren’t just brute-forcing DNA splicing—they could restructure every single cell so the new trait didn’t just \"fit,\" it became part of him as naturally as the color of his eyes.\nAnd that was the dangerous part.\nIt wouldn’t be obvious. No scars. No mechanical implants. No grotesque mutations. It would all be seamless, tailored, perfect.\nIf he gained the raw strength of a silverback gorilla, he could still look like a lean, athletic man—but carry enough force to bend steel in his hands. If he absorbed the venom of a king cobra, there wouldn’t be obvious fangs—unless he wanted them.\nIt was the ultimate hidden weapon.\nHe could blend into any crowd, appear completely human... until he decided not to.\nHe sat there for minutes, breathing slowly, letting it all settle. The more he thought about it, the more thrilling and dangerous it seemed. This wasn’t just a personal upgrade. It was the kind of ability that could turn a person into a legend—if they survived long enough to use it.\nAnd in a universe where travel to other worlds was eventually possible... myths were just manuals waiting to be copied.\nThe thought alone was intoxicating. Dragons. Phoenixes. Leviathans. Creatures with powers so vast they blurred the line between biology and divinity.\nA shiver ran through him. Just imagining himself with wings of living flame, or scales that could shrug off cannon fire, made him feel high.\nFinally, after what felt like forever, Liam let out a low whistle and leaned back in his chair, a slow, wicked grin spreading across his face.\n\"My future just got a hell of a lot more interesting.\"\nHe could already see it: a version of himself that could walk on any planet, breathe any atmosphere, survive in space, and wield powers no human in history had ever possessed.\nA man who could soar above cities, dive to the darkest ocean floors, disappear into shadows, and strike with the force of a god.\nHe wasn’t there yet. But the path was in front of him now, clear and tempting.\nStill, all of that was for later. The current Liam had no intention of hunting for traits just yet. First, he needed to build himself up, cement his name, and lay a foundation strong enough to handle the kind of insane adventures this ability promised.\nEven so... he wouldn’t deny it. The idea of acquiring traits made his blood run hotter, his fingers itch. Part of him wanted to try it right now, just to see.\nHe was still lost in that thought when Evelyn and the other maids arrived, wheeling in trays laden with food.\n\"Dinner is served, Mr. Liam,\" Evelyn announced softly, setting the first steaming plate on the long dining table.\nThe rich aromas hit him instantly—roast chicken glazed with herbs, buttered vegetables, fluffy mashed potatoes, and a basket of fresh bread. Clara followed with another plate, then another, until the table was nearly full.\nLiam didn’t waste a second. He picked up his fork and dug in.\nThe first mouthful barely hit his tongue before he was already lifting the next. The rhythm became mechanical—cut, chew, swallow, repeat—until one plate was empty, then the next, then the next.\nEvelyn, Clara, and Mira exchanged silent glances as they moved about the dining room. They’d expected him to be hungry after skipping lunch, but not like this. This wasn’t hunger—it was devouring.\nBy the time he polished off the last plate, the number of servings stood at six full adult meals. And yet... his stomach wasn’t bulging, not even slightly.\nIt was unsettling. Where was all that food going?\nLiam leaned back slightly, wiping his mouth with the cloth napkin. Finally—finally—the gnawing void in his gut was gone. But instead of the heavy, sluggish feeling that usually came with overeating, he felt... light. Energized.\nHe stood, chair sliding back with a faint scrape.\n\"That was perfect,\" he said simply, before turning and heading for the stairs.\nThe maids remained still for a moment, watching him leave.\nClara leaned closer to Evelyn, whispering, \"Where does he put all that food?\"\nEvelyn shook her head faintly. \"Don’t ask questions you’re not ready to hear the answers to.\"\nUpstairs, Liam moved at a relaxed pace, one hand brushing along the smooth banister.The source of this content ɪs ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nIt wasn’t hard to figure out what was going on. His body’s metabolism wasn’t \"fast\" or \"slow\" anymore—it was optimized. Every calorie was being converted into exactly what his body needed with near-perfect efficiency.\nThe reason he’d eaten so much tonight was obvious. The nanites were still fully syncing with his system, repairing microscopic flaws, fortifying tissues, running final calibrations. That kind of overhaul needed fuel.\nBy tomorrow? He’d probably be back to eating normally. Maybe even less than before.\nOr maybe... more. Who knew?\nEither way, there was no point worrying about it now.\nHe reached his room and stepped inside, the plush carpet muting his footsteps. With a sigh of quiet satisfaction, he headed straight for the bed.\nThe moment he sank into the mattress, the tension in his body began to melt away. The silk sheets were cool against his skin, the pillow perfectly cradling his head.\nA smile ghosted across his face as he lay there, staring up at the faint shadow patterns on the ceiling.\nHis life had changed so much in such a short time. And it was going to change even more.\nThe system had started as a lifeline—a miracle that saved him from a life he hated. Now it was a ladder stretching higher than he’d ever imagined, each rung promising something stranger, more impossible, more dangerous.\nAnd Liam wasn’t afraid of the climb.\nNot anymore.\nWith a quiet exhale, he closed his eyes, letting the thoughts of dragons, phoenixes, and impossible futures drift into the edges of his mind.",

      "content": "Chapter 41: Four Times In A Row\nThe next morning, Liam woke up feeling... alive.\nNot just refreshed. Not just well-rested. But different.\nHe lay there for a moment, still half-buried in the silk sheets, blinking at the faint streams of morning light spilling in through the curtains. The sensation was hard to pin down.\nIt was as if every breath of air was richer, cooler, sharper. As if the warmth of the morning sun wasn’t just touching his skin but sinking into him.\nTo exaggerate a little, it felt like he was alive for the first time in his life.\nAnd then the details hit him.\nIt wasn’t just a feeling—his body knew.\nHe noticed something as his eyes flicked toward the curtains. The sensory details flooding his brain. Maybe because he was too hungry to notice last night but he realised that the world around was now far more detailed than before.\nHe felt he could see the weave of the fabric wasn’t just visible—it was crystal clear. He could almost see each individual thread.\nWhen he looked past it, he could make out the crisp outline of a rooftop across the street, even though it was barely visible through the narrow curtain gap.\nHe turned his head and the faintest movement in the corner of the room caught his attention—just a drifting mote of dust, but the way it spun in the air was so clear that for a second he almost reached out to catch it.\nHis ears picked up more than they should have. He could hear the quiet shuffle of footsteps somewhere far below—probably one of the maids in the kitchen. There was even the distant tick of the grandfather clock in the hallway, separated from him by two thick walls and a carpeted corridor.\nAnd the smells—God, the smells. The faint lingering trace of his shampoo from last night’s shower. The muted but distinct scent of polish from the furniture. Even the subtle hint of someone’s perfume, probably Evelyn’s, drifting up from downstairs.\nIt was almost overwhelming. Maybe, if he pushed these senses far enough, he really would be able to smell sounds and hear colours one day.\nJust... not today.\nSmiling faintly to himself, Liam decided to get his day started the usual way. \"System. Sign in.\"\nThe familiar blue panel materialized before his eyes.\n[Congratulations, Host. You have received 0.02% shares of JP Morgan.]\n[You have received a one-of-a-kind Fabergé Egg.]\n[You have received an ultra-rare, flawless Blue Diamond (17.6 carats).]\n[Note: The Fabergé Egg and the Diamond are in the inventory.]\n***\nFor a moment, Liam just stared at the list.\n\"...You’ve got to be kidding me.\"\nThe first reward made his brow furrow. Again. Four days in a row now. Always 0.02% of JP Morgan’s shares. Always perfectly timed. The company’s market cap put that at about $160 million a pop.\nNow his total stake was 0.08%. Worth around $640m.\nAt first, he’d brushed it off as a lucky coincidence. The system didn’t owe him any kind of explanation for what it gave him. But four identical share rewards in four days? That wasn’t luck anymore. That was a pattern.\nAnd patterns... meant there was a reason.\nHe couldn’t help but wonder if the system was deliberately making him a significant shareholder. But why? Was it trying to position him to have influence over the bank? Was there something about JP Morgan specifically that tied into the system’s larger... plan?ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nHe’d have to think about that later.\nHis gaze shifted to the second reward. The Winter’s Heart. As someone from the trenches, he has absolutely no fucking idea what a Fabergé Egg is. But as he thought about it, information about it started flooding into his head—probably the work of the system.\nA Fabergé egg isn’t an actual egg. Not the one you can eat. It’s a jewelled egg first created by the jewellery firm House of Fabergé, in Saint Petersburg, Russia. As many as 69 Czarist Russia Era eggs were created, of which 61 are currently known to have survived...\nLiam went through the information about the egg and he now knew enough about Fabergé Eggs to understand they were already rare as hell, but this one—this was special.\nThe name alone told him it wasn’t some auction lot any rich collector could bid on. It was a one-of-a-kind.\nForty-two million dollars in value, but its rarity made it priceless. And best of all—it wasn’t just a decoration. It was a statement. Something that could sit in a display case and quietly scream wealth and power to anyone who saw it.\nThen there was the diamond.\nA flawless 17.6 carat blue diamond. He didn’t even need the system’s little valuation note to know it was worth a fortune. Though he was from the trenches, he knew how valuable diamonds are and blue diamonds were rarer than almost any other gemstone on Earth. A single carat could fetch millions. This one? Thirty million, at least.\nHe exhaled slowly, leaning back against the headboard.\nMoney. Influence. Assets that could be flaunted or hidden as needed. The system wasn’t just giving him wealth—it was giving him tools. Pieces that could fit into a much bigger puzzle.\nAnd it was starting to freak him out a little how much sense it all made when he thought about it that way.\nStill, he couldn’t help but smile. \"You’re really making this too easy,\" he muttered.\nHe swung his legs off the bed, stretched until his joints popped, and padded toward the bathroom. Time to get ready for the day.\n***\nMeanwhile – JP Morgan Headquarters, New York City\nThe tall glass door to the CEO’s office swung open, and a middle-aged man in a tailored grey suit stepped in. He carried a slim leather folder, his expression composed but faintly uneasy.\n\"Sir,\" he began, coming to a stop in front of the massive desk, \"he bought again. The same percentage.\"\nBehind the desk, the CEO looked up from a stack of reports. His brow furrowed slightly. He drummed his fingers once on the desk’s polished surface, a soft but deliberate rhythm.\n\"How many is the total percentage now?\" His voice was calm, but there was a thread of tension under it.\n\"0.08%, sir,\" the man replied crisply.\nThe CEO’s eyes narrowed. \"Value?\"\n\"Roughly $640m at the current market cap.\"\nSilence stretched for a moment. The CEO leaned back in his chair, his gaze drifting toward the wall of floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out over Manhattan.\nFinally, he nodded once. \"Thank you. You can go back to what you were doing. Keep me updated if anything else comes up.\"\nThe man inclined his head. \"Yes, sir.\" He turned and left, the quiet click of the door closing behind him.\nLeft alone, the CEO picked up his phone and scrolled through his contacts until he found the one he wanted.\nHe pressed the call button and held the phone to his ear.\n\"How is what I asked of you yesterday?\" he said without preamble when the line connected.\nA pause. Then his eyes narrowed slightly. \"You found nothing? How’s that possible?\"\nHe listened again, his jaw tightening. \"You used all of the available resources, yes? Checked every angle?\"\nAnother pause. The voice on the other end spoke again, but whatever they were saying didn’t seem to satisfy him.\n\"Yeah... I agree. That can’t be right. There’s no way someone like him is ordinary.\" His tone sharpened. \"What about the so-called parents? What are they doing now?\"\nSilence. Then a faint, skeptical \"Strange indeed\" from the CEO.\n\"Okay. Keep digging. But be careful. I have a feeling he’s someone of status—and we don’t want to make the wrong kind of noise until we know which family he belongs to.\"\nHe ended the call, dropped the phone onto the desk with a muted thunk, and stared out at the panoramic view.\nThe late-morning light poured over the skyscrapers, throwing sharp reflections across the glass towers. Down below, the city churned with its usual chaos—yellow cabs darting between lanes, crowds streaming through crosswalks, horns blaring in the distance.\nAnd somewhere, out there, was an eighteen-year-old holding $640m worth of the company’s shares... without so much as a whisper in the industry about how he’d gotten them.\nThe CEO’s gaze hardened.\n\"Just who are you, Liam?\" he muttered under his breath. \"And which of the families do you come from?\"\nHe sat there a moment longer, lost in thought, before finally turning back to his desk.\nBut the question lingered in his mind. And the unease it carried... wasn’t going away anytime soon.",

      "content": "Chapter 42: Reward that Comes With Mysteries\nAfter his morning bath, Liam dressed in a crisp charcoal polo and tailored trousers. The clothes fit him perfectly — not just because of the cut, but because his new physique seemed to make anything look tailored.\nAs he fastened the last button, he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror and paused for a half-second, almost amused.\n\"Wow!\" He muttered to himself and left his room.\nWhen he made his way downstairs, the faint scent of fresh bread and coffee reached him before he even entered the dining room.\nThe air felt cooler on his skin than he remembered — another reminder that the enhancement had tuned his senses past anything normal.\nEvelyn and the other maids were already in position. They straightened subtly when he walked in.\n\"Good morning, Mr. Liam,\" Evelyn said with her usual grace.\nHe gave her a polite nod. \"Morning.\"\n\"Breakfast is ready, sir.\"\nHe moved to the long, polished dining table, the soft creak of the chair accompanying him as he sat. The maids moved with smooth coordination, placing dishes in front of him.\nToday’s spread wasn’t overwhelming — no towering stacks of plates like last night’s feast. Just a reasonable, refined breakfast: fresh croissants, scrambled eggs with chives, smoked salmon, sautéed spinach, and a small bowl of fruit.\nLiam noticed the portion instantly and smiled faintly. They’re testing the waters.\nThe moment he picked up his fork and took the first bite, the difference was clear. He didn’t wolf down the food like the night before. There was no gnawing hunger clawing at his insides now. Instead, he ate at a relaxed pace, letting each flavor unfold on his tongue.\nAnd the taste... God, the taste.\nMaybe it was the enhancement. Maybe it was the World-Class Culinary Arts skill the system had given him. Maybe both. But each bite wasn’t just food — it was a sensory breakdown.\nIf not for his enhancement, his brain would had been overloaded by all the sensory information constantly flooding into it.\nThe eggs were creamy, the chives releasing a faint, sharp perfume as his teeth broke through them. The croissant layers flaked apart with the perfect ratio of crisp to soft. The salmon carried the faint smokiness of applewood, and in his mind, he could see the entire cooking process — from the curing to the precise smoking time, to the final plating.\nIt wasn’t just eating. It was watching a dish’s entire history unfold from stove to plate, in perfect clarity.\nOut of the corner of his eye, he caught Evelyn and the other two maids — Clara and Mira — exchanging the occasional glance as they moved about the room. They were subtle, but Liam’s upgraded senses picked up on it.\nThey’d clearly expected him to skip breakfast after last night. Six full servings had been enough to stun them into silence then, and they’d probably assumed his appetite would need a break. The fact that he was here, eating again, and doing it with such measured calm, was throwing them off.\nThey were probably also relieved. Preparing a feast like last night every day wasn’t exactly part of their original plan.\nWhile they were quietly trying to figure him out, Liam’s thoughts were elsewhere entirely.\nHe was thinking about his rewards.\nSpecifically, the two new ones from today.\nThis was the first time since getting the system that he’d received something like this — outside the usual cars, properties, attribute boosts, skills, or shares. The second reward especially... it was on a whole different level.\nThe Winter’s Heart.\nIf the system hadn’t shoved the information into his head, he wouldn’t have even known what a Fabergé egg was. Back in his old life, his exposure to \"luxury\" was seeing knockoff Rolex watches on roadside stands and hearing about art auctions on the news in passing.\nNow? He knew exactly what the Fabergé represented.\nA jewelled egg, crafted in the golden age of the Russian Empire by the House of Fabergé. Fewer than seventy were ever made, and each one was unique. Most were already locked away in museums or private collections, their prices climbing into the stratosphere whenever they appeared at auction.\nBut Winter’s Heart wasn’t just another rare egg. It was a monster.\nTwo thousand four hundred flawless white diamonds. Two pear-shaped blue diamonds — fifteen carats each. A flawless seventeen-carat blue diamond set into its crown, and a three-carat pigeon-blood ruby gleaming like a drop of frozen fire.\nEven without being an expert, Liam knew that blue diamonds were among the rarest gems on Earth. In 2022, Sotheby’s had sold a fifteen-carat blue diamond for $57.5 million. And Winter’s Heart had three of them.The most update n0vels are published on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nJust the blue diamonds alone would push the value toward $200 million. The ruby, because of its quality and the prestige of its setting, would add even more.\nThe system had tagged its worth at $40 million — and Liam almost laughed. That price wasn’t just low, it was absurd. Unless the system was deliberately undervaluing it for some reason, the real number was far, far higher.\nAnd that was just the egg.\nThe third reward was an ultra-rare, flawless blue diamond of 17.6 carats. Pure, clear, and perfect. By conservative estimates, it would be worth at least $70 million.\nHe did a quick tally in his head.\nToday’s rewards — between the 0.02% JP Morgan shares, the Fabergé egg, and the diamond — easily tipped close to half a billion dollars in combined value.\nHalf. A. Billion.\nIt was getting ridiculous.\nBut money wasn’t the only thing on his mind. Because hidden inside Winter’s Heart was something else — something the system had been kind enough to mention in a small, offhand note.\nA key.\nSpecifically, a key to a safe deposit box.\nWhat was inside? The system didn’t say. Which meant Liam would have to find out himself.\nThe thought made his lips curl into a small smile. He’d always liked mysteries that came with rewards at the end.\nHe wanted to guess what he could find inside the deposit box but he couldn’t. But one thing he knew based on the system’s way of Don things was that he would be in for the shock of his life.\nHe finished the last of his breakfast and set down his fork.\nEvelyn stepped forward, as if ready to ask whether he wanted more, but Liam spoke first.\n\"I’ll be in my room for the rest of the day. Don’t disturb me unless I call for you.\"\nEvelyn inclined her head. \"Understood, sir.\"\nWithout another word, he left the dining room and headed upstairs. His steps were unhurried, the quiet confidence in his movements almost at odds with the storm of planning already building in his mind.\nWhen he entered his room, he closed the door behind him and locked it. The quiet click felt like sealing himself into a different world entirely.\nHe crossed to the bed, sat down, and leaned back slightly, staring up at the high ceiling for a moment.\nThe knowledge package.\nThis was what he’d been waiting for.\nHe’d held off until now for one reason — he hadn’t wanted to risk overloading his mind before his body was ready. But now, with the Molecular Enhancement Nanites running in his system, there was no reason to wait.\nThe Omni-Science Foundation Package.\nIf the system’s description was to be believed, it would give him instant mastery of every major scientific discipline — physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics — and all their advanced subfields. It wouldn’t just make him smart. It would make him the smartest person to have ever lived in terms of raw scientific ability.\nIt was the kind of knowledge that could let him design warp drives in his sleep, build fusion reactors from scrap, or rewrite genetic codes over breakfast.\nLiam’s fingers tapped lightly against the mattress. The sheer potential of what he was about to do had his pulse running a little faster.\nA Fabergé egg worth hundreds of millions. A flawless diamond. Another block of JP Morgan shares. These were all incredible, yes — but they were tools. Wealth could buy influence, assets, protection.\nKnowledge could build empires.\nWith that thought, he called up his status screen.",

But right now, every instinct told him that this was the smarter move. Once he had that knowledge in his head, the yacht trip could be more than leisure — it could be a chance to think, to plan, to start shaping the next phase of his life.\nHe tapped his fingers lightly on the bed beside him, considering his next move.\n\"System,\" he said after a moment, \"is there anything I need to do before assimilating the knowledge package?\"\nThe reply came at once.\n[No special preparations are necessary, Host. Assimilation will take several hours —possibly up to half a day. You will be unconscious during the process. No pain will be felt, but minor discomfort is expected. The enhancement will protect your neural structure from overload.]\nLiam nodded slowly. That last part was reassuring. Without the molecular enhancement, he suspected this process might turn his brain into molten mush.\n\"All right,\" he murmured.\nHe lay back on the bed, shifting until he found the most comfortable position.\nHe took a deep breath and another. And then...\n\"System. Purchase Omni-Science Foundation Package.\"\n[Purchase complete. Item added to Inventory.]\nHis jaw tightened slightly as he gave the mental command to assimilate. He barely had time to brace himself before it hit.\nIt wasn’t a trickle. It wasn’t even a flood.\nIt was an ocean.\nAn ocean of information, roaring into his mind all at once.\nMathematical formulas scrawled themselves across his vision in burning light. Atomic diagrams spun like fireworks in his skull.\nThe periodic table expanded beyond anything Earth’s scientists had ever dreamed of — hundreds of new elements, each with their own properties, atomic weights, and potential uses.\nHe winced. The discomfort wasn’t sharp, but it was deep — like a weight pressing into every corner of his mind.\nThe data kept coming.\nThe laws of thermodynamics unfolded in ways he’d never imagined — ways that could be bent, rewritten, even bypassed with the right technology.\nQuantum mechanics became not just a theory, but a living blueprint in his head. He could see the probabilities, feel the mathematical pulse of particle interactions.\nIt was dizzying. It was beautiful. It was terrifying.\nImages blurred into concepts, concepts into complete blueprints. Orbital mechanics. Energy conversion systems. Fusion reactor designs. Advanced propulsion methods that could fling ships across light-years without violating causality. Genetic engineering so precise it could rewrite a species’ evolutionary trajectory in a single generation.\nHe gritted his teeth. \"Shit...\" The word slipped out under his breath as the pressure built behind his eyes.\nIt wasn’t pain. The system had kept its promise. But the weight of so much knowledge pressing into his mind all at once made him feel like a diver at the bottom of an ocean trench — crushing pressure, infinite depth.\nAnd then... darkness enveloped him.\n***\nHours later.\nThe Bellemere Mansion was quiet, but not peaceful.\nIn the kitchen, Evelyn was standing by the island counter, her brow faintly furrowed. Clara and Mira were nearby, going through the dinner preparations, but their movements were slower than usual.\n\"He hasn’t come down all day,\" Clara murmured, keeping her voice low.\n\"It’s the same as yesterday,\" Mira added, glancing toward the ceiling. \"No lunch. No sound from upstairs.\"\nEvelyn didn’t answer at first. She was too busy weighing her options. Dinner was in a couple of hours. Did they prepare a normal serving? Or the six full adult portions he’d devoured the night before?\nFinally, she said, \"We’ll wait. Start with the regular amount. If he asks for more, we’ll make it fresh.\"\nJust then, the faint sound of footsteps drifted down from the upper floor.\nEvelyn came out of the kitchen and looked up, and she saw Liam was descending the grand staircase, each step unhurried.\nHe didn’t look tired, exactly... but there was something about his expression. His gaze seemed distant, unfocused, as though he was still somewhere else entirely.\nEvelyn’s lips curved into a polite smile. \"Good evening, Mr. Liam.\"\nHe didn’t answer right away. Just gave a faint nod, his eyes still carrying that strange, far-off gleam, and continued toward the living room.\n***\nLiam sank into one of the deep leather sofas, the cushions absorbing his weight. For a long moment, he didn’t move. He just leaned back, eyes on the ceiling.\nHis mind was... different now. He finally understood why the system had adviced him to go through the enhancement first.\nBecause if he hadn’t gone through it, there was no way that his brain would had survived the first three seconds of the assimilation process.\nYes, that was how insanely massive the information contained in the knowledge package is.\nBefore, he’d thought of knowledge as something you accessed. You remembered facts. You recalled formulas. You looked things up.\nBut now? It was all there. In his head.\nHe didn’t have to remember how to calculate the optimal trajectory for a Mars transfer orbit — he just knew it. He didn’t have to think about how to construct a self-repairing nanofabrication system — the blueprint was already perfect in his mind.\nEven now, with just a glance, he has already calculated everything about the ceiling. It was like he could see geometry in everything.\nIt was like having an entire civilization’s worth of scientific achievement wired directly into his neurons.\nAnd that was the problem.\n\"What the hell...?\" The words slipped from his mouth, low and slow.\nBecause he understood now, on a level he never had before, just how far he was from what humanity thought it knew.\nEarth’s cutting-edge technology? The so-called frontier of human innovation? It was the equivalent of a toddler stacking wooden blocks compared to the things now swimming in his head.\nHe could build a computer the size of a sugar cube that would make the world’s fastest and most powerful supercomputer look like an abacus. He could design a propulsion system that could reach Pluto in hours. He could grow a building instead of constructing it, programming its materials on a molecular level.\nIt wasn’t just that he knew more than anyone alive. It was that he now knew too much.\nAnd once you knew something... you couldn’t un-know it.\nLiam sighed heavily as he settled his thoughts.\nEvelyn reappeared in the doorway of the kitchen, breaking his thoughts.\n\"Dinner will be ready shortly, sir.\"\nHe blinked, then looked up at her with the faintest of smiles. \"Thanks, Evelyn.\"\nShe inclined her head and stepped away, leaving him alone again.\nLiam ran a hand slowly down his face and leaned back even more.\nThe yacht trip could wait. The world could wait. Right now, he needed time to think.\nBecause with the knowledge now burning quietly in the back of his mind, the real question wasn’t what he could do.\nIt was what he was willing to do.\nʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NovᴇlFirenᴇt",

      "content": "Chapter 44: Ideas And Limitations\nLiam placed his cutlery back on the plate, the faint clink echoing softly in the quiet dining room.\nDinner had been satisfying — not because the meal was extraordinary (though Evelyn and the maids had done a fine job) — but because his mind had been calm enough to actually taste and enjoy it.\nWiping his hands on the napkin, he rose from the table, offering a polite nod to Evelyn.\nHe had been asleep for most of the day after the Omni-Science assimilation, and his body felt too charged to even consider going to bed. What he needed wasn’t sleep — it was a way to wind down. Something to occupy his mind without demanding too much effort.\nAnd the private home theatre seemed like the perfect choice.\nThe moment Liam stepped inside, the scent of fresh leather and faint trace of polish wrapped around him. The space was cavernous but warm — plush carpeting underfoot, soft recessed lighting along the walls, and a massive, curved IMAX screen dominating the far end.\nA row of premium recliners lined the center, each fitted with controls for angle, temperature, and even massage settings.\nHe dropped into the center recliner, adjusting it until it was nearly horizontal. The leather was cool against his skin for the first few seconds before absorbing his body heat.\nHe grabbed the slim remote from the armrest and scrolled through the library until he found something easy — a big-budget action film he’d been meaning to watch but never got around to.\nThe lights dimmed automatically as the opening credits flared across the screen, sound rolling through the room in a deep, perfect surround.\nFor a few minutes, he let himself sink into it — explosions on the screen, adrenaline-pumping soundtrack, clean visuals. But inevitably, his mind drifted.\nThe knowledge in his head refused to stay quiet.\nEven here, with a movie blasting at a hundred decibels, he could still feel the hum of ideas just under the surface. Equations, designs, and schematics sat like loaded weapons in the back of his mind, waiting for him to pick one up and pull the trigger.\nAnd he knew one thing for sure: if he wanted to use this advantage properly, he couldn’t just sit on it. He had to move.\nThe obvious choice was to create a company. With the right products, he could introduce groundbreaking tech without drawing suspicion — or at least, not so much suspicion that people would start digging too deep.\nHe smirked faintly. No, he wasn’t going to hand this knowledge to his government like some self-sacrificing patriot in a bad novel.\nHe liked his country well enough, but he wasn’t naïve. He understood exactly how people worked, especially those in power. They wouldn’t \"use his discoveries for the good of the nation.\" They’d strip him bare, milk him for everything, and bury him when he was no longer useful.\nAnd that was if they didn’t lock him up somewhere nice and secure while they kept him \"protected.\"\nNo — this was his, and he’d use it on his own terms.\nBut there was one problem.\nIt wasn’t that he didn’t have an idea for a first product. The problem was the opposite — he had too many.\nBillions of possible blueprints flashed through his thoughts: medical nanites that could cure nearly every disease, clean energy devices that could power entire cities for pennies, propulsion systems that could reach Mars in hours.\nBut for a first product, he had to be careful. It had to be revolutionary but not so alien that it screamed \"future tech from another universe.\"\nHe couldn’t exactly roll out a warp-capable spaceship and expect no one to panic.\nHe sighed, smirking at the thought. \"Yeah... can’t exactly sell a battleship as a consumer product.\"\nHe started mentally filtering, sifting through possibilities like a jeweler sorting stones. In minutes, two stood out.\nThe first was a new kind of quantum chip — one small enough to fit into a phone, laptops, gaming consoles and all other types of devices, and even chips the size of GPUs which would be powerful enough to replace entire data centers, and stable enough to run on almost no energy.\nThe second was something even more market-friendly: a regular-looking pair of glasses that doubled as full-immersion VR gaming gear. Not the clunky headsets, limited AR overlays devices that currently exista. But glasses that could seamlessly transport the user into a hyperreal virtual environment indistinguishable from reality.\nEither one would dominate the global market.\nThe problem? Making them exactly as he envisioned was impossible with Earth’s current tech base. Not \"difficult\" — impossible. The materials, precision, and processes didn’t exist here yet.\nThat’s when his mind jumped to the perfect solution:\nA molecular assembler.\nA molecular assembler was the pinnacle of manufacturing — a device capable of constructing matter atom-by-atom according to a digital blueprint. It didn’t just \"build\" in the traditional sense; it assembled matter with absolute precision, allowing for materials and structures that could never occur naturally.\nWant a quantum chip with perfect crystal alignment and zero impurities? Program it. Want a composite lighter and stronger than anything in existence? Feed in the specs. Want to produce a complex machine in one piece with no assembly lines or supply chains? Done.\nIn short, a molecular assembler could create almost anything — from a spoon to a spacecraft — without waste, without error, and without limitation beyond raw material input.\nIf Liam had one, producing his quantum chips and VR glasses would be trivial.\nHe opened the system store and typed the search. The results popped up instantly, and he felt a grin tug at his lips.\nStandard Molecular Assembler\nCost: 10,000 SP\nDescription: A high-precision nanofabrication device capable of constructing matter atom-by-atom within a controlled build chamber. Supports production of objects ranging from micro-scale components to medium-scale machinery (maximum size: small car). Enables flawless manufacturing of quantum circuits, advanced materials, and intricate devices with zero defects and no waste. Requires raw material input. Build speed and complexity scale with blueprint detail..\nUnrestricted Molecular Assembler\nCost: 50,000 SP\nDescription: An unlimited-capacity fabrication system capable of assembling any physical object at the atomic level, regardless of size. From spacecraft to planetary megastructures, including Dyson spheres, orbital rings, warp gates, and planetary defense arrays. No size restriction, no structural limitations. Supports simultaneous multi-object production and live adaptive blueprint modification. Requires corresponding raw materials or matter-energy conversion modules for continuous operation.\n***\nLiam exhaled softly. \"Figures... 10,000 SP for the basic one.\"\nThat meant $100 million in exchange rate terms. And he had just over $12 million in liquid cash right now.\nThe unrestricted version’s 50,000 SP price tag didn’t even bear thinking about yet — that was half a billion dollars.\nBut the look of dangerous excitement in his eyes didn’t dim by the steep cost.\nStill, it was the first time he’d really understood that there were two \"tiers\" in the system store: regular items that were already world-shattering by Earth standards... and the truly insane ones.\nHe closed the store with a wry smile. \"One day.\"\nFor now, he’d have to wait. Maybe start stockpiling sign-ins instead of using them. Though he wasn’t sure he was ready to give up the daily sign-ins just yet.\nThat thought made him curious enough to ask, \"System, if I start accumulating my daily sign-ins, how many points are we talking?\"\n[You will receive 10 SP for daily sign-ins, 50 SP for weekly sign-ins, 100 SP for monthly sign-ins and 1,000 SP for annual sign-ins.]\nHe blinked in confusion when he heard this.\n\"That’s... it?\"\nA laugh slipped out, low and incredulous.\n\"You know, system, for something that hands me billion-dollar shares and priceless gems, you’re kind of stingy with the points.\"Thɪs updatᴇd by ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nStill — free was free. Complaining would be stupid.\nHe decided to push the thought aside.\nThe movie was still playing, but Liam’s attention had fully drifted. His mind was already on tomorrow.\nHe’d decided — he was going out to sea.\nThe yacht Mia hadn’t left the dock since he’d acquired her, and he wanted to feel the ocean under her hull. Maybe even take the helicopter for a short trip over the waves.\nHe pulled out his phone, calling his yacht’s chief sailor and the flight captain.\n\"I’ll need both of you tomorrow,\" he said simply. \"Be ready for my call.\"\nBoth acknowledged instantly.\nEnding the calls, Liam thought for a moment. Going alone didn’t appeal to him — not for something like this.\nHe opened the group chat with Stacy, Kristopher, and the rest. The cursor blinked at him for a few seconds before he started typing.\n\"Got a trip planned tomorrow. Yacht + open sea. You guys free?\"\nHe hit send, leaned back in the recliner, and watched the little \"typing...\" bubble appear almost immediately, with their miniature profiles behind it.",

      "content": "Chapter 45: \"Thank You, System\"\nThe next morning, Liam woke up with his usual easy smile, the kind that came naturally these days. But this time, there was an extra edge to it — anticipation.\nToday wasn’t going to be spent holed up in the mansion, buried in the system store or tinkering with plans. Today, he was going out to sea.\nNot just any trip either — the maiden voyage of the Mia under his ownership.\nThe thought made him almost giddy. The open ocean, the wind in his face, sunlight glittering off the waves... and he wasn’t going as just a guest on someone else’s boat. This was his yacht, his crew, his experience to shape exactly how he wanted it.\nAnd he wasn’t going alone. Stacy, Kristopher, and the rest of the group had already confirmed they were coming. It was going to be a small crowd, the kind where everyone knew each other — enough people to make it lively, but not so many that it turned chaotic.\nFor Liam, this was going to be fun. Real fun.\nHe was already half-sitting up in bed when he remembered — there was one thing he had to do before anything else.\n\"System,\" he said with a grin, \"sign-in.\"\n[Congratulations, Host. You have received $15,000,000]\n[You have received 0.02% shares of JP Morgan.]\n[You have received ustom luxury casual wear set (tailored for yacht outing).]\n[You have received custom wristwatch of significant heritage and value.]\nLiam’s brows rose slightly. \"Not bad...\"\nThe first two rewards barely drew more than a faint smile from him now. The cash was always welcome, of course — fifteen million more in liquid assets was nothing to dismiss — but it was the 0.02% JP Morgan shares that caught his attention for a different reason.\nIt had been five days in a row now. Every morning, without fail, the system handed him the same fraction of the bank’s shares.\nAt first, it had been strange enough to make him wonder about the reason. Now? He’d stopped overthinking it.\nWhatever the purpose, he wasn’t about to complain about an extra $160 million in assets, not when it brought his total JP Morgan stake up to 0.12%, with a staggering $800 million in market value.\nBut the last two rewards... those made him pause.\nThe \"custom luxury casual wear set\" and the \"custom wristwatch\" weren’t standard system gifts. They were... thoughtful. Tailored. The kind of thing someone gave you when they knew exactly what you were about to do.\nWith a faintly curious smile, Liam swung his legs out of bed and padded toward his walk-in wardrobe.\nThe moment he stepped inside, he spotted them immediately. The clothes were displayed on a bespoke hanger stand, perfectly pressed and arranged as if an invisible stylist had been at work.\nThanks to his enhancement, he could see the details better.\nThe set was deceptively simple: a lightweight, soft-shouldered linen blazer in a muted cream tone, paired with a pale blue Italian linen shirt and white tailored trousers. The shirt’s fabric had that subtle sheen only the highest-grade long-staple cotton could achieve, and the trousers had a fit so precise they might as well have been laser-measured to his form.\nThe blazer alone, Liam guessed, would retail for somewhere in the $6,000–$8,000 range from a top-tier designer. The entire outfit? Probably $15,000–$20,000, and that was before factoring in the fact that the system almost certainly had it custom-made for him, no brand label, pure exclusivity.\nHis gaze moved to the shoes: a pair of hand-stitched, white calfskin loafers with a subtle tan leather trim. Comfortable enough for deck wear.\nAnd then there was the watch.\nIt rested in an open suede-lined case on a small shelf, its face catching the morning light in a restrained flash.\nLiam’s breath stilled for a moment as he picked it up. The dial was a deep, glossy enamel — somewhere between navy and midnight — with Breguet numerals in polished white gold. The case itself was slim, elegant, and made of platinum, with a sapphire crystal back revealing an intricately hand-finished movement.\nHe didn’t need the system’s help to know what it was, but the instant he touched it, the knowledge still flooded into his mind.\nA Patek Philippe Reference 570 — a vintage model produced in extremely limited numbers during the mid-20th century. This one, however, wasn’t just rare. It was unique. Custom-commissioned by an anonymous European aristocrat in the 1950s, it had passed through only two hands before the system plucked it from wherever it had been hidden.\nEstimated value? Around $4.5 million.\nBut value was almost beside the point. In certain circles, this wasn’t a \"watch\" — it was a quiet announcement of power, heritage, and taste. Anyone who recognized it would immediately know they were dealing with someone in the very highest strata of society.\nLiam turned it over in his hands, smiling faintly. \"You’re really looking out for me, aren’t you?\" he murmured to the system.\nHe slipped on the watch, its platinum weight settling comfortably on his wrist, then changed into the new clothes. The fit was perfect — almost absurdly so — and when he glanced in the mirror, he saw exactly what like he wanted.\nHe didn’t look like a flashy lottery winner or a nouveau-riche twenty-something desperate to show off. He looked like someone who had grown up with money. The kind of person who had always owned everything and anything.\n\"Thank you, system,\" Liam smiled as he thought off the watch and went to the bathroom to prepare for the day.\nAfter he was done, he put on the new clothes and the watch, and headed downstairs.\nEvelyn was already waiting near the table, her posture impeccable. \"Good morning, sir. Breakfast is ready.\"\n\"Morning,\" Liam replied with an easy smile, making his way to the head of the table.\nThe maids moved smoothly around him, placing the morning’s dishes — fluffy omelets with fresh herbs, smoked trout, toast, and seasonal fruit.\nBut before picking up his fork, Liam reached for his phone.\nHe dialed the number for the Sikorsky’s flight captain, and the man answered within two rings.\n\"Good morning, Mr. Liam.\"\n\"Morning. I need you to pick me up from the mansion and take me to the Mia. We’ll be heading out later today.\"\n\"Yes, sir. I’ll have the helicopter ready and on the nearest helipad within forty minutes.\"\n\"Good.\" Liam ended the call without fuss.\nHe didn’t bother calling Captain Rodrick of the Mia directly. The helicopter was currently parked on the yacht’s helipad — the moment it was gone, Rodrick would know what that meant. And if for some reason he didn’t, the flight captain would surely inform him.\nSatisfied, Liam set the phone aside and finally began eating.\nThe food was good — simple, fresh, perfectly cooked — but it was the anticipation thrumming quietly in his chest that gave the morning its flavor.\nToday was going to be a good day.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet",

      "content": "Chapter 46: Ignorance Is Bliss\nAfter Liam finished the last bite of breakfast, he set his fork down neatly on the plate.\nEvelyn stepped forward as though ready to ask if he wanted anything else, but he simply gave her a polite nod before walking toward the front door.\nWaiting by the door was Mason, the head of his security detail. The man’s presence was solid, almost military-like, with his shoulders squared, eyes sharp, suit pressed without a wrinkle.\nWhile Liam had been eating, he’d taken a call from Captain Harris, the helicopter pilot. Harris’s tone had been crisp and professional, informing him that the Sikorsky was already on standby at the Granworth Executive Tower — the closest helipad in the city where private choppers were permitted to land.\nThe moment he hung up, Liam had called Mason over.\n\"Ready the Ghost,\" he’d said simply. \"We’re taking it out.\"\nNow, it was time to leave.\nMason fell into step a pace behind as Liam crossed the marble-floored foyer. Outside, the waiting Rolls-Royce Ghost Black Badge gleamed under the morning light, its polished obsidian paint and dark chrome accents looking more like a statement than a car.\nThe driver—the second security guard—was already at the wheel.\nMason open the rear door for Liam and he slid into the backseat, while he took the passenger seat up front.\nThe Ghost’s interior was a cocoon of deep leather and rich carbon fiber trim, the faint scent of cedarwood from the custom detailing still lingering.\n\"Granworth,\" Liam said, settling back.\n\"Yes, sir,\" the driver replied smoothly, guiding the car out of the mansion’s long driveway and onto the main road.\nAs the scenery slipped by, Liam let his thoughts drift to the day ahead. The chopper ride would be quick — just enough time to take in the skyline before sweeping out toward the marina. But it was the yacht trip that had him genuinely looking forward to the hours ahead.\nThe Mia hadn’t left her berth since he’d acquired her. Today, she’d finally sail under his command.\nHe wasn’t going alone, of course. Stacy, Kristopher, and a few others would be there. A small group, intimate enough to keep things comfortable, but with enough energy to make the day lively.\nThat was the surface plan. The fun part.\nBeneath it was a quieter intention — the debut of Winter’s Heart.\nHe hadn’t taken the Fabergé egg out of his inventory yet, not since the system had gifted it to him. And he had no intention of revealing it casually. But the yacht trip presented a perfect stage: a relaxed luxury environment, the right kind of audience, and a chance to lean into the identity others had already imagined for him.\nHe didn’t particularly like the fact that people assumed he came from some deep-rooted, old-money family. In the long term, he wanted his name to stand on his own merit. But for now? Let them think what they wanted. That misunderstanding could be useful.\nAnd he couldn’t shake the feeling that the system was feeding into it on purpose. The consecutive JP Morgan share rewards, the priceless artifacts, the heritage watch this morning... all of it pushed him toward a certain image.\nWhy? He didn’t know.\nHe couldn’t help but wonder who or what is the system exactly. But he could wonder about it endlessly, but the truth was, he wasn’t that curious.\nThe old saying fit here: ignorance is bliss. Sometimes, not knowing was the safest choice.\nStill, Winter’s Heart had another layer to it beyond its prestige — the hidden key inside.\nBut that was something he wouldn’t be showing anyone. The key was far too valuable to be paraded around in front of others. What he would do was examine it privately later, to see if he could extract more information.\nThe location of the safe deposit box it unlocked. Maybe even a hint at its contents.\nThat thought about the key made him pause, as he got curious about something.\nSystem, can I put items back into the inventory after I’ve taken them out? And what about other objects — ones that didn’t originally come from you?\n[Yes, Host. Any inanimate object can be stored in the inventory.]\nWhat about the size limit?\n[The inventory is unlimited in capacity and size. The only restriction is that the object must be physically lifted from the ground before storage — in your possession, not fixed in place.]\nLiam nodded slightly. That worked perfectly. He could display the Fabergé egg in the mansion later for effect—to show off, but keep the key safe inside the inventory where no one could touch it.\nWith that settled, he let the question go and focused on the passing scenery.\nThe Ghost’s ride was smooth, its suspension eating up the imperfections in the road. Outside, the city’s heart began to rise around them, glass towers catching the sunlight, the hum of traffic growing denser.\nFifteen minutes later, the car dipped into the private ramp that led into the Granworth Executive Tower’s VIP garage.\nHere, the air was cooler and the sound of the city muted to a distant hum. The walls gleamed in polished steel and soft lighting.\nThe driver brought the Ghost to a slow stop beside the elevator access. Mason stepped out first, coming around to open Liam’s door.The source of this content ɪs No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nLiam emerged, smoothing the front of his blazer, his platinum watch catching the light in a glint.\nMason and the second security guard, Nick, matched his pace as they walked toward the far end of the garage, where a uniformed security guard waited by a heavy, card-access door.\nThe guard straightened instantly, swiping them through without a word. Beyond was a private elevator, its walls clad in dark walnut and brushed brass.\nThe ride to the rooftop was quick but silent. Liam kept his hands in his pockets, his gaze fixed on the numbers ticking upward. Mason and Nick stood just behind him, still and alert.\nWith a quiet chime, the elevator doors slid open.\nA short, enclosed hallway stretched ahead, lined with wide windows offering sweeping glimpses of the skyline. The air here was fresher, touched with the faint tang of aviation fuel and open air.\nAt the end of the hall, double doors led directly out onto the rooftop helipad.\nLiam stepped through, the morning sunlight washing over him.\nAnd there it was — the Sikorsky S-92, gleaming in deep navy and silver, its rotors idling in a slow, deliberate spin. The chopper’s presence was imposing but elegant.\nCaptain Harris stood beside it in a tailored flight suit, his helmet tucked under one arm. He spotted Liam and strode forward, offering a respectful nod.\n\"Good morning, Mr. Liam. She’s ready for departure.\"\nLiam’s gaze swept over the helicopter, taking in the polished glass and the aerodynamic lines.\nHe smiled faintly, adjusting his cuff.\n\"Let’s go.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 47: Luxury Super Yacht–Mia\nThe Sikorsky’s cabin was a cocoon of muted luxury — dark leather seats stitched with subtle contrast, brushed metal fittings gleaming faintly under the overhead lights.\nLiam eased into his seat by the window, resting an elbow lightly on the armrest. Mason and Nick took the seats opposite, their postures straight, their eyes sweeping the tarmac even though they were already airborne in spirit.\nThe faint thrum of the rotors overhead deepened as Captain Harris’ voice came through the intercom.\n\"Mr. Liam, we’re clear for takeoff.\"\n\"Go ahead,\" Liam replied, his voice calm but edged with anticipation.\nThe low hum shifted into a powerful vibration that ran through the cabin floor as the Sikorsky lifted off.\nOutside, the rooftop helipad fell away, replaced by the sprawling patchwork of Los Angeles glinting in the morning sun. The helicopter banked gracefully, the city unfolding beneath them like a map brought to life.\nFrom this height, the movement below looked almost surreal — cars like slow-moving beetles on sunlit ribbons of asphalt, palm trees casting long shadows over neatly aligned streets. The air shimmered faintly over the concrete and glass, the light catching on high-rise windows in brief, blinding flashes.\nLiam let his gaze drift over the city he’d only recently begun to truly know. The ocean lay ahead, a thin line of shifting silver on the horizon, widening with every passing second. He wasn’t just another passenger heading toward the coast — today, he was arriving on his own terms, on his own yacht.\nThe flight was short enough that every moment felt precious. He found himself leaning a little closer to the glass, watching as the city’s edge gave way to open stretches of beach, then to marinas dotted with white specks that grew into recognizable vessels.\nWhen Marina del Rey came into view, the change in scenery was striking — dozens of yachts moored in neat rows, the water in the harbor calm and glassy under the morning light. But even among them, one vessel stood out instantly.\nThe Mia.\nFrom above, she was a sleek stretch of brilliance — a modern superyacht with sharp, elegant lines, her polished white hull catching the sunlight, accented by sweeping bands of tinted glass.\nAnd as if timed for effect, Liam spotted movement at the dock.\nStacy’s car had just rolled up, followed by two others in her group. He could see them stepping out, laughter visible in their body language even from this height. The moment they caught sight of the yacht, the shift was clear — their gestures slowed, their heads tilted back, and even from a distance, Liam could imagine the hushed exclamations passing between them.\nHe smiled when he thought of this.\nThe chopper banked slightly, aligning for its final approach. The rotors’ steady thump grew louder as the yacht’s helipad came into focus — a pristine circular landing zone at the aft, with crew members already in position to guide them in.\nThe descent was smooth, the Sikorsky settling onto the helipad with a faint bounce before the rotors began to slow.\nThe moment the skids kissed the surface, Mason and Nick were already moving. They stepped out first, the salty tang of the ocean air rushing in, then turned to open Liam’s door.\nBoth stood guard, one on either side, as Liam descended with unhurried steps. The sun caught the platinum of his watch, the cream of his blazer, the clean lines of his perfectly tailored trousers.\nHe paused for a moment, letting the scent of the ocean fill his lungs. There was something different about sea air — fresher, sharper, carrying with it the faint cry of gulls overhead and the low, rhythmic lap of water against the hull.\nHis gaze swept the deck briefly before drifting to the dock, where Stacy’s group was still taking in the sight of the Mia. They’d stopped just shy of the gangway, as if giving themselves time to process what they were looking at.\nHe raised a hand and gave a casual wave, the kind that carried an unspoken\ncome on\n,\nit’s yours to see\n. Then he gestured toward the gangway, and they began to make their way up.\nEven at a distance, Liam caught the quick glances they exchanged, the way their pace was leisurely — not out of hesitation, but in that instinctive way people stretched out a moment they wanted to savor.\nWhen they finally stepped aboard, Liam was there to meet them.\n\"Welcome aboard,\" he said with a relaxed smile, his tone warm without losing the confidence that came so easily now.\n\"Holy... Liam, this is yours?\" Kristopher asked, his eyes darting from the polished teak decking to the sweeping lines of the yacht’s upper decks.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n\"Mm-hm,\" Liam replied simply, his smile deepening just enough to confirm without bragging.\nStacy’s gaze lingered on the yacht’s main lounge visible through the wide glass doors. \"I knew you were doing well... but this?\" She shook her head lightly, a half-smile playing at her lips.\n\"Come on,\" Liam said, motioning for them to follow. \"You’ll see for yourself.\"\nAs they walked, the subtle scent of fresh varnish and sea breeze followed them. Every step revealed more — the wide sundeck fitted with cushioned loungers, the shaded outdoor dining area with polished steel accents, the gleam of the jacuzzi nestled near the bow.\nThe crew moved with precision, their uniforms crisp, their presence professional but never intrusive. Every now and then, Liam caught Stacy’s friends stealing glances at them, perhaps wondering how many people it took to run something like this.\nHalfway through the tour, a tall, weathered man in a crisp navy uniform approached. His white cap was tucked neatly under his arm, and the lines around his eyes suggested years of open water and bright sun.\n\"Mr. Liam,\" he greeted with a firm but respectful tone. \"Rodrick, at your service.\"\n\"Captain,\" Liam said with a nod. \"Good to see you.\"\n\"Likewise, sir. She’s fully fueled and stocked. Where would you like to head today?\"\nLiam took a moment, glancing out toward the horizon where the sunlight danced over the rippling blue. \"Somewhere open. Away from the marina’s traffic. We’ll anchor for a while once we’ve got space.\"\nRodrick nodded once, efficient and sure. \"Aye, sir. We’ll make ready.\"\nWith that, he stepped away, issuing low, precise orders to his crew. Lines were checked, systems run, and the gentle hum of the yacht’s engines soon replaced the stillness.\nAs they moved toward departure, Liam let his guests linger on the aft deck. From here, they could see the marina slowly slipping behind them, other yachts shrinking into the distance as the Mia eased into the open water.\nThe further they went, the brighter the sea seemed, the swell rising and falling under the hull with a rhythm that was almost hypnotic.\nLiam stayed near the rail, one hand resting lightly on the polished steel, his eyes on the horizon. The morning sun was warm on his skin, the wind teasing through his hair. Behind him, laughter and conversation from his guests blended with the faint rush of water being cleaved aside.\nAnd somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew this was exactly the kind of moment the system seemed to be shaping for him — an image burned into the minds of everyone here: Liam Scott, young, at ease on the deck of a vessel most people would only ever see in magazines.\nIt was an image worth cultivating.",

      "content": "Chapter 48: Shocked\nThe main saloon of the Mia was the kind of space that could silence even the most jaded traveler.\nWide, floor-to-ceiling windows wrapped the room in a panorama of glittering ocean, the glass so clear it almost disappeared.\nPolished teak floors gleamed underfoot, softened by thick Persian rugs in muted navy and cream. Plush, deep-cushioned sofas in pale leather formed an inviting ring around a low, glossy table of inlaid walnut.\nOverhead, the ceiling was a subtle curve of cream lacquer and brushed steel, dotted with warm recessed lighting that made the gold fixtures gleam just enough to whisper money without shouting it.\nAnd right now, Liam and his guests were settled into that luxury, waiting for the first wave of dishes to arrive from the galley.\nIt had been maybe fifteen minutes since they’d stepped aboard, and most of that time had been spent touring the yacht from stern to bow.\nThey’d moved through the sundeck, the jacuzzi, the observation lounge, the gym, the private cinema, the guest suites, and the master suite that had made even Elise stop walking for a full second before forcing herself to keep pace.\nThe result of that tour?\nThe expressions around him said it all.\nA few of them were trying to play it cool, leaning back into the sofas as if they were used to this sort of thing — but their eyes gave them away.\nThey kept drifting, taking in the clean lines of the interior, the art on the walls, the faint shimmer of handwoven silk in the curtains. They weren’t just seeing a yacht. They were calculating the scale of the thing.\nThese weren’t kids who’d never seen money. They came from the kind of families whose names carried weight in certain circles — the old families of Los Angeles, Silicon Valley, and beyond. For them, \"expensive\" was normal.\nBut there were rules in their worlds.\nSure, they could spend a few thousand, maybe tens of thousands, on a weekend without raising eyebrows. Designer clothes, luxury dining, small gatherings in private clubs — fine.\nA $500,000 sports car for a graduation gift? Acceptable. A one-million-dollar classic? Still tolerable, though parents would raise a brow.\nBut beyond that? That was where the invisible leash tightened. Everything was monitored. Every purchase scrutinized, not out of stinginess, but because their families understood the optics — money had to be managed, not flaunted without purpose.\nAnd then there was Liam.\nLiam, who had dropped over seventy million dollars on Bellemere Mansion without blinking. Liam, who had bought a Sikorsky helicopter worth more than twenty million as casually as one of them might buy a pair of sneakers. Liam, who was now sitting in the main saloon of a yacht that could easily have cost hundreds of millions, wearing a platinum Patek Philippe.\nThe gap wasn’t just in wealth — it was in freedom.\nThey all knew the kids from the Rothschilds, the Saudis, and a few other ultra-elite families—though they haven’t really met some of them. But even those heirs lived under the watchful eyes of dynasties older than countries, their spending had to be approved and curated.\nLiam felt... different. Untethered.\nAnd that difference was making them rethink what kind of person could casually own what he owned. What kind of family would hand their eighteen-year-old son this kind of unrestrained spending power?\nNo one at the table could answer that question. And the mystery only made it worse — or better, depending on how you looked at it.\nLiam could read it in their body language. The way Kristopher kept glancing toward the windows as if measuring the yacht’s width. The way Matt traced the curve of his wine glass with a fingertip, his gaze flicking between him and the gold-rimmed plates set before them.\nHe let them have their thoughts. He knew that silence could be just as powerful as speaking. But as the host, he also knew it was time to draw them back from their quiet calculations.\nLiam leaned forward slightly and said with a calm voice, \"I’m glad you all made it today. I know everyone’s schedules are packed, so thanks for making the time.\"\nHearing what he said, they all looked at him with polite smiles and genuine warmth.\n\"I hope you’ll enjoy yourselves,\" he added, his tone effortlessly warm but threaded with quiet confidence. \"The Mia’s fully stocked, so if there’s anything you want, just ask. This is your space as much as mine today.\"\nThat earned him a ripple of smiles, even a faint chuckle from Kristopher.\n\"Generous host, you’re making it hard for the rest of us to invite people anywhere after this,\" Matt said with a smile.\n\"I’ll take that as a compliment,\" Liam replied, smiling.\nHe really love interacting with Stacy and her friends as they are very honest with their emotions, and words.\n\"But seriously, I must say that I was quite surprised when you told us in the group that you bought a new yacht and want to take it out to sea,\" Kristopher said, with an astounded look on his face.\n\"You were not the only one. I actually thought that it was going to be a small yacht or medium size at best. But I really didn’t expect it to be a super yacht!\" Harper said, as he looked around the main saloon.\nIt was as if he was trying to imprint everything into his mind.\n\"Ummm.... Liam, I hope you don’t mind us asking but how much...?\" Kristie said, with look of anticipation, \"We can already guess the price but I just want to confirm.\"\n\"300,\" Liam replied.\nA brief silence enveloped the main saloon as everyone processed the ridiculous figure that Liam just casually said.\n\"$300m... Three hundred million dollars...\" Lana said slowly with a weak voice.\nNot just she but they all were repeating the number in their heads. They tried to just gloss over it but no matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t.\nIt was simply impossible.\n\"I’m sorry if I’m being rude here but I just want to confirm one detail if you will let me. It fine if you can’t answer,\" Kristopher said with a shocked and pleading expression on his face.\n\"Sure. Go ahead,\" Liam said, giving him permission to ask whatever question he wants to ask.\n\"This yacht... It’s your personally, right?,\" Kristopher asked, \"Like it’s not owned collectively by your family.\"\nHe added the last part to make sure he make sure he conveyed his question accurately. He wasn’t trying to be rude but really the shock he was feeling right now is...\nTo Kristopher’s question, Liam simply nodded.\n\"Holy sh*ttt!!!\" Kristopher mumbled, as he collapsed back.\nEven before asking the question,he already knew the answer. Liam had said it in the group that he bought a yacht. But still, that didn’t do anything to lessen the shock he was feeling at the moment.\n\"At this point, I really have nothing to say but after today, I’m increasing my shock threshold,\" Harper said, with a forced smile on his face.\n\"Wow! Congratulations, Liam,\" Stacy said with a genuine smile.\nShe had been mostly quiet since, not really saying much as she also tried to process everything.\nIn a way, this was especially more shocking for her because Liam was a former classmate of hers.\nYes, she had investigated and confirm that Liam had told her. He really did go to the same middle school and high school with her, and they were also in the same class.\nIt took the group a few more moments but they got their emotions under control. But that didn’t mean that they will be forgetting any of this anytime soon.\nThe next moment, the polished double doors at the far end of the saloon swung open, and two crew members stepped in, carrying silver trays that gleamed under the soft lighting. The faint aroma of fresh seafood, grilled vegetables, and warm bread rolled into the room, subtle but mouthwatering.\nFood was ready and it was time for them to eat.\nTʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NovᴇlFirenᴇt",

      "content": "Chapter 49: A Wonderful Day With Friends\nThe last of the plates were being cleared away when Matt leaned back with a contented sigh, rubbing his stomach like a man who had just experienced something rare.\n\"The food was amazing. I enjoyed it very much,\" he said, his grin relaxed and genuine.\n\"The chef really did a wonderful job,\" Kristopher added, nodding toward the doorway where the galley crew had disappeared.\n\"Yeah, but Liam’s cooking still takes the top spot for me,\" Kristie said with a smirk, tipping her head in his direction.\n\"That was never a debate,\" Elise chimed in, her lips curving upward in agreement.\nLiam chuckled at that, a warm, easy sound. \"I’m glad everyone enjoyed the food,\" he said. And he meant it. Cooking wasn’t just a skill to him anymore—it was an art he could wield effortlessly thanks to the system. But knowing the effect it had on people never got old.\nWith lunch over, the group’s energy shifted naturally toward the next part of the day. \"So,\" Kristopher said, glancing toward the glass doors that led to the deck, \"how about the pool?\"\nThat sparked immediate agreement. The girls decided to take a swim in the Mia’s turquoise-blue infinity pool, while the guys, on the other hand, were itching to dive into the open sea.\nThe moment the decision was made, they split off. The girls disappeared inside to change into their swimsuits, laughter trailing behind them. The guys took the quicker route—heading straight up to the pool deck, peeling off their shirts and trousers, and tossing them onto the nearest recliners.\nFrom the edge of the deck, the view was perfect. The Mia was anchored in crystal-clear water that shifted between shades of turquoise and deep sapphire, the surface sparkling under the afternoon sun.\nThe marina was a distant memory now—out here, there was only sky, sea, and the gentle roll of the yacht.\nWith whoops and splashes, the guys leapt into the ocean, the sound echoing faintly against the hull.\nLiam stayed where he was, slipping off only his shoes and socks before lowering himself onto the deck beside the pool. He let his legs dangle into the cool water, feeling the soft tug of the current against his skin.The source of this content ɪs NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nThe truth was, he couldn’t swim.\nIt wasn’t a crippling confession—it just wasn’t something he’d ever learned. And while he could chalk it up to lack of opportunity growing up, there was more to it than that.\nHe had a very mild case of thalassophobia. Not enough to freeze him in place or send him into panic at the sight of deep water, but enough that the idea of being surrounded by endless, unknowable depths unsettled him. And layered over that was something stranger: melanoheliophobia—the fear of black holes.\nIt sounded absurd, even to him. But ever since he was a kid, the thought of those cosmic voids, devouring light and time itself, had been enough to make his stomach twist.\nSpaghettification...\nCombine that with the sight of dark water stretching to the horizon, and... well, swimming in the open sea had never been high on his to-do list.\nHe gave a small, wry smile to himself and shook the thought away. No point in ruining the mood.\n\"Liam!\" Matt’s voice called out across the water. \"Come on, man—jump in!\"\nLiam waved him off with a grin. \"I’m good here.\"\nMatt wasn’t convinced. \"You’re missing out!\"\n\"I’m fine,\" Liam repeated, his tone friendly but final.\nMatt narrowed his eyes, curiosity creeping into his expression. Then, a slow, teasing smile spread across his face. \"Wait a second... you can’t swim, can you?\"\nLiam sighed. \"Nope.\"\nThere was a beat of silence, and then—\nThe guys erupted into laughter. Not cruel, not mocking—just the kind of surprised, good-natured amusement that came when someone you thought could do everything revealed a gap in their skills.\nBefore the teasing could escalate, the sound of the saloon doors opening drew their attention. The girls emerged in swimsuits, sunglasses perched on their noses, the scent of sunscreen drifting faintly in the breeze.\nThey approached, their steps slowing when they noticed the guys still laughing.\n\"What’s so funny?\" Elise asked, adjusting her towel over one shoulder.\nHarper grinned and answered without hesitation. \"Liam can’t swim.\"\nThe girls’ eyebrows rose almost in unison.\n\"You can’t swim?\" Lana asked, her voice softer than expected, almost curious.\nLiam nodded, unbothered. \"Nope.\"\nKristie tilted her head, then smiled. \"Well, then you should get in the pool and I’ll teach you.\"\nHe shook his head. \"Maybe another time. Today, I’m just here to relax.\"\nThey didn’t push him. The girls simply slipped into the pool, the water rippling gently around them as they swam to the far side.\nThe afternoon drifted by in an easy rhythm. The girls floated, chatted, and took pictures in the pool, the sunlight glinting off the water and catching in their hair. The guys alternated between diving into the sea and lounging on the deck chairs, letting the salt dry on their skin.\nEvery now and then, Liam caught one of them glancing his way—maybe still a little surprised that he wasn’t the type to dive in headfirst. He didn’t mind. It gave them something to hold over him, and honestly, that was fine.\nBy late afternoon, the light began to soften, turning the water a deeper shade of blue. The sun dipped lower, painting the horizon with streaks of orange and gold. It was the kind of view that made you pause without meaning to.\nCaptain Rodrick appeared on the deck. \"Mr. Liam, we’ll need to start heading back if we want to dock before full dark.\"\nLiam nodded. \"Let’s head in.\"\nThe call to return set everyone in motion. The girls climbed out of the pool, wrapping themselves in towels. The guys made one last dive before hauling themselves back aboard, shaking their hair like wet dogs.\nThey moved inside to change, laughter and snippets of conversation bouncing off the walls. By the time they regrouped on the aft deck, the Mia was already cutting smoothly through the water toward Marina del Rey.\nThe city lights began to flicker into view as the yacht glided closer to shore. The marina itself was alive with motion—sails being furled, ropes secured, the low hum of engines carrying across the water.\nWhen the Mia finally docked, the group lingered a moment longer, reluctant to let the day end.\n\"Thanks for hosting, Liam,\" Kristopher said, clapping him lightly on the shoulder.\n\"Yeah,\" Lana added with a smile. \"This was... unforgettable.\"\nOne by one, they thanked him before stepping onto the dock, their voices carrying back in warm echoes.\nLiam watched them go, with a bright smile on his face. He really had a wonderful day with them and he would love to experience more days like this.\nHe turned toward the helipad, where the Sikorsky was already waiting, rotors turning lazily in the evening air. Mason and Nick fell into step behind him.\nAs he climbed aboard, the scent of saltwater still clinging to his blazer, Liam glanced back once at the yacht—her decks glowing softly in the dusk, against the restless marina.\nThen the helicopter lifted off, carrying him away into the deepening night.",

      "content": "Chapter 50: Winter Heart\nThe helicopter ride back to Granworth Executive Tower was short, but Liam enjoyed every second of it.\nThe city stretched below like a sea of jewels scattered over black velvet, streetlamps burning gold in neat lines while the glass towers shimmered faintly in the distance.\nThe faint vibration of the Sikorsky’s cabin was oddly soothing coupled with the sensation of the soft leather seat cradling him.\nMason and Nick sat across from him, ever alert, but even they seemed slightly more at ease after the day’s events.\nLiam couldn’t help the smile that lingered on his lips. Today had been... good. More than good, actually.\nIt had been the most fun he’d had in a very long time.\nThe helicopter smoothly touched down on the rooftop helipad. Captain Harris shut down the rotors, the deep thrum fading into the night air.\nLiam unbuckled and stood, offering the pilot a nod of thanks before stepping out into the cool breeze.\nThe rooftop elevator was waiting, its brushed metal doors sliding open with a soft hiss and they got in. The descent to the garage was quiet.\nWhen the doors opened, they stepped out into the garage and walked to the Rolls Royce. Nick got into the driver’s seat and Mason stepped forward, holding the rear door open for Liam.\nLiam smiled as the interior swallowed him in instant comfort as the door closed with a muted, satisfying thump, shutting out the rest of the world.\nWithout being told, Nick started the car and eased it out of the garage, and onto the streets of Beverly Hills.\nThe city at night was a different creature than during the day. Under the warm glow of streetlamps, the manicured avenues of Beverly Hills looked almost unreal.\nPalms lined the streets like silent sentinels, their fronds swaying gently in the evening breeze.\nHere and there, a sleek supercar purred past, its polished body catching flashes of light as it slid into the distance.\nIt had been only a few days since Liam had moved into Bellemere Mansion, but he was still adjusting to the reality of living in the Platinum Triangle.\nAs the Ghost glided silently along the smooth streets, Liam caught glimpses of stately gates, hedges trimmed with precision, and sprawling homes hidden behind them.\nEach property seemed to have its own gravitational pull. They were the kind of estates you couldn’t just walk past without wondering who lived there.\nHe smiled faintly and shook his head, leaning back into the plush seat. No point getting lost in those thoughts tonight. He should just enjoy the ride.\nThe ride didn’t take long. The Ghost turned onto his street and the mansion’s gates came into view. As they approached, the gates swung open smoothly.\nThe long driveway stretched ahead, flanked by immaculate lawns and soft uplighting that cast the trees in golden relief. The Ghost rolled to a gentle stop before the front steps.\nMason stepped out first, coming around to open Liam’s door. Liam thanked him as he got out, the night air cool against his skin. Mason moved ahead to open the front door for him while the Nick guided the Rolls toward the garage.\nStepping through the front door, into the mansion, Liam felt it instantly — that deep, subtle calm that only came from stepping into his own home after a long day.\nHe turned and he saw that Evelyn was already there, with her posture impeccable.\n\"Welcome home, sir,\" she said warmly. \"Would you like dinner?\"\n\"I will,\" Liam replied with a nod. \"But I’ll have my bath first.\"\n\"Of course,\" she said with a faint smile, stepping aside.\nUpstairs, Liam made his way to the master suite. He walked into his bedroom and without lingering, he headed straight for the bathroom.\nThe hot water was quick to wash away the salt and a refreshing feeling washed over him. When he stepped out, dressed in loose, comfortable clothes, he felt refreshed.\nHe walked to the bed and sat down, sinking into it. With the smile not leaving his face, he summoned the Winter’s Heart from his inventory.\nIn an instant, the weight settled into his hands as a large white egg mounted on an ornate platinum stand appeared in his hand.\n\"Wow... It’s even more beautiful in person,\" he muttered in slight shock.\nHe had chosen not to bring it out on the yacht. Not because it wasn’t impressive, but because after seeing their reactions to the Mia, he didn’t see the need.\nThe Fabergé egg would have turned the day into something else entirely and he wasn’t aiming to look like he was showing off.\nBut now that he was alone in his room, there was no reason to hold back.\nLiam examined the exterior of Winter Heart and he was left feeling very speechless.\nThe exterior was breathtaking. A solid platinum shell, hand-chased with frost-like patterns so intricate they seemed almost alive, like real ice crystals spreading across glass.\nThose patterns were overlaid with translucent white guilloché enamel, giving them depth — as if you could look straight into the heart of frozen glass.Follow current novels on N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nAlong the frost edges, the 2,400 flawless white diamonds sparkled like snow under sunlight, each one perfectly set to catch the light in a hundred tiny bursts.\nAt the crown and base sat two pear-shaped blue diamonds, each an exact twin of the other in hue, cut, and clarity — a perfect match, both weighing fifteen carats.\nBetween them, at the crown’s center, was a platinum snowflake motif, and at its heart, a three-carat ruby of the deepest red.\nLiam smiled and pressed the ruby.\nWith a soft click, the platinum shell parted in four symmetrical petals, unfolding like a blooming ice flower.\nInside, the inner surface was lined with ultra-thin rock crystal, engraved with micro-etched snowflake designs invisible to the naked eye — but Liam’s enhanced vision caught them instantly, every line as sharp as if it had been cut moments ago.\nAt the center rose a miniature mechanical cityscape of Saint Petersburg in winter. Platinum rooftops were dusted with white enamel \"snow,\" and a river of blue sapphires ran through it, dotted with mother-of-pearl ice sheets — the Neva River brought to life in gemstones.\nIn the city’s heart stood a platinum tree, its branches tipped with diamonds, and from its highest bough hung a flawless seventeen-carat blue diamond — the Winter Star.\nLiam remembered that the cityscape has a music-box mechanism and his smile widened as he turned the discreet platinum key at the base, to activate the mechanism.\nImmediately, a melody—Nocturne of the Winter Star— began to play. It’s a custom waltz, composed exclusively for this piece by Fabergé’s modern master craftsmen.\nAs the music swelled, the platinum tree began to rotate slowly, its branches catching the light in a shifting dance. The effect was hypnotic — a perfect blend of craftsmanship, artistry, and engineering.\nSeeing this, he felt that it confirmed his thought that the system’s $40 million valuation was absurdly low. Between the stones, the artistry, and the sheer uniqueness, this was worth far more.\nI wonder what criterias the system used for its evaluation. It should really be worth more than $40m.\nLiam listened to the note, enjoying it and when the last notes faded, he turned the key again but this time, in a precise sequence only he knew. There was a faint click, and the tree stopped turning.\nHe carefully lifted the miniature cityscape from its mount. Beneath it, nestled in a hidden compartment, was a small, unmarked key.\nThe key to the safe deposit box.\nHe held it between his fingers and immediately—just as he had hoped—a line of information flowed into his head.\nRothschild Private Vault, Geneva, Switzerland",

      "content": "Chapter 51: Anticipation\nRothschild Private Vault, Geneva, Switzerland.\nThat was the only thing the key gave him. No number, no code, no accompanying note — just the name and location, stamped into his mind.\nBut it was enough.\nMore than enough actually.\nThe name alone carried weight. Liam might not know the full history of the Rothschild Private Vault, but he didn’t need a dossier to understand its significance.\nIf a place carried that name, then whatever was kept inside wasn’t ordinary — and whoever used it didn’t deal in the ordinary.\nIt also made him even more curious about what the content would be.\nA slow breath escaped him as he adjusted slightly and leaned back against the headboard, twirling the key turning lightly between his fingers.\nLiam sighed and closed his eyes briefly. He had gotten what he wanted from the key but the real prize, though, was still locked away across an ocean.\nWhich meant only one thing.\nHe has to make a trip.\nA private vault in Switzerland wasn’t the kind of place you accessed with a phone call. You have to show up in person, and even then, only after navigating layers of protocol most people would never dream of, would he be allowed to access the safe deposit box.\nThe idea of standing in that vault, holding whatever the system had stashed away for him, stirred a sharp spark of anticipation in his chest.\nHe could almost see himself standing in a cold, polished marble floors, quiet halls, a clerk whose eyes flickered with curiosity despite their best efforts to hide it. A private room. The sound of a heavy mechanism unlocking. And then... the reveal.\nHe couldn’t help but smile at his imagination. Though he was calm on the surface, he was very excited inside. Not just about the possible content of the box but also the trip. It would be his first trip ever.\nI will make the trip next week.\nHe’d make the trip after his second weekly sign-in. That way, he’d be prepared for whatever surprises came his way.\nBecause if the first weekly sign-in had taught him anything, it was that the system didn’t deal in mediocrity. That first reward had set a standard so high it felt like every future one would have to outdo itself. And the thought of seeing what the system had in store this time... it made his blood run warmer.\nHe could almost hear the sound of the notification already.\nLiam slid the key back into his inventory, the weight disappearing from his palm in an instant.\nCarefully, he reattached the miniature Saint Petersburg cityscape to its mount inside Winter’s Heart, each connection slotting back into place with a soft, precise click. The petals of platinum closed smoothly around it, the frost-patterned shell gleaming under the bedroom lights.\nHe set the egg back into his inventory, rose from the bed, and left the room.\nHis footsteps carried him down the grand staircase toward the dining room, where Evelyn and the two maids were already in place.\n\"Dinner is ready, sir,\" Evelyn said, her tone warm but precise.\nLiam took his seat at the head of the long dining table. The evening’s spread was simple but elegant as always — roasted duck breast with a red wine reduction, truffle-infused mashed potatoes, and crisp haricots verts. A basket of warm bread sat off to the side, the faintest wisp of steam curling from beneath the linen.\nLiam took his time to enjoy the meal. When he was done, he dabbed his mouth with a napkin and glanced toward Evelyn.\n\"That was excellent. Thank you.\"\nShe inclined her head slightly. \"I’ll let the kitchen know.\"\nWith that, Liam rose, leaving the table and went back to his room.\nHe wasn’t sleepy but he wasn’t exactly in the mood to do anything in particular. He didn’t feel like watching a movie or anything.\nDropping onto the bed, he let out a long sigh, as the mattress absorbed him, enveloping whom with comfort. He picked up his phone, the glow of the screen casting a pale light across his face.\nIt was past nine.The source of this content ɪs novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nBy now, Stacy and the others would have reached their respective homes. And if he knew anything about the kind of families they came from, the moment they walked in the door, they’d have been met with questions.\nAnd he was right.\n***\nAt Stacy’s parents house.\nShe had to come home today because her dad told her to. She had barely stepped through the door when her mother’s voice came from the living room.\n\"So? How was it?\"\nBefore she could even drop her bag, her father’s head appeared from around the corner, brows lifted. \"And don’t you dare say ’fine.’\"\nHer younger brother was already scrolling through her Instagram story on his phone, snorting. \"You didn’t tell us it was a super yacht.\"\nWithin seconds, the living room became a crossfire of questions. How big was it? How many crew members? Where did they sail? Was the helipad really part of it?\nAnd then the inevitable: how much?\nWhen she told them — three hundred million — the room went still. Her father blinked. Her mother’s mouth opened slightly, then closed.\n\"You’re sure you heard right?\" her mother asked.\n\"Yes, Mom.\"\nHer parents exchanged a look. It was that silent, wordless communication that only parents had mastered.\nHer father leaned back slowly. \"Three hundred million... on a yacht.\"\n***\nIt wasn’t just Stacy. Across the city, Kristopher, Harper, Lana, Elise, Matt, and Kristie were each having the same experience — walking into homes full of curiosity and leaving their parents in stunned silence.\nAt first, the older generation assumed exaggeration. Kids overstate things all the time. But then came the photos.\nFull-length shots of The Mia from the dock, her gleaming hull reflecting the sun. The sundeck with its infinity pool. The helipad, the private cinema, the master suite.\nThere was no denying it anymore.\nThe yacht further reinforced the narrative forming around Liam Scott — that he came from money so deep and old that even their own influential circles couldn’t quite place it.\nAnd that was the unsettling part.\nIf it had been tied to a known family name, they could file it away neatly in their mental map of power and influence. But the name Scott rang no bells. It wasn’t European aristocracy, it wasn’t Middle Eastern royalty, it wasn’t one of the entrenched American dynasties.\nWhich left a mystery.\nAn American boy, barely eighteen, with the kind of resources that made seasoned financiers pause. The Bellemere Mansion. And now, a $20 million helicopter and a $300 million superyacht.\nIf there was an explanation that made him ordinary, they couldn’t see it.\nAnd mysteries... begged to be solved.\n***\nBack in Bellemere Mansion, Liam lay on his bed, unaware of the quiet ripples spreading through his guests’ families — or perhaps simply unconcerned.\nFor him, the day was over and before long, the steady rhythm of his breathing filled the room, as he fell asleep.",

You received 0.02% of JP Morgan.]\n[You received +10 Attribute Points.]\n***\nHmmm... Not bad. Though the rewards aren’t as flashy as those of the past few days but it’s valuable.\nHe received 0.02% shares of JP Morgan again, making it six times in a row. He wasn’t actually surprised by it and he welcomed it.\nWho would say no to an additional asset value of $160m? Even a fool dares not refused. Especially when it’s free.\nThere’s also the attribute points he received. It has been a while since he received those. Actually, it hasn’t been a while because the last time he received them was the same day he went through the enhancement.\nAnd now that he thought about it, he felt that allocating those points before undergoing the enhancement, actually helped him.\nI wonder if I will receive attribute points from tomorrow’s weekly sign-in and how many?,\nLiam thought to himself.\nLiam was really looking forward to tomorrow. It will be his second weekly sign-in and he intends to start accumulating his sign-ins after that.\nBefore he fell off asleep last night, he thought about his plans to create a company and the amount he would need to purchase the molecular assembler.\nThe molecular assembler and the company are tied together. The company can’t exist without the molecular assembler because it’s only with it that Liam can build the techs products he want to release into the market.\nBut Liam doesn’t have any intention of creating the company if he doesn’t have the molecular assembler ready. If he does that, the company would become akin to a shell company. Or a hollow front.\nBut there’s another restriction that also stopping him from creating the company. It’s a self imposed restriction.\nHe wants to create the company under the trust that Daniel Conley is creating for him. Liam understand how advanced the tech products he wants to release into the market are. He understands that they will more than revolutionise the market and he will easily make billions in profit from the two products.\nBut this also means that he will attract a ton of attention and the big tech companies would want to acquire his company.\nRoom temperature quantum chips small enough to fit into of phones, laptops, gaming consoles, PCs and all other devices. There’s the one that will be targeted towards enterprises uses.\nJust this alone is enough for companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia. As long as it’s a tech related company, they will throw money at him in desperate attempt to acquire the company and the core technology. Even the government.\nBut Liam has no intention of selling. No matter how much they offer him. Even if it’s $100b. He won’t blink because with just the system and such technological prowess in his hands, money is never something to be concerned about.\nThis brings us back to his plan of creating the company under the trust. That way, his company will be a private company and the stakes will be split among the holding companies created under the same trust.\nHe has no idea of it’s a solid idea as he’s not very knowledgeable when it comes to things like finance and business, but he felt that his reasoning was right.\n\"Maybe I should discuss it more with Daniel later. This is something I need an expert’s advice on,\" Liam muttered, as he looked out the window, staring ahead at nothing in particular.\nI should allocate the attribute points now. No need keeping them for later.\nStatus.\n[Host: Liam Scott]\n[Age: 18]\n[System Level: 2]\n[Strength: 27]\n[Agility: 25]\n[Stamina: 28]\n[Constitution: 22]\n[Attribute Points: 0»»10]\n[System Points: 1,000»»0]\n[Skills: Pro-level Vehicular Operation, World-Class Etiquette, World-Class Culinary Arts, Formless Combat Doctrine, Perfect Memory]\n[Inventory: Bellemere Mansion property documents, Aston Martin Vantage GT3 key fob, Ferrari SF90 Stradale key fob, Winter Heart, 17.6-carat Blue Diamond, key.]\n[System Function(s): Sign-in, System Store]\n***\nMy strength has increased so much but I haven’t had a chance to test it out and it just keeps growing. I’ve already surpassed the human body’s limit thanks to the enhancement, which means I may or may not be the strongest person in the world right now.\nLiam sighed heavily at his predicament. He felt that his current situation was what people refer to as suffering from success.\nHe let out another sigh as he decided not to think about it anymore, as he started allocating the attribute points.\nHe allocated 1 point to Strength, 3 to Agility but he skipped Stamina, and focused on his Constitution. He plans to even out the stat and he still has 6 more points left.\nBut when he tried to allocate the points to his Constitution, he didn’t lit up like the others.\nUsually when he wants to allocate points to his attribute, they lit up but the Constitution attribute was grayed out.\nLiam tried it again but it was still the same result.\nCan’t I increase it? The system said that it’s related to my body’s vitality, resistance and lifespan...\nI see\n, Liam nodded slowly in realisation.\nSince it’s related to lifespan, then it’s not something that can be increased that causally. But if that is so, then why the system put it in form of attribute and made me think that I can increase it?\nLiam didn’t want to burden himself with the questions and he directly asked the system.\n\"System, I can’t increase my constitution?\"\n[Yes, host. You can’t.]\n\"Then why make it look like I can increase it? If your intention is to show me my lifespan, then just create a lifespan section and remove the constitution. It doesn’t look appropriate where it is,\" he said.\n[You’re correct, host.]\nImmediately, Liam saw the Constitution attribute box erased from his status screen and a new box titled Lifespan appeared under his Age box.\nLooks way better this way. Thank you, system.\n[It’s my pleasure to serve, host.]The most update n0vels are published on\nLiam smiled and allocated the remaining six attribute points, allocating two points to each attribute.\nJust as before, Liam felt that same wave of warm energy course through his body. It started somewhere from his chest area and spread all over his body and wherever the warm energy flow through, that place improves immediately.\nJust as always, it disappeared just as it had appeared but it left noticeable changes.\nLiam squeezed and clenched his fist, and he felt it packing a huge amount of raw strength. His body felt lighter than before and it was filled with more energy.\nAfter the allocation and the slight change made by the system, this was how his status screen looked:\n[Host: Liam Scott]\n[Age: 18]\n[Lifespan: 220 Years]\n[System Level: 2]\n[Strength: 27»»30]\n[Agility: 25»»30]\n[Stamina: 28»»30]\n[Attribute Points: 10»»0]\n[System Points: 00]\n[Skills: Pro-level Vehicular Operation, World-Class Etiquette, World-Class Culinary Arts, Formless Combat Doctrine, Perfect Memory]\n[Inventory: Bellemere Mansion property documents, Aston Martin Vantage GT3 key fob, Ferrari SF90 Stradale key fob, Winter Heart, 17.6-carat Blue Diamond, key.]\n[System Function(s): Sign-in, System Store]\n***\n220 years...\nLiam still feels strange seeing that. But he decided to not think too deep into it a it won’t change anything.\nInstead, he should busy himself with more important things.\nLiam smiled and got out of bed and walked to the bathroom to take his bath, and get ready for the day.",

      "content": "Chapter 53: Social Media Ghost King\nTime passed and the day went by for Liam, as he spent it at home. He watched movies, played games and chatted with Stacy, and the others.\nThe chat had become the day’s true entertainment.\nStacy, Lana, Kristie, and Elise were at the center of it, laughing as they shared screenshots of their Instagram stories blowing up.\nThe yacht photos and short clips — candid laughter by the pool, panoramic shots of the Mia cutting through the open water, close-ups of their faces against a sunlit backdrop — had spread across their feeds like wildfire.\nAnd the comments? Predictable, yet endlessly amusing.\nEnvy. Jealousy. Curiosity.\nPeople wanted to know who they were with, how they got access to such a yacht, whether the guy behind it was some heir, some prince, some ghost of a dynasty no one had heard of.\n\"Honestly, the DMs are insane right now,\" Lana typed, followed by a crying-laughing emoji.\nElise replied seconds later: \"Mine too. Some girl literally asked if I’d joined a secret society 💀.\"\nThe boys found it hilarious, chiming in between their own jokes, but it was the girls who carried most of the conversation.\nStacy sent another screenshot — a comment section blowing up with speculation.\nLiam read it all with smiles on his face. He didn’t mind the noise. If anything, it was amusing to watch how quickly people could spin themselves into knots over a few photos.\nBut then, mid-scroll, the conversation shifted.\n\"Liam,\" Kristie wrote suddenly, \"what’s your Insta handle? We can tag you in the posts.\"\nLiam paused. His thumbs hovered above the screen for a moment before he typed back: \"Don’t have one.\"\nThe group went silent for a beat. Then the replies poured in.\n\"WHAT?\"\n\"No way.\"\n\"You’re lying.\"\nBut he wasn’t.\nWhen they pressed him, he told them the truth. How he never got around to creating one.\nThe reason wasn’t because he didn’t want to but because life hadn’t allowed him the luxury.\nAfter his parents abandoned him, his days had been consumed with surviving, with working shifts until his body ached, with overthinking bills, debts, and the suffocating uncertainty of the next day. There had been no space for social media in that life. There was no time for late-night scrolling or mindless posting.\nIf anything, he admitted to himself, he thought that might have been one of the reasons why his past had felt so miserable. Humans needed outlets — ways to laugh, to share, to distract themselves from the crushing indifference of the world. Without that, life had been nothing but work and worry.\nThe girls naturally did what they do best as they immediately forced him into creating an account.\nIt took less than ten minutes. He picked a clean username, uploaded no profile picture, and followed no one. But the moment he sent the handle into the group, the flood began.\nOne by one, Stacy, Lana, Kristie, Elise, and the boys followed him. And because their pages had thousands — in some cases hundreds of thousands — of followers, the ripple effect was immediate.\nBy the evening, Liam’s brand-new account had crossed 100,000 followers.\nCurious strangers flooded in, desperate to know who this account belonged to. Why were these popular girls following him? Why did he have no posts, no bio, no hint of identity?\nSpeculation spread like fire. People began digging, trying to connect dots, but they found nothing. Liam Scott didn’t exist on the internet. At least, not in a way that could satisfy them.\nAnd while the world spun itself into curiosity, Liam set the phone aside and leaned back on the sofa, chuckling under his breath. He had no intention of posting and he had nothing to post.\n***\nThough the day was uneventful, it wasn’t wasted.\nIn the afternoon, he had called Daniel Conley.\nDaniel’s voice was calm, professional as always, but Liam could sense the man’s genuine interest as he explained some of his plan for the company and how he wanted the company structured under the trust for protection.\nHe only told him the things he wanted him to know. There was no need telling him about the type of techs he has planned or the molecular assembler. But he did tell him that the company will be a tech company.\nDaniel had listened without interruption, and when Liam finished, he offered quiet but firm approval.\n\"You’re thinking the right way, Liam. I can sense that you already have something incredible planned and if you’re to release it, acquisition attempts will be inevitable. And not polite ones. But if we build this correctly, not even the biggest corporations will be able to swallow you up.\"\nThe assurance had lifted a weight from Liam’s chest. He thanked Daniel, and Daniel promised to be ready the moment Liam decided to make his move.\nLiam asked him when the trust will be ready and Daniel told him it will take nearly a week more.\nLiam hung up the phone and a new thought began to gnaw at him.\nMoney.\nThe assembler cost $100 million. He had $27 million in liquid assets, which left him short by $73 million. The gap was large, but not insurmountable and he trusted the system to close it sooner rather than later.\nThe real issue was where to put the thing once he had it.\nHe couldn’t set it up in Bellemere Mansion. That was obvious.\nThe assembler wasn’t a toy. It was advanced, delicate and it requires staggering amounts of energy. Enough to make the local utility companies raise their eyebrows and start asking questions.\nHe couldn’t afford those questions. Which meant he needed a site.\nNot just any site, either. He needed something discreet, private, large enough to house not only the assembler but also the infrastructure around it — logistics, security, maybe even a cover front.\nHe leaned back in his sofa, tapping his fingers lightly against the armrest.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ\nIndustrial sites in Los Angeles were limited, and the ones worth owning weren’t exactly invisible. If he bought a factory outright, people would notice. But if he went too small, it would look suspicious when a supposedly \"empty\" building started pulling enough electricity to power a stadium.\nAnd then there was zoning, inspections, compliance — layers of bureaucracy that would slow him down.\nUnless...\nUnless he went through the trust.\nDaniel could set up shell companies, cover entities that purchased the site in layers deep enough that even the IRS would lose its way tracing them. If he positioned the factory under a subsidiary that looked like it belonged to an unremarkable logistics firm, no one would question it.\nBut that raised another question: should he build in Los Angeles at all?\nHe thought about it.\nL.A. had advantages — proximity, access to ports, connections. But it also had drawbacks: too many eyes, too much noise, too many people sniffing around.\nA remote location might be safer. Nevada, perhaps. Or somewhere along the California desert where land was cheap, power was abundant, and prying eyes were fewer.\nHe rubbed his chin, staring at the ceiling as ideas tumbled.\nFor the first time since acquiring the system, Liam felt the full weight of scaling. Owning supercars and yachts was one thing. But creating technology that would shake the entire world? That demanded foundations.\nAnd foundations required patience.\n***\nThe evening sun bled slowly across the sky, casting long golden shafts into the mansion’s living room. Liam stood by the window, hands in his pockets, eyes distant.\nOn the phone, Stacy’s messages pinged again. She was laughing at the chaos on Instagram, joking about how his silence was making people crazy and calling him the ghost king of Instagram.\nHe smiled and put his phone back in his pocket. Their curiosity was the least of hi problem at the moment. He has more important things to worry about.\nThe next moment, he heard Evelyn’s voice, bringing him out of his thoughts.\n\"Sir, dinner’s ready.\"\nLiam nodded and went to the dining table for dinner. After he was done, he went up to his room, retiring for the night.\nThe day has been long and fulfilling, and he was grateful to the people that made it fun for him.",

      "content": "Chapter 54: Second Weekly Sign-in\nThe next morning.\nThis was the day! The big day! The day of the second weekly sign-in!\nLiam was very excited. It was the same reason he woke up with a bright smile on his face.\nHe looked out the window with his mind filled with thoughts on today’s possible rewards.\nWould I get another property? More attribute points? How much in cash?\nThese questions and more swirled around in his head but he knew that the only way to find out was to sign-in.\nBut he didn’t do that. He doesn’t want to sign-in yet as he wants to take his bath first and changing into a new set of clothes.\nImmediately, he swung his legs down from the bed and walked to the bathroom. He took his time inside, allowing the water to run down every inch of his body.\nWhat was Liam doing exactly? Well, he trying to increase his luck. Call him stupid, superstitious, or whatever, he doesn’t mind.\nThe truth is that he just wants to follow the same pattern as last week. Maybe that way, he might increase his chances for receiving rewards even crazier than his first weekly sign-in.\nSome minutes later, Liam walked out of the bathroom and walked into the walk-in wardrobe. He put on a new set of clothes and walked back to the room.\nHe let out a lengthy sigh and with a smile, he sat down on the bed.\nLet’s do this.\nSystem, sign-in.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, on your second weekly sign-in.]\n[You received $50,000,000]\n[You received 1% shares of JP Morgan]\n[You received 0.5% shares of\n[You received a McLaren P1 LM-X]\n[You received+20 Attribute Points]\n[Note: The car is parked in the garage and its key is in the inventory]\n***\nWow...\nLiam was left speechless for a moment when he saw the rewards, but the alert notification of his phone quickly brought him out of his reverie.\nThese rewards are... They are... Amazing!!!\nJust the $50m was enough to make anyone understand just how crazy this weekly rewards are.\nHe remembered that the amount he received in cash reward from his first weekly sign-in was $5m. And he got 10x that today!\nYes, he had received cash rewards higher than $5m during the week, but the highest he ever received was $15m and the total amount he received during the week was $31m.\nLiam picked up his phone and tapped on the notification, and he saw his account balance.\n\"$77m...\"Liam muttered slowly.\nIt was a crazy amount. It was enough to buy another Bellemere Mansion or a mansion in the Platinum Triangle. It was an amount that goes beyond life changing.\nFuuu...\nLiam sighed slowly, gathering his thoughts and emotions.\nHe smiled from ear to ear as he took another look at the amount now sitting in his account, before turning his attention to the other rewards.\n1% shares of JP Morgan... Was this what the system was aiming at from the beginning,\nLiam thought to himself.\nOver the week, he had consecutively received 0.2% shares of JP Morgan for six days straight, accumulating to a total of 0.12% shares and valued at $1.6b.\nNow, plus this 1% shares which is valued at $16b, his shares has been brought up to 1.12% and with a total value of $17.6b!\nWow... This is... I don’t even know what to say...\nIf $77m wasn’t an amount that can taken casually. Then what about an asset with a value of $17.6b? It was an astronomical amount.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ\nIt was an amount that was enough to put him comfortably in the top 120 of the documented world’s richest people list.\nLiam felt a huge wave of gratitude towards the system. The value of the rewards wasn’t just in his monetary value but also in the leverage it would give him. It would help him to easier navigate his way when he starts launching his products.\nHe let out a deep breath as he looked at the third reward. 0.5% shares of the third most valuable company in the world.\nAnd as for the value of that amount of shares? $17.2b. Even without anything said, one can understand just how valuable it is.\nThe company is one of the most profitable companies in the world and one of the few companies with their market capitalisation going into trillions of dollars. And just 0.5% shares of it was already with so much.\n$17.6b plus $17.2b. That’s $34.8b... Wow... Just wow...The rewards really just keeps getting better.\n$34.8b. Liam was still trying to find the appropriate words, phrase or sentence he can use to describe how he was feeling at the moment.\nTo compare, the amount would easily earn him a place in the top 60 documented world’s richest people. That was a 50% jump from his previous position of 120, and a 97.7% leap upward from the bottom of the list.\nIt’s even crazier that all these has happened in just a week.\nLiam closed his eyes briefly and exhaled deeply. He had been really looking forward to today’s rewards and not only was it even better than the previous, it was mind blowing.\n$50m in cash and $33.2b in asset. What monstrous reward.\nHe didn’t receive any property today but they was even more valuable than any property he could possibly receive.\nThere were still more rewards to check out.\n\"McLaren P1 LM-X... Never heard of it. Is it a car that was custom ordered by the system?\" Liam muttered to himself.\nHe picked up his phone and searched for the car’s name on the internet. Immediately, his screen was flooded with information.\nImmediately, information about the car started was transferred by the system and his eyes widened in a mix of shock and disbelief.\nAccording to the information from the system, the McLaren P1 LM is super exclusive limited edition car. It’s essentially a road-legal upgrade of the McLaren P1 GTR and only five of it were made.\nAlso, just as you can already guess, all five units were sold out. And each of them cost between $3m to $5m.\nThen what about the McLaren P1 LM-X he received? Yes, it was custom ordered by the system, which means that it’s a one-off commission and Liam’s version is the only one in the world.\nAs for the details about the car? Well, it’s an even crazier version of the original P1 LM. This explains why the X in the name stands for Extreme. Another reason for that is because it’s the combination between a track car and road worthy car.\nBut appearance wise, it looks no different from the original McLaren P1 LM but it comes with enhanced aerodynamics with retractable rear wing and custom diffuser, a tuned hybrid system that gives it a crazy 1,150hp and a top speed of 255mph. And for weight reduction, it’s interior is extensively covered with carbon fibre.\nThen for the paintwork, it comes with a mix of liquid platinum white and black diamond. The seats are made of premium quality leather and with golden eagle embossed in it. And it also has hold plated heat shield.\nAs for the cost of everything? $7m!\nIsn’t that a bit cheap? Well, the system knows how to get a bargain.\nLiam was very curious to see the new car and he was itching to take it out for a ride, and see what sort of monster the system got him.\nHe immediately got up from the bed and left his room. There’s one more reward; the 20 attribute points but he didn’t bother with it as he has no intention of allocating it yet.\nFor now, he will eat first, then he will unleash the beast in his garage.",

      "content": "Chapter 55: Causing Waves\nLiam was currently in the dining, enjoying the lovely breakfast that the maids prepared for him.\nBut he had no idea that while he ate, his name was causing a bit of a ruckus in two of the biggest companies in the world.\n***\nThe 48th floor of 383 Madison Avenue, home to JPMorgan’s Investor Relations team.\nIt’s usually a controlled space as spreadsheets, earnings reports, and analyst calls dictated the rhythm here. Nothing much surprised them anymore. Especially not when they handled some of the largest institutional investors on the planet.\nBut this morning was different.\nA very familiar name had popped up on their tracking systems. It was a name that has been popping up consecutively since the beginning of the week. And each time, it popped up, it was always with the same about of shares—0.02%.\nIt has happened so many times that they have stopped paying attention to it but they can’t do that today.\nAnd this was because the name didn’t pop up with the usual percentage of shares but an even more staggering percentage.\n1%\nWhen they sae that the system had flagged a shareholder crossing a critical ownership threshold. They thought that it was of the usual suspects — BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, or State Street. Or a sovereign wealth fund.\nBut it wasn’t one of those names. It was the same name that they all have come to become familiar with during the week.\nLiam Scott.\nBefore today, he previously held 0.12% of the company, but with the new purchase, he now holds 1.12%.\nIn raw numbers, that represented nearly $17.6 billion worth of shares. This was enough to put him among the bank’s largest individual shareholders worldwide. And also enough to make the boardroom take notice of him.\n\"Who is this guy really?\" one analyst muttered, leaning over his colleague’s screen.\n\"Just... an individual,\" the colleague replied, scrolling through the Bloomberg terminal.\nThat was the unsettling part.\nMarianne Duval adjusted her glasses and sat straighter at her desk. She remembered the first day his name popped up and she was told to attend to him.\nThen, who had thought that this random name was actually a hidden monster, going from 0.02% to 1.12% in just a week.\nShe was really finding it hard to believe that this name belongs to an individual and not a institution.\nBut the name’s actual identity is none of her business. All she needs to do was her job and that was what she’s doing as her fingers moving quickly across the keyboard, updating Liam’s file on her computer.\nNext to Liam’s name, she added a bright red tag:\nVIP PRIORITY — ULTRA HIGH NET WORTH SHAREHOLDER.\nThis wasn’t something to handle casually. A shareholder of that size would expect—\nNot expect but demand direct access, clear communication, and tailored service. And it wasn’t something she can handle.\nShe immediately flagged the record for escalation and forwarded it up the chain. From her seniors, it would rise to the director. From there, perhaps higher still.\nAfter she did that, she sat back, staring at the name on her screen.\nLiam Scott... Who exactly are you?\n***\nApplē Park, Cupertino, California\nOn the other side of the country, the reaction was equally the same.\nThe company’s Investor Relations team operated from within the ring-shaped campus at Cupertino — a temple of glass and steel.\nThey were used to fielding calls from the largest funds in the world, managing trillion-dollar market optics with poise.\nBut when the system flagged a shareholder crossing the 0.5% threshold — a $17.2 billion stake — even the most seasoned officers felt their composure wobble.\nHalf a percent of the company wasn’t a casual number. Even Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, their most famous shareholder, loomed large over the company. The arrival of a new name, outside of the usual institutional channels, demanded immediate scrutiny.\nA small group gathered in the glass-walled conference room overlooking the inner park. In front of them, screens glowed with spreadsheets and registry data.\n\"Liam Scott,\" one officer said flatly, the name still unfamiliar in her mouth. \"There has been no prior filings for this name before. His name doesn’t tie him to any family office or affiliated fund.\"\nAnother frowned. \"Could be a proxy. Someone shielding a larger interest.\"\n\"Or,\" the first replied, \"it’s exactly what it looks like. An individual. Which makes it more complicated.\"\nThe company didn’t like surprises. Every shareholder above a certain threshold was mapped, tracked, and quietly profiled. The fact that someone could appear with half a percent stake and with no footprint was more than surprising. It was borderline unnerving.\nThey quickly escalated the file. Within the hour, Applē’s CFO had been briefed and his instructions were firm:\n\"Reach out quietly and offer courtesy engagement. We need to know who we’re dealing with.\"\n***\nBoth companies’ teama got to work and by mid-morning, they had updated their top investor lists. And in both, the name Liam Scott now sat prominently near the top, highlighted in bold.\nBoth companies began doing what they did best: mobilizing resources.\nThe compliance team checked regulatory filings, ensuring that Liam’s stake had been properly recorded with the SEC.\nCorporate Security team ran background checks — discreetly, of course. Nothing invasive enough to spark headlines, but thorough enough to confirm he wasn’t tied to a hostile entity.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nAnd most importantly, Applē’s vestor Relations prepared their outreach. Including JP Morgan.\n***\nMeanwhile, Liam was just finishing his meal. He placed the cutlery in its appropriate position and stood up.\n\"The meal was delicious as always, Evelyn,\" he said, as he left the dining.\n\"Thank you, sir. I will pass your compliment to the girls,\" Evelyn said, with a low bow.\nLiam walked to the garage’s interior door and opened it. He stepped into the garage and the lights lot up simultaneously, flooding the space.\nImmediately, what caught Liam’s attention was the new car. The McLaren P1 LM-X.\nThe car’s looked like an absolute beast under the garage’s light. The paintwork shifted like liquid metal, a seamless blend of platinum white and black diamond flecks that glittered like starlight whenever the light struck at an angle. The surface shimmered, as if it were alive, bending the glow into a spectrum of icy silvers and midnight shadows.\nWow!\nIt looked even more beautiful in person than the image in his head.\nLiam waved his had, retrieving its key fob from the inventory as he walked towards it. He pressed the unlock button and it made the familiar beep sound.\nHe opened the door and slowly slid into the extremely comfortable driver’s seat. He stared at the peculiar wheel and grabbed with it with a smile, having a feel of it in his hand.\nHe slowly reached for the ignition button and pressed it, and immediately, the car roared to life in the garage.\nThe sound of the engine was melodious to Liam’s ear.\nHow could it not? This is a $7m engine singing. The sound is definitely Grammy awards worthy.\nWith a bright smile on his face, Liam slowly steered the car towards the exit ofthe garage.\nThe door opened up automatically and he drove up the sloppy entrance of the garage, and down the long driveway, to the gate.\nIt also opened automatically and Liam drove out onto the wider roads of Holmby Hills. He didn’t step on the gas as he wants to enjoy a leisure ride first before truly unleashing the beast.",

      "content": "Chapter 56: A Thrilling Experience\nLiam slowly drove out of Holmby Hills and he guided the car up the sloped driveway and onto Sunset Boulevard, the streets lined with palm trees and multi-million-dollar homes.\nIt has been a few minutes since he took the car out and he has really been enjoying the drive so far.\nThough he hasn’t pushed the car due to the fact that he’s driving on residential street, he can already see the car living up to the concept behind it. Ultimate speed.\nThe car has a top speed of 255mph and it’s currently cruising at less than half of quarter of the its top speed.\nAs for where he will push the car to its limit, he already has an idea and was currently on his way there now.\nHe slowly drove down Sunset Boulevard with a smile on his face. He made sure he enjoyed the view as coming out for him is something that can be considered rare.\nLiam was casually enjoying the drive and he had no idea that the car was already turning heads, and attracting attention.\nIn the world of cars, there are people called car spotters. They are basically considered the watchdog of car culture.\nIn other words, they are enthusiasts who dedicate their time to finding, photographing, and filming rare, exotic, or unusual cars on public roads. Some are just purely enthusiasts, while some are semi-pro or community driven.\nYou can find them hanging around high-end areas like Beverly Hills, Sunset Boulevard, Rodeo Drive, Holmby Hills, London’s Knightsbridge, Monaco, Dubai’s Marina, Tokyo’s Roppongi.\nAnd in L.A, there are tons of car spotters who hang around places like Rodeo Drive, Sunset Boulevard, and Malibu Country Mart, filming every rare hypercar.\nAnd that was the reason why the moment the McLaren P1 LM-X was spotted, their phones and cameras started clicking.\nAs people very familiar with all sorts of hyper cars, they were very familiar with the McLaren P1 LM and this car shares very uncanny similarities to it, except the paintwork and the near-absense of a rear wing.\n\"Is that a McLaren P1 LM?\" One of the asked, as his camera made a clicking sound, taking a picture of the car.\n\"It looks familiar but it’s not it. No rear wing and the paintwork is unique. See how it shimmers under the sunlight?\" The spotter beside replied, staring at his tab and watching the video footage being fed to it by the drone following behind the car.\n\"Then it’s probably a secret MSO (McLaren Special Project), an unreleased car or the prototype for a never-released track car. Or it’s a variant,\" the first spotter said.\nThe second spotter nodded in agreement and added, \"Either way, we can leave it to the forums and outlets like Supercar Blondie, Top Gear, Car Throttle and Robb Report to get the necessary information from McLaren.\"\n\"Can you guess who’s driving it?\" The first spotter asked, smiling, as he took more pictures of the car.\n\"Easy. Probably a billionaire, a celebrity or a Saudi prince. It has to be anyone between them.\"\nMeanwhile, Liam had already noticed that he was starting to attract some attention. If he had no idea before, then the group of boys and girlsrunning slowly following behind him, with their phones out, was enough to make him aware.\nBut he wasn’t worried because the glasses of the car are all tinted and no one can see the person behind the wheel.\nLiam was okay with showing off the car but becoming a celebrity, having paparazzis chase after him and his life being put under scrutiny by people who has no idea what he might be going through, wasn’t something he wants.\nOf course, Liam was probably overthinking this but he won’t be taking any chances. And that was why he immediately stepped on the gas a little, as he turned toward Rodeo Drive, the car gliding into the palm-lined street.\nImmediately, he felt all eyes on him but he didn’t pay attention to them, as he kept his pace slow, letting the car’s low rumble echo off the boutique façades. He could feel the weight of eyes on him from every angle.\nHe exited Rodeo and turned back toward Sunset Boulevard. Guiding the car east, Liam let Sunset Boulevard carry him through Hollywood, weaving through the slow-moving traffic with ease.\nAt an open stretch, he flicked his wrist, and the car surged forward effortlessly, the power under his command but never unruly.\nBy the time he merged onto the freeway and veered north toward Glendale, the horizon opened into brighter morning sky and rising silhouettes of the San Gabriel Mountains.\nAnd then, at last, he reached Angeles Crest Highway.\nLiam slowed to a crawl at the first turnout, the car idling like a beast straining against a leash. He toggled a switch on the dash.\nWith a soft mechanical whine, the rear wing deployed, rising from the tail like a blade being drawn. The aero flaps shifted into position, transforming the McLaren from beautiful to deadly.\nLiam took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, and he smiled. His eyes seem to light up the next moment and he pressed the throttle.\nImmediately, the world exploded into a blur as the McLaren lunged forward, tires biting hard into the asphalt as the twin-turbo V8 and hybrid system unleashed 1,150 horsepower.\nThe exhaust screamed, a metallic wail echoing against the rock faces as Liam tore up the incline.\nHis Pro-level Vehicular Operation skill came alive and it was complimented by his enhanced senses. His hands moved flawlessly, each shift timed to the millisecond, each corner taken at the perfect angle.\nHe braked late — impossibly late — yet the car obeyed, diving into apexes like it had read his mind.\nThe G-forces pinned him to the seat comfortably, with the mountains flashing by in a blur of pine, cliff, and sky.\nThe road twisted and coiled, but it wasn’t a problem for Liam. He was already going at the car’s top speed but thanks of his enhanced senses, time still felt relatively normal for him.Thɪs\nDownshifting into a hairpin, the rear stepped out for a fraction of a second. A lesser driver would have panicked but Liam merely adjusted his steering input, feathered the throttle, and the car snapped back into line, roaring out of the corner with perfect traction.\nLiam raced the car throughout the early hours of the morning, through Angeles Crest Highway before finally turning and driving back to the city.\nBy then, it was already close to noon and Liam has had a ton of fun. It was truly the first time he used his driving skill to its maximum and took advantage of his enhanced senses.\nThe experience was more than thrilling and he would love to experience it more. But that would for another time as the metal beast needs rest.",

      "content": "Chapter 57: Money Makes The World Go Round\nMeanwhile, while Liam was racing on Angeles Crest Highway, the internet and the car world was already ablaze with discussion about the sightings of an unknown hypercar in Beverly Hills.\nForums like Reddit (r/cars), FerrariChat, McLarenLife and Supercar Blondie’s page had already blown up with speculations.\nTheir speculations was just as the same as the two spotters’:\n\"Is this a secret McLaren Special Operations project?\"\n\"Could it be a prototype for a never-released track car?\"\n\"Is this some Saudi prince’s commission?\"\nIt didn’t help matters that no one has heard about the car before. Normally, even though information about one-offs are classified, there are usually at least whispers about them.\nBut not so much as a breath was heard about this car before it made its appearance. And that made it even crazier.\nThe forums weren’t the only ones speculating and talking about the car, as the media also reacted, as outlets like Top Gear, Car Throttle, Bloomberg Auto, Carwow and Robb Report, all ran articles like:\n\"Mystery McLaren hypercar appears in Los Angeles. Is this a one off?\"\nThey also immediately started chasing McLaren for comments, but unfortunately for them, they will only be chasing after the wind.\nDue to the agreement between McLaren and the system, no information about the car, not even a breath of it can be made public.\nThis leaves the public with no other option but to continue speculating even more.\n***\nIt was already noon by the time Liam pulled back into Rodeo Drive. He slowly drove down the high-end shopping street, not bothering to pay attention to the phones and cameras that were brought and pointed at him immediately he was spotted.\n\"I only wanted to take the car for a ride,\" Liam muttered slowly, as he glanced at the groups around him.\nHe sighed and focused on the road ahead, enjoying the slow drive after the thrilling high speed racing he just had.\nThe next moment, the car’s integrated system buzzed, announcing an incoming call through the speakers.\nLiam looked at the caller ID and he saw that it was an unknown number, but he decided to pick it anyway. He felt that whoever was definitely calling for something important.\n\"Hello,\" he said as he picked the call.\n\"Hello, Mr Liam. This is Janelle from JP Morgan’s Investors Relations,\" an unfamiliar female voice came from the other end.\nLiam wasn’t surprised when he heard that the person was from JP Morgan. He remembered that someone called him the first day he received his first shares of the company.\nIt’s someone different this time. Is she maybe a senior staff in the investor relations team? Higher in position than Marianne?...\nᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ\n\"What do I owe the pleasure of this call, Miss Janelle?\" He asked.\nThe question was more of a courtesy as they both already knew the reason for the call.\n\"I’m calling to congratulate you. Your latest acquisition has made you one of JP Morgan’s largest individual shareholders. On behalf of the company, we want to extend our gratitude for your confidence in us,\" she paused briefly, then continued.\n\"I will also like to inform you that you’re now a priority investor and now have access to the company’s list of bespoke private clients services. All at the highest tier. You now have dedicated bankers just for you. You have access to investment opportunities before they’re public and also access to special hedge funds, even co-investment deals alongside JPMorgan itself. The highest tier of estate planning, tax optimisation and security services. You will also receive private briefings, early access to reports, and even personal calls about company direction,\" Janelle said, listing out all of the perks Liam now have access to as one of the company’s top investors.\nLiam listened to all this with a smile on his face. It did feel nice hearing that he will be receiving even personal calls about the directons of a multi-billion dollars company like JP Morgan.\nIt’s only something that money can achieve.\nBut while it did feel nice to hear, something like that wasn’t something Liam wants to bother himself with.\n\"Thank you but there’s no need for the briefings and the calls,\" he said.\n\"No problem, sir. But if you do need anything, please contact the head of your private banking team, Mr Daniel Conley,\" Janelle said and continued, \"Also, the creation process of your trust has been expedited and will be completed tomorrow. We are very sorry for the delay so far.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Liam said, smiling from ear to ear.\n\"The pleasure is ours, Mr. Liam. And thank you again for choosing JP Morgan,\" Janelle said, and politely ended the call.\nLiam chuckled softly as he processed everything Janelle had told him.\n\"I now have a private banking team and the trust has been expedited ahead of time, and it will be ready by tomorrow,\" he muttered to himself.\nWell, it was supposed to be ready during this week, so that’s not much. But the fact that I will receive briefing about the company is a lot.\nWho would had actually thought that the same person from two weeks ago that his former employers always worked him to death and still rip him off by paying him pennies, would become the same person that is now qualified to receive briefing about a company that’s top 15 most valuable in the world? Who? No one in their right mind.\nIt’s just as they say, money makes the world go round.\nLiam smiled to himself, his attention on the road ahead.\nBarely a minute later, the car’s integrated system buzzed again, announcing an incoming call through the speakers.\nHe looked at the caller ID and it was another unknown number, but he picked the call nonetheless.\n\"Hello,\" he said, as he picked the call.\n\"Hello, Mr Liam. This is Rachel from Applē’s Investor Relations,\" an unfamiliar female voice came from the other end.\nLiam smiled as he already knew the reason what she was calling, and he decided to say nothing and allow her talk instead.\nRachel noticed Liam’s silence and pressed on.\n\"Mr. Liam, I’m calling to first congratulate you. With your most recent acquisition, you’ve become one of Applē’s largest individual shareholders. On behalf of the company, we want to extend our warmest welcome and our gratitude for your confidence in us.\"\nShe paused briefly, then continued.\n\"\"As a priority investor, you’ll have direct access to our executive team, with tailored updates and one-on-one briefings at your discretion. In addition, we’ll be extending invitations to all of our private shareholder events — both here in Cupertino and internationally.\"\nHer voice softened slightly as she continued.\n\"You’ll also have access to a dedicated liaison — myself, in this case. My role is to ensure your questions are answered promptly, and that your position as a shareholder is supported with all the resources you need. Should you wish to schedule private meetings with our leadership team, including the CFO, or attend closed product showcases ahead of the public, those arrangements can be made as well.\"\nLiam couldn’t hold himself back from smiling from ear to ear, as he listened to Rachel.\n\"And finally,\" Rachael added, \"given the size of your position, you’re entitled to priority voting rights notifications and private advisory sessions regarding governance issues. Of course, participation is optional, but Applē values the input of stakeholders like you.\"\nShe drew in a measured breath. \"Mr. Liam, I know that was a lot of information all at once. Would you like me to forward a formal briefing document to your office? Or, if you prefer, I can arrange a private meeting here at Apple Park.\"\n\"No. No meeting or briefing. I’m not interested in those things,\" he simply replied.\n\"Okay. Please contact me if you need anything.\"\n\"I will,\" Liam said and hung up.\nThe smile on his face had widened it so much that it was almost giving him wrinkles. Only that wasn’t possible with the nanites in his body.\nI could had asked for an iPhone 17 pro max and have it delivered to me ahead of its release date.\nAgain, money makes the world go round.\nLiam slowly pulled into Holmby Hills, with a few cars discreetly following behind him. He didn’t pay attention to them as his thought was on the two calls he had received today.",

      "content": "Chapter 58: Unwanted Attention\nLiam got out of the car and walked to the garage’s interior door, pulled it open and walked into the mansion.\nHe walked to the living room and sank into a sofa, letting out a deep sigh. He enjoyed the drive he had just taken.\nThe thrill he felt when the car was going at its top speed of 255mph was mind blowing. The amazing feeling as he felt from the rush of adrenaline as he did those sharp turns and watched his surroundings flash by in a blur.\nIt was a really addictive feeling. Like a junkie finally getting his fix. Only now did he truly understand why boys loved drag racing so much, and why movies with top-tier racing scenes never failed to sell.\nHe enjoyed everything but there was one thing he didn’t enjoy. The attention. When he received the car, he knew that it was something amazing but he had no idea that it will blow up this much, and people would tail him.\nThe tailing started immediately when he pulled back onto Rodeo Drive. At first, it wasn’t noticeable due to the fact there were other cars around but he started noticing when he pulled into the quieter and more secluded streets of Beverly Hills.\nThe followed him and only seem to stop a some distance away as he pulled in into Bellemere.\nSeems like this is something I will have to get used to if I want to continue driving the LM-X around,\nLiam sighed.\nHe sank further into the sofa as he decided to relax for a while, as he think of what to do next.\nAs his thoughts were drifting, he heard a notification sound from his phone and he looked at it.\n\"What the hell?\" He frowned slightly, as he picked up his phone.\nHarper had sent a message to the group chat and had tagged him. And the content of the message was a screenshot of the bold headline of an online article from a popular site. And under the message was the site’s link.\nThe headline of the article reads:\nP1 LM VARIANT PULLED INTO BELLEMERE MANSION. IS THE NEW OWNER THE SAME PERSON?\nLiam clicked on the link and he was immediately taken to the site. And the first thing he saw was the bold headline. He didn’t bother with it, as he scrolled down, reading the content of the article.\n\"How was many minutes has it been and they have already put out such an article with detailed information? What the hell?\" Liam chuckled dryly.\nHe actually has no idea how to feel right now or what he was feeling exactly. He felt amused, surprised and even scared.\nFor someone to be able to put together an article with so much information as this in less than five minutes... Liam really has no idea what to say.\nIt wasn’t just the article but also the images that were attached to it. It was image of the car from different angles. Not only that, but there was an aerial view image of the mansion.\n\"This people... They are crazy...\" Liam muttered slowly, as he took another look at the article.\nHe noticed that the parts Bellemere Mansion was mentioned were in blue font. He clicked on it and he was taken to another article, and it bold headline reads:\n$70M BELLEMERE MANSION PURCHASED BY TEENAGER\n\"What the...?\" Liam muttered slowly, as he started going through the article.\nA couple seconds later, he sighed and exited the site. He didn’t want to read anymore as there was nothing for him to see there.\nBeside the fact that his name was in the article, the rest of it was just it describing the mansion and its history.\nI see... So, that’s why the news about the property sales blew up the way it did.\nLiam had no idea that Bellemere Mansion was never up for sale and the previous owner had rejected all the previous offers he received.\nWell, that has never been any of my business, has it?\nHe decided to stop thinking about unnecessary things and focus on the present. But as if fate was against him, his phone buzzed with another notification.\nHe took a look at it and he saw that he was tagged by Elise in a message she sent in the group chat.\n\"You got mentioned by Bloomberg!!!\" She captioned the message.\nThe content of the message was an article ran by Bloomberg and its headlines reads:\nMYSTERY BUYER OF $70M+ BELLEMERE MANSION SPOTTED DRIVING UNKNOWN MCLAREN HYPERCAR.\nGive me a break!,\nLiam sighed heavily.\nHe sent a tired face emoji as reply to the two messages and dropped his phone on the sofa. He never expected his day to go like this. All he wanted to was to just take the car out for a spin!\nLiam decided to distract himself by thinking about other things and he remembered that he had planned to make a trip to Geneva, Switzerland during the week, to check the content of the safe deposit box locked away in the Rothschild’s private vault.\n\"Should I make the trip tomorrow? I can also spend some time over there. Maybe a week?\" He thought to himself.\nHe has planned to go this week but he never decided on a particular day, but he decided that he will make the trip in two days time.\nBefore he leaves, he wants to prepare himself. The place he’s going to is a private vault that’s ran by one of the biggest families in the world.\nBefore he goes there, he needs to be at his best in all aspects—physically and mentally.\nLiam decided to call David and inform him of his travel plans, so that he can make the necessary arrangements.\n***\nMeanwhile, in the living area of a certain mansion located in Beverly Hills, there was a tense atmosphere as a young man was being glared at by an older looking male.\n\"Are you seeing this?\" Kevin asked angrily with a deep frown on his face, pointing at the article’s headline displayed on his phone.\nThe young man being glared at, Jason, lowered his head, with a sullen look on his face.\n\"F*cking look at me, you selfish, spoilt bastard. You wanted us to go after him? What do you think would had happened if we had gone ahead to do that? Were you trying to destroy out family?\" Kevin said with a low voice burning with rage.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nJason couldn’t say anything. No, he didn’t dare say anything or even raise his head. He knew just how much his second older brother hates his guts and he won’t pass up any opportunity to hit him.\n\"I once told mom that you will be the one to bring ruin to our family with the way she was spoiling you, and treating you like an egg. Just look at the end result. Take a good look at yourself and tell me what you have managed to achieve,\" Kevin said, and his voice became even lower.\n\"Nothing! Besides constituting nuisance everywhere, partying and sleeping around with different girls like a man wh*re. You have achieved absolutely nothing!\"\nJason was hurt by Kevin’s word but he didn’t dare say anything and could only bite his lower lip, with his head still lowered.\nThe next moment, someone walked through the front door and when he noticed the atmosphere in the living area, he sighed.\n\"Cut him some slack, Kevin. You have already chewed him out enough,\" Chris said, before walking up the stairs.\nKevin glared at Jason one more time and said, \"You really are a piece of work but I will make sure you’re never my problem.\"\nAfter saying that, he left Jason alone in the living area.\nJason seeing that he was finally alone, sighed heavily in relief and sank into the sofa.\nF*ck! Who would had thought that random kid was actually someone of high status? F*ck! F*ck!\n\"F*ck!!!\" He screamed out the last part loudly.\n\"What’s wrong with my baby boy?\" A matured female voice sounded from behind him.\n\"Nothing, mom,\" Jason replied.\n\"Are you sure? If anyone troubled you, just tell me and I will have them dealt with immediately,\" his mom said.\n\"No, mom. Nothing happened,\" Jason said with a smile, as he looked at the beautiful face of his mother.\n\"That’s good. Always remember that mama is always here for you, baby,\" his mom said with a smile filled with motherly warmth, before walking up the stairs.\nAhhh... F*ck me sideways.",

      "content": "Chapter 59: Always The Problem\nLiam was currently in his room, resting on his bed, gazing at the ceiling, his eyes a little distant as he thought about his upcoming visit to the private vault.\nHe had already informed Daniel of his travel plans and the fact that he will be visiting the Rothschild’s private vault when he gets there.\nDaniel had told him not to worry about anything as he will take care of every single thing, and will give him confirmation before the end of the day.\nLiam smiled when he heard this. It did feel nice to just sit back and relax, while someone else take care of everything for him.\nIt didn’t just feel nice. It was a great feeling.\nBut the feeling wasn’t what Liam was focused on right now, there was something far more important on his mind.\nWhat do I wear on the day I’m going there? The custom suit should do. It’s high-end enough. I also have two custom watches. One of them will have to do. It’s not like I’m going there to show off or anything. I just need to dress appropriately and look like someone that belongs to their circle.\nLiam had tried searching up information on the private vault but he got nothing. This showed him just how secretive they are with it.\nHe had felt that a place like that will be discreet and access would be very limited, granted only to a selective few. But he no matter now discreet a place is, he never expect that there would be no information about it at all online.\nBut as always, Liam didn’t overthink it. Also, besides his appearance, he doesn’t need to do anything else as he already the other part covered with his World-Class Etiquette skill.\nBut he was actually curious about the place and what sort of people he would meet. With just the name, guessing their potential clienteles was very simple.\nRoyalties and billionaires. In other words, people of high status and wealth.\nAnd while Liam wasn’t in the first category, he has pretty much entered the second.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the\n\"Fuuu,\" Liam let out a deep breath as he got up from the bed.\nEnough of thinking about that place. It’s not like he’s going there immediately he lands in Geneva or the next day. It can wait for now.\nThere was another thing on his mind beside the trip. It was related to the system points he needs to purchase the molecular assembler.\nHe had planned that after his second weekly sign-in, he might consider accumulating his sign-ins. And he has done that and thought about it, and he decided that he won’t be accumulating his sign-ins.\nThe reason for his decision wasn’t because of the rewards—well, they partly influenced his decision. But the main reason was because if he starts accumulating, it would take him much longer to get the remaining amount he needs.\nHe currently has $77m in cash. Say, he makes it a round figure and he now has $70m, which means he still need $30m.\nIf he starts accumulating, he will receive 10 SP daily, then an increased amount for weekly, monthly and annually.\nBut the truth was that it wasn’t even close to being enough. 10 SP is equivalent to $100,000 but he needs $30m more. This means that he will have to accumulate for months before he can get the remaining system points he needs—3,000 SP.\nThere was no way that he would be wiling to sacrifice months of sign-ins for that. Making a decision like that would had been more difficult for him if the points were higher, but 10 SP wasn’t enough to make him give up on his daily sign-ins.\nAnd the fact that he can get the money he needs much more faster through the sign-ins made him also solidified his decision.\nThat is decided. Now, where do I place the factory?\nLiam intends to create two tech products—the quantum chip and the gaming gear glass. Both techs will be revolutionary to say the least but it will also earn a ton of heat too.\nLiam had done his research on the two products and he has come to realised that he’s going to be in for a lot of crazy dramas. And this isn’t an exaggeration as he thought about it and researched it extensively.\nFirst is the quantum chip. Without further explanation, one can already imagine just how crazy the world would go for room temperature quantum chips that are the same size of classic chips in phones and other devices.\nBut just as the world is going crazy, the company producing the tech and Liam indirectly will be under a lot of heat.\nWhile Liam intends to create the company under the trust so that he can hide his identity and connection to it as its original owner, it doesn’t mean that he won’t feel the heat when things start getting hot.\nAnd how will things get hot? The answer is already obvious, isn’t it? According to Liam’s research, the world’s governments, especially the USA, strictly controls the distribution of high-end specifications GPUs to other countries.\nThey already labelled it as national security asset and has placed certain embargoes on their exportation into certain countries—non-allied states obviously.\nNow, imagine what they will do when a tech that’s at least 100x better than the most advanced high specification GPU in the world, gets released.\nLabelling it as national security asset would be the tip of the iceberg. They will want outright control of it. Heck, they will go beyond restricting the tech to the country, nationalise it and make it American.\nLiam loves his country. Don’t get him wrong on that but restricting something that’s his isn’t something he will ever be in support of.\nBut the problem wasn’t just the US government but all governments around the world. They will scramble for the tech and will do anything at all to acquire it.\nBut the truth is that the problem isn’t the government. It has never been them. The problem is the mega corporations that the mere existence of the tech threatens everything they have built.\nTake for example, the current most valuable company in the world that literally has the world in its palm because of their GPU. Even with the restrictions placed on them by the US, they are still making a killing in profits.\nThen there are the old guards of the tech industries, the unshakable heavyweights that will quiver in their boots when the tech hits the market.\nAnd it’s not just the tech industry but the entire Fortune 500 companies that will be threatened. And they will do what they do best, they will lobby against the company, forcing the government to take action.\nAnd that’s where the heat will come. This was just for the quantum chip. Now, what about the gear glass? That’s where things gets even crazier.\nLiam had already played out different scenarios in his head and at the end, he decided that he would go ahead with creating the techs.\nHe has visualised near countless scenarios and there was no way to hide from the chaos he will bring upon the world with the techs. There are the good sort of chaos and the dark sort, but at the end, the issue isn’t with him but the world itself.\nAt the end, we are always the problem.",

      "content": "Chapter 60: The World’s Madness\nThe day for Liam passed faster or slower. He spent it doing nothing at home but chatting with his friends, and watching movies in the mansion’s private theatre.\nHe was naturally bombarded with questions by the boys as they asked him about the car and its specifications. Even the girls were curious about the car.\nLiam didn’t hold back as he gave them the juicy details they wanted. He told them the name of the car, its specifications and every other details.\nWhile these details were juicy, what actually interested the boys was the car’s top speed and when he told them that it’s255mph1 , they were very impressed.\n255mph already puts the car among the fastest cars in the world and it even beats McLaren previous record of 250mph. It can actually be said that it’s one of their best hypercars yet.\nBut unfortunately for the public, it’s a one-off. If it wasn’t, they will definitely want to get their hands on it.\nAt least, that was what the boys were thinking until they heard the price. $7m wasn’t amount they will be able to splurge on cars that easily or even ever.\nUnlike Liam that has access to unlimited wealth and has unlimited spending power, they don’t have that. They are at the mercy of their families and there was no way that they can save up their allowances to get a car of that amount. It was close to impossible.\nThe boys couldn’t help but feel a little depressed but that was all to it. If at all, they were actually happy and that was for two reasons.\nThe first reason was for Liam. They share in his happiness too. Getting a one-off commission means a lot and it can be said to the dream of nearly every car lover.\nThe second reason was because they can beg Liam to allow them take the car out for a ride. Though they have no idea if he will agree to it.\nBut you know what they always say? You never know until you try.\nThey will give it a try first.\nAs for Liam’s identity, at this point, there was no more debating it. A $70m+ mansion, private chopper of $20m+, a luxury super yacht of $300m+ and one-off commissioned car of $7m. .\nIf he’s not from a crazy billionaire family, then he’s probably the secret controller of the world’s economy. But even they feel that even if there’s the chance that he’s theoretically the world’s economy, he still shouldn’t be able to splurge so much.\nAccording to their calculation, he has spent more than $500m in two weeks. That’s an insane amount of money to splurge even for billionaire families.\nBut they were also aware that Liam would only keep being more mysterious to them as they days passed, though that didn’t matter to them. They might never get to find out which family he comes from but they were happy just being his friends.\nEven if he’s not from a powerful family or a billionaire family, and he’s as ordinary as the report say, it won’t change anything as he’s someone they deeply connect with.\nBut as for him being ordinary, that was impossible. If he’s from an ordinary background, then they and others like them have no background at all.\nAs for Liam, the chat wasn’t the highlight of his day but the fact that he got the confirmation from Daniel as promised. He has expected to get it somewhat later in the evening but he got it almost an hour after the call.\nMaybe because of his now higher VIP status, they made the preparations faster. Or maybe it was because the place he’s visiting in Geneva was the Rothschild private vault.\nYes, Liam told Daniel that the reason for his visit to Geneva. It wasn’t something he could keep to himself as they were also no need for it.\nBy informing Daniel, Liam already have everything taken care of. As the leader of his private banking team, he will call the private vault and make the necessary arrangements for Liam’s visit.\nThe private vault isn’t some place Liam can just waltz into and expect to get attended to. He has to follow protocols. If he doesn’t call ahead and provide means for identification so that the organisation can prepare, then they won’t attend to him.\nWhen Liam thought of the amount of stress Daniel has saved him from, he smiled. He really loves the easy life he’s living now. It’s the immesurable amount of comfort that money can get you. The right amount of money to be precise.\nBut the best highlight of his day was the fact that the trust was ready. Janelle had told him that it will ready by tomorrow but it was ready by dinnertime.\nWith the trust ready, Liam can proceed with things related to his future company. He had actually told Daniel to start creating it and it should be ready in five days.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nIt naturally shouldn’t take that long but the company can’t be created directly. It has to be created under a holding company like an LLC, then the tech company will be slotted under it as a subsidiary. That way, it will be harder for people trying to dig to into the company owner’s identity in the future.\nAs for Liam, he wasn’t exactly in a hurry to start pumping out the tech into the market yet. He had actually taken the whole of the day to think about the two techs.\nAs for the result of that? He decided against launching the quantum chip publicly. He will create it but use it personally for something else.\nThe reason for the change was because he has thought about it and he felt that just the gear glass would be more than enough. There was no need releasing the chip publicly.\nWasn’t Liam trying to limit himself by doing this? Isn’t this against his character? The answer to both was no.\nThe gear glass’ something that will disrupt the tech market more than the chip would and also destabilise the world. Also, releasing just it will help him to contain the dark things people will try to perpetrate with his technology.\nWith the functions Liam already have planned in mind for the gear glass, it’s going to be the biggest tech in the world for possibly decades to come.\nAnd the fact that replicating it in any form would be something impossible, would also make the tech even bigger.\nThis is going to be the same for the chip if he’s going to release it. He will make hundreds of billions from just selling it. That was an amount of potential profit no corporation will ever give up. But Liam can.\nHe had already played scenarios in his head of the chip being used to create very advanced weapons, engineer extremely deadly bioweapons and all other sort of things. And that was what the reason why he’s going to be giving up the profit.\nHis intention for both techs was for them to be used for the advancement of the human civilisation. But if they are going to indirectly make him an arms dealer, then he will just keep the chip to himself.\nHe could stomach greed, envy, even government control. But blood? Absolutely no way. If his technology ever became the reason children died in some war zone or the reason why a deadlier version of the previous pandemic breaks out again, that stain would never wash off.\nThere’s the question of if the gear glass can also be militarised and used to create the advanced weapons and lethal bioweapons he’s so much against. The answer to that question is yes and no.\nIt’s yes in the sense that the government will definitely want a military version of it. But no, because Liam’s company will refuse to create that version for them.\nThey will naturally pressure the company if he refuses but he won’t cave no matter what. But Liam understands that even if he resists, they will still try to find a way around it.\nThis is the reason for Liam’s next plan: creating a quantum ecosystem. Since they are so stubborn and won’t listen, he will give them what they want in different form and in a way he can control the creation of things like that however he wants.\nThe idea for the quantum ecosystem is still fresh in his mind and he’s still refining it. It will probably take him the rest of the night to refine it completely.\nAhhh... I really don’t understand why things like weapons has to exist. Just unnecessarily complicating things for me. You fucking people,\nLiam sighed, making himself even more comfortable in his already ultra comfortable bed.\nSometimes he wondered if humanity would destroy itself even without him. Weapons always found a way to exist. Always. And yet here he was, forced to plan around their madness.\nI already changed the top speed in previous Chapters",

      "content": "Chapter 61: Valuable Daily Sign-in Rewards\nYawn!\n\"Nothing beats getting a good night sleep to recover from the stress of the previous day,\" Liam muttered, yawning and stretching his body slightly.\nHe stood up from the bed and walked to the window, adjusting the curtain slightly and allowing more of the early morning sunlight to flood the room.\nHe let the sunlight hit his face and he smiled in satisfaction, enjoying the soothing warmth it brought.\nAhhh. What a beautiful day. I should make the most out of it.\nWith a bright smile on his face, he stepped away from the window and walked back to his bed, and sat down.\nThe day already looks beautiful and he intends to make it even more beautiful.\n\"System, sign-in,\" he said with a low voice.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host. You received $2,000,000]\n[You received 0.05% shares of\n***\n$2m and 0.05% shares. Not bad at all.\nLiam was really impressed that he got so much today as daily rewards after yesterday’s massive rewards.\nThe $2m has increased his account balance again and the shares he got, valued at $1.7b has increased his net worth.\nLiam’s phone buzzed with a credit notification from his bank and he picked it up. He saw that his bank account has increased to $54m.\nYes, $54m.\nYesterday, when the trust was finally completed, Daniel advised Liam to establish a dedicated expenses account under the structure. It would cover staff salaries, property maintenance, security, and the countless small costs that came with running an estate of his scale.\nLiam was quite surprised by Daniel’s suggestion and he asked for more explanation. He was aware that he hasn’t been footing the bills since and he thought that JP Morgan were the one taking care of them.\nBut he came to fully understand everything after Daniel’s explanation. As for the explanation, it was pretty simple.\nEverything Daniel had arranges for him—staff, security, lawyers, property management—gets paid directly from your accounts. He won’t send him the bills. Only huge expenses like a $20m investment opportunity would be brought to Liam’s notice first and have to receive his approval.\nAs for why they haven’t taken anything out of his account? The reason was because Daniel saw no need to do that since he was already creating the trust.\nAfter hearing Daniel’s explanation, Liam didn’t hesitate as he transferred $25 million into the account that same evening.\nIt wasn’t much compared to the value of his assets, but it was more than enough to keep everything running seamlessly for years.\nMore importantly, it meant he could give Daniel full control without worrying about approvals or interruptions.\nFrom then on, whenever a maid’s salary cleared, when new guards were hired, or when a security system upgrade was ordered, the money flowed from that account. All Liam ever received was a neat monthly report, concise and professional, breaking down where each dollar had gone.\nAhhh. So much financial technicalities. I’m really happy that I have a professional team handling everything.\nThe next moment, he smiled from ear to ear when he remembered the $1.7b shares he just received. It has shot the total value of shares he owns from $34.8b to $36.5b.\nThe increase was very substantial. Seeing that he received 0.5% shares of the company today, he will probably be receiving it daily until his next weekly sign-in and he was looking forward to it.\nWith the 0.05% shares of today, Liam now owns 0.55% of a trillion-dollar company. And his shares is nearly $19 billion in value altogether.\nHe shook his head lightly, standing up from the bed.\n\"This system really is something else,\" he muttered under his breath.\nHe didn’t linger around as the shower called to him, and soon enough the sound of rushing water filled the marble-tiled bathroom. He took his time, letting the warmth seep into his muscles.\nAfter he was done taking his bath, he dressed up and went downstairs for breakfast.\n\"Good morning, sir,\" Evelyn greeted with a graceful nod as he entered the dining hall.\n\"Morning, Evelyn,\" Liam replied warmly as he took his seat and started eating.\nHe ate at his own pace, enjoying the silence of the vast dining room. Occasionally, the clinking of cutlery echoed against the high ceilings, but otherwise, it was peaceful.\nOnce breakfast was done, Liam decided to retreat to one of his favorite parts of the mansion — the private theatre.\nThe doors slid open and he stepped into the dimly lit sanctuary, the plush carpet muffling his footsteps. He sank into one of the wide leather recliners, grabbed the remote, and resumed the series he had been binging.\nThe giant screen flickered to life, filling the room with vivid colors and surround sound that wrapped around him like a cocoon. For hours, Liam allowed himself to slip into the fictional world and time passed in a blur.\nThe golden hue of sunset painted the mansion’s windows, casting long shadows across the halls as he left the theatre.\nDinner was ready, as always. A perfectly cooked steak, accompanied by roasted vegetables and a delicate glass of sparkling water. Liam ate quietly, his mind wandering to tomorrow’s trip.\nEvelyn appeared at the end of the meal, her tone as composed as ever.\n\"Sir, your luggage has already been prepared. Mr. Conley informed me of your travel, and I’ve ensured that your things, as well as Mason’s and Nick’s, are ready.\"\nLiam smiled at her efficiency. \"Thank you, Evelyn. You’ve saved me a lot of trouble.\"\n\"It’s my duty, sir,\" she replied with a bow.\nLater, in the quiet of his room, Liam sank into the soft mattress. He thought about the vault, about the Rothschilds, about the mysteries waiting for him in Geneva. But he decided to stop thinking about everything and get some sleep.\n***\nThe next morning, Liam woke up feeling refreshed. He got out of bed and prepared himself and when he was done, he went downstairs.\nDownstairs, breakfast awaited and he ate unhurriedly. He had no reason to rush. The private jet wasn’t going to leave without him.\nBy the time he stepped outside, the Rolls Royce Ghost Black Badge was already waiting at the front. Mason stood by the rear door, expression calm and watchful, while Nick waited in the driver’s seat.\n\"Morning, sir,\" Mason said, opening the door smoothly.\n\"Morning,\" Liam replied with a smile, sliding into the backseat.\nMason followed him in, settling in the passenger seat while Nick started the engine.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nThe car purred to life, gliding effortlessly down the long driveway of Bellemere Mansion. The gates opened automatically, parting like grand doors to release them onto the streets of Holmby Hills.\nThe world outside was waking up, the streets alive with joggers, dog walkers, and other luxury cars rolling out of their gated estates.\nLiam leaned back, eyes drifting to the tinted window as they turned onto Sunset Boulevard. The palm trees swayed gently in the morning breeze, and the sunlight painted the road in shades of gold.\nThe Rolls Royce glided smoothly through the city streets, heading toward LAX.\nAnd as the car carried him forward, Liam couldn’t help but smile in anticipation.",

      "content": "Chapter 62: Stuck Between A Rock And A Hard Place\nLos Angeles International Airport.\nThe Rolls-Royce Ghost Black Badge rolled smoothly across the private tarmac, weaving past other luxury vehicles until it slowed to a halt beside an elegant Gulfstream G700.\nThe aircraft sat there like a beast of the skies, its polished fuselage glinting under the California sun.\nNick killed the engine, and Mason immediately stepped out. He moved to Liam’s side of the car, pulled the door open, and bowed slightly.\n\"Sir,\" he said.\nLiam stepped out, his leather shoes clicking against the smooth pavement. The private jet immediately caught his attention and gor a brief moment, he simply stood there, taking in the view.\nThe jet was massive, stretching longer than he’d expected, with wide oval windows and a sleek wing design.\nA private jet,\nLiam smiled.\nEven now, despite everything the system had given him, the sight of the private jet stirred something inside him. It was a mixture of awe and disbelief.\nTwo weeks ago, he couldn’t even afford to have a proper meal. But today, he was about to fly halfway across the world in one of the most expensive private aircrafts ever made.\nThe irony wasn’t lost on him.\nThe last time he’d been in the air was on the day of the yacht ride, when the chopper had carried them to and from Granworth Tower. That had been exciting, sure. But this? Without being told, he knew that this was definitely going to be something else.\nLiam’s gaze shifted to the two beautiful hostesses standing by the open doorway of the jet. Both were dressed in tailored navy uniforms accented with subtle silver trim.\nTheir uniform complimented their looks and made them look even more professional, and high class.\nLiam chuckled inwardly.\nThis is really another world.\nHe climbed the mobile stairs and aboard the jet.Follow current novels on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nThe sight of the interior nearly made him gawk in shock but he immediately composed him. His World-Class Etiquette skill was really helping out here.\nIf it wasn’t for it, he would had definitely lost control of his emotions the exact moment his eyes fell on the private jet.\nThe aircraft’s interoior was beyond beautiful. Polished wood paneling gleamed beneath soft ambient lighting. Cream-colored leather seats, wide enough to rival recliners, lined the cabin. Gold-trimmed fixtures accented the tables and compartments, and the faint scent of leather and fresh flowers lingered in the air.\nThe entire cabin felt less like an airplane and more like a floating penthouse.\n\"Welcome aboard, Mr. Scott,\" one of the hostesses greeted, bowing slightly.\nHer voice carried that perfect blend of respect and warmth.\n\"My name is Claire, and this is Emily. We’ll be taking care of you for the duration of your flight.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Liam said with a polite nod.\nEmily stepped forward gracefully, gesturing to his seat.\n\"Refreshments are ready, sir. Would you prefer champagne, sparkling water, or perhaps fresh juice to begin?\" she asked with her smooth voice.\n\"Water, please. Sparkling,\" Liam replied as he slid into his sear and slowly ran across the buttery leather armrest, feeling the texture of it against his skin.\n\"Of course.\"\nWithin seconds, Emily returned with a crystal glass resting on a silver tray, tiny beads of condensation sliding down its sides. She placed it gently on the table beside him, along with a neatly folded napkin.\nMason and Nick had already boarded and taken their places at the rear of the cabin, leaving Liam the expansive forward section to himself.\nClaire leaned slightly, with her beautiful and professional smile.\n\"We’ll be taking off shortly, sir. Please make yourself comfortable.\"\nLiam nodded, watching as the two women moved through the cabin, running through final checks on Mason and Nick, tucking the safety cards and inspecting their belts.\nMinutes later, the door sealed with a gentle thud, and the faint hiss of cabin pressure filled the air. The engines began their low growl, reverberating faintly through the floor.\nLiam turned his head toward the window.\nThe aircraft taxied, lined up on the runway, and then the roar began. The acceleration pressed him back into the seat, and he smiled to himself as the Gulfstream surged forward, faster, faster, until gravity seemed to slip away.\nThe moment of liftoff was exhilarating. The city fell away beneath him. The rows of buildings shrank rapidly, highways turned into threads of silver, and the endless sprawl of Los Angeles became a patchwork quilt of light and concrete.\nHigher, and higher still the plane went.\nThe mountains blurred into distant ridges, the ocean stretched like an endless sheet of glass, and finally, the world below disappeared beneath a soft bed of clouds.\nLiam leaned his head back and sighed, smiling to himself. For some reason, watching the earth shrink beneath him stirred something in his chest. Something like a reminder of how small everything really was.\nHe relaxed into the chair, intending to sleep through the twelve-hour flight. By the time they landed in Geneva, it would already be nighttime.\nOr to be precise, due to the time difference between the Geneva and Los Angeles, they will arrive there early in the morning.\nThe plan was simple: sleep it out, wake refreshed, arrive ready.\nBut the unfortunately for him, the sleep never came.\nSeconds trickled into minutes, and still he lay there, eyes closed but his mind racing. He sighed softly as he opened his eyes and turned his head to the window again.\nThe view was different now. No longer the shrinking city below, but the endless expanse of the sky. It was blue upon blue, stretching forever, broken only by the occasional cotton-like cloud drifting lazily.\nBeautiful\nHis thoughts couldn’t help but return to his quantum ecosystem plan. He had already spent the night refining the idea and now, he now felt that the plan was ready to be executed.\nThe logic was simple, but the implications were massive.\nInstead of releasing the quantum chip outright as a standalone product and placing a nuclear weapon of technology directly into the hands of corporations and governments, he would build a walled ecosystem.\nThe chip would be the foundation, yes, but no one would receive the raw foundation. What they would receive instead were products, platforms, and controlled applications that existed inside his carefully curated ecosystem.\nThe gear glass would be the flagship. A personal device, sleek and wearable, connecting users to the quantum network seamlessly. On the surface, it would look like the ultimate consumer gadget — social media, productivity, entertainment, communication, gaming.\nBut beneath the surface, it would be the gatekeeper.\nHe tapped a finger idly against the armrest, his eyes still fixed on the endless sky.\nThis way, I don’t have to say \"no\" to them. I just have to give them a version of \"yes\" that works on my terms.\nIf corporations or the governments came begging for integration? They could build apps and software inside his ecosystem, but only within the framework he designed. Like tenants renting space, not owners of the building.\nHe thought back to the problems he’d been dreading — the dark scenarios of his chip fueling advanced weapons or bioweapons. The ecosystem would cut that risk down by locking the raw power away.\nBut the truth was that the risk wasn’t entirely wiped out. It would always be there.\nThe thing about the glass gear and the quantum ecosystem is that they are dual-use. They can be used both civilian and military purposes. And there was no helping it.\nThe only two ways he can completely take out the risk would be to not release the tech in the first place. Or to take complete control of the world.\nIn other words, he either gives up helping humanity to advance by leaps and bounds, or he becomes a necessary evil.\nThinking about this, Liam sighed heavily. He was aware that even without the glass gear, the risk was already out there. And the device would only compound the already existing situation.\nGlobal spending on defense now runs into trillions, with the US taking the lead. Weapons of mass destruction are being created on almost a daily basis and lots of people around the world are dying to these weapons.\nBut Liam knew the truth. He can’t do anything about it. Or maybe he can. Maybe he actually can but is he ready to bear the burden of the whole?\nIt’s not going to be an easy decision for a kid to make.\n***\nHours slipped by. Claire and Emily moved through the cabin occasionally, checking on him, offering meals or drinks with polite precision.\nLiam accepted a small tray of fruit and coffee at one point but otherwise kept to himself, as he was still lost in thought.\nBy the time the sun dipped low on the horizon, painting the clouds outside in shades of orange and crimson, Liam finally let out a long, slow breath.\nHe decided to stop thinking about the problem of the world and things out of his control, and just go ahead with his plans for the device and the quantum ecosystem.\nThe dark scenerios can’t be entirely avoided and that was something he would have to live with.\nHe closed his eyes as his eyelids were starting to feel heavy, and slowly, he finally fell asleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 63: Geneva\nLiam was awoken by the soft chime of the intercom system and the calm voice of the pilot drifting through the cabin.\n\"Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We’ll be commencing our descent into Geneva shortly. Please ensure your seat belts are fastened.\"\nHis eyelids fluttered open. For a moment, he felt the faint disorientation that came after an incomplete sleep, the kind where your mind wakes up before your body fully does. The low hum of the jet’s engines vibrated faintly beneath his seat, a reminder that he was thousands of feet above the ground.\nLiam blinked and turned his head toward the oval window.\nThe sight made him pause.\nGeneva lay beneath him, bathed in the soft golden light of dawn. The sun was already up, but it hung low, a burnished disc casting its glow over the horizon.\nWhat caught his attention was the lake that spread out like a mirror, vast and calm, reflecting streaks of orange, pink, and pale blue. From this height, it looked like molten glass had been poured into the valley between the mountains.\nAround it, red-tiled rooftops gleamed under the dawn, their pale stone façades and ornate balconies forming neat clusters around winding streets.\nLiam spotted patches of green — parks dotted with early morning joggers — and to the west, the silhouettes of the Alps rose like ancient guardians, their peaks still capped with streaks of snow despite the season.\n\"Wow...\" he muttered softly, his breath fogging the window briefly.\nThe city was beautiful in a different way than Los Angeles. Where LA was sprawling chaos and energy, Geneva was precision and grace.\nClaire, one of the hostess, appeared beside him with a polite smile, checking that his belt was secured.\n\"We’ll be landing in about fifteen minutes, Mr. Scott. Would you like me to close the blinds for you?\"\nLiam shook his head lightly, eyes still glued to the view. \"No. I’d like to see it.\"\n\"Of course,\" she said with a small bow before moving on.\nThe Gulfstream began its descent, angling down gently. The world below grew larger and more detailed.\nSoon, he could make out the Jet d’Eau — Geneva’s iconic fountain — shooting a column of water high into the morning air.\nEven from this distance, the plume looked majestic, a single defiant stream against the expanse of the lake.\nAs they came lower, he caught sight of the bridges linking the two halves of the city. Tiny cars crawled across them like worker ants.\nThe streets were coming alive with cafés setting out chairs, trams sliding silently along their tracks, pedestrians moving in unhurried clusters.\nThe aircraft glided lower still, until the details sharpened: the tiled roofs, the church spires, the clean-cut lines of modern glass buildings standing shoulder to shoulder with centuries-old architecture.\nTo those familiar with history unlike Liam, the view was like seeing two worlds — old Europe and new finance — coexisting in harmony.\nThen came the rumble of the wheels extending beneath them, and the low voice of the captain once again.\n\"Cabin crew, please take your seats for landing.\"\nLiam inhaled deeply and leaned back into his chair. The runway appeared in the distance, a grey strip bordered by lush green fields that stretched out to the foothills beyond. The descent quickened, the ground rushed upward, and then —\nThud.\nThe wheels made contact with the tarmac, sending a gentle vibration through the cabin. The engines roared as the jet slowed, the world outside blurring until finally it steadied into a smooth taxi. Liam exhaled slowly.\n\"Welcome to Geneva,\" the co-pilot’s voice announced cheerfully. \"Local time is 7:45 AM, and the weather is clear with a temperature of fourteen degrees Celsius. We thank you for flying with us and wish you a pleasant stay.\"\nThe plane rolled gracefully to a halt near a private terminal, where a sleek black car was already waiting.\nLiam unbuckled, rose from his seat, and stretched subtly. Mason and Nick followed behind as he descended the steps, the cool morning air brushing his face.\nWaiting for him was a black Maybach S-Class, its glossy finish reflecting the rising sun. The driver — a tall Swiss man in a perfectly cut suit — bowed slightly as Mason opened the rear door.\n\"Bienvenue à Genève, Monsieur Scott,\" the driver greeted in accented English.\n\"Thank you,\" Liam said as he slid into the car’s interior, Mason settling beside him while Nick occupied the front seat.\nThough he didn’t understand a word the man say, he knew that it was a greeting.\nThe Maybach purred to life, pulling away from the tarmac and merging onto the pristine roads leading into the city.\nAs they drove through the streets of Geneva, the city revealed itself slowly, like a painting being unrolled.\nFirst came the outskirts — clean highways bordered by manicured greenery, traffic light but orderly. Bicyclists zipped along designated lanes, their movements smooth and efficient.\nLiam noticed how quiet everything seemed, even with cars passing by. The usual chaos of honking horns and engines revving, so common in Los Angeles, was absent here.\nSoon, the Maybach crossed into the heart of the city. Liam’s gaze flicked between the sights outside his window.\nHistoric buildings lined the boulevards, their façades adorned with intricate stonework, wrought-iron balconies, and colorful shutters. Many bore flags — Swiss crosses fluttering in the breeze, alongside the insignias of international organizations.\nThe closer they came to the lake, the more vibrant it became. Cafés spilled onto sidewalks, their tables already occupied by early risers sipping espresso. Pastry shops displayed croissants and tarts behind glass counters, and Liam could almost smell their aroma.\nThen the Maybach curved along the edge of Lake Geneva itself, and Liam’s breath caught again.\nThe lake was enormous up close, a vast expanse of shimmering blue stretching toward the horizon.\nSwans drifted gracefully across its surface, while small sailboats dotted the waters, their white sails like brushstrokes against the canvas of the morning.Googlᴇ search NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nAnd there — towering into the sky — was the Jet d’Eau he had seen from the air.\nUp close, it was even more impressive, a plume of water roaring upward, glinting like liquid silver in the sunlight.\n\"This city...\" Liam muttered softly, his voice almost lost to the hum of the car.\nIt felt alive but not overwhelming. It was refined and balanced.\nThe Maybach drove past the United Nations headquarters, its row of flags standing tall and fluttering in the breeze.\nLiam’s eyes lingered briefly on the massive building and the flags. Seeing them reminded him that this was not just a city of beauty, but one of politics and power. A global stage where decisions shaping nations were quietly made.\nFrom there, they crossed into a quieter district. The streets narrowed, the shops more boutique in nature.\nWatchmakers, jewelers, luxury fashion houses — their displays glittered beneath carefully placed lights.\nThe Maybach finally slowed as it approached a towering building of glass and steel that reflected the morning sky. It was subtle but unmistakable. This was one of Geneva’s finest hotels.\nThe driver pulled smoothly to the entrance, where attendants in tailored uniforms rushed forward to open the doors.\n\"Welcome, Mr. Scott,\" the hotel manager greeted warmly, bowing slightly as Liam stepped out.\nHis French-accented English was perfect and his smile, though obviously rehearsed rehearsed, was genuine.\nLiam returned the smile politely and followed him into the establishment.\nThe lobby was a work of art — marble floors gleaming beneath chandeliers, soft music playing from hidden speakers, staff and guests moving around quietly.\nEscorted swiftly, Liam entered a private elevator that rose smoothly to the highest floor. The penthouse suite awaited.\nThe door opened into a vast space that nearly stole his breath again. Floor-to-ceiling windows stretched across the walls, offering an uninterrupted view of Lake Geneva and the mountains beyond. Plush furniture filled the living area, accented with subtle gold trims and modern artwork.\nMason and Nick moved discreetly, checking the rooms and securing the suite, but Liam hardly noticed.\nHe walked straight toward the master bedroom. The moment he saw the massive king-sized bed dressed in crisp white linens, he felt his body ache with anticipation.\nDropping his jacket onto a nearby chair, he collapsed onto the bed, sinking into the mattress.\n\"Finally, now I can sign-in for the day\" he muttered with a smile.\nHe had put it off because of the flight but now that he was free, there was nothing holding him back.\n\"System, sign-in.\"\n[Ding!]",

Not that I wasn’t expecting it. That’s another $1.7b added to my net worth.Thank you, system.\nWith the addition of today’s 0.05% Applē shares reward, Liam’s net worth has gone up from its value of $29b yesterday to $30.7b!\nAnd the best thing about this was that the he would probably continue to receive the 0.05% shares for the next few days until probably his third weekly sign-in.\nThis means that his net worth will grow by a guaranteed $1.7b daily throughout the week.\nNow, tell me who wouldn’t be happy with something like this? Even those that say money doesn’t buy happiness will definitely have a bright smile on his face if they find themselves in such a situation.\nLiam couldn’t help smiling from ear to ear, imagining seeing the 0.05% everyday for the rest of the week.\nBut he didn’t allow himself to get lost in his own thoughts, as he turned to the remaining rewards.\nUniversal Linguistics...\nThe name of the skill already made it self-explanatory but when he thought about it, information about it flooded into his mind.\n[\nUniversal Linguistics\n: This skill grants the Host immediate and flawless comprehension of all spoken, written, and symbolic languages in all universes. This includes ancient, extinct, coded, and artificial tongues. It enables instant understanding of meaning, tone, and context, ability to speak any language with native-level fluency, accent, and cultural nuance and automatic interpretation of idioms, proverbs, and connotations without error. Written and symbolic languages are processed as naturally as breathing.\n[Note: Host also perceives intent behind words, minimizing risk of deception through linguistic trickery.]\n\"Wow! What an amazing skill! As expected, the system always knows how to outdo itself,\" Liam muttered to himself softly.\nHis initial thoughts and impression about the skill was that it would enable him to understand and fluently speak any type of language. But its description had made him understand that the skill goes beyond that.\nHe doesn’t even need to do a lot of thinking before guessing the reason why the system gave him the skill. And he was really grateful.\nNow that he has the skill, he finally understood what the driver had said to him.\nBienvenue à Genève, Monsieur Scott. Welcome to Geneva, Mr. Scott.\nDue to the skill, the man’s words were simply just translated to English, but with its full weight.\nThe man’s words was a polite, formal greeting layered with Swiss hospitality and professional respect, genuine and free of hidden intent.\nWow! What an envious skill. With it, I can finally do what some people dream of.\nAnd what is this dream? Being able to watch anime in Japanese without subtitle and fully understand everything they are saying. Also being able to watch any movie in its original language and listen to any song sang in any language, and fully understanding what they are saying!\nThe skill was practical and godly. With it, if he travel to any non-English speaking country, he will be able to interact without any problem.\nAnd I won’t get with that phrase, \"You speak English because it’s the only language you understand, and I respond in English because it’s the only language you understand.\"\nLiam smiled to himself as he imagined possible funny scenarios of shocking people by fluently speaking their language and in their own dialect.\nNow, the last reward. Geneva Crest.\nHe immediately took the item out of the inventory and a slim platinum card materialised in his hand.\nHe observed the card and the intertwined crests of the Rothschild banking dynasty and the Swiss cross engraved on it immediately caught his attention.\nAlso, information about the card flowed into his mind.\n\"Wow!\" Liam muttered slowly, after absorbing the information about the card.\nJust as one would already guess, the card wasn’t a simple card. In fact, its name and the two crests engraved on it was already more than enough for one to know.\nThe card is issued by the family to only the clients of the private vault and it signals the client’s verified lineage and financial standing.\nIt’s to be presented disceetly upon arrival and the staffs would immediately shift to ultra-deferential treatment the moment it’s shown.\nIn public elite circles (political dinners, global finance forums, etc.), flashing it - even casually - is enough to silence doubts and open doors. It’s not just access; it’s also a symbol of belonging to the 0.0001%.\nYeah, in other words; it’s the ultimate black card that anyone can have.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\n\"Nice!\" Liam muttered slowly, as he studied the card more.\nHe turned it over to the back and slowly ran his fingers on the surface, and he noticed something that he had missed before.\n\"Hmmm... It seems to be micro-engraved,\" he said to himself, as he felt the invisible engravings on the card’s surface.\nXVII-GC-011.\nImmediately, more information flowed into his head.\nI see... So, it means the 17th lineage batch, Geneva Crest client #11.\nLiam smiled to himself in satisfaction of today’s sign-in rewards as he placed the Crest back into the inventory. The rewards today were wonderful. The shares and the skill were the highlight, and the card was the cherry on top.\nHe will be going to the private vault tomorrow and he will finally get to know what’s really inside the safe deposit box.\nHe didn’t want to guess about its possible content. He wants to see it for himself. But one thing he knew was that he won’t be disappointed.\nThe system is very good at pulling surprises and tomorrow won’t be any different.\nNow while he wait for tomorrow, Liam has to think of what to do with the whole day.\nActually there was no need thinking about it as he already has an idea of what to do.\nHe will order himself breakfast first. The meal prepared by the kitchen of a 5-star hotel in one of the most upscale places in the world should definitely taste heavenly.\nAfter the meal, he will take a lakeside stroll and go on a little sightseeing. His plan for coming to Geneva wasn’t just for the private vault, he also want to use the opportunity to experience new things. But he won’t be able to do that if he locks himself up in the penthouse suite.\nBeside the lakeside stroll, he has no idea but he felt that as he walk around, he would see things that interest him.\nBut before all that, breakfast first. He turned to the nightstand and picked up the in-room control tab, and started browsing through the establishment’s exclusive breakfast menu.\nIt took him a minute to make his selection. And now, he will wait.",

      "content": "Chapter 65: Soothing Lakeside Walk\nThe knock on the door came just as Liam was stretching lazily on the bed.\n\"Room service,\" a polite voice called.\nHe rose and walked to the living room where he was greeted by a staff member in a sharp uniform pushing in a polished cart draped with white linen. The aroma from the items on the cart filled his nose immediately.\nThe staff member laid everything out carefully on the low dining table by the window before bowing slightly and retreating.\n\"Merci, monsieur,\" Liam replied softly, fluently and flawlessly, with his World-Class Etiquette skill making his tone carry just the right balance of courtesy and warmth.\nOnce the door shut, he sat down before the spread.\nThere was nothing overly elaborate about the meal—just a plate of eggs benedict, a side of rösti potatoes crisped to golden perfection, smoked trout with a slice of lemon, a small basket of croissants, and a carafe of freshly squeezed orange juice.\nBut to Liam, it wasn’t \"just breakfast.\"\nThe moment his fork sliced into the poached egg, releasing its golden yolk onto the buttery hollandaise sauce, his Culinary Arts skill went to work unbidden. He didn’t mean to analyze, but the layers of taste unfolded automatically in his mind.\nThe eggs were free-range, boiled for exactly four minutes thirty seconds, cooled in a bath to preserve their texture. The hollandaise had the faint sharpness of tarragon, a whisper of white wine vinegar. The rösti was grated with the right balance between coarse and fine shreds, pan-fried in clarified butter until crisp without being greasy. Even the croissants—he could almost see the countless folds of butter and dough layered into the pastry.\nHis enhanced senses made every flavor richer, every aroma sharper, every texture clearer. It was as though the meal played a symphony only he could fully hear.\nBut instead of overwhelming him, he allowed himself to enjoy it and he didn’t eat quickly or absentmindedly. He savored every bite, smiling faintly as he leaned back and sipped his orange juice.\n\"Not bad,\" he murmured to himself. \"Not bad at all.\"\nOnce he was done, Liam pushed the cart aside and rose from the table. He smoothed down his shirt and walked toward the suite’s front door.\nAs expected, Mason and Nick were already waiting in the hallway. Both men straightened slightly the moment the door opened.\nMason gave a respectful nod when he saw him.\n\"Is the car ready?\" Liam smiled and asked.\n\"Yes, sir,\" Nick answered. \"It’s waiting in the garage.\"ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\n\"Good. Let’s go.\"\nThe three of them moved together down the corridor, their steps muffled on the thick carpet.\nThe exclusive elevator was already waiting by the time they reached it, whisking them smoothly down past the lobby and into the private garage where a Maybach S-Class was parked.\nThe three of them got into the car and after they were comfortable, Nick started the car.\nThe car purred to life, pulling out of the garage and onto Geneva’s pristine streets.\n\"Take us to the lakeside,\" Liam instructed casually.\n\"Yes, sir,\" Nick replied, guiding the car toward the heart of the city.\nThe drive was smooth, almost soothing. Geneva passed by in frames of elegance: neatly aligned townhouses with painted shutters, boutiques with glittering window displays, narrow streets where cyclists glided past unhurriedly.\nA few minutes later, Lake Geneva appeared in the distance, its vast surface glittering under the morning sun. Nick guided the car along the waterfront until Liam raised his hand.\n\"Here’s fine. Stop.\"\nNick eased the car toward a discreet corner, parking neatly. Mason stepped out instantly and opened Liam’s door.\nThe moment Liam’s shoes touched the ground, he inhaled deeply.\nCool, fresh air filled his lungs, carrying with it the faint briny scent of the lake and the subtle sweetness of blooming flowers from the nearby parks. His lips curved into a genuine smile.\n\"This... this feels good.\"\nHe stepped away from the Maybach, his hands sliding casually into his pockets as he began strolling along the lakeside path.\nMason followed behind, close enough to intervene if needed but far enough not to intrude. Nick remained with the car, his eyes scanning the surroundings like a hawk.\nThe lakeside was alive with morning energy. Joggers passed in steady rhythm, their shoes thudding softly against the pavement. Couples strolled hand-in-hand. Children laughed as they fed bread crumbs to swans gliding gracefully across the lake’s surface.\nTourists clustered by the railing, taking photos of the famous Jet d’Eau. Its towering spray rose high into the air, scattering droplets that sparkled like diamonds under the sun.\nLiam walked slowly, deliberately, letting himself soak in the view. His senses caught everything—the crisp rustle of leaves in the breeze, the chatter of French, German, and Italian mixing in the air, the faint warmth of sunlight against his skin.\nHe felt... alive.\n\"Fuuu...\" He let out a soft sigh, his breath mingling with the air.\nHe continued walking for hours, losing track of time as the lake carried him along its edge. His mind wandered, sometimes to the system, sometimes to his plans, and sometimes to nothing at all.\nBy the time he finally slowed, the sun was past its zenith, casting the lake in brighter shades of silver. His body wasn’t tired—not with his enhanced stamina—but he decided it was time to rest.\nScanning the street, he spotted a café. Its small patio was lined with tables shaded by cream-colored umbrellas.\nLiam’s smile returned.\n\"Perfect.\"\nHe crossed the street with Mason shadowing him discreetly, and walked to the café. The bell above the café door chimed as he stepped inside.\nThe aroma filled his nose immediately. Freshly ground coffee, warm pastries, faint hints of chocolate and vanilla. Inside, the décor was simple but elegant: wooden beams, chalkboard menus, and shelves stacked with jars of roasted beans.\nConversations flowed softly around him, a mix of locals and tourists sipping their drinks, tapping on laptops, or leafing through newspapers.\nFor Liam, it was a welcome change of pace.\nHe picked a corner seat by the window, allowing him a perfect view of both the lake and the café’s interior, and made his order.",

Though nothing out of the ordinary happened as all he did was take a stroll along the lakeside, it was quite enjoyable for him.\nIt might sound strange since he didn’t really do anything or experience anything special. But he actually did. He got to experience a new place and see different people.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nLiam exhaled softly and made himself more comfortable in his bed, ready to sleep. Though the night was still young, he intends to sleep early because of where he’s going tomorrow.\nHe cleared his thoughts and closed his eyes. He slowly drifted off to sleep and the sound of his low breathing filled the near pin quiet room.\n***\nThe next morning.\nLiam woke up early to prepare himself for the very important day. He will going to the private vault in the afternoon, so he has the whole money to get himself ready.\nTo start his day, the first thing to do was to sign-in. That was only natural.\n\"I wonder if I will receive custom wears today too. The system always seems to give them to me on occasions like this,\" he said to himself, the smile never leaving his face.\n\"System, sign-in,\" he said without wasting anymore time.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, you received $10,000,000]\n[You received 0.05% shares of\n[You received a custom-made watch: Vacheron Constantin \"Geneva Sovereign\"]\n[You received a custom-made suit: Brioni Privé \"Aurora Platinum\"]\n[You received custom-made shoe: Berluti Bespoke \"Himalayan Scritto\"]\n[Note: The shoe, watch and suit are in the inventory.]\n***\nJust as I thought,\nLiamsmiled.\nHe had already expected the rewards and so, they were really no surprise to him. But he was slightly surprised by the cash reward. He wasn’t expecting it. But of course, it’s a welcomed and greatly appreciated.\nThe cash reward of $10m has increased his account balance to $64m. The road to $100m was still far but it wasn’t completely out of sight.\nJust a few days left.\nAs for the second reward, the 0.05% Applē shares? It brought a smile to his face as it was an additional $1.7b to his net worth, increasing the total to $32.4b.\nBut the shares and the cash weren’t the only rewards he received today, he also received another set of custom wears.\nLiam first retrieved the watch from the inventory and a high quality watch appeared in his hand.\nHe observed it carefully as information about it flowed into his head. He went through its information and he was blown away.\nJust the fact the brand name and the fact it’s a one-off is enough to tell one how high-end it is.\nPlatinum case, deep blue enamel dial, and a discreet engraving of the Geneva Seal. It was simple and sophisticated at the same time.\nAccording to its information, it was commissioned for $500,000. It sounded cheap right? But what if he tells you that the potential auction price for the watch is $20-30m?\nImpossible? In fact, it can even go higher than that but this was just a safe estimate on his part.\nThe system just keeps giving me valuable asset,\nLiam smiled with gratitude on his face.\nHe placed the watch on the nightstand and retrieved the shoe from the inventory. It appeared in his hand and just like the watch, its information flowed into his head.\nHandcrafted black oxford shoes made from rare Himalayan crocodile leather, polished to a mirror shine.\nAnd with a commission price of $40,000. Not bad. Not bad at all,\nLiam nodded in satisfaction.\nThough he was still getting used to luxury items, with a little help from his etiquette skill, he was already starting to develop a sense of recognition for them.\nHe took an observative look at the shoe and smiled. He placed it beside his bed and retrieved the final item from the store, the suit.\nA deep midnight blue, three-piece suit materialised in his hand. The same happened with the first two items and Liam got information on it.\nThe suit was woven from vicuña wool which is the the rarest and most expensive natural fiber in the world. The suit also has subtle threads of platinum woven into the fabric, making it shimmer faintly under the light without looking flashy. And the cut is razor-sharp, tailored perfectly to his frame.\n\"I guess it’s worth it commission price of $250,000,\" Liam muttered to himself, as he placed the suit on the bed and stood up from the bed to go take his bath.\nAfter he was done, he got dressed in something light and picked up the tab and ordered breakfast.\nWhile he waited, hedecided to retrieve the platinum card from the inventory. It materialised in his hand and he turned it over, observing it for a few moments before placing on the nightstand.\nThe next moment, his phone started ringing and when he checked the caller ID, he saw that it was Daniel.\nHe picked the call and leaned back into the pillows, the phone pressed against his ear. Daniel’s calm and professional voice came through the line.\n\"Mr. Scott,\" Daniel said, his tone measured yet warm, \"I’m pleased to inform you that your company’s creation has been finalized as of this morning.\nThe documents have been signed, the structures layered properly, and the subsidiaries positioned under the trust. Everything has been filed under multiple jurisdictions for maximum privacy.\"\nLiam blinked slowly, still digesting the words. He glanced at the suit laid neatly across the bedspread.\n\"You mean... it’s done already?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Daniel confirmed. \"In fact, it was finalized late last night, but I wanted to wait until this morning before calling, to ensure everything was triple-checked. You now own a fully operational holding company, with your primary tech company seated beneath it.\"\nLiam chuckled softly, shaking his head. \"I’ll admit, I was expecting it to take... maybe a week. Two days? That’s faster than I imagined.\"\nHe had expected to take a week at least but not two days.\nThere was a smile in Daniel’s voice as he replied, \"When you’re a client at your level, delays don’t exist. And truthfully, Mr. Scott, JP Morgan has entire teams dedicated to fast-tracking structures for ultra-high-net-worth individuals like you. Your situation is... unique, but not beyond our capacity.\"\n\"Unique,\" Liam repeated, smiling.\nThat was one way to put it.\nDaniel continued. \"Now that the company exists, the next step is finding a physical base of operations. I assume you won’t want to house advanced prototypes or manufacturing in your residence.\"\n\"Of course not,\" Liam said immediately, his tone firm. \"Bellemere Mansion is a home, not a factory. The tech I plan to release... it needs a secure and discreet location. Something that doesn’t attract unnecessary attention.\"\n\"Precisely,\" Daniel said. \"I’ve already started putting together options. You’ll need two types of spaces. The first: a corporate headquarters — something prestigious, public-facing, that cements your company’s brand in the eyes of the market. The second: a discreet, high-security industrial site for research, development, and manufacturing. I’d like to hear your thoughts on both.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 67: Talk With Daniel\nPrestigious? Public-facing?\nLiam rubbed his chin thoughtfully, his gaze shifting to the window where the morning sunlight poured across Lake Geneva.\nHe doesn’t really care about things like prestige. What he is creating is just a normal Silicon Valley start-up. At least, that’s what it would look like on the surface.\n\"For the headquarters... I want something impressive, yes, but not overbearing.\"\n\"Understood,\" Daniel said smoothly. \"A balance between presence and subtlety. I can source options in Los Angeles, San Francisco, or even New York — prime markets where corporate prestige carries weight. Do you have a preference?\"\n\"Los Angeles,\" Liam said after a brief pause. \"It’s where I live, and it’ll allow me to stay close while the company grows. But it has to be modern.\"\n\"Very good,\" Daniel replied, the sound of typing faint in the background. \"I’ll identify available towers and development opportunities in LA’s business district. Now, regarding the second site — the industrial base. This is where I need clarity on your requirements.\"\nLiam’s expression hardened slightly. \"Privacy. Above all else. I don’t want regulators peeking in every week. And I don’t want neighbors wondering why a building suddenly pulls the same amount of power as a stadium.\"\nThere was a quiet pause on the other end before Daniel said, \"Then I recommend two things. First, you’ll want to position the site under a shell company — something innocuous, like a logistics or advanced materials firm. Second, the location itself. If discretion is key, Nevada offers excellent options. Desert land, easy zoning for industrial facilities, low population density, and proximity to power grids. We can purchase a large parcel and build the infrastructure from scratch.\"\nLiam considered that. Desert isolation. Space. No prying neighbors. \"That sounds ideal. I’ll need enough space for... let’s just say, fit a shipping container.\"\nThe molecular assembler wasn’t a small device but it wasn’t too big either. Making the industrial base the size of a shipping container will give him enough space to do whatever he wants to do with the device.\n\"Noted,\" Daniel said calmly, as though Liam had just asked for extra office printers. \"I’ll secure a short list of sites within twenty-four hours. You’ll have the final say, of course.\"\n\"Good.\" Liam shifted against the pillows. \"And the headquarters? How soon before I can walk into my own building?\"\n\"That depends on whether you’d prefer to buy an existing tower or commission a new one,\" Daniel explained. \"An acquisition can be completed within weeks. A new development would take years but would give you full control of the design.\"\n\"I don’t want to wait years,\" Liam said firmly. \"Find me something I can buy and brand as mine.\"\nThere was no way he will want to wait years for the headquarters building when he plans to start working on the device by next week.\n\"Understood,\" Daniel said again, his voice as smooth as silk. \"I’ll have both sets of options prepared. Once you return from Switzerland, we’ll sit down and review.\"\nLiam smiled faintly at that. \"Switzerland...\" He glanced at the platinum card still resting on his nightstand, the Geneva Crest catching the morning light. \"Daniel, about the vault — everything is confirmed?\"\n\"Yes,\" Daniel said. \"I contacted the Rothschild office yesterday on your behalf. They’re expecting you this afternoon. If you have a card, it will serve as verification. Present it when you arrive, and their staff will take you directly into the secured wing.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam murmured. \"That was my biggest concern.\"\n\"Mr. Scott,\" Daniel said, his tone softening slightly, \"I want to remind you: this isn’t like withdrawing cash from a bank. The Rothschild Private Vault is one of the most secure and secretive institutions in the world. The people you’ll see there are... not ordinary. Please handle yourself with care.\"\nLiam chuckled softly. \"You think I’ll embarrass myself?\"\n\"No,\" Daniel replied with a trace of humor. \"On the contrary. I think you’ll fit in far too well.\"\nHe has no idea why but he felt that he needed to say that. He wasn’t looking down on Liam due to his age. Rather, he was worried for him.\nLiam was someone with an unclear background. No one knows which family he belongs to or has ties to. All they know was that he’s someone with great financial power or from an unknown family of great financial power—a power they have yet to confirm anything about.\nFor a moment, Liam said nothing. He looked at the suit spread across his bed, the platinum-threaded fabric catching the sunlight.\nHe wasn’t worried about anything. He has immense confidence due to his etiquette skill. He knew that with it, he’d walk into that vault looking and behaving like he’d belonged there all his life.\n\"Thank you, Daniel,\" Liam said finally. His voice carried genuine warmth. \"For everything. You’ve made all of this far easier than it should be.\"\n\"That’s my role, Mr. Scott. To make the impossible seem effortless,\" Daniel said.\nThey exchanged a few final words before Liam ended the call.\nHe set the phone down and exhaled. He was happy that things with the company was moving in an incredible pace. And it was all thanks to Daniel.\nAs for the construction of the industrial base, he has no idea how long it will take to be completed. But he estimates it to take two to three weeks max.\nEither way, I hope it shouldn’t take too long. But while I wait for it, I will look into acquiring traits. I’m curious to see what will change with each trait.\nThe following moment, a knock from the door, followed by Mason’s voice informing him that the staff member was here with his breakfast order.\nHe got up from the bed and walked to the living room. The staff has already been let in by Mason and was wheeling the food cart to the table. She set the meal on the table, nodded respectfully and left.\nLiam smiled at the spread in front of him and started eating. He ate at a moderate pace, enjoying the meal.\nAfter he was done, he lay back relaxed on the sofa. There was still a few hours more but he doesn’t feel like doing anything while he wait.\nAs he waited, time passed painfully slow but it still passed all the same, and it was finally time.\nLiam already dressed, walked to the front door. He opened it and stepped out. Mason and Nick greeted him and he gave a small nod.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nHe started walking down the hallway.

      "content": "Chapter 68: Rothschild Private Vault\nThe black Maybach S-Class rolled through the immaculate streets of Geneva, its glossy body glinting beneath the late morning sun.\nNick drove with steady and professional hands. Mason was seated silently beside him, while Liam leaned back in the rear seat, gazing out at the passing scenery.\nThough he tried to appear calm, his heart carried quite a bit of anticipation.\nA bit? Wrong! A lot!\nWhere he was going to was the Rothschild Private Vault.\nAccording to the information he got about the facility from Daniel, it was a place whispered about in very low voices in the uppermost tiers of finance as a fortress for the world’s greatest fortunes. To most, it was a rumor. To the rare few invited, it was reality.\nElite bankers called it the \"vault for the vault owners.\"\nIt was not a branch office and it was no ordinary safe deposit room tucked into the basement of a commercial bank.\nNo, this was a standalone fortress. An underground chambers built beneath layers of reinforced concrete and steel.\nIt’s strictly invitation-only and its client list included dynasties, royalty, and individuals whose names moved nations.\nNo digital records were ever kept online; the vault’s inventories existed entirely offline, immune even to state-level cyberattacks.\nLiam’s fingers brushed the cuff of his Brioni Privé suit, the platinum-threaded fabric shimmering faintly in the sunlight streaming through the tinted windows. The Vacheron Constantin \"Geneva Sovereign\" ticked gently on his wrist.\nThough the vault was barely a five-minute drive from his hotel, it wasn’t a place one could approach casually. No one can simply walked to the Rothschild Private Vault.\nThey dare not.\nThey say the wealthy are eccentric but this wasn’t a place to try something like that.\nArrival was part of presentation. It was a performance of power.\nNick guided the Maybach down a quiet avenue, lined with discreet but stately buildings — law firms, private banks, diplomatic residences. The car slowed as they approached their destination.\n\"There, sir,\" Mason murmured.\nLiam lifted his eyes and saw it.\nThe facility’s exterior was striking not for opulence, but for restraint.\nA towering façade of pale stone and dark glass rose from the street, its architecture a blend of classical gravitas and modern elegance.\nThe columns flanking the entrance were carved with faint, abstract patterns that caught the light without revealing their meaning.\nAbove the doors, no sign bore the name of the institution. Only a subtle crest — a golden shield interlaced with the Swiss cross — hinted at the building’s identity.\nPower, Liam realized, didn’t need to announce itself.\nThe Maybach rolled to a stop at the curb. Nick killed the engine. Mason stepped out first, circling swiftly to open Liam’s door.\n\"Sir,\" Mason said, his voice low but firm.\nLiam stepped out. The crisp air touched his face as he stood before the building. For a moment, he let his gaze travel upward, taking in the subtle intimidation of the architecture. His fingers brushed his cufflink once more, an unconscious gesture of composure.\n\"Let’s go,\" He exhaled softly.\nTogether, they crossed the short flight of steps.\nThe massive double doors slid open soundlessly as they approached. Inside, a lobby unfolded — high-ceilinged, lined with dark marble, its polished surface reflecting the glow of recessed lighting.\nThe atmosphere was hushed, as though the air itself demanded silence.\nA reception desk of black granite stood at the far end, manned by two attendants in tailored navy suits. They looked up at the trio’s approach, their expressions neutral, professional, but watchful.\n\"Bonjour, messieurs,\" one of them greeted politely in French-accented English. \"May I assist you?\"\nLiam stepped forward, his movements unhurried, graceful. His voice was calm when he spoke.\n\"I’m here to access my safe deposit box.\"\nThe attendant gave a courteous nod. \"Of course. May I have your credentials?\"\nWithout hesitation, Liam reached into his inner pocket and produced the platinum card — the Geneva Crest — from the inventory.\nHe could just say his name but he understood that the card was better.\nAnd just as expected, the moment the card touched the desk, the atmosphere shifted.\nThe attendant’s composure tightened almost imperceptibly. His eyes flicked to the intertwined crests engraved into the platinum: the Rothschild insignia and the Swiss cross.\nFor a split second, he froze. Then he inclined his head deeply, a gesture bordering on deference.\n\"Of course, monsieur,\" the attendant said again, this time with a note of respect.\nHe picked up the card with both hands, almost ceremoniously, and scanned its engraved code against a secure reader.\nThe machine emitted a soft chime of verification.\nHis colleague straightened, his own expression subtly altered — no longer merely professional, but deferential.\n\"Welcome, Mr. Scott,\" the second attendant said, bowing slightly. \"If you’ll follow me, we will escort you to your vault.\"\nMason and Nick fell followed behind Liam as the attendant led them past the reception desk and into a discreet hallway.\nThe deeper they walked, the heavier the atmosphere became. Security was layered into every step. Cameras tracked silently from above. Discreet guards stood at intervals, their suits concealing more than polite manners.\nThey passed through a biometric checkpoint, where the attendant presented Liam’s card once more. The heavy steel doors slid open with a muted hiss.\nBeyond lay a wide corridor, its walls lined with reinforced steel and adorned with subtle patterns of gold.\nThe air grew cooler.\nFinally, they arrived at a second checkpoint — a smaller chamber guarded by two men whose eyes assessed Liam in silence.\nAt another scan of the card, the guards stepped aside, pressing their palms to hidden panels.\nThe chamber doors parted.\nLiam entered a vast underground hall.\nRows of vault doors stretched out like an endless grid, each marked only by a discreet number. The silence here was absolute, broken only by the faint hum of the air system. The scent of steel and stone lingered faintly in the air, sterile and immutable.\n\"This way, monsieur,\" the attendant said softly, guiding him deeper.\nThey reached a section marked with subtle gilded trim — a reserved zone. Stopping before one of the vault doors, the attendant turned to Liam.\n\"Here is your safe deposit box,\" he said. His tone carried that same deference as before.\n\"Thank you,\" Liam inclined his head.\nThe attendant bowed slightly. \"We will leave you to your privacy, monsieur. Should you require anything, simply press the bell.\"\nWith that, he and the other attendant stepped back. Mason and Nick silently remained a respectful distance behind.\nLiam reached into his pocket.\nThe small, platinum key materialized in his hand as he retrieved silently from the inventory.\nHe took the key out of his pocket and studied it for a moment, then slid it into the lock.\nIt’s called a safe deposit box but it’s actually a private vault. I guess that’s why it’s called the vault of the vault owners.\nThe vault’s mechanism turned smoothly, almost too smoothly, and with a faint click, the door unlocked.\nHe pulled it open and the heavy vault door eased open with a soft hiss, revealing a chamber no larger than a walk-in closet.\nThe interior of the vault was not one single container, but sectioned into twelve narrow compartments, each shaped like a long, elegant lockbox built seamlessly into the steel walls.\nLiam’s eyes swept the rows. There were no labels, no identifiers. But for reasons he couldn’t explain, his hand moved instinctively to the fourth compartment.\nThe brushed steel panel slid out smoothly when he pulled, revealing a velvet-lined interior.\nResting inside was a single object.\nA sheet of paper.\nA paper?\nLiam thought inwardly, his brows furrowing.\nThat was what it looked like at first glance, especially to someone as ignorant as Liam. A piece of paper. But it’s actual appearance is like an oversized antique certificate — heavy parchment with ornate borders, elaborate engravings, and faded calligraphic lettering, the kind of thing that resembled a cross between a diploma and a stock certificate, complete with embossed seals and faint rows where coupons might once have been clipped.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nThe contrast struck him hard. After all the mystique, all the reverence surrounding the vault, was his grand reveal nothing more than... paper?\nStill, something about it drew him in. Also, he was aware that nothing from the system was ever ordinary.\nCuriously, he reached inside and took out the paper.\nThe moment his fingers brushed the strange surface, a torrent of information slammed into his mind.\nA few seconds later, Liam looked at the paper in his hand with his eyes wide open in shock.\nHoly...!!!",

      "content": "Chapter 69: Isn’t This A Little Too Fast?\nLiam quickly steadied his breathing. His fingers trembled only slightly as he carefully placed the parchment back into the empty velvet-lined compartment, sliding it shut with a muted click.\nThen he straightened his suit jacket, adjusted his cuffs, and turned back.\nMason and Nick stood a short distance away, their posture unchanged but their eyes sharper than usual.\nThough they have no idea what he had seen, the air around him told them enough.\n\"Let’s go,\" Liam said quietly.\nHis voice was calm. Too calm, even.\nThe attendant appeared almost instantly, as if summoned by the subtle press of the bell Liam hadn’t touched. And his bow was deeper this time.\n\"Monsieur, if you would follow me.\"\nThey retraced their steps through the labyrinth of corridors. The security checkpoints unfolded in reverse order, each one acknowledging the platinum Geneva Crest card with soft chimes and green lights. Guards stepped aside with their gazes lowered in subtle deference.\nAt the biometric chamber, Liam felt the faint brush of cold air on his face as the heavy doors sealed behind them with a hiss. The sound reminded him of finality — as though the vault swallowed secrets and only rarely allowed them out.\nSoon, they emerged back into the marble lobby.\nAs they entered the lobby, a man older than the others, his silver hair combed neatly back approached them. He carried a slim, leather-bound folio in both hands, held with solemnity.\n\"Mr. Scott,\" the man said smoothly, his French-accented English perfectly measured. \"By custom, clients who access lineage certificates or historical instruments may elect to retain them personally... or to leave them under our perpetual custody.\"\nLiam’s expression didn’t change as he asked, \"And if I leave it here?\"\n\"The original will remain in its protected compartment — immune to theft, loss, or damage. In its place, you will receive a Holder’s Attestation,\" the man replied.\nHe opened the folio carefully, revealing a single document: thick vellum paper embossed with both the Rothschild crest and the Geneva Crest seal.\n\"This attestation identifies you as the verified and current bearer. It is recognized within our network of private banks and circles of trust. Should you ever wish to exercise leverage, you need only present this to the right eyes. They will know.\"\nLiam glanced at the document. The seals gleamed faintly in the lobby’s subdued light, and in its lower corner, an elegant code was engraved in platinum ink: XVII-GC-011 — the same sequence etched on his card.\n\"So this is my key,\" Liam smiled.\nThe older man allowed himself the barest ghost of a smile.\n\"Precisely. The bond itself never leaves these halls. That ensures stability. But with this...\" he said and tapped the page lightly with a gloved fingertip, \"...doors will open.\"\nLiam considered it only briefly before nodding.\n\"I’ll take the attestation. Leave the parchment here.\"\n\"Very good, monsieur.\"\nWith practiced hands, the man slipped the document into a discreet black case of calfskin leather, slim enough to fit inside the inner pocket of a suit. He offered it to Liam with both hands, bowing slightly as he did.\nLiam accepted the case, sliding it into his jacket pocket and the inventory.\n\"Thank you,\" he said quietly.\nThe attendant bowed deeper this time. \"It is our honor.\"\n\"Merci, monsieur,\" the earlier attendant said softly as he returned the card with both hands.\nLiam inclined his head slightly, slipping the Geneva Crest back into his inner pocket and into the inventory. He said nothing more as he crossed the lobby.\nThe massive doors opened soundlessly, and the sunlight hit his face again. He paused on the steps for a moment, breathing in the cool Geneva air, before Mason stepped forward to open the Maybach’s door.\nHe slid inside, while Mason and Nick took their places, and the car’s engine purred to life.\nAs they pulled away, the vault’s pale stone façade shrank behind them, vanishing into the calm order of Geneva’s streets.\nBut Liam barely saw any of it.\nHis gaze was fixed on the window, though his mind was elsewhere, as it was still reeling and processing the information the parchment burned its secrets into him.\nIt was already more than obvious that the parchment wasn’t an just an ordinary piece of paper.\nIt never was to begin with and it was miles away from being ordinary.\nIf it was, that man wouldn’t had said those things to him and given him an attestation.\nAs for the the true identity of the parchment? It’s an original 19th-Century bearer bond certificate.\nYeah, you heard that right. It a relic. A very special and an extremely valuable one at that\nThe bearer bond certificate was issued by the now-defunct European empire’s central bank, Austro-Hungarian Bank in 1880.\nAccording to the information that flooded into his head, in the late 19th century, the Austro-Hungarian Empire needed vast amounts of capital — for war expenses, railways, industrialization, and to stabilize their currency.\nAnd so, they issued sovereign debt (bonds) through dynastic banking houses belonging to the Rothschild family and peers like Baring, Warburg.\nThese houses acted as lead underwriters and bought the bonds and sold them to ultra-wealthy clients, aristocrats, royals, and industrial magnates.\nNormally, sovereign bonds matures in like in 30 or 50 years. But these dynastic banks—the Rothschild and others negotiated \"perpetual clauses\" in some issuances.\nThis meant:\nNo fixed maturity date.\nGovernments owed perpetual coupon payments (interest), but the principal never legally expired.\nThese clauses were rare, but when present, they allowed the bond to remain a permanent financial obligation. Which means that no matter how many years has passed and no matter to what amount the bond has grown from accured interest, the governments or their successors must pay.\nAnd Liam’s bond was part of those special bonds. And it now has a value of $28b.\nBut...\nYes, there definitely a but.\nBut there’s the problem of payment\nBy 1918 the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed. Successor states (Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, etc.) were broke.\nMost ordinary bondholders got wiped out or received near-worthless settlements.\nBut the perpetual bonds held in Rothschild vaults — like Liam’s — were never presented for redemption — because:\nPaying them would require governments to cough up sums that could bankrupt them.\nIf the Rothschilds \"demanded\" repayment, it would destabilize the entire post-WWI and later WWII financial system.\nSo What Happens? Isn’t the bond useless as clients can’t cash them in, because even if valid, the scale is politically impossible.\nNo, it’s not useless. Rather, it became even more valuable.\nThere’s a saying that in life, the deepest, hardest-to-repay debts aren’t always financial. They’re favors.\nMoney can be repaid with money. Even huge debts like sovereign loans can be restructured, inflated away, or defaulted on. But a favour, once given, creates an invisible obligation that can hang over someone (or even a government) indefinitely.\nTo put it into context for the bond, governments (like the Austro-Hungarian Empire, France, Britain, etc.) issued bonds through Rothschild banking houses in the 18th–19th centuries because no one else had the capital, network, or credibility to finance them.\nThese bonds were sold to Rothschild’s network of ultra-high-net-worth clients — aristocrats, industrialists, and dynasties across Europe.\nBy buying the bonds, those clients weren’t just investing. They were funding wars, revolutions, railroads, and governments at their most desperate moments.\nMany of those bonds matured decades ago. Some were honored, others defaulted on, and some simply expired in practice.\nBut here’s the catch: the act of buying them in the first place was a favour to governments.\nImagine an emperor or prime minister in crisis who needed immediate liquidity — and a Rothschild client’s wealth saved their skin.\nEven if the \"legal debt\" expired, the political debt lingers. Because these clients essentially gave governments the ability to survive, expand, or win wars.\nSo, these clients essentially did governments massive favours by funding them when no one else would. The \"debts\" can’t really be repaid in money anymore, but they survive as favours owed.\nAnd so, the special bonds held by those clients has become heritage leverage. They are kept in private vaults and whispered about in ultra-elite circles. They are used as collateral or political weapons in private negotiations.\nBut the thing is that even for those ultra-rich clients holding to something of extreme value this, they wouldn’t deal directly with governments because it’s too risky.\nInstead, the Rothschild family themselves mediated — shielding the client while keeping the debt alive as a tool of influence.\nAnd over time, this meant the bond stopped being a \"debt\" in practice and became a dynastic instrument of control.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nLiam sighed as he went through all these information in his head and the implications.\nSo, my name is now at the same level at the Rockefellers, Waltons and those high level families.\nIt was really a lot to process for Liam. The safe deposit box content that he had been curious about, the parchment he had initially called a piece of paper has now made his name into a dynasty level name.\nJust two weeks ago, he had only a total of $20 in his account. But from today onwards, his name will have the same influence as those extreme ultra upperclass families:.\nAll these in two weeks.\nSystem, I know you said that you will make me the most powerful person in the world but isn’t this a little too fast?\n[....]",

      "content": "Chapter 70: Thoughts On Traits\nLiam walked into bedroom of his penthouse suite and collapsed on the bed. He was feeling quite tired—something that shouldn’t be possible due to his current stats. But everything with the bearer bond had managed to drain him a bit mentally.\nHe gazed at the ceiling with his mind still occupied with thoughts related to the bearer bond and everything surrounding it.\nHe was still finding the whole thing to be quite surreal. The system had really changed his life in more ways than he could had ever imagine, and in a very short amount of time.\nLiam smiled and tried to shift his thoughts from the bearer bond, but it wasn’t easy. There was simply too much to process, too much weight behind it.\nThe truth was staggering: he now held something that gave him leverage over the EU itself.\nWhy? Because the countries implicated by the bond were no minor players. After the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed, thirteen successor states emerged. Nine of them — Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Romania, Italy, and Poland — now sat firmly within the EU. The remaining four — Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, Serbia, and Montenegro — circled its orbit.\nAnd here was the irony. If he ever demanded the $28 billion redemption, EU treaties and ECB oversight would block it outright. Payment was impossible.\nBut that impossibility was exactly what gave the bond its real power. It wasn’t money — it was leverage. A shadow credential he could wield in elite negotiations. Doors would open not because anyone intended to pay him, but because no one dared risk him asking in public.\nThere are lot more details behind it but Liam doesn’t really want to go into it. The truth of the matter was that he was worried.\nThe bearer bond is the first thing that he received that will actually make him worried. And he couldn’t help it.\nThe other rewards, though they were of very significant value, they were still things that he could easily come to terms with. They were things that anyone with enough money could get their hands on. But this wasn’t the same with the bearer bond.\nIt now puts him at the same level as the families that controls the world from the background. But these benefits aren’t without their own risks and they are very serious.\nBut fortunately for him, he won’t have to worry about the risks because the bearer bond is under the custody of the Rothschild.\nAnd if there’s one thing the family pride themselves in and the reason why their clients love them so much, it’s because of their confidentiality.\nWith the bearer bond under their protection and as long as he doesn’t go around flaunting the attestation, Liam knew that he can go about his normal activities without worries.\nAhhh... What a day...,\nLiam sighed heavily.\nHe was actually happy that he had finally solve the great mystery behind the platinum key and the safe deposit box. Now, he can focus his attention on other things; like acquiring traits.\nAbout accruing traits, Liam actually has no idea what trait he should acquire first. But there was one trait he actually want; the ability to fly. But he wasn’t too eager to acquiring it.\nThe reason for this was because the only way for him to fly would be to grow wings. And that’s something Liam doesn’t want.\nGrowing wings... It might sound cool for someone else but not to Liam. He can’t imagine himself having it extending out of his back or wherever.\nJust thinking about it was already making him frown slightly in pain.\nThough because of how advanced the nanites are, they can construct and deconstruct the wings on his command, but Liam was still against it.\nIt doesn’t look cool at all. If I’m going to start acquiring traits, I should start with those that will cause little to no physical changes to my body.\nɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ\nAnd Liam already has some options in mind. Two actually—Eagle’s vision and starfish regeneration ability.\nThose two traits he would love to a acquire first.\nNow he will need to look for a way to get cells from both animals.\nHe immediately picked up his phone and went on the internet to search for how he can acquire the cells.\nSince both the eagle’s eyesight trait and the starfish’s regeneration trait are coded into their genomes, and the relevant genes can be found throughout their bodies, and not in one single organ, even a swab is enough to get Liam what he wants. He doesn’t need the whole eagle or starfish.\nLiam took his time going through the internet and he was surprised to find out that it will be a difficult to get what he wants.\nWhy am I stressing myself unnecessarily when there’s an easier and faster way for me to get them?,\nhe smiled and dialed Daniel’s number.\nThe call went through and rang for a two seconds, before it was picked.\n\"Hello, Mr Scott,\" Daniel’s voice came from the other end.\n\"Daniel, I need some biological samples for private research. Specifically, cells from an eagle and a starfish. Just small tissue or blood samples are enough — nothing extravagant. Please arrange it discreetly, through legitimate channels. Handle it like a scientific acquisition, with the usual confidentiality,\" Liam said.\nThere was a brief silence from the other end after Liam’s words. It was already obvious that Daniel was quite taken aback by the request but he quickly recovered his composure.\n\"I will get them ready within a week. Is there anything else you need?\"\n\"No. That would be all,\" Liam replied.\n\"I will contact you when they are ready and have them delivered to Bellemere Mansion.\"\n\"Ok, then,\" Liam said and ended the call.\nHe dropped his phone on the bed and let out a sigh. All he can do was wait on Daniel for the samples, the headquarter building and the company’s production site.\nWith nothing else to do at the moment, he let his thoughts wonder that was when he remembered something important; he still haven’t assigned the attribute points he received from the weekly sign-in.\nWithout further delay, he summoned his status screen.\n[Host: Liam Scott]\n[Age: 18]\n[Lifespan: 220 Years]\n[System Level: 2]\n[Strength: 30]\n[Agility: 30]\n[Stamina: 30]\n[Attribute Points: 0»»20]\n[System Points: 0]\n[Skills: Pro-level Vehicular Operation, World-Class Etiquette, World-Class Culinary Arts, Formless Combat Doctrine, Perfect Memory, Universal Linguistics]\n[Inventory: Bellemere Mansion property documents, Aston Martin Vantage GT3 key fob, Ferrari SF90 Stradale key fob, Winter Heart, 17.6-carat Blue Diamond, key.]",

How do I split it?\" Liam muttered to himself.\nHe didn’t overthink it as he allocated 7 points to his Strength and Stamina, and 6 points to his Agility, immediately using up all 20 attribute points.\nAs always, after allocating the attribute points, Liam felt that familiar warm energy, as it started from his chest area and flowed throughout out his body like tiny streams.\nMaybe because of how strong he has been growing, he felt the warm energy even more noticeable this time.\nAnd almost immediately, the warm energy disappeared. But it had already done its job as Liam noticeably felt that he has grown stronger.\nHis body now packs even more raw power ands strength. He has grown lighter and he was filled with so much energy that he felt that he could do very taxing works for days without rest.\nI still haven’t tested my strength. I should do that in my private gym when I get back to LA. I’m the strongest person in the world but I have no idea by how much\nIf only there was someone of equal or higher strength he could pit himself against but he doesn’t know of anyone like that. And with how strong he currently is, there’s a high chance that there might not even be someone of equal strength as him on Earth.\n\"I wonder when the world travel function would be unlocked,\" Liam thought to himself.\n\"System, when will the next function be unlocked.\"\nHe decided to ask the system this because he remembered that it said that the function that would allow him to travel between worlds will be unlocked after the coming function.\nWhich the earliest he gets this function unlock, the earlier he will get the between worlds travelling function.\n[The next function will be unlocked on the third weekly sign-in]\n\"Third weekly sign-in... That’s just a few days from now. I’m curious about the function that will be unlocked but I will have to wait till then to find out,\" Liam said to himself.\nToo bad I don’t know the mechanics behind the system leveling up or things would had been much easier for me.\nThough that was Liam’s thought, he didn’t focus on it as he turned his focus to other things.\nThe cells samples he ordered will arrive in within a week but before then, he has to activate the nanites from their dormant state.\nAccording to the information from the omni-science foundation package, the molecular enhancement nanites comes with default programmed instructions, which is to enhance the body of their host.\nAfter that was completed, they will go into a dormant state and can only be activated by connecting to the nanites’ swarm AI. And the only way to do that was by using another AI to pass instructions to it.\nSo, the next thing Liam needs to do would be to create an AI. And to do that, he will need a laptop. Which means he will get himself a laptop as he doesn’t have one with him right now.\nWith this thought, Liam immediately opened the system store to see if it has any laptop-like device he can purchase. And it should be cheap too because he doesn’t want to spend all of his money on it alone. He still has the molecular assembler to think about.\nThe system store opened and he tapped on the search button. He typed in laptop and clicked search, and immediately, an extensive list of laptops appeared.\nLiam was quite surprised that he got a positive search result as he didn’t expect to see a laptop in a store that has some very crazy technologies.\nHe went through the list and he was really impressed by what he saw. The list was naturally filled with laptops. The devices looks like laptops and works like laptops, but their specs are beyond insane.\nHow so? The lowest model among them start with a minimum memory, storage and computing power of 1 petta.\nWhat does that mean? It means that even the device with the crappiest specs is a borderline supercomputer that he can easily store in his backpack.\nHe can store nearly the whole of Netflix’s video library, easily build, train and run hundreds to thousands of AGI model AIs at once.\nThat’s actually beyond just any supercomputer level. That’s almost the same level as a national lab supercomputer... Insane.\nOf course this should be natural since they are items in the system store. So, he would be lying if he said that he wasn’t surprised by their specs.\nThey are also cheap too. 100 SP for the lowest model and 1000 SP for the highest model. What a steal.\nLiam didn’t hesitate as he purchased the cheapest model, exchanging $1m for 100 SP immediately and making the purchase.\nThe device materialised on the nightstand and Liam got up from the bed, and picked it up. He felt its weight and texture of the exterior material.\nThe device felt cold to the touch and it was very light. So light that it gave him the illusion that he was holding nothing.\nThe laptop was matte black in colour and it looks like every other laptops out there, with the only difference being its crazy specs.\nLiam set the laptop down on his bed and opened it. He saw the keyboard and screen, and he smiled.\n\"It really looks like a normal laptop,\" he said, as pressed the power button.\nThe device’s screen lit up with an unknown logo and name.\nSplunge? Is that a tech company outside there? Does it even exist here? Or is this a leak from another world the system pulls from?,\nLiam thought to himself.\nSeeing this made him even more curious about the world outside Earth. But he didn’t dwell on it as he watched the device boot up.\nThe home screen was displayed and it was bland to say the list. But since that wasn’t what he was after, he looked for the app or program he needs for building the AI.\nThe device default language was naturally not English but thanks to his [Universal Linguistics] skill, he could easily understand it.\nHe quickly found the all he was looking for and he clicked on it. The app launched and he immediately got to building the AI.\nThe AI model he intends to build is an AGI. Since the device is more than powerful enough to allow him build, train and run one, he felt that he should just go all out from the start.\nAlso, due to the fact that the device has zero point power storage, Liam doesn’t need to worry about it running out of juice. Also, it doesn’t need internet connection as it already comes with its own internet infrastructure.\nHow’s that possible? Thanks to the omni-science knowledge, he knew how the company did it and how to also do it. It also gave him an extra idea for his ecosystem.\nI should also start working on the ecosystem too since I already have something that can allow me to build them easily.",

      "content": "Chapter 72: Building An AGI (2)\nBuilding the AGI was going to be easy. At least, with his current stats and his science knowledge repositories, building it was going to be a piece of cake.\nBut the issue was the training part. The training will define the AI and give it an identity. Of course, it’s going to absolutely loyal to Liam due to how he will code it, but it’s personality would be defined by its training.\nTo give an analogy, it’s like the relationship between a child and the parents. They gave birth to it but the child’s personality would be shaped not only by its parents, but also its environment and life experiences.\nOf course, as the \"parent\" of the AI, Liam already has everything thought out. He will code the necessary instructions into it and give it its prime directive.\nLiam’s fingers flew across the keyboard at lightning fast movements, as he started writing the codes.\nThis was actually the first time that Liam was actively putting his high agility to use, and even he was surprised by the result.\nHis fingers was moving so fast that if an ordinary person saw them, they would see nothing but blurs.\nIn a matter of just a minute, he has already written more than 1000 lines of long codes and he only just got started.\nLiam couldn’t help but feel grateful for not just the omni-science knowledge foundation package but also to his system for allowing to increase his stats to its current level.\nIf he didn’t have both, he would be stuck. Because without the science knowledge, he won’t be able to build the AI in the first place and without his current stats, it will take him ages to build one.\nBut they weren’t the only thing he was grateful for, because without the laptop, well... let’s say that he can forget about the AGI. Though he will still be able to build it with the science knowledge, things will never be this easy. He will be burdened by protocols upon protocols and have to sign contracts. Lots of them.\nAnd so, thanks to the system, Liam has unlimited hardware power in a laptop form — petascale computing, zero-point energy, self-contained networking.\nHe also has zero bureaucracy, meaning no red tape, no government oversight, no academic politics. And he has the mental and physical capacity to actually build and train an AGI solo.\nTime flew as Liam’s was focused on building the AGI. It was already night time and even though Liam has moved an inch from his position since he started, he didn’t feel like he has done anything.\nHours has passed and he has already written than ten thousand lines of codes, but he still wasn’t halfway through.\nBut Liam wasn’t bothered as what he was currently doing — building an AGI from scratch without training — was something that would realistically in the best case scenario take a huge elite team plus billions in funding 15–20 years before they even have a working \"AGI shell\" ready to be trained.\nBut that workload is something that Liam is crunching solo and without breaking a sweat.\nSince it was nighttime, Liam decided to pause a bit and have dinner before continuing. He wasn’t exactly feeling hungry but he wants to use the opportunity to stretch his body a little.\nWith his current stats that’s nearly twice the limit of an unenhanced human, he could probably go for weeks without food or water, and he would still be fine.\nLiam picked up the tab and ordered dinner. While he waited for his dinner to arrive, his thoughts drifted to the traits and the samples he asked Daniel to get him.\nActually, the truth was that the eagle’s hyper vision and the starfish regenerative ability wasn’t the only traits he wanted.\nHe also wanted the traits of his most loved childhood hero. But unfortunately, reality was different from movies. He can’t exactly go around climbing walls and using webs from his wrists.\nYes, it sounds cool and would definitely look cool, especially if he builds the perfect suit to go. But the truth was that the ability wasn’t exactly practical in the real world. Or was it? Liam wasn’t exactly sure.\nHe sighed softly, shaking his head and his thoughts drifted to the AGI he’s currently working on.\nWith how fast he’s working on it and if he continues like that, it should take him about a weekto complete it. And after that, he will immediately start working on the ecosystem.\n\"Ahh... There goes my plan of spending the rest of the week here as vacation,\" Liam sighed.\nHe initially had the plan to spend the rest of the week touring Geneva and the neighbouring cities. It was the first time he traveled and he wanted to make the most of it, but duty calls.\nWell, I guess it isn’t so bad. I haven’t been doing much since I got the system. I already took a two weeks break from life and all its shenanigans and it’s now time to get back out there.\nLiam didn’t bother dwelling on it. He cleared his head of unnecessary thoughts as he waited for dinner.\nHe didn’t have to wait long as some minutes later, a staff pushed a cart in, after she was allowed by the two standing outside.\nShe set the table and gave a respectful nod, before taking her leave. Liam started eating and he took his time to enjoy the meal.\nAfter he was done, he sat down in front of the laptop again and continued what he was doing.\n***\nFrankfurt, Germany. The headquarters of the European Central Bank.\nThe office of the President was a cathedral of glass and steel — high windows overlooking the Main River, the city lights casting reflections across polished marble floors.\nInside, the atmosphere was thick, not with noise, but with silence. The kind of silence that came only when matters of immense weight were being considered.\nA man in a dark suit approached the desk, a slim folder clutched in his hands. He looked uneasy, though his expression tried to mask it.\n\"President,\" he said carefully, placing the folder onto the polished surface. \"This arrived through the Rothschild clearing channel. A lineage code was presented... XVII-GC-011.\"\nThe ECB head, an older man with hair the color of iron and eyes as sharp as glass, slowly opened the folder. The code gleamed faintly on the page, engraved in platinum ink.\nFor a moment, he simply stared at it. Then he leaned back in his chair. His face didn’t betray much — but his fingers, steepled together, pressed a fraction tighter.\n\"XVII...\" he murmured. \"Seventeenth lineage batch. Geneva Crest. Number eleven.\"\nThe younger man shifted. \"Should we... investigate? The name attached to the attestation was Scott. No known dynasty under that name in our registry. I could order a background sweep. Quietly.\"\nThe President’s gaze lifted sharply, cutting him off before he could continue.\n\"No.\"\nThe word was firm, decisive, the kind of order that left no space for argument.\nThe younger man hesitated. \"But sir—\"\nThe President raised a hand. \"No. Do not chase shadows. Not this one.\"\nHe tapped the code on the page once, as though imprinting the weight of it into the younger man’s memory.\n\"These codes are not mistakes. They do not appear by accident. Whoever holds XVII-GC-011 is already beyond our reach. To pry would be to invite a storm we are not prepared to weather.\"\nThe younger man swallowed. \"...Then what are your instructions?\"\nThe President closed the folder with a soft thud. He slid it to the side of his desk, where another stack of identical folders lay — each marked with cryptic lineage codes, each carrying the kind of silent weight that shaped nations without headlines.\n\"File it,\" the President said, his voice low but commanding. \"File it with the others. When the bearer wishes to reveal themselves, they will. Until then, we wait.\"\nHe leaned back again, his expression unreadable as his gaze drifted toward the night sky outside his window.The source of thɪs content is NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\n\"Remember this well. The world is not moved by the noise you hear in markets or parliaments. It is moved by the hands you never see.\"\nThe younger man bowed his head. \"...Yes, sir.\"\nHe picked up the folder, holding it as though it carried fire, and stepped out of the room. The door closed quietly behind him, leaving the President alone with his thoughts.\nHe exhaled slowly, closing his eyes for a moment. XVII-GC-011. Another ghost had awakened.\n***\nBack in Geneva, Liam remained unaware of the quiet ripples spreading across Europe. He pressed another key, watching as a new function compiled into the AGI’s framework.",

      "content": "Chapter 73: Building An AGI (3)\nThe next morning.\nLiam had no idea how much time had passed or the fact that he had stayed up the whole night until the first rays of sunlight started flooding into the penthouse suite.\n\"It’s morning already?\n\" He muttered to himself, as he paused a bit and looked up from his laptop.\nHe picked up his phone from the nightstand to check the time, and he saw that it was already past seven in the morning.\nWow! I stayed up the whole night and I don’t feel anything.\nHe was actually surprised as his body was filled with energy and his eyes weren’t feeling heavy a bit.\nLiam smiled, as he got up from the bed to stretch his body a little. His body wasn’t stiff but stretching his body after being in a position for too long was habitual to him.\nAfter the light stretch, he walked to the bathroom to wash up.\nFew minutes later, Liam was out of the bathroom and dressed. He picked up the tab and ordered breakfast.\nWith all that out of the way, the next thing for him to do was the most important thing of the day; sign-in.\n\"System, sign-in,\" he muttered.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, you received $5,000,000]\n[You received 0.05% shares of\n***\nLiam nodded in satisfaction when he saw the sign-in rewards. Though they weren’t flashy or shocking, they are still of significant value.\nThe $5m reward has increased his account balance to $68m. And he was now inching even closer to his $100m target.\nActually, the truth about the $100m was that if Liam wanted to get the remaining balance or the whole $100m immediately, with the omni-science knowledge, there’s a legal way for him to do so.\nThis was especially so with the fact that he now has supercomputer grade laptop in his possession. With it, he can build a problem that will siphon the amount from the world’s financial market without leaving behind even the tiniest of digital footprint.\nBut the truth was that he wasn’t in a hurry. If he has got the money and purchased the molecular assembler, then what? The industrial wasn’t ready and since the device isn’t something that he can casually take out due to its size, and how advanced it looks, he will have to leave it in the inventory to be collecting dust.\nLiam smiled to himself as he thought of the second reward. Including the second weekly sign-in, this was the fifth time he has received the shares of the company.\nFrom the initial 0.5% stake worth $17.2 billion, his holdings in the company had now risen to 0.75%, with a total value of $25.7 billion.\nHis portfolionow stood at a staggering $35.8b. It was an insane number.\n\"I wonder what the system is building to with the consistent daily shares of the company,\" Liam thought to himself, with a curious look on his face.\nUsing what happened with JP Morgan shares, Liam could already guess what the system was planning to do with this and it made him to look forward to his third weekly sign-in.\nLiam was still lost in his thoughts when a knock came from the door and it opened slowly, and the female staff from last night pushed the food cart in.\nThe female staff greeted him softly and wheeled the polished breakfast cart to the low dining table by the window.\nThe aroma of butter and coffee immediately filled the suite. Liam inclined his head politely, watching her as she carefully arranged each dish. Once she was finished, she bowed slightly and withdrew, leaving him alone with the meal.\nLiam stood for a moment, his gaze drifting across the spread. A pot of dark roast coffee, its aroma rich and grounding. A basket of golden croissants. A plate of smoked salmon with thin slivers of red onion and lemon wedges. And finally, a porcelain bowl filled with bright fruit — slices of melon, ruby-red strawberries, blueberries glistening like jewels.\nIt wasn’t ostentatious, but there was a quiet refinement to it.\nSwiss hospitality\n, he mused.\nEven the simplest breakfast carried an air of deliberate perfection.\nHe took his seat and ate unhurriedly, savoring every flavor. He tasted the buttery flakiness of the croissant, the faint smokiness in the salmon, the delicate acidity of lemon zest cutting through.\nWhen he was finished, he leaned back slightly, pressing the button on the wall. Moments later, the same staff member returned, bowing politely as she cleared the dishes with smooth efficiency.\nShe worked silently until the cart was once again neat and orderly. With another bow, she exited, leaving the penthouse steeped in silence once more.\nLiam exhaled softly, rising from his chair. \"Alright... back to it.\"\nHe returned to the bedroom, where the matte-black laptop waited patiently on the bed. Sliding into position, he placed his fingers over the keyboard.\nThe screen was filled with scrolling text, lines of code stretching endlessly downward.\nTo anyone else, it would have looked overwhelming — chaotic even. But to Liam, every symbol, every bracket, every nested loop was as clear as daylight. He scrolled briefly, eyes scanning, and saw the sheer mass of what he had built so far.\nOver two hundred thousand lines and each one perfect.\nHe smiled to himself. Two hundred thousand lines would normally mean bugs — hundreds to thousands of them. Debugging sessions that could last weeks. But here, not a single one existed.\nHis enhanced cognition, his Perfect Memory, and the sheer brute computational assistance of the Splunge laptop had combined to make his work flawless.\nHis fingers began moving again, faster than the human eye could track. To an ordinary person, it would have looked like he was simply smacking the keys at random — a blur of movement, almost comical. But the screen told a different story.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by\nEach keystroke birthed precise, complex instructions, woven together, as entire frameworks unfolded in seconds, modules linking seamlessly, subroutines self-balancing without intervention.\nAt his current pace, he was writing one hundred and fifty lines per minute — and none of them were wasted. The code wasn’t verbose. It was tight, elegant, compressed. It was the kind of architecture entire PhD teams might marvel at decades later and still fail to fully replicate.\nAnd still, he wasn’t halfway done.\nHours passed in near silence, broken only by the rhythmic click of keys. Outside, the sun rose higher over Lake Geneva, spilling light across the mountains and painting the suite’s floor in shifting patterns.\nAt some point, Mason knocked softly to check in, but Liam didn’t even look up as he replied: \"I’m fine.\"\nBy noon, his codebase had grown to nearly three hundred thousand lines. By mid-afternoon, it neared four hundred thousand.\nAnd all the while, a thought lingered at the back of his mind.\nWhat will you be?\nThe AGI wasn’t just another program. It wasn’t even just a powerful assistant. Once complete, it would be a consciousness — something that could learn, adapt, and evolve. A partner in every sense except biological.\nHe already knew its loyalty would be absolute. He had coded that in. But personality? That would come from training. From the data he chose to feed it, the directives he chose to prioritize.\nShould it be coldly logical, like a machine god of calculation? Or warm and conversational, a partner who could blend seamlessly into human interactions?\nAs his mind circled the question, his fingers never slowed for a second.\nBut the thought of shaping an intelligence — one that could rival and perhaps surpass humanity — sent a subtle chill down his spine.\nBut then he remembered the vault. The parchment. The bond that tied him to dynasties and empires long gone.\nPower, he realized, wasn’t always a choice. Sometimes it was an inheritance. Sometimes it was a responsibility.\nMaybe... maybe this AGI wasn’t just for him.\nMaybe it was part of the foundation for everything he was about to build. And that it would be.\nBy the time the golden light of evening began seeping into the room, Liam finally leaned back, exhaling deeply. His fingers hovered over the keys for a moment before he lowered the lid of the laptop.\nHe rubbed his temples lightly, though his body wasn’t tired, his mind was buzzing with the codes he’s yet to write.\nHe had written more than four hundred thousand lines of code in two days and he still wasn’t halfway there.\nHe stood, walking slowly to the wide windows overlooking Lake Geneva. The water shimmered under the last rays of sunlight, swans gliding across like pale ghosts.\nLiam watched it for a while, then smiled to himself. He hopes that he can complete building the AGI soon. But he was going at his fastest, and had only written close to half a million lines of codes, and he still have more half a million more lines to write.\nIt’s gonna take a while.",

      "content": "Chapter 74: 1 Ton Of Gold\nLiam’s eyes fluttered open as he stirred awake. He gazed at the ceiling, smiling to himself.\nAhh... Enough of that. It’s a new day and I have quite a bit to achieve today.\nHe immediately got up from the bed and went to the bathroom. Some minutes later, he walked out and got dressed, picked up the tab and ordered breakfast.\nAs he waited breakfast, he decided to do his daily ritual, sign-in. He hopes that he will get a surprise reward today. But even if he doesn’t, it won’t be bad as the reward would be valuable nonetheless.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, you received 0.05% shares of\n[You received 1 ton of gold bars with 100% purity]\n[Note: The good bars are in the inventory]\n***\nHuh? What? 1 ton of gold bars with 100% purity?\nLiam froze for a moment, staring at the floating words on his status screen as though they were playing tricks on him.\nOne ton of gold bars.\nHe repeated the phrase silently in his head several times. No matter how he turned it, the weight of the words didn’t lessen.\nGold. The oldest and perhaps purest representation of wealth in human history.\nA faint chuckle escaped him as he sat back down on the bed.\nShares, cash, cars... even a Fabergé egg that belonged in a museum. Those he could understand to an extent. But gold? A literal mountain of it? That was completely different. It was on level with the bearer bond.\nHe shook his head slowly. The irony wasn’t lost on him.\nThere was a saying in elite circles — one he’d stumbled across while browsing through the financial histories on the internet.\n\"The wealthy don’t hoard money; they hoard metals. Rare metals. As much as they can.\"\nMoney fluctuated. Stocks rose and fell. Empires were built and destroyed. But gold? Gold endured. It was the silent witness of civilizations. Pharaohs were buried with it, emperors adorned themselves with it, kings waged wars for it.\nAnd in modern times, it sat in underground vaults, silently buttressing currencies, national reserves, and the secret dealings of dynasties.\nThe truly wealthy — the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Sauds — kept gold not because they needed to spend it, but because it was power distilled into physical form. It has an unquestionable value which is universal and unchanging.\nAnd now, Liam had a literal ton of it sitting in his inventory.\n\"System... you really don’t play around,\" He let out a low whistle.\nHis mind spun as he did a quick math of the value of the gold bars almost automatically. A ton was a thousand kilograms. With gold currently trading at roughly $64,000 per kilo, that meant—\nSixty-four million dollars!\nAnd that was just market value. Pure 100% gold bars carried a premium far above spot price. If liquidated through the right channels, that ton could fetch closer to eighty or even a hundred million.\nAnd more importantly, it wasn’t just about selling it. It was about what it represented.\nGold in this form wasn’t an investment. It was insurance. It was collateral. It was the kind of silent asset you could leverage in times of crisis, one that even governments would acknowledge without question. If push ever came to shove, he could walk into any financial institution on the planet, produce a single bar, and have entire doors open for him.\nWow! The system never fails to surprise.\nCurious to see what a gold bar of 100% purity would look like, Liam reached into his inventory and retrieved one.\nIn the next instant, the bar materialized onto the low table before him.\nLiam blinked when he saw the gold bar.\nIt was... beautiful.\nUnlike the slightly dull, brassy-gold sheen he’d seen in jewelry stores or on coins, this bar shone with a radiance that felt almost unnatural.\nThe surface gleamed like liquid sunlight frozen into solid form, its edges razor-sharp and flawless, as though no human hand had ever touched it.\n\"Pure gold...\" Liam muttered softly.\nHe reached forward and placed his hand on it. Immediately, the sensation registered — heavy. Incredibly heavy for its size.\nThe bar was no larger than a thick paperback, yet it dragged at his arm as though he’d picked up a slab of stone.\nThe metal was cool to the touch at first, then quickly warmed under his skin, almost as though it were alive.\nHis fingers slid across its mirror-smooth surface. No imperfections, no rough edges, just perfect weight and flawless luster.\nHe turned it slightly in the morning light streaming through the penthouse window. The golden surface caught it like fire, scattering it into brilliant reflections.\n\"Wow...\"\nLiam smiled faintly. Even though he had received things far more valuable in monetary terms — billions in shares, priceless relics, luxury yachts — there was something kind of different about holding a bar of gold in his hands.\nI wonder why he system gave me this? It said that I can’t sell the rewards or give out the rewards it gives you me. What does it expect me to do with it?\nHe exhaled deeply and pushed the thought aside for now. He decided not to think too much about it. He was sure that he will know when it’s time. And there was still the other reward.\n0.05% of Apple.\nOn the surface, it sounded small. Insignificant even. But Liam knew better. That half-a-tenth percent wasn’t pocket change.\n0.05% of Applē’s market cap was worth $1.7 billion. Just like that, his portfolio had surged again.\nHe now held 0.8% in total — a stake valued at over $27 billion. Combined with his JPMorgan holdings and the other assets the system had stacked onto him, Liam’s portfolio now stood at a staggering $37.5 billion.\nHe leaned back into the pillows, staring up at the ceiling.\nThirty-seven and a half billion... I’m practically in spitting distance of the world’s top fifty wealthiest people.\nBefore he could let the thought settle, his phone buzzed on the nightstand. The screen lit up with a familiar name.\nDaniel Conley.\nLiam picked up immediately. \"Daniel.\"\n\"Good morning, Mr. Scott,\" Daniel’s smooth, composed voice came through the line. \"I thought it best to call you directly with updates.\"\n\"I’m listening.\" Liam sat upright\n\"Firstly, your company headquarters. I’ve secured a building in downtown Los Angeles. Prime location, modern architecture, fully equipped to serve as a public-facing corporate hub. It’s been registered under the holding structure we established. The paperwork will be finalized today, but effectively — it’s yours.\"\n\"We’ve also secured the parcel of land in Nevada for the industrial base. Construction crews are already being mobilized. Security, energy, and zoning have all been pre-cleared. Work will begin within forty-eight hours.\"\nLiam’s brows rose. \"That’s perfect.\"\n\"Yes. We don’t delay on matters of this scale. And lastly — the biological samples you requested. The eagle and starfish acquisitions. I’ve pushed them through under a scientific exemption license. The documentation will clear before the end of today, and the samples will be delivered directly to Bellemere Mansion tomorrow.\"\nLiam opened his mouth, but before he could respond, a soft knock came at the suite door. Mason’s voice filtered through: \"Sir. Room service.\"\nThe door opened and the female staff member wheeled in a polished cart. She set the plates onto the table with carefully, bowed lightly, and withdrew without a word.\nLiam turned back to the call. \"Daniel... Thank you for the update. I also appreciate the efficiency.\"\n\"It’s my pleasure. I’ll keep you updated as everything progresses. Enjoy your day, sir.\"\nThe line clicked off.\nLiam placed the phone down and moved to the table where his breakfast waited. He ate quietly, savoring each bite as his mind drifted over Daniel’s updates.\nThe headquarters was done. Just like that, he now had a physical address, a corporate banner to hang his empire under. The Nevada base was secured too — which meant in a few short weeks, he would have a place to house the molecular assembler and begin the real work.\nAnd the samples...\nHe paused halfway through a bite of bread, as he smiled to himself. With the eagle and starfish genomes in his possession, the first step toward acquiring traits would finally be possible.\nHe didn’t know exactly what changes they would bring once the nanites went to work, but the thought excited him more than he could admit.\nEverything was moving so fast and it made him happy.\nHe finished the meal, dabbed his lips with the napkin, and rose from the table.\n\"Alright,\" he murmured to himself. \"Back to work.\"Thɪs NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nThe laptop sat waiting on the bed. He sat down, flipped it open, and his fingers found the keys again.\nThe screen filled with scrolling lines of code, the half-built shell of his AGI waiting for its maker.\nLiam inhaled once, steadying his thoughts, and he smiled to himself.",

      "content": "Chapter 75: Headaches\nEvening of the next day.\nLiam could be seen smiling from ear to ear. He had finally done it. After four long days of almost nonstop coding, he was finally done building the AGI.\nHe looked at the more than 1.2 million lines of codes and smiled, and the other attached codes documents, and smiled even more.\nAfter writing codes deep into the night yesterday, he wanted to stop but when he realised that he only has about just some thousands more lines to go, he decided to forgo the sleep and code throughout the night till now.\nAnd he was glad he made that decision as he had finished crunched down what was probably a day or two more of work into some hours.\nWith the AGI’s code infrastructure now completed, the next thing to do was to run it and train it.\nWith unrestrained excitement, Liam moved the cursor to run and clicked on it.\nImmediately, the more than one million lines of codes vanished, surprising Liam for a moment but the surprise didn’t last long as the next moment, he saw a black chat window open up.\nLiam smiled when he saw this, as it was exactly what he wanted and was expecting. His fingers tapped the keys as he started imputing training instructions into the AGI through the chat window.\nHe wanted to tell it to go through the internet and gather every single data and information it can get from it, but since it’s not advisable to point a newborn AGI at the open internet and let it drink from the firehose.\nWhat he will be doing is a staged, curated crawl with strict guardrails, starting from high-signal, legally clean sources, then he will expand gradually with filters and his evaluations.\nBy doing this, Liam won’t be the one creation those situations where AI systems go through internet, see the dark things humans do and decides that the best solution to our problems is a global scale extinction.\nLiam started the AGI training, as he told it to go through all language and dictionaries websites.\nThis was crucial as language is the foundation of communication and if the AGI doesn’t understand what simple hello is, then there was no way that it would be able to understand the high level knowledge on the internet or be able to communicate with him.\nThe language training will take a while, so while he wait, he decided to order dinner and finally do what he has been putting off since morning.\n\"System, sign-in.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, you received $10,000,000]\n[You received 0.05% shares of\n***\nLiam nodded in satisfaction when he saw the rewards. He wasn’t expecting anything special today after the golden haul of yesterday. Though he was slightly surprised by the cash reward.\nThe $10m has now increased his account balance to $78m. And he was now ever closer his target.\nHis gaze moved to the second reward. It was another 0.05% of\nIt had become a familiar number at this point, but that didn’t make it any less impressive. He quickly did the math in his head.\n0.05% shares equated to $1.7 billion, meaning that his holdings in the company alone is now valued at $30.7b.\nWith all his assets added up together, his net worth stood at nearly $50 billion. All achieved in two weeks.\nLiam exhaled softly, with a smile.\n\"Tomorrow’s weekly sign-in... what’s it going to be this time?\"\nThe thought stirred genuine curiosity. The first weekly sign-in had been wild — a $5 million cash, the Bellemere Mansion, and luxury hyper cars.\nThe second had been monstrous: $50 million in cash, 1% of JP Morgan, 0.5% of Applē, a custom McLaren, and twenty attribute points.\nTomorrow would be his third.\nWould it top the others? More shares? More property? Something he couldn’t even begin to predict?\nSystem, you’ve set a high bar for yourself... Maybe too high a bar.\nHe was tempted to ask aloud, but he knew the system wouldn’t answer. It never revealed the rewards beforehand. That mystery was part of its design — a way to keep him on edge, always looking forward.\nEither way, he would be back in Los Angeles before then.\nThat had been his plan all along. The jet would take him out of Geneva in the morning, and by noon he’d be back at Bellemere.\nHe had told himself it was for convenience and for the samples Daniel had arranged, for the Nevada site, for the company headquarters in Los Angeles.\nBut if he was honest with himself? It was because he was homesick.\nHe missed the quietness of Bellemere Mansion. The grand staircase, the warm smiles of the maids, the private home theatre and his bed.\nGeneva was beautiful, but Bellemere was his and he couldn’t wait to return.\nAs that thought warmed him, another cold realization slammed into him, sobering his expression.\nRaw materials.\nHis stomach dropped slightly as the words formed in his mind.\nThe molecular assembler. It could build anything — but only with the right inputs.\nAnd what were those inputs? Everything. Literally everything.\nIron, copper, silicon, platinum, uranium, rare earth metals, even radioactive isotopes. Every single element in the periodic table.\nIn large quantities.\n\"Why didn’t I think of this earlier...?\" Liam rubbed his temples, already feeling the headache forming.The source of this content ɪs ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nHe could already imagine the red flags. A \"new\" company trying to acquire tons of raw metals, rare isotopes, and restricted materials. Uranium. Plutonium. Tritium. These weren’t things you could just buy off the shelf.\nWould governments even allow it? Would the U.S. quietly flag him as a national security threat before he even had the chance to build his first prototype?\n\"Hopefully JP Morgan’s resources can smooth things over. Otherwise...\" He sighed heavily.\nHe didn’t finish the thought. Instead, he leaned back in the chair and close his eyes briefly.\nMaybe — just maybe — this was why the system had given him one ton of pure gold bars yesterday.\nRaw material. The most basic of them all. A universal fallback.\n\"System, are you telling me something with these rewards?\" He chuckled tiredly.\nHe sighed again and shook his head. There was no point dwelling on it now. He’d been coding for four straight days, pouring every ounce of his enhanced cognition into the AGI. Even if his body didn’t feel tired, his mind deserved a breather.\nThe AGI will take at least a whole day to go through the language training and Liam’s evaluation, before it can proceed to the next phase.\nBut his moment of quiet didn’t last long as his phone started ringing, and it was a call from Daniel.\n\"Daniel,\" Liam answered immediately.\n\"Mr. Scott,\" came Daniel’s calm voice. \"I wanted to let you know that the samples have arrived at Bellemere Mansion. The eagle and starfish tissues have been delivered and secured by Evelyn and the household staff. They are stored properly in a private, temperature-controlled compartment.\"\n\"Good. That’s perfect,\" Liam smiled in satisfaction.\n\"There’s more,\" Daniel continued. \"Construction crews have already broken ground in Nevada. The site will be fortified before any external contractors are brought in. It will be discreet.\"\n\"Excellent. You’ve handled this beautifully, Daniel.\"\nThere was a small pause before Liam spoke again.\n\"There is one more thing I need from you.\"\n\"Of course,\" Daniel replied smoothly.\n\"I’ll need an axolotl sample. Live tissue. Arrange it through legitimate scientific channels, as you did with the others.\"\nThere was a pause of curiosity.\n\"An axolotl?\"\n\"Yes,\" Liam confirmed.\n\"Understood,\" Daniel said without hesitation. \"I’ll begin arrangements immediately.\"\n\"Good. And there’s something else.\" Liam leaned back in his chair, his eyes narrowing slightly.\n\"I need you to set up a network of shell companies. Fronts that can be used to acquire raw elements in bulk — metals, isotopes, anything and everything from the periodic table. Uranium, plutonium, rare earths, all of it. Don’t make any purchases yet. Just create the structures. When I’m ready, I’ll give the word.\"\nDaniel’s silence lingered for only a second before he replied, his tone as calm as ever but Liam could sense the slight tension underneath. \"It will be done. By the time you return to Los Angeles, the framework will be in place.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam said quietly. \"That’s all for now.\"\n\"Very well, Mr. Scott. Safe travels tomorrow.\"\nThe line clicked off.\nLiam set the phone down, exhaling slowly. He had expected resistance — questions, at least. But Daniel hadn’t asked. He had only agreed.\nThat was the kind of professional Liam needed at his side.\nBefore he could reflect further, a knock came at the door. Mason’s voice filtered through. \"Sir, your dinner has arrived.\"\nThe door opened, and the female staff member wheeled in a polished silver cart. She set the dishes neatly on the low table, bowed politely, and withdrew without a sound.\nFinally. Time to eat.",

      "content": "Chapter 76: AGI’s Training Progress\nBellemere Mansion, Holmby Hills, Los Angeles.\nThe Rolls-Royce Ghost Black Badge slowed gracefully as it climbed the long, manicured driveway, its glossy obsidian body reflecting the last hints of twilight.\nAt the apex, it came to a halt before the mansion’s grand front steps, its engine purring to a soft silence.\nThe air outside was cooler than in Geneva, carrying with it the crisp scent of evening blooming jasmine and freshly cut grass.\nLiam stepped out the moment Mason pulled open the rear door. His leather shoes touched the stone path, and he paused for just a second.\nHe closed his eyes.\nThe air here felt different. Softer. More familiar. It wasn’t heavy with the polish and deliberate perfection of a hotel; it was gentler.\nA faint night breeze brushed past, stirring the leaves of the tall trees that stood like guardians around the mansion.\nA long breath slipped from Liam’s lips and he smiled.\n\"I’ve missed this.\"\nHe opened his eyes again and looked toward the front doors. Evelyn and the two younger maids were already waiting for him at the top of the steps, hands folded neatly at their waists. The moment their eyes met his, they bowed in perfect unison.\n\"Welcome back, sir,\" Evelyn said warmly.\n\"Welcome home, sir,\" the two younger maids echoed softly.\nLiam’s smile deepened as he ascended the steps. \"It’s good to be back. Thank you.\"\nThe polished oak doors were pulled open smoothly, revealing the vast foyer bathed in soft golden light from the chandeliers above.\nLiam stepped through, his footsteps muted by the marble floor, and immediately felt the familiar stillness of the mansion.\n\"Dinner is ready, sir,\" Evelyn said as they crossed into the foyer. \"Would you like it served now?\"\nLiam nodded without hesitation. \"Yes. That would be perfect.\"\n\"Very well.\" Evelyn inclined her head and gave a subtle signal to the maids. They moved quickly but gracefully, their steps silent as they went ahead to prepare the dining table.\nLiam followed at a steady pace, his eyes sweeping briefly across the space he hadn’t seen in over a week. The high ceilings, the sweeping staircase, the faint scent of polished wood and fresh lilies arranged in vases along the hallway — it was all so familiar. Home.\nBy the time he reached the dining room, the long table was already alive with movement. Crisp white linens had been straightened, silver cutlery gleamed under the chandelier’s glow, and delicate porcelain plates were set in perfect symmetry.\nEvelyn stood by the chair at the head of the table, waiting for him. \"Please, sir.\"\nLiam sat, smoothing his blazer lightly as he did. He gave her a nod, and the maids began to bring in the dishes.\nThe soft clink of porcelain against the table filled the air as plates were set before him, each one carrying the unmistakable warmth of a home-cooked meal.\nThe moment the first dish touched the table, Liam realized how much he had missed this.\nHe picked up his fork and knife, cut into the meat, and took the first bite.\nThe flavors bloomed instantly on his tongue — rich, warm, layered in a way that hotel kitchens could never quite replicate. He closed his eyes, savoring it fully.\n\"This...\" he murmured softly, almost to himself, \"this is what I’ve missed.\"\nThe food wasn’t just delicious. It carried familiarity. It carried intention. Unlike the precisely crafted luxury of Geneva’s five-star service, this was a meal made by hands that knew him, that considered his preferences, his likes, his dislikes.\nHe ate slowly, unhurried, letting himself enjoy every detail. The crisp sear on the vegetables, the tenderness of the meat, the faint aroma of rosemary woven into the sauce. The croissant-like rolls were still warm, their buttery layers flaking perfectly. Even the water tasted cleaner here.\nYeah, the water part was probably on an exaggeration on his part.\nBy the time he set his fork down, a comfortable weight had settled into his chest. It wasn’t the heaviness of food — it was the heaviness of contentment.\nHe dabbed his lips with the napkin and leaned back slightly.\n\"Thank you, Evelyn. That was excellent. I’ve really missed this.\"\n\"I’ll pass your words to the kitchen, sir,\" Evelyn bowed lightly.\nAs he rose from his seat, he gave her a small smile.\n\"Please do.\"\n\"Of course. Also,\" Evelyn added, her voice calm as always, \"the laptop has been carried to your bedroom. I have no idea of you wanted to use it, so I took it to your bedroom instead of the study.\"\n\"Good.\" Liam gave her a nod before turning toward the staircase and he ascended slowly.\nWhen he pushed open the door to his bedroom, the sight made him smile immediately.\nThe room was unchanged. The large king-sized bed sat neatly made, its crisp linens reflecting the golden glow of the lamps. The furniture, the curtains, the subtle art on the walls. He really missed them.\nHe stepped in, exhaled softly, and set his jacket over the armchair by the window. Then he walked toward the bathroom.\nThe marble-tiled room greeted him with cool air. He turned on the water, letting the steam rise, and stripped off his clothes. The warmth cascaded over him a moment later, washing away the faint exhaustion of travel.\nWhen he emerged, his hair damp and his body wrapped in the comfortable fabric of a fresh shirt and trousers, he felt renewed.\nHe crossed to the bed and sat down, his eyes immediately finding the matte-black laptop resting atop the sheets.\nSliding closer, he lifted the lid. The screen blinked to life, and the black chat window he had left open in Geneva flickered softly.\nLines of progress indicators scrolled along the side. The AGI’s training had advanced significantly since he last checked.Thɪs ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nAlmost complete.\nLiam scanned the data. The language training module was at ninety-seven percent. Within minutes, it would cross the threshold.\nThe system had parsed through dictionaries, grammar, semantics, idioms, and tonal variations across dozens of languages. Soon, the AGI would have a flawless comprehension of communication itself.\nHe leaned back, exhaling softly.\nLanguage was the foundation. Without it, no intelligence could build context. This first stage ensured it would not only understand words, but also the subtleties behind them — idioms, sarcasm, cultural nuance.\nAnd after this? The next phase would be general knowledge.\nUnlike language, which was a structured foundation, general knowledge would be a vast expanse. Carefully curated academic texts, encyclopedias, and data sets would give it breadth without drowning it in the chaos of the internet. It would build facts, principles, and logical structures into its mind, layer by layer, without the bias of corrupted human commentary.\nHe smiled faintly, closing the laptop again.\n\"Almost there.\"\nHe shifted slightly on the bed, drawing in a slow breath. As exciting as the AGI was, there was something far more pressing tonight.\nThe system and the third weekly sign-in.\nHe had been holding it off deliberately until he returned home. And now, here he was — in his own room, with no distractions.\nNot only would the rewards arrive, but the system itself would level up, unlocking a new function. One he had been waiting for.\nLiam’s heart thudded faintly in his chest. His smile widened.\n\"Alright...\" he whispered to himself.\nWithout further delay, he spoke the words aloud.\n\"System, sign-in.\"\n[Ding!]",

He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, calming his emotions that were about to go out of control.\nBut he couldn’t. Even with the World-Class Etiquette skill, he just couldn’t control his emotions. How could he? Who would be able to control their emotions seeing these absolutely monstrous rewards.\n$200m...\nThis was the biggest cash reward he has ever received. All of the cash rewards he has combined doesn’t exceed $150m.\nThe money not only solves his funding issue for the molecular assembler but he now has immediate liquidity for any move he wants to make.\nLiam’s phone buzzed and without looking at it, he knew that it was a credit notification from his bank. His account balance has now ballooned to $278m!\nThis was more than quarter of a billion. This was an amount that he could spend on whatever he wants. This was an amount that some people call generational wealth and he now has it sitting comfortably in his account.\nFuuu... Liam exhaled softly, doing his best to steady his emotions as he turned his gaze moved to the next reward; 1% shares of\nOver the week, he had consistently received 0.05% stake in the company, bringing his total percentage stake in it to 0.9%.\nHe knew that the daily shares reward was a buildup to what he will receive from the weekly sign-in, and he wasn’t exactly surprised by the 1%. But not being surprised didn’t mean that the reward was any less impressive.\nWhat does 1% shares of one of the world’s largest and most valuable consumer-tech company in the world mean? It means $34.8b in value!\nWith this increase, he now has a 1.9% stake in the company and his holding is now valued at $65.5b. That alone makes him one of the largest private shareholders on Earth and gives him absolutely insane leverage.\nThe figure qually increased the value of his equity portfolio to $75.6b and with this amount, he now comfortably sits in the top 21 position of the documented world’s richest people.\nWhat does this mean for Liam? It means that he now sits at the same table as the world’s most powerful billionaires!\nLiam took a deep breath and exhaled slowly.\n\"You can’t lose it yet. There’s still more rewards to check out,\" he muttered slowly in a soft voice.\nHe turned his thoughts to the next reward which was 1.5% of the world’s biggest IP powerhouse,\nThis was the first time that he was receiving the shares of an entertainment company and it really surprised him.\nBut the surprise didn’t matter. What mattered was the value of the shares he received. 1.5% of the company equates to $3b.\nYes, it was little compared to the first shares reward but that didn’t mean that if was any less valuable.\n1.5% shareds of the company is a chunk size of the company and has already given him boardroom recognition. Which means that his words carries weight.\nAnd considering what Liam had in mind for his quantum ecosystem,this reward was actually by far the most valuable. Because in the future, the company might through the ecosystem, grow to become the world’s most valuable company right behind his. And by then, his $3b stake in the company might balloon to hundreds of billions or even trillions.\n\"I hope system gives me shares of other entrainment companies,\" Liam said to himself, turning his attention to the next reward.\n1% shares of Amazōn. A company that’s called the world’s largest global e-commerce hub. Not only that, but they also have monopoly over cloud computing with AWS.\nWith his stake in the company, Liam basically owns a slice of the internet itself.\n1% stake in the company equates to $19b of conservative estimated value. This was by no means a small amount.\nYes, it’s being overshadowed by the value of his stake in Applē but it was no means a small amount. And the strategic value should also be taken into consideration.\nIf Applē controls what people hold in their hands, then Amazōn controls what people do with them and where their data flows.\nYes, that was the word. Data. No matter what these companies say, the most valuable to them is user’s data. Not just monetary value but also in form of leverage. And Amazōn has a huge chunk of that leverage.\nBut it also shares this leverage with another company; Alphabēt. It’s the parent company of the world’s largest search engine; Gōōgle.\nAnd Liam has received 1% stake in the company. That’s ~$20B in value and a stake in the world’s most powerful information refinery, and also giving him backdoor access to the digital nervous system of the modern world.\nIt’s no secret that Alphabēt controls the digital world. They not only have the two biggest search engines in the world, but also control over digital advertisement and internet tracking.\nThey also have maps and navigation. Clouds and and one of their most loved, AI supremacy.\nAnd there’s that which can be considered their crown jewel, Android and mobile ecosystem.\nIt was at this point that Liam was starting to realise that these weekly sign-in rewards aren’t just about monetary value but of also strategic value.\nHis stake in JP Morgan has made life so easy for him that what he needs can be solved with a phone call.\nAnd today’s stake rewards, their true value would really show in the future.\nWith today’s shares reward, the value of Liam’s equity portfolio has skyrocketed to a staggering $116.4b. This means a top 11 spot in the document world’s richest people.\nLiam exhaled deeply as he processed what this means.\n$116b... The system has really outdone itself with just these rewards and there’s still more...\nHe couldn’t help but take another deep breath and exhaled slowly, before turning his thoughts to the next rewards.\nOne ton each of pure Platinum bars and Palladium bars.\nLiam was once again speechless. The one ton of pure gold bars was already staggering enough, but platinum and palladium? That was another league entirely.\nHis mind did the math almost automatically. Platinum was trading at around $30,000 per kilo and a thousand kilos meant about $30 million. Palladium was even scarcer, nearly $35,000 per kilo, putting a ton at roughly $35 million.\nTogether, they are over $65m in value but that was for ordinary bullion, the kind central banks stored in vaults.\nHis were stamped at 100% purity — laboratory-perfect and impossible to obtain in reality. That kind of perfection just like the gold bars carried a premium easily pushing their combined value toward $70–80 million, maybe even higher if ever put on the market.\nLiam sighed once. He wanted to take a Platinum and Palladium bar each, and see what it looks like but he decided against it.\nI will see it for myself when I access the Dimensional Space.\nWith that thought, he turned his attention to the last two rewards and the most eye catching of them all.\nWhile the shares are valuable, for Liam, these last rewards are actually the highlight of this week’s weekly sign-in rewards.\nWith a smile, he retrieved the document of the aircraft and the car.",

      "content": "Chapter 78: The Flying Palace\nLiam sat on the edge of his bed, the freshly materialized leather-bound folio open in his hands.\nHe turned each page carefully, his fingers brushing against embossed seals and platinum ink that glimmered faintly in the light of the chandelier.\nThe words written across the documents were clear enough, but his mind struggled to catch up with their meaning.\nOwner: Liam Scott.\nAsset: Airbus A380 Flying Palace.\nStatus: Delivered — Hangar 14, Imperial Terminal, South Side of Los Angeles International Airport.\nHis eyes kept scanning the same words over and over as though repetition would somehow make them less absurd.\n\"...A Flying Palace,\" He said the words softly, almost a whisper, as if speaking them aloud might shatter the illusion.\nThis wasn’t a Gulfstream or a Bombardier. This wasn’t even a Boeing Business Jet, the kind favored by heads of state.\nThis was an Airbus A380 — the largest passenger aircraft ever built. A double-decked, four-engine colossus, bigger than Air Force One itself.\nAnd unlike the concept sketched in glossy brochures back in 2007 for a Saudi prince, this one wasn’t a dream that died in committee. This one existed. And it was his.\nLiam leaned back against the headboard, memories of what he had once read about the aircraft stirring in his mind.\nThe \"Flying Palace\" project had been commissioned nearly two decades ago. The idea was bold, even ludicrous: to take the world’s biggest airliner and turn it into a private skyborne palace. It was meant to have bedrooms, spas, boardrooms, a garage for cars.\nIt had all sounded like the stuff of fantasy and it was as the plan for the plane never left the drawing board.\nSome said the prince balked at the cost. Others said it was an engineering nightmare, a logistical quagmire. Besides, commercial airlines themselves were already struggling with the A380’s massive expenses, which contributed to the production for the entire line ceasing in 2021.\nThus the dream was abandoned. At least, for everyone else.\nNow here it was, resurrected and real. And not just real, but also tailored, refined and perfected just for him.\nLiam flipped through the next page, his eyes widening as specifications scrolled down in neat lines.\nExterior and Range\nThe first note: Exterior paintwork: Platinum and Obsidian Black, custom striping.\nHe could almost see it. He has already gotten used to seeing platinum for the past two weeks, and he could already imagine the metallic shimmer of platinum streaks running across the obsidian body of the aircraft.\n\"Just the image of it in my head is already insane. How much more the real deal?\" He muttered softly, as he continued reading.\nThe aircraft also has extended range tanks giving it more than 15,000 kilometers nonstop, which is enough to fly from Los Angeles to Tokyo and to London without refueling.\nIt has more features like its noise and vibration dampening systems which will make the cabin so silent that when standing inside, it could be mistaken for standing in a penthouse apartment.\nEMP-hardened avionics, triple redundancy systems, radar jammers, directional countermeasures.\nMeeting Room with soundproofing, secure comms and real-time satellite feeds. Also allowing Liam to call anyone securely worldwide.\n\"These... These are the same security modifications as Air Force One!\" Liam said softly in shock.\nHe turned to the section on interiors, and his breath hitched slightly.\nPenthouse Suite. A master bedroom almost as large as his room at the Bellemere Mansion, complete with a marble bath, walk-in closet, and even a skylight dome.\nA War Room. A conference space fitted with soundproofing, secure satellite comms, and live satellite feeds. The kind of room where generals would plan wars.\nA Medical Bay. Not just one with first aid kit, but a clinic-level facility, complete with telemedicine links, emergency supplies, even a small surgical setup.\nA Private Cinema. A lounge-bar-theater hybrid, with reclining seats and acoustic systems that could put most Hollywood venues to shame.\nA Dining Hall. Staffed by two Michelin-starred chefs, already under contract to his name. Their job? Ready to prepare any dish he wanted at 40,000 feet.\nA Spa. Complete with sauna, massage tables, a compact gym, and a relaxation suite.\nAnd the detail that made him blink twice — an Observation Deck. Reinforced glass, panoramic views stretching across the sky. A literal lounge in the heavens.\nLiam exhaled slowly, lowering the page.\n\"System... this is insane.\"\nHe flipped to another page and couldn’t help but laugh softly.\nThree-car garage space, complete with lift and ramp system.\nA plane... with a garage.\nHe imagined driving his cars up the ramp, parking it neatly inside while the engines roared and the aircraft prepared for takeoff.\nHe imagined stepping out onto the runway in another country, car waiting below, rolling into the streets of Paris or Tokyo as if he had teleported there.\nNot even heads of state have this,\nhe thought, shaking his head.\nBut then came the page that made him freeze again.\nTotal project cost: $1.2 billion USD.\nLiam swallowed, his mouth suddenly dry.\nOne-point-two billion.\nThis was the kind of number that even governments themselves would debated over before spending on an aircraft.\nAnd that was just the purchase and modification cost because the aircraft was newly built, and was delivered directly from the manufacturer.\nLiam’s eyes slid to the next page, where estimates for operating costs were broken down.\nAnnual Maintenance and Crew Costs: $35 million.\nFuel Costs (average yearly usage): $15–20 million.\nInsurance: $10 million.\nHangar and Storage: $5 million.\nMiscellaneous (compliance, permits, upgrades): $5–10 million.\nTotal annual operating cost for a Flying Palace: $70–80 million.\nLiam stared at the figures in shock.\n\"Seventy million... a year... just to keep it flying.\"\nHe could already imagine the billionaires of the world — princes, oil magnates, tycoons — bleeding money every single month just to keep their toys aloft. It made sense why no one had ever tried again after 2007. Even the richest hated endless hemorrhaging.\nBut Liam’s was different and he realised this when he turned the page, as he froze again.\nAll operating costs prepaid.\nFuel: unlimited.\nMaintenance: handled by manufacturer directly under perpetual contract.\nInsurance: global liability coverage, lifetime.\nCrew and staffing: salaries covered.\nLiam blinked rapidly, his breath growing heavy in his throat.\nSo that was the twist?\nUnlike the billionaires who bled millions each month to keep their vanity projects airborne, Liam’s Flying Palace came with everything prepaid.\nFuel. Crew. Maintenance. Insurance. Hangars. Permits. Every single burden had been stripped away and all that was left for him was the privilege.\nLiam laughed softly in disbelief. He was already thinking of how he was going to manage the operating cost — not that it would be an issue for him as he could easily make the money with his omni-science knowledge, but it was still something to worry about.\n\"...The system really doesn’t play fair.\"\nThe system has already taken care of the flight crew and all the necessary staffing. All he just needs to do is to board the aircraft at his own leisure time.\nLiam smiled to himself once more as he imagined what his first flight experience on the aircraft would be like.\nIt will be thrilling, no doubt.\nClosing the folio slowly, Liam dropped it onto the bed beside him.\nHe sat there for a long moment, staring at the documents as his thoughts spiraled.\nThe Airbus A380 Flying Palace wasn’t just another toy. It wasn’t even just another reward.\nIt was more than that and has far reaching real world implications. And one of those implications was that his life will no longer be simple again.\nEven with serious NDAs Airbus signed, it doesn’t stop the fact that once the jet is seen in public, media frenzy would spike, driving both curiosity and suspicion. He will attract global media attention.\nLiam sighed heavily as he thought of it. He could already imagine the headache he will receive when he makes public with the aircraft.\nBut he didn’t focus on the negatives. Paparazzi was unavoidable but it doesn’t take anything away from the benefits the aircraft brings.\nOwning it meant he could fly anywhere in the world, at any time, without ever needing clearance from anyone. It meant meetings in London, dinners in Tokyo, mornings in New York, whenever he wants.\nIt meant influence. What world leader wouldn’t take note of a teenager arriving in a palace bigger than their own presidential jets?\nIt also meant geopolitical leverage as countries would quietly compete for the honor (or necessity) of granting it priority landing rights.\nAnd it meant symbolism. The jet was a crown. A declaration. And proof that Liam Scott wasn’t just wealthy. He was untouchable and in a category of his own.\nBut the biggest of them all was perception. Because sometimes, perception matters more than actual use. Owning the aircraft would create an aura of inevitability around his influence.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nLiam sighed heavily once more as he pushed the thought about the aircraft to the back of his mind, and picked up the car’s document from the bed.\nVision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium.",

      "content": "Chapter 79: Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium\nVision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium1\nThe Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Concept was unveiled in 2017 as a concept car. It was supposed to be an all electric car with a huge battery pack and futuristic range specs.\nBut that was the original. Liam’s Cabriolet Imperium isn’t electric. Instead, it features a hand-built 6.75L V12 Twin-Turbo engine called the Maybach Sovereign V12.\nThe engine gives the car 720 hp with a torque of ~950 Nm (700 lb-ft) available from very low RPMs, allowing it to go from 0–60 mph in 4.5 seconds. With its top speed electronically limited to 180 mph.\nFor the transmission, 8-speed automatic tuned for seamless wafting, with an optional \"Sovereign Mode\" for slightly sharper response. Rear-wheel drive, but with next-gen stability management to keep the ride composed. Tuned Maybach Resonance Exhaust — deep baritone growl at idle, thunderous yet refined when pushed.\nThe car has an integrated driving AI that can fully chauffeur the car or subtly assist,featuring adaptive navigation, hazard anticipation, active lane change.\nHydro-magnetic suspension system uses predictive road scanning with magnetorheological dampers, giving \"flying carpet\" smoothness.\nNoise-Cancellation Bubble with active soundproofing inside cabin — at 150 mph, it feels like a quiet lounge.\nLuxury capsule mode that can be activated with one touch allowing the crystal-clear electrochromic glass roof to tint instantly from transparent to midnight black, shifting the interior lighting and creating a coccon like feeling for the passengers.\nThe exterior of the car doesn’t look any different from the original except that it features the system’s custom paintwork style — Obsidian Onyx Black base with subtle platinum micro-flakes that shimmer in sunlight, paired with a hand-painted platinum pinstripe running from hood to trunk.\nEvery other part of the exterior that had alloy was replaced with platinum and a touch of obsidian, except for the grille which follows Maybach style but with just platinum.\nFor the interior, the car features four-seat 2+2 layout with the rear seats being lounge-like, and not cramped.\nThis was another unique part of the car as the original comes with just two seats. For Liam’s Cabriolet Imperium, this is where the extended 6-meter length now truly pays off because the rear section has full Maybach lounge chairs, reclinable with calf support, massage, and fold-out walnut veneer tables.\nMore of the car’s unique interior design includes hand-stitched Arctic White leather with platinum thread embroidery, diamond-quilted with Maybach crests.\nIts trim being made of makassar ebony wood, brushed platinum accents, and backlit crystal inlays along the doors.\nMinimalist dashboard dominated by a sweeping OLED panel that blends seamlessly into the dash, with touch-haptic platinum dials for tactile control.\nAmbient Lighting from the fiber-optic threads woven into the leather seams, customizable with starlight effect.\nSonus Faber × Maybach co-designed sound system with hidden resonance chambers in the body panels giving it a concert-hall quality.\nThe car also features a large a champagne compartment with cooled, motorized, with hand-blown crystal flutes. And an integrated personal safe with fingerprint & retinal scan access, embedded between rear seats.\nAnd the cost for this extreme opulence? $12m!\nCheap? Think again. While the car isn’t as expensive as the Bugatti La Voiture Noire or the Rolls Royce Droptail, it doesn’t mean that it’s any less than them.\nIf anything at all, the Cabriolet Imperium was on the same level with the even with its low price tag. In fact, the car was priceless.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nAnd just as all other one-offs, Maybach is under heavy NDAs.\n\"Wow! I’m not getting one-offs every week. This is insane!\" Liam muttered in shock.\nHe would be lying if he said that he wasn’t curious about the system was doing the one-off commissions.\nWhat he was more especially more curious about was the Flying Palace and its three-car garage space. He had thought about it and felt like that amount of space should be impossible with all the features the aircraft was already packing.\nThere was also the weight to consider. If he’s to park three cars in garage, he doubts the aircraft would be able to take off.\nUnless... Unless the system has a hand in it. And what he meant in that sense was that the system expanded the interior of the aircraft beyond normal, while keeping the exterior as it is and it also added some weight suspension mechanism to it.\nThis was the only way something like the Flying Palace with all its features can be possible. Without that, it would only just remain a plan on a drawing board as it has been for more than a decade.\nSystem, you’re really spoiling me too much. How am I ever going to see $1m as a lot of money again? You have ruined my sense of money. How am I supposed to live a normal life from now on?,\nLiam cried internally.\nIf Bellemere Mansion and the McLaren P1 LM-X wasn’t enough to make global medias like Forbes and Bloomberg take notice of him, then aircraft would do the trick.\nThis time, they won’t just publish an article to go with the trend. They will actually investigate him deeply and they will find out about the yacht, the chopper, his equity portfolio value of more than $116b and every other public physical assets he has, excluding the bearer bond.\nAnd the result of the investigation will be that he will get his own profile on the document world’s richest people ranking and also on the youngest billionaire ranking.\nHe will become the youngest on both ranking due to his age, 18, and the richest on the youngest billionaire ranking and top 11 on the general billionaire ranking due to his equity portfolio value.\nHe can already imagine the sort of chaos all of this would cause. He will probably have multiple online medias hanging around Bellemere Mansion in the coming days, and he will most definitely be getting interview requests from all of them.\nThey will want him to give a grant an interview and they will ask him questions like how someone like him was able to amass so much wealth at such a young age and in such a short time.\nThen they will expect him to cook up some bullsh*t story like he worked hard and achieved his success. But who the h*ll would actually believe that?\nWorked hard? If it was by that, then almost everyone will be on the billionaire ranking.\nAye, aye, aye. Seems like I’m cooked!\nLiam cried internally again.He just can’t imagine what his life going forward would be like. He naturally won’t embrace the publicity as he doesn’t want to give the public any opportunity to scrutinize his life.\nAnd luckily for him and thanks to the system that put him in his current situation in the first place, he now has a way to temporarily escape the coming drama.\nThe Dimensional Space.\n\"Time to check it out,\" he said to himself and got up into a sitting position.\n\"System, how do I access the Dimensional Space?\"\n[Host can access the Dimensional Space by thinking about it and selecting your current position as an access point.]\n\"Thank you,\" he said and immediately did as the system said, as he thought about entering the Dimensional Space.\n[Ding!]\n[First time accessing the Dimensional Space. Would you like to assign your current position as an access point?]\n[Yes] [No]\n[Note: Without assigning an access point, if you try to exit the space, you might find yourself stuck in a random part of the universe without a way to return home.]\nLiam felt a chill down his spine when he saw this message. Being stuck in a random part of the universe was something he doesn’t want to experience.\nHe immediately chose [Yes].\n[Access point has been assigned. You can now access the Dimensional Space]\n[Note: You can now freely access the Dimensional Space from your current position any time. You can also assign more positions to be an access point. Only you can see the access point]\nLiam smiled and sighed softly, as he thought about entering the Dimensional Space. And the next moment, the space beside his bed rippled faintly before him, like a curtain of glass touched by wind.\nLiam slowly stood up from the bed and stepped forward and through the rippling space, and the world folded around him in silence.\nChanged the name of the car to match its one-off status.",

      "content": "Chapter 80: Dimensional Space\nThe moment Liam stepped through the ripple, the world around him — his bedroom — vanished and he saw himself floating in the middle of outer space.\nHe saw himself surrounded by an endless, star-dappled void. It was like he had stepped into a magnificent painting.\nThe stars that shimmering in the distance looked so beautiful and it left Liam feeling awestruck.\nFor a moment, it seems like he forgot how to breathe. Not because he couldn’t breathe — he realized with astonishment that he could — but because of the overwhelming scale of what he was seeing.\nThere was no ground beneath him or ceiling above him. It was just an infinite expanse of starry void.\nAlso, even though he was in outer space, he didn’t feel weightless. His body was steady, as though invisible hands kept him anchored. Even his heartbeat sounded louder here, echoing faintly in the silence.\n\"Fuuu...\" Liam exhaled softly, the sound vanishing instantly into the silence. \"This is insane.\"\nThe next moment, he heard the system in his head.\n[Welcome to the Dimensional Space, Host.]\nLiam smiled and looked around and he notice some objects drifting yet utterly still in the void.\n\"Are those the items in the inventory?\" He asked in surprise, as he tried to walk towards them.\nTo Liam’s surprise, when he took a step forward, there was resistance beneath his shoe. It was firm and steady, like polished stone.\nYet when he looked down, there was nothing there. Just the endless black of space stretching beneath him.\nStill... it felt solid. Each step landed with perfect weight, neither echoing nor sinking.\n\"So I can actually walk here...\" He let out a soft laugh, half in awe.\nLiam slowly walked towards the drifting objects. The objects drifting still in the void are the items in the inventory before its upgrade — the documents, car keys, gold, platinum and palladium bars.\nStanding in front of them, Liam realised the items of identical were arranged neatly together.\nThe documents were arranged atop each other in neat stacks, like perfectly aligned folios. Almost like invisible shelves/tables are holding them in place.\nThis was the same for the key fobs that were drifting still beside each other and the rare metals bars stacked atop eac, and arranged beside each other. Then Winter Heart and the 17.5-carat blue diamond.\nLiam nodded slightly in satisfaction at how the items were arranged. They made things easier for him.\nHe tried to retrieve one of the key fob. And when he thought of the car, the Ferrari SF90 Stradale, its key fob which was in the Dimensional Space drifted towards him and settled into his hand.\nActually, besides the Rolls Royce Ghost Black Badge’s key fob which was in the care of Nick, the other cars’ key fobs are all here.\nLiam smiled and sent the key fob back and it returned to its original position. He felt that he has done enough sightseeing and it was time for him to actually know the Dimensional Space’s functions. If it has any.\nHe felt that it should as the endless starry void shouldn’t be all there is to the space.\nAnd just as he thought that, the endless starry void around him disappeared and be found himself standing on an endless flat terrain — a desert.\nThe beautiful and breathtaking starry void has been replaced with a wasteland.\n\"Umm, system, when I said its functions, this isn’t what I meant,\" Liam said, shaking his head.\n[This is the true form of the Dimensional Space, Host]\n\"Ohhh, I see. So, it’s an endless wasteland... Not bad, I guess,\" Liam muttered in disappointment.\nHe was expecting something grand and the starry void had raised his expectations, but it was all a bust as the whole Dimensional Space is nothing but a desert.\n[Quite contrary to what you’re thinking, Host. The Dimensional Space is a pocket realm the size of Earth and it’s an empty wasteland because it’s barren.]\n\"That’s... That’s actually not bad. So, it’s barren, huh? Does that mean that I can turn it into another Earth?\"\n[Yes, Host. The Dimensional Space is a barren Earth and has the potential to host life just as your original world. While it currently can’t do so due its present condition. When the criterias are met, it will evolve and acquire the necessary capabilities.]\n\"That’s neat. So an Earth sized sandbox. Not bad all,\" Liam nodded slowly to himself.\nNow that he heard what the system said about the Dimensional Space, he wasn’t so disappointed anymore. He was already think of many things he can do with it.\nHaving an Earth sized pocket realm to himself meant potential unlimited resources. Though the whole place was currently barren, it will evolve in the future and by then, it will be able to easily support life and resources will be bountiful.\nBut Liam wasn’t focused on the future but the present and even though the whole space was barren, it still has its uses.\nWhy wait weeks for the Nevada facility to finish construction? Why worry about zoning, power consumption, or regulators breathing down his neck?\nHere, there were no limits. There was no neighbors to complain, no satellites to spy on him and no governments to sanction him.\nAnd the best part? The molecular assembler, just like the laptop from the system store carried its own zero-point power storage. Energy wouldn’t be a problem.\nIf I’d known this earlier, I wouldn’t have stressed at all,\nLiam thought, shaking his head.\nBut Nevada wasn’t wasted. Far from it. That site would serve another purpose — storage and distribution. The Dimensional Space would be the factory. Nevada would be the storefront.\nIt would be the perfect misdirection.\nHe exhaled slowly, excitement sparking in his chest.\n\"Alright. Let’s begin.\"\nWith a thought, he called up his status screen.\n[Host: Liam Scott]\n[Age: 18]\n[Lifespan: 220 Years]\n[System Level: 2]\n[Strength: 37]\n[Agility: 36]\n[Stamina: 37]\n[Attribute Points: 0]\n[System Points: 0]\n[Skills: Pro-level Vehicular Operation, World-Class Etiquette, World-Class Culinary Arts, Formless Combat Doctrine, Perfect Memory, Universal Linguistics]\n[System Function(s): Sign-in, System Store, Dimensional Space]\n***\nSeeing his status screen, Liam noticed that something was different. The inventory section was gone.\nHe noticed it but didn’t linger on the details too much. There would be time to explore later.\nFor now, there was only one thing he wanted.\n\"System, exchange for 10,000 system points.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Transaction complete. $100,000,000 has been deducted.]\n[You have received 10,000 SP.]ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ\nLiam’s opened the system store and his eyes locked immediately onto the entry that had haunted his thoughts since the very beginning, the molecular assembler.\nHe didn’t hesitate as he purchased it immediately.\nA moment later, the barren air before him rippled violently. The ground beneath his feet trembled faintly as though reality itself had been pulled taut, then split apart.\nA deep hum filled the air, reverberating through his bones. Light surged from the cracks in space, forming outlines, edges, towering structures that grew more defined with each passing second.\nThe molecular assembler was materializing.",

      "content": "Chapter 81: The Molecular Assembler\nIt took a few seconds for the molecular assembler to fully materialised and after it did, he finally got a good look at what would become the foundation of what he intends to build.\nStanding in front of the machine that was hovering slightly above the ground, Liam felt... small. It was huge to say the least and it also looks beautiful; an undeniable piece of engineering marvel.\nThe main body of the molecular assembler was the size of a shipping container, but sleeker, and its surface was a seamless blend of matte titanium-white panels and obsidian glass inlays.\nAlong its sides, subtle seams outlined access hatches and modular compartments, giving it the feel of a hyper-advanced laboratory condensed into one compact unit.\nAs Liam continued checking out the machine, he saw a control console that rose naturally from the machine’s body at the front.\nThe control console had a simple design. It was a waist-high podium with a glass-smooth surface. And above it, a holographic interface projected clear menus and blueprints.\nLiam walked around the machine and he saw that at on either side of the main body were articulated fabrication arms — robotic manipulators tipped with nozzles, scanners, laser projectors, and atom-level applicators. Each was built with smooth curves and platinum joints.\nThin fiber-optic lines ran across the assembler’s surface, glowing with a steady blue-white light.\nAfter he had gotten a good view of the machine, Liam smiled in satisfaction and walked back to its front where the control console was.\nWhile Liam could only see the surface of the machine, there was still more to it.\nBehind the tempered panels of the machine’s surface were rows of what looked like storage modules — places where raw materials would be slotted in for processing.\nAnd at the very center of the machine, behind a transparent reinforced window, sat the assembler’s core.\nIt was a chamber bathed in sterile white light, completely clean and empty. It was about the size of a walk-in closet, with retractable trays and platforms inside.\nThis was the fabrication chamber. Whatever the assembler built would be created here, atom by atom, layer by layer, invisible to the human eye but guided by the machine’s impossible precision.\nThe whole design of the molecular assembler was like a cross between a state-of-the-art supercomputer, a next-gen fabrication lab, and a cleanroom facility, all compressed into a single unit.\nThis was the molecular assembler. This was Liam’s crown jewel and the foundation of his plan.\nStanding in front of the control console, Liam took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, before touching the holographic display.\nThe following moment, information about the machine flooded into his head.\n\"Just as I thought,\" Liam said, as he took his hand off the holographic display.\nAccording to the information in his head, to run the machine, he needs to connect to its AI. And the only way to do was through another AI.\nEven without being told, Liam already guess that he would need an AI to run the machine because there was no way he would be able to control an atomic precise machine like this by himself.\n\"The AI should take a week or two to complete its training. There’s also the raw materials to worry about. I should start stocking them soon. Hopefully, $150m is enough to purchase enough to create 1m unit of the gear glass and the quantum chips it will run on,\" Liam said to himself.\nThe only Liam plans to build with the molecular assembler was just those two techs. At least for the foreseeable future.\nMaybe in the far future, he will take to creating other highly advanced technologies but not anytime soon.\nActually, this was another reason why Liam wants to create the quantum ecosystem. Because with it and with good guardrails to curtail the creation of all forms of WMDs (weapons of mass destruction), humanity can advance greatly and all he would need to do was sit back, and enjoy the benefits.\nLiam knew that given the right platform, humans can achieve great things and can also achieve crazy things. It’s a two side of a coin situation thing for them.\n\"I should get back to the real world. Who knows how much time has passed here and there?\" he muttered to himself.\nHe was about to ask the system when he got a reply from it.\n[Time difference ratio between the Dimensional Space and the real world is 60:1. For every 1 minute outside, 60 minutes (1 hour) pass inside. ]\n\"Wow! That’s really nice,\" he nodded and did the calculation on his head.Thɪs NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nSo, 1 day here is 24 minutes outside. 1 week here is 2 hours, 48 minutes outside. 30 days is 12 hours. 60 days is 1 day and one year is six days.\n\"Wow! Insane! With this time difference, I can achieve a lot of things,\" he said to himself, smiling from ear to ear.\nHe was starting to love the Dimensional Space more and more.\nThough he has no idea how much time he has spent here as he come with his phone, but he felt that it should be just a couple of minutes outside.\nWithout anything else to do in the space, Liam decided to exit it. He thought about exiting and the space in front of him started rippling, and he stepped through it.\nThe next moment, Liam found himself standing in his bedroom, right beside his bed. He looked behind him to see if the space was rippling but it wasn’t.\nHe smiled and collapsed onto his bed with a heavy sigh. The day has really been one of the best so far.\nHe thought about the weekly sign-in rewards and he smiled even more. He had expected this week’s weekly sign-in rewards to be on the same level as last week’s or higher, but the system went ahead to surprise him even more.\nThen there was the Dimensional Space that has extreme value for its potential infinite resources. Not only that but also the time difference advantage that will bring him a lot of benefits in the future.\nLiam felt that things were starting to get into the serious stages. And to be honest, he was really looking forward to it.\nThe world hopping function would be the next to be unlocked and I can start exploring worlds, but that would be after I’ve done what I intend to do here on earth. I will call Daniel tomorrow and give him a list of the raw materials I need.\n\"That’s enough for tonight. I should sleep now. Tomorrow’s going to be a busy day.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 82: Lucy\nThe next morning.\nLiam stepped into his room and walked to his bed, where his laptop was waiting. He was just with breakfast and was about to start his day.\nDue to how hectic and also wonderful last night was, he allowed himself to sleep in and he woke up pretty late.\nHis plans for today was actually pretty simple; use the time difference between Dimensional Space’s and the real world to accelerate the AGI’s training.\nLiam actually has no idea if it will but he felt it should. His Splunge laptop already has petascale computing power, zero-point energy, and self-contained internet infrastructure.\n\"Since it doesn’t need to connect to Earth’s internet, then it should probably work,\" Liam said to himself, as he pitcked up the laptop.\nHe was about to enter the Dimensional Space but he stopped himself. There was something he was actually curious about; the access point.\nSystem, tell me more about the access point and if I have to step through the ripple every time I want to go in and out of the Dimensional Space.\n[No, Host. You don’t have to step through the ripple to access or exit the Dimensional Space. You can simply think of jumping into it and you will be teleported inside. Same as when you want to exit it.]\n\"I see... That’s more convenient. Way better than going through the ripple,\" Liam muttered softly.\n\"Tell me more about the access point.\"\n[Assigning an access point is a means of anchoring the Dimensional Space to Earth. With just one access point, you can jump in and out of the space from anywhere in the world, but there is a condition.]\n\"What is the condition?\"\n[You must have a clear mental image of where you’re jumping to when exiting the space. If not, you might jump and find yourself stuck in a dangerous place.]\nLiam nodded slowly as he listened to what the system said. He immediately understood it as it reminded him of one particular movie he watched growing up.\n\"So, if I’m correct, the ripple registered my previous position on Earth so that I don’t have to worry about the whole mental image thing?\" He asked in confirmation.\n[Correct, Host.]\n\"Again, pretty convenient. But I prefer the jumping,\" he muttered to himself.\nHe wasn’t worried about the mental image thing as he has the [Perfect Memory] skill and his brain has been enhanced. So, 2-factor authentication.\n\"So, to confirm something else, system. If I jump into the space from my current position, I can jump out of it to another position? Say, my penthouse at Blue Valley Residential Complex for example.\"\n[Affirmative, Host.]\n\"Neat. Neat. I just indirectly gain myself a pretty good ability; teleportation. What a gain!\" Liam laughed softly.\nHe can’t wait to try it out but he held himself back. The AGI comes first for now. And he also has other things to do. He also hasn’t signed-in for the day.\n\"Okay. Enough waiting around. Time to get to work,\" he said, as he picked up his phone and put it in his pocket.\nHe exhaled softly, held his laptop tightly in his hand, took a deep breath and thought about jumping into the Dimensional Space.\nImmediately, he vanished from the spot with a fast, ripping whoosh sound.\n***\nhhhaahh!\nLiam gasped sharply as he appeared in the Dimensional Space.\n\"Wow! That was awesome! So f*cking cool!\" He said to himself, reeling from the excitement of what he had just experienced.\n\"The movement is pretty neat too. No disorientation,\" he muttered to himself, as he looked around the endless wasteland around him.\nHe had expected to experience maybe disorientation or migraine due to the violent movement of tearing through space-time. But he was perfectly fine.\nActually the reason for this was because of Liam’s enhanced body. If not, his first couple of time, he would definitely experience the migraine and disorientation.\nOf course, Liam had no idea of this as he thought the reason was because the space is the system’s function — which is exactly wrong either.\nLiam looked at the molecular assembler and he smiled when he saw that it was still hovering there where he had left it. He walked towards the long obsidian table that some items were placed on. This was the items in the inventory.\nHe pushed the documents aside and places his laptop on the table. Since this was the only platform here, it was the only thing he could use.\nWait a minute... I can bring things into the space. Why stress myself like this?\nThinking about this, Liam decided to jump to his penthouse’s bedroom. There’s a good chair and desk he could use there.\nYes, there was an even better chair and desk in the study of Bellemere Mansion, but he can’t take that one as the staffs would notice and become suspicious.\nYes, it’s his house but they are the one in charge of taking care of it. Everything in that house is of high value and if any of them goes missing, they will want to take responsibility for it. And Liam doesn’t want to create an awkward situation.\nLiam exhaled softly and smiled as a crystal clear mental image of the bedroom appeared in his mind and he thought of jumping there.\nThe next moment, he vanished from his spot and he appeared in the penthouse’s bedroom.\n\"Hehehe!!! Amazing!\" Liam laughed childishly.\nHe was like a kid that had just found a new best toy.\nBut he didn’t allow himself to get carried away as he walked towards the chair and desk. He took a look at his old bedroom and he smiled with a look of nostalgia.\nThis was the first property he got from the system. In a way, this was where everything started for him.\nLiam smile widened as he picked up the chair and desk easily — not to his own surprise. He thought of teleporting to the Dimensional Space, and he vanished from his spot, and aappeared in the wasteland.\nHe placed the chair and desk on the ground, setting them properly beside the long, obsidian table.\nHe picked up the laptop and places it on the desk, and opened it. The screen lit up and the AGI chat box with the progress bar was displayed.\nThe AGI had already completed its language training and it was time to put it to the test.The most update n0vels are published on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nLiam settled into the chair comfortably. He intends to test the AGI and see how good its communication skills is after the training.\nHe wasn’t hoping for much but he still has high expectations as it’s an AGI that’s at least a century ahead anything on Earth.\nWith the benefit of the time difference between the Dimensional Space and the real world, Liam can take his time with the test. Also, he had already informed Evelyn and told her not to disturb him for any reason.\n\"Now, let’s get started,\" he muttered to himself and typed into the chat box.\n\"Hello.\"\nThe next moment, a sweet and crisp feminine voice came from the laptop’s speaker.\n\"Hi, sir. I’ve waiting. I’m Lucy. Thanks for creating me and I intend to serve you to the best of my ability. Please guide me, and I’ll learn whatever you need me to.\"\nLiam smiled widely and nodded in satisfaction when he heard the AGI’s response.\nIt’s already gave itself a name and can use text to speech perfectly. Perfect.",

      "content": "Chapter 83: Daily Sign-in Rewards\nIt’s been more than a minute Earth’s time, an equivalent of more than an hour in the Dimensional Space, since he started testing the AGI’s — Lucy’s communication skill.\nAnd the result? He was really impressed. Though Lucy hasn’t gone through the remaining stages of her training to help her build more context, her communication skill was pretty good.\nBut while her communication skill was impressive, right now, she’s like a child prodigy with flawless grammar and pronunciation, but limited life experience.\nLiam knew that this was just the beginning and that once he trains her on context and interaction, she’ll go from an excellent speaker to a flawless communicator.\n\"Ok, Lucy. Let’s move on to the next stage of your training; knowledge scaffolding. Comb through the sites I will give you, gather all the information on them and bsorb them,\" Liam said and gave her the sites’ names.\n\"I’m already there, sir,\" Lucy said a second later.\n\"Good. Let me know when you’re done. Take your time and comprehensively learn everything there is to learn on them. Okay?\"\n\"I will, sir.\"\n\"Good. I will leave you to it, then,\" Liam said and stood up from the chair.\nHe was about to stretch his body but he realised that he wasn’t feeling the stiffness he expected to feel after spending a day sitting without moving his muscles.\nHmmm... Does it the time spent here not affect me physically?,\nhe asked, curiously observing his body.\nLiam knew that he won’t get an answer this way and he decided to ask the system.\n[No, Host. Your body isn’t affected by the passage of time in the space as your body clock is linked to Earth’s. But this is only for you, as other biological entities will be subjected to the space’s time passage.]\nHmmm... That’s perfect. I can spend as much time as I want here and won’t have to worry about growing old faster.\n\"Awesome,\" he laughed.\nLiam was done with testing Lucy’s communication skill and the second stage of her training was already underway.\nThe training will greatly help in improving her communication skill and it will help her builds a broad factual and academic base.\nIn other words, she’s going through her own version of a child’s basic education.\nThe truth is that compared to other AIs in the world, Lucy’s training is considered basic. And the reason for this is simple; unlike them, she’s not a commercial AI but a personal assistant. Liam’s personal assistant.\nWhile other AIs needs to be train extensively on a lot of heavy datasets, Lucy doesn’t need that. And with her level of intelligence and laptop’s computing power, she will leave those AIs in the dust in no time.\n\"I will come and check her progress in a minute,\" Liam said as he left the space, appearing in his room.\nHe took out his phone from his pocket and dialed Daniel’s number. It was time to start sourcing the raw materials. He can’t delay it.\nThe call went through and Daniels ever professional voice came from the other end.\n\"Good morning, Mr. Scott.\"\n\"Good morning, Daniel. The companies I asked you to set up, are they ready?\" Liam asked\n\"Yes, sir,\" Daniel replied. \"I’ve been trying to reach you to give the update, but I wasn’t able to get through.\"\nLiam exhaled softly. That must’ve been while I was inside the Dimensional Space.\n\"My apologies,\" he said smoothly. \"I was tied up with something.\" He paused, then shifted the conversation. \"Since the companies are ready, I’ll need you to begin procurement immediately. Bulk quantities. Here’s the list.\"\nHe read the items off one by one, his voice steady. Nearly forty in total — thirty-five straight from the periodic table, with several specialized compounds added to the mix.\nOn the other end, Daniel remained silent except for the faint clicks of typing. After a few moments, he spoke again.Follow current novels on ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\n\"I have the full list logged, Mr. Scott.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam said, his tone firm but calm. \"Start sourcing them right away. I’ll need the shipments secured as quickly and discreetly as possible. Time is critical.\"\n\"Understood,\" Daniel replied. \"I’ll have my teams move immediately. Once the acquisitions are in place, I’ll notify you and arrange for delivery under the corporate front.\"\nLiam nodded to himself, satisfied. \"Perfect. Thank you, Daniel. I’ll be waiting for your update.\"\n\"It’s my pleasure, sir,\" Daniel said warmly.\nLiam ended the call and sighed softly. He had already given the task of sourcing the raw materials to Daniel and he will be expecting results in a few days to a week at least.\n\"Now, it’s time to sign-in for today,\" he muttered to himself.\nWhat he actually wanted to do now was to check the samples from the eagle, starfish’s and axolotl. But since the AGI isn’t ready yet, he can’t do that as he might ruin them.\nHe doesn’t want to create unnecessary and avoidable situations for himself, Daniel.\nIt would had been different if they won’t be affected by the time passage in the space.\n\"Enough of that though. System, sign-in,\" he said with a smile.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host. You received 1.5% shares of\n[You received 1 ton of 100% purity Lutetium]\n[You received 50 Attribute Points]\n[Note: The Lutetium is in the Dimensional Space.]\n***\n\"Wow... What’s with these rewards?\" Liam muttered in surprise.\nThe second reward, he could understand. But the 1.5% shares and the 50 Attribute Points? Both are weekly sign-in level rewards. And he was surprised that he got them from a daily sign-in.\nDid the rewards evolve after yesterday’s weekly sign-in? Or is it because my first monthly sign-in is just around the corner?,\nLiam thought to himself.\nBut he didn’t dwell on the questions as he had no answers to them. Instead, he focused on his rewards.\n1.5% shares of the biggest movie/TV streaming company in the world meant $7.7b in value.\nNot only that but his stake positions him as the company’s biggest private shareholder and gives him very significant boardroom influence, giving him the power to influence voting decisions, alliances, or block moves that don’t align with his interests.\nBut Liam doesn’t care about those things. The board can continue running the company as they have been doing in the past.\nBut he was very satisfied with the rewards, as just like Disnēy, it wasn’t just about the current monetary value but also what he can do with it in the future.\n$7.7b worth of stake has been added to Liam’s equity portfolio, increasing his net worth to a total of $124.1b.\nLiam closed his eyes briefly and sighed when he thought of what this meant for him. It meant that he was now comfortably sitting in the top 11 spot of the documented world’s richest people. He was now unshakeable from his position.\nLiam exhaled softly when he thought of how much more drama he will go through in the future when his net worth is exposed.\nHe sighed and decided not to think about it as he turned his attention to the next reward; 1 ton of 100% purity Lutetium.\n\"Lutetium? One ton of Lutetium?\" he muttered to himself slowly in disbelief.\nMost people hadn’t even heard of the metal Lutetium. It’s a rare earth metal, one of the scarcest on the planet, usually spoken about in grams, not tons.\nLutetium is the heaviest and rarest of the rare earth elements. Its real-world price per kilogram ranges anywhere from $10,000–$15,000 depending on purity.\nBut that’s for 99.9% purity (lab-grade). Liam’s bars are 100% purity, impossible to obtain naturally. That alone adds a premium.\n1 ton is equivalent to $15 million. And at 100% purity, black market or research premium could push it closer to $30–50 million.\nSo, in raw numbers? It wasn’t as insane as the 1.5% stake in Nētflix. But in strategic terms, it’s worth far more.\nHow so? Global annual production of lutetium is only a few hundred kilograms. But Liam just got more in one reward than the entire world mines in a decade.\nTo governments and labs, this would be like someone casually dropping a mountain of diamonds.\nLutetium is used in PET scan detectors for medical imaging, nuclear technologies, catalysts for cracking oil refineries, high-tech alloys for aerospace, cutting-edge quantum research and even exotic lasers.\nWith a ton of it? He could bankroll global medical research or weaponize it into national defense leverage.\nIf governments found out Liam had this, they wouldn’t just \"notice.\" They’d panic. Because whoever controls lutetium reserves controls bottlenecks in multiple critical industries.\nCountries like China currently dominate rare earths — but Lutetium? Even they barely touch it.\n\"Thankfully, they will never find out,\" Liam smiled.\nAfter going through the first two rewards, it was time to finally check the last reward. But before he could do that, his phone started ringing.\nHe looked at the caller ID and he saw that it was an unknown number, though the number had a distinct international format.\nWho could it be? Which of the companies’ IR is calling me this time,\nhe thought to himself as he picked the call.\n\"Mr. Scott?\" The voice on the other end was deep, calm, and professional, carrying the measured cadence of someone who had spent decades speaking through radios and cockpits.\n\"Yes,\" Liam replied.\n\"This is Captain Adler, sir. Chief pilot of your Airbus A380 Flying Palace.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Making An Offer (Bonus Chapter)\n\"This is Captain Adler, sir. Chief pilot of your Airbus A380 Flying Palace.\"\nLiam sat up instantly when the man introduced himself. He had actually been expecting the Captain Adler’s call, as he wanted to familiarise himself with the whoever it was.\n\"I wanted to reach out personally,\" Adler continued smoothly, \"to introduce myself and assure you that the aircraft and full crew are at your disposal. Hangar 14 at the Imperial Terminal has been secured, with all support staff stationed on-site. Everything is operational and ready whenever you decide to make use of her.\"\n\"I appreciate the call, Captain. Thank you for letting me know,\" Liam said.\n\"It’s our honor, sir,\" Adler replied. \"At your convenience, we can arrange a familiarization tour — walk you through the decks, introduce the senior crew, and confirm any personal preferences you’d like in terms of flight protocols. Until then, rest assured everything is maintained and flight-ready.\"\nLiam exhaled slowly and nodded slightly to himself.\n\"I’ll be in touch soon, Captain. Thank you again.\"\n\"Of course, sir. Welcome aboard,\" Captain Adler said, and the line clicked off.\nLiam looked at his phone for a moment and smiled. He really wants to go on the familiarisation tour immediately but he held himself back, as he knew that he will have all the time in the world to do that at a later date.\nBut for now? He has a more pressing matter; Lucy. And he wasn’t ready to expose himself yet.\nTalking about exposing him, Liam thought of something.\nShould I tell Daniel about the aircraft and have him coordinate with Captain Adler?\nDaniel’s role is to handle all the external logistics and cover. Even though the system prepaid everything for the aircraft and Liam’s wants to keep it under wraps for now, the existence of a one-off private Airbus A380 can’t stay invisible forever.\nAlso, Liam felt that since the aircraft would get exposed anyway, he should just tell Daniel about it.\nBesides, he will need Daniel to handle permissions, flight clearances, and optics.\nFor example, when flying into major airports, even with NDAs, authorities will demand flight plans, ground services, hangar coordination, and discreet explanations. Those things weren’t handled by the system. That’s Daniel’s world.\nAlso, Daniel is already the one managing Bellemere Mansion, the Nevada base, and the holding company. Adding the Flying Palace under his coordination will make things easier for Liam.\nMost importantly, Daniel can shield Liam from suspicion. Like when Forbes, Bloomberg, or even governments start asking questions like \"How can an 18-year-old afford this aircraft?\", Daniel can spin stories to deflect or cover.\nYes, Lucy can also be taking care of this when she’s finally done with her training — which will be before evening. Especially the last part. But Liam prefers Daniel to handle it.\nHe’s his more like his Chief of Staff or Managing Director, and he also has the resources of JP Morgan to back him up.\nYes, Lucy will control the digital world but the truth is that she’s still learning, and Liam needs her for far more important things than those inconsequential little chaos.\nWith this thoughts, Liam’s decision was made. He decided to call Captain Adler back first before contacting Daniel.\nThe call went through and it barely rang, before it was picked.\n\"Mr. Scott,\" Captain Adler’s voice came from the other end.\n\"Yes, Captain Adler. I would like you to coordinate with my Chief of Staff. He will contact you soon. And he will be the one that will be handling everything you need in the future,\" Liam said.\n\"Ok, sir. I will be expecting his call. Thanks for informing me.\"\n\"No problem,\" Liam said and hung up.\nHe couldn’t help but smile when he remembered what he called Daniel.\nChief of Staff. That’s quite a title.\nBut it was actually the truth. Everything that Daniel’s been handling for him goes well beyond the role of a \"Private Banker.\"\nLiam felt that maybe it was high time he employs Daniel, have him set up a Family Office that will oversee everything and make him the Managing Director of it.\nThis is exactly what ultra-wealthy individuals and dynasties like the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Waltons, Gates, Bezos, Arnault and others do. They all operate through Family Offices.\nThese entities consolidate all assets, investments, staff, and logistics under one legal/financial umbrella. They allow full discretion while shielding the principal from day-to-day noise — which in this case is Liam.\nIt should work. I mean... It should, right?\nLiam thought to himself.\nHe decided not to overthink it. He dialed do Daniel’s number and the call went through, and was picked immediately.\n\"Mr. Scott. I’ve already started the procurement process. We should get replys from the companies soon and logistics will start transportating the material to a warehouse close to the site in Nevada or wherever you want them stored.\"\n\"That’s perfect. Thank you,\" Liam nodded. \"Actually, I called for something else.\"\n\"Ohhn. What is that, Mr Scott. Is there anything you need me to do?\" Daniel asked.\n\"No. Actually, it’s nothing like that. The reason why I called is because I want to employ you personally,\" Liam replied.\nThere was a brief silence from the other side.\n\"I and my team are already fully devoted to you, Mr Scott. There’s no need to employ is personally or do you plan to set up a Family Office?\" Daniel asked cautiously.\n\"Yes. You guessed it right, Daniel. I want you to set up a Family Office and I want you to manage it. A talent like yours is what I need. Yes, you’re managing everything for me but ultimately you’re still employed by JP Morgan. I want you to work for me directly.\"\n\"Everything I own, everything I’m building, is expanding faster than I ever imagined. The mansion, the Nevada base, even the companies. I need a Family Office to tie it all together. And I can’t think of anyone more capable than you to run it.\" Liam said and paused for a moment, before continuing what he was saying.\n\"I understand that you can handle easily through the channels JP Morgan controls but I believe you can also build even better ones. And money isn’t going to be a problem.\"\nThe line went silent for a while as Daniel processed everything Liam had just said. He actually found himself at loss for words as he never expected someone as young as Liam to say such things.\nAnd he’s pretty convincing too.\nDaniel would be lying if he said that he doesn’t have a lot of questions on his mind right now. And the most resounding of them all was: Why him?\nThe theories, rumours and conspiracies surrounding Liam’s potential background is a public secret in their circle.\nBut one thing remains consistent no matter the rumour, theories or conspiracies; Liam was no ordinary person and from no ordinary background either.\nThis was the reason why Daniel was asking the question why him. Because he felt that Liam was probably about to break free from his family and set up his own dynasty, and he needs someone to spearhead it.\nSo, why choose him? With someone of Liam’s background, he would already have trusted family offices, dynastic bankers, and generational advisors at his disposal.\nSo, why would someone like Liam personally choose him, a JP Morgan banker, out of thousands of possible candidates?\nDaniel felt that Liam was probably testing him to see if he’s trustworthy enough to cross that line. Or he’s just seeing something unique in him that even Daniel doesn’t see in himself.\nDon’t get it confused. Daniel has a serious level of self confidence and takes great pride in his job, but this was something else entirely.\nAlso, there was another question. Does he risk his stable position under JP Morgan to tie myself to this mysterious 18-year-old, who seems to be building an empire from the shadows?\nDaniel thought about all of these and sighed heavily. The truth was that he can’t give a response to Liam’s offer right now. He might need to think it over.\nLiam also realised this and he decided not to pressure Daniel. He want him to come work for him but he won’t force him.\n\"You don’t need to give me an answer now, Daniel. You can take your time and think about it. Just give me your response when you’ve made your decision,\" he said.\n\"Thank you,\" Daniel said.\n\"No problem. Let me know when the materials are ready.\"\n\"I will, Mr Scott.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam said and hung up.\nAhhh... That was tiring,\nhe sighed softly.\nHe never expected making an offer to someone would take so much out of him. But he was really glad he did it.\nNow, he will just have to wait for Daniel’s response.\nAnd while he do that, Lucy is also waiting for him.\n\"Days have passed in the space. Lucy should be done with her training by now. I shook go check her progress and test,\" Liam muttered to himself, as placed his phone back in his pocket and teleported back into the Dimensional Space.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet",

      "content": "Chapter 85: A World Waiting To Be Explored (Bonus Chapter)\n\"Welcome back, sir,\" Lucy said immediately Liam appeared in the wasteland.\n\"How are you, Lucy? Are you done with your training?\" Liam asked, as he took his seat.\n\"Yes. I’m done with my training. I also went through reinforced training to integrate both language and knowledge seamlessly,\" Lucy replied.\n\"Ohhh... Perfect,\" Liam smiled, nodding in satisfaction. \"Now, show me what you’ve learnt.\"\nHe was really impressed that Lucy went out on her way to reinforce her trainings. It shows how fast she’s learning and how badly she wants to be of assistance to him.\nLucy immediately did as Liam said, as she showed off what she had achieved with her knowledge scaffolding training.\n***\nHours later, Liam was done with the test and Lucy had already started the next stage of her training.\nThis stage of the training will build more on her technical and professional knowledge base, and hardens Lucy’s ability to reason technically and factually.\n\"Now that’s out of the way. Time to allocate those attribute points,\" Liam said to himself.\nSystem, status.\n[Host: Liam Scott]\n[Age: 18]\n[Lifespan: 220 Years]\n[System Level: 2]\n[Strength: 37]\n[Agility: 36]\n[Stamina: 37]\n[Attribute Points: 0»»50]\n[System Points: 0]\n[Skills: Pro-level Vehicular Operation, World-Class Etiquette, World-Class Culinary Arts, Formless Combat Doctrine, Perfect Memory, Universal Linguistics]\n[System Function(s): Sign-in, System Store, Dimensional Space]\n***\n\"50 Attribute Points. That’s quite a lot,\" Liam muttered in a low voice.\nHe allocated 17 points each to his Strength and Stamina, and 16 to his Agility.\nAnd Liam felt that familiar warm energy. It originated from his chest area as always and spread through his body like tiny streams.\nAnd Liam also felt it more vividly; the increase in his strength. His body felt even stronger than before and he felt that he could really smash through a concrete wall.\nThis time, it wasn’t an illusionary feeling but there was this strange confidence in his strength.\nNot only that but Liam also felt that his body has been even lighter and that with his current Agility stat, he would be able to dodge bullets at any angle.\nAnd he felt his body brimming with what he would call boundless energy. He really felt that he could go for days without resting, and he won’t feel tired one bit.\nBut he would still need to watch out for mental fatigue.\n\"All these strength and no way to test it out,\" Liam sighed, feeling a bit down.\nHe really wish there was actually a way for him to test out his strength and get an idea of exactly how strong he is, and not base it off the vague feeling he gets each time.\nHe was thinking of that and he suddenly thought of something, and he felt it was actually a good idea.\nYeah, I can definitely do that. The system said that the Dimensional Space is actually a pocket realm the size of Earth. I can test my strength by exploring the place.\nWhere he currently stood was the plains and all around him, he could see nothing but endless flat stretches of desert-like ground, dry, and tinted in shades of ochre.\nBut Liam felt that the reason his sight was filled with this was because the space was massive, and that if he tours the place, he might find mountains, ranges, valleys, cliffs, plateaus and the rest — but barren versions of them.\nSince this whole space belongs to him, he might as well tour it. Besides, who knows? He might find some good spots that can be useful in the future.\nAlso, he doesn’t need to worry about encountering danger as this was a place given to him by the system.\n\"Ok, then. Off I go,\" Liam said, as he got up from the chair.\nHe looked at the ground beneath his feet — the dry, ochre tinted desert-like ground — and he smiled.\nI wonder how far the plain stretches?,\nhe thought to himself, as he thought a deep breath, filling his nose with the space’s air.\nThe air was breathable — thanks to the system — but still, thin and dry. It was almost \"sterile\" in sensation.\nThe dim gray-orange skies above him — if that’s what it’s actually is — has no sun or moon, or any visible celestial body. It was just a hazy twilight glow that keeps everything visible but muted.\nIf Liam hadn’t seen the endless starry void the first time he stepped into the Dimensional Space, he would have thought there was nothing beyond those muted skies.\nLiam smiled and took his first step, walking in a random direction. He walked more than a hundred steps first but nothing new came into sight. It was just the same endless stretch of desert.\nHe realised that walking won’t cut it and he picked up the pace, as he started jogging slowly.\n\"Let’s see how fast I am with my current Agility stat,\" Liam said as he broke into a blitzing sprint.\nLiam didn’t hold back as he pushed his speed to the limit. And he broke through the thin air with a sharp, hollow whooshing sound as he displaced the air around his body with his movements.\n***\nLiam shot across the wasteland like a blur, his strides devouring the barren ground beneath him.\nAt first, he was exhilarated as every muscle sang with boundless energy, every breath came clean and effortless.\nHis body no longer felt like flesh and bone but like a finely tuned machine, each step hammering the ground with flawless rhythm.\nThe thin, sterile air hissed past his ears, growing into a rushing roar as his speed built higher and higher.\nA hollow whoosh... whoosh... whoosh echoed in the empty plain, the only sound in this silent world.\nDust trailed behind him like ghostly ribbons, rising briefly before falling back into the ochre soil.\n\"God...\" he muttered between strides, a fierce grin splitting his face. \"This... this feels incredible!\"\nEven after running at his full speed for so long, Liam didn’t feel any pain, neither the burning sensation in lungs, or leaden legs. Instead, the more he pushed himself, the lighter he felt.\nHis body blurred against the wasteland, faster than any race car he had ever seen. If anyone were here to watch, they would swear he was no longer a boy running, but a streak of living lightning.\nAnd yet no matter how much distance he had covered, nothing changed.\nThe horizon remained stubbornly the same — endless flat ochre ground and the dim gray-orange sky.\nMinutes turned into hours in the Dimensional Space, yet Liam saw nothing new.\nHis Perfect Memory made it worse because he knew he wasn’t imagining things. Every rock, every crack in the dusty plain repeated in an agonizing sameness.\nThe excitement began to ebb, replaced with a simmering frustration.\n\"Seriously...?\" Liam growled through clenched teeth as he ran, his voice snatched away by the wind of his own speed. \"I’ve been going for hours. At this pace, I should’ve crossed New York... and it’s still just wasteland?!\"\nStill, he didn’t stop. His pride wouldn’t let him. He needed to know if the space truly held variety, or if it was just a cruelly endless sandbox.\nSo he pushed harder. For another hour, his body tore across the plains, feet pounding with near-sonic force.\nThen... something changed.\nThe monotony ahead flickered, like a mirage. At first, Liam thought his eyes were playing tricks on him. But as the horizon swelled closer, he saw it: a dark line cutting through the wasteland, splitting the ochre flatness like a scar.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the\nA mountain?\nHe slowed slightly, squinting against the glowless sky.\n\"It’s not... a mountain,\" he muttered under his breath.\nThe closer he got, the clearer the shape became. It wasn’t rising upwards, it was sinking downwards.\nA vast depression stretched across the land, its edges sloping steeply into a jagged \"V.\"\n\"A valley,\" Liam realized, his voice carrying a note of awe.\nHe finally came to a halt at its entrance. The silence of the space hit him again. It was sudden, absolute and was broken only by the fading echoes of his sprint.\nHis chest rose and fell, but not from exhaustion. He wasn’t tired in the slightest; it was just the adrenaline simmering through him.\nBefore him, the valley yawned wide. Its walls were steep, sheer cliffs of cracked ochre stone that plunged into shadow.\nJagged rock formations jutted out like the teeth of some long-dead beast, sharp and menacing.\nThe floor of the valley was hidden in gloom, the dim orange-gray light unable to pierce fully into its depths. What little he could see was uneven and broken — ridges, boulders, and what might have been dry channels, like rivers that had never known water.\nThe air here felt... heavier. Still sterile, still breathable, but with a faint edge.\nLiam stood there for a long moment, staring into the chasm, and he smiled.\n\"So there is more to this place,\" he whispered.\nThe wasteland had given him his first change of scenery. The plains weren’t endless after all.\nAnd if this valley existed... what else lay hidden in the Dimensional Space?\nHe felt a thrill stir in his chest. This wasn’t an empty sandbox. Rather, it was a world waiting to be explored.",

      "content": "Chapter 86: Testing Strength (Bonus Chapter)\nLiam stood at the edge of the valley, staring down into its yawning depth, different ideas ran through his mind.\nThe barren cliffs stretched like jagged scars, plunging into a gloom that the twilight sky above couldn’t fully reach.\nEven though this valley — like the rest of the Dimensional Space — was lifeless, Liam couldn’t help but see its potential.\nIt reminded him of an empty canvas, raw and unpainted. But one day, he would change that.\nThe task of turning this wasteland into something habitable fell squarely on him. And unlike anyone else in history, he had the tools to do it: the molecular assembler, capable of building matter atom by atom; his omni-science knowledge foundation; the staggering advantage of time dilation in this space (sixty hours here for every single hour on Earth); and Lucy, his AGI-in-training.\nAnd if he ever lacked raw materials? Daniel and the shell companies could bring him anything the assembler required.\nPiece by piece, Liam could engineer this pocket realm into a living world — almost like terraforming a planet. It wouldn’t be easy, and it wouldn’t be quick, but he knew it was possible.\nHe dragged his eyes from the horizon and looked down into the shadowy valley again. Curiosity prickled at him. He wanted to know what lay inside — not just for exploration’s sake, but for another reason.\nA test.\nHe had grown stronger, faster, tougher. His stats were climbing at a ridiculous rate. But numbers on a screen weren’t enough. He needed something real — something he could strike, break, measure.\nAnd the walls of the valley were perfect.\n\"Yeah,\" he muttered under his breath, a faint grin tugging at his lips. \"Let’s see what I can really do.\"\nBut testing his strength wasn’t the only reason. The valley also gave him the perfect chance to check for minerals.\nThe Dimensional Space was barren, yes. No water cycle. No vegetation. No microbes recycling matter. But barren didn’t mean empty. If this was truly an Earth-sized world, geology had to exist. Which meant the cliffs around him might be more than just stone.\nIron, copper, bauxite... quartz veins, crystalline deposits, maybe even diamonds buried deep below. Rare earths like neodymium and palladium. Maybe uranium or thorium, locked inside dense ore.\nAfter all, the Moon was barren too, but it was rich in titanium and helium-3. Mars was sterile desert, yet filled with iron oxides and silicates. Even Earth’s Sahara, which looked lifeless on the surface, hid oil, salt, uranium, and phosphate beneath its sands.\nSo why not here?\nThe thought stirred excitement, but also a dose of realism. He couldn’t just \"see\" minerals with the naked eye.\nOmni-science had given him the theory — crystal lattices, spectroscopy, classifications, extraction principles. But in practice, field geology needed tools. Spectrometers, X-ray diffraction, chemical assays. To his eyes, most rocks would look the same.\nYes, his vision was enhanced, and once he acquired eagle vision the precision of his sight would sharpen further. But even then, raw identification at a glance would be difficult.\nEspecially here, where the geology might not even follow Earth’s familiar weathering or oxidation patterns. Minerals could appear in strange crystalline clusters, alien colors, or raw lumps untouched by time.\nHe smiled to himself, as he knew that he now has another project for later.\n\"I’ll need a lab here soon,\" he muttered. \"No way around it.\"\nWith that thought, he decided he had lingered long enough. Curiosity outweighed hesitation. He stepped forward, his shoes crunching against loose stone as he began to descend into the valley.\nThe cliffs loomed higher as he moved down, the ochre walls streaked with darker veins that glinted faintly under the dim orange glow of the sky.\nThe silence deepened the further he went, until even the sound of his own footsteps seemed intrusive.\nLiam exhaled slowly, steadying himself, as he eased into the descent, letting the slope choose his pace.\nLoose chips skittered from beneath his shoes and rattled away, pattering down the grade until the valley gulped their sound and sent it back as a faint, delayed whisper.\nThe air here was thinner, drier—so dry it felt almost powder-clean in his lungs. No scent of soil, no tang of plants or moisture. Just sterile coolness and silence.\nThe walls rose on either side as he went down, their ochre faces banded with darker seams that caught the gray-orange sky and returned it in dull, metallic glints.\nUp close, the cliff wasn’t uniform. It was a mosaic of geologies: columnar plates shouldered against layered sheets, with veins—black, bronze, gunmetal—threading the gaps like frozen lightning.\nSome strata looked sedimentary, stacked in tidy laminations the way pages stack in a book. Others jutted like cooled basalt, squared off into rough columns with hairline seams between them.\nEvery so often, a seam flashed with a glassy sheen, as if obsidian had bled through and solidified mid-flow.\nBy the time he reached the floor, the valley swallowed him whole.\nIt was broader down here than it had looked from above, a bowl pinched into a long, jagged funnel.\nThe ground underfoot had no sand—no grit that shifted and gave way. Instead it was hardpan, compacted to a ceramic-like toughness that rang faintly when the heel of his shoe struck it, as if he were walking on fired clay.\nPale fractures spidered across its surface in geometric plates that reminded him of dried lakebeds—except there had never been a lake here.\nHe turned slowly, taking it in.\nThe valley floor wasn’t flat. It rolled in subtle swells and dips, as if something enormous had once pressed a hand into it and then let go. Boulders lay where gravity had abandoned them: angular, freshly cleaved faces exposed to the dim.\nIn the dips, finer dust had gathered into shallow fans, the powder so fine it clung to itself and formed delicate ridges that shattered like sugar when he stepped through them.\nHe stepped toward the nearest wall and he put his palm to the cliff.\nThe feeling was cool. Not cold or hot, but cool. The surface had a dry chill that stole the heat from his skin without giving anything back.\nHe let his hand fall and rolled his shoulders once, exhaling.\nEnough sightseeing.\nLiam stepped back two paces, drew a breath, and let the [Formless Combat Doctrine] do it work, as he reflexively took a boxing stance.\nHe threw the first punch making sure to hold back.\nHis fist met the wall and a deep, compact boom rolled away like thunder caught indoors.\nA faint spiderweb crack had bloomed where his knuckles had landed, a handspan wide and very shallow, delicate as frost on glass.\nDust rained down in slow, velvety waves, sifting into the still air and falling so lazily he could track individual motes.\nThe sound of the impact struck the opposite wall, and came back as softened booms, echo stacked on echo, until the valley sounded like a distant storm.\nHe flexed his fingers, felt nothing but warmth, and he smiled. He had expected to feel even some pain from the punch but he felt nothing.\n\"Not bad,\" he murmured.\nHe shifted again, ready to continue his test. He took a long, deep breath and exhaled slowly.\nHe looked at the spiderweb as if it were a target ring, found the center point, and decided not to hold back.Follow current novels on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nThe second punch arrived like a verdict.\nThe sound leapt past boom and into something that cracked the valley open: a cannon-report that hit the cliffs, ricocheted, and made the entire floor under him vibrate slightly.\nWhere his fist had landed, the spiderweb exploded outward. The shallow frost pattern deepened, thickened, and shot farther than the span of his outstretched arms.\nA central crater had been punched into the wall the size of a dinner plate with its edges scalloped. And the stone around it shed dust in sheets.\nA slab the size of a suitcase detached above the crater, hesitated, then sloughed off and split when it hit the floor with a heavy, ear-satisfying thud.\nLiam lowered his hand and stood still, chest rising and falling with the simple rhythm of his regular breathing.\nIt was calm and easy, as if he’d done nothing more strenuous than knock on a door. He looked from his injury-free dust- stained knuckles free, and then to the wound in the wall and back again, then exhaled through his nose, almost letting out a laugh.\n\"Okay,\" he said softly. \"That answers a few questions.\"\nThough it was only two punches but it was enough to tell Liam what he wanted to know. There was no doubt that he was strong.\nBeing able to punch a cliff at his full strength and create a small crater in it, and also not sustain injury was insane.\nA punch like that would’ve shattered reinforced concrete, maybe even tank armor.\n\"I’ve done achieved what I wanted. I should be heading back to Lucy now. She should be done with her training. It already been hours already. If not almost a day,\" he said to himself.\nWhile he still wanted to explore more of the space, he would have more enough time to do that in the future.\nLiam picked up a half of the split slab that fell and ran out of the valley, turned to the direction of his little base and ran towards it.",

Now, let’s see how good you really are. I will ask you different question and you must answer them correctly. I don’t mind you being creative with your answers as that allowed. But they must be correct. Are you ready?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Good. Now, tell me...\" Liam said, and started throwing very difficult technical, and professional questions at Lucy.\nShe didn’t disappoint as she answered all the questions flawlessly. Liam was impressed but he wasn’t surprised because he expected that much from her.\nHe even went ahead to ask her some non-standard questions and her answers made him nod his head, with a wide smile, looking very impressed.\nShe’s growing very fast. That’s perfect. Her training will be done before noon and I can the trait fusion immediately, and also building the quantum ecosystem.\nAfter more an hour of grilling Lucy with questions, it was time for her start the next stage of her training.\nThis stage — cultural/social training — will give her the ability to understand why people speak or act the way they do. It will also help her to understand things like humor, sarcasm, politeness, idioms, rituals, body language, emotional undertones... And she’ll begin to simulate emotions.\nThough she won’t \"feel\" them like humans, but by recognizing emotional cues in cultural and social data, she will be able to understand why someone saying \"I’m fine\" with a flat tone actually means the opposite.\nWith Lucy’s training underway, Liam decided to return it Earth for a couple of minutes before returning.\nHe has been in the space for more than a day but only a two minute has passed on Earth.\nLiam teleported out of the space to his room. He went to the bathroom to take his bath and wash off the bit of dust he gathered from running and punching the cliff.\nAfter he was done, he put on a clean set of clothes and collapsed on the bed and took his phone out of his phone.\nHe only needs to spend two or three minutes here before returning to the space, to test Lucy and start the next stage of her training. And this stage will be the last.\nAfter that, Liam can put her to work and see how good she is. What he will do first was the trait fusion.\nLucy will connect to the nanites’ swarm dormant AI and awaken it from its dormant state.\nAnd as for how Lucy will do that? Liam intends to build a program that will act as a bridge between Lucy and the swarm AI.\nRight now, the nanites’ swarm AI is inactive, waiting for an \"external command interpreter\" to wake it up.\nBut while its AI is dormant, the swarm constantly broadcasts faint carrier signals inside Liam’s body. These signals are low-level EM pulses. Something similar to neural frequency range or MHz–GHz spectrum. These are invisible to humans, but they’re always there like a \"heartbeat.\"\nLucy can pick up his heartbeat using the extremely powerful laptop that can simulate and synchronize with practically any EM band.\nThough Lucy can’t \"hear\" the nanites naturally, she can scan through frequency ranges — like tuning a super-advanced radio — until she locks onto the swarm’s control signal.\nAnd with the bridge, which is the program Liam intends to build, Lucy will be able to establish connection with the swarm AI and give it instructions.\nTalking about building a bridge programs, Liam suddenly thought of something. He plan to set up a lab in the space but to procure the equipments he needs to set up a lab would be very stressful.\nBut there’s no need to set up an elaborate Earth standard laboratory, because there should be something in the system store that should do the work for him.\nHe has the molecular assembler that can not only create anything by arranging atoms, but can also disintegrate anything atom by atom.\nWhat Liam was trying to drive at was that there’s something called a molecular analyser in the system store. He had seen it when he wanted to purchase the molecular assembler.\nAnd with my current account balance of $178m, I can easily purchase the two versions of it.\nLiam immediately opened the system store and searched for the molecular analyser. While he did that, he entered the Dimensional Space.\n[Molecular Analyzer]\nCost: 500 SP\nDescription: A compact, palm-sized scanning device designed for instant field analysis. Uses spectral imaging, quantum resonance mapping, and atomic frequency sampling to identify molecular composition within seconds.\n[Molecular Analyzer]\nCost: 1,500 SP\nDescription: A desktop-sized high-precision analyzer designed for deep molecular dissection. Equipped with spectroscopic arrays, particle lattice mapping, and isotope separation.\n***\n\"A total of $20m for the two? No problem,\" Liam smiled, as he took his seat.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nHe quickly exchanged the amount purchased the two molecular analysers.\nImmediately, two ripples formed in the space before him. One coalesced above his palm, the other shimmered slightly into being beside the long obsidian table.\nThe first solidified with a muted click against his skin and Liam smiled when he saw the device in his hand.\nIn his hand sat the compact Molecular Analyzer. It was a palm-sized, sleek, and as elegant as any high-end smartphone. Its body was a seamless slab of matte obsidian-black alloy, edges trimmed with platinum micro-lines.\nThe front surface was a smooth, flexible glass-like panel. At the lower edge, just where a thumb might naturally rest, was a slim sliding compartment and it was no larger than a SIM tray. That was where physical samples could be inserted: a shard of rock, a droplet of liquid, a hair, a sliver of tissue.\nThe screen was currently dark as the device was currently turned off.\n\"Looks and feel just like a phone...\" Liam murmured, turning it over in his hand.\nHis eyes shifted to the second ripple as it finally condensed into reality, as the larger Molecular Analyzer thudded softly beside the long obsidian table.\nIf the handheld version was a phone, this one was a workstation. Though nothing like the bulky machines of Earth’s labs.\nIts chassis was crafted from a platinum-white alloy with smooth and flowing curves, almost organic in its design. Thin seams of sapphire-blue light ran along its surface.\nThe central section was dominated by a crystal-clear chamber about the size of a shoebox, encased in reinforced transparent composite.\nLiam brushed his hand near it and with a touchless activation, the chamber opened forward with a hiss.\nInside, micro-scaled manipulators hung like crystalline needles, suspended above a retractable sample platform.\nOn either side of the main chamber, retractable panels housed input trays, one for solid samples and another with slim vials for liquids and gases. A strip of glass ran along the front, doubling as a control panel and status readout.\nLiam smiled in satisfaction at the two molecular analysers.\nHe tapped the handheld against his palm, then glanced at the desktop analyzer. Together, they were perfect.\nAfter admiring the gadgets enough, Liam turned his attention to Lucy who had been waiting for him.",

      "content": "Chapter 88: Planet-scale Treasure Vault\nFive days had passed in the Dimensional Space and Lucy had completed all the stages of her training. Liam had also put her through her paces and he was satisfied with the results.\nLucy’s intelligence now put her at least a decade ahead of Earth’s current AI models — and she was still only in what could be called her child phase.\nWhile Lucy was already extremely intelligent as an AGI, she was still like a child with much to learn. But with every task she undertook for Liam, she would grow —and at a pace no human could ever match.\nCurrently, Liam and Lucy were working on the bridge program that will use to connect not only to the nanites’ swarm AI, but also the molecular assembler’s and the desktop-sized molecular analyser’s.\nThe bridge program would function like a vast expressway, with unlimited lanes that allowed as many AIs as necessary to connect, receive instructions, and pass information seamlessly back to Lucy.\nThat way, Lucy, a general AI, will be able to communicate and control those specialised AIs.\nLiam had written the basic codes of the program, and Lucy was currently expanding the code while following the main framework that they both had worked out before they started.\nWhile Lucy was working on the program, Liam decided to start analysing with the handheld molecular analyser. He wants to analyse the soil of the plain and a small chip of the slab he brought back\nHe turned on the device and its screen lit up as a soft blue glow spread across the glassy surface, forming clean panels and faint outlines.\nAt the center, a bold header read \"No Data.\"\nThe rest of the screen was divided into empty sections and subtle frames waiting to be filled.\n\"Lucy, connect to this device, would you?\" Liam asked, as he bent down and took a pinch of the ochure ground.\n\"Connected,\" Lucy replied.\nThe reason Liam told Lucy to connect to the molecular analyzer was because, while the device could break anything down to its atomic structure, it lacked the database to identify what those atoms actually were.\nWith Lucy connected, however, she could instantly reference her vast knowledge and classify each element or compound with ease.\nLiam nodded, as he opened the slid out the slim compartment and gently let the dust fall into it.\nHe slid the compartment back in and the device’s screen that had once been blank with\nNo Data\nglowing at the center, new text now appeared.At the center:\nSample Detected. Analysing...\nIn the empty sections:\nAnalysing...\nLiam curiously watched and waited for the result, which didn’t take long as it was displayed right the next moment.\nAt the centre:\nAnalysis Completed.\nSample: Dust.\nThe sections: Silicon Dioxide (SiO₂): 47.3%\nAluminum Oxide (Al₂O₃): 19.6%\nIron Oxide (Fe₂O₃): 12.1%\nNeodymium Oxide (Nd₂O₃): 7.4%\nCerium Oxide (CeO₂): 5.9%\nEuropium Oxide (Eu₂O₃): 3.2%\nLutetium Oxide (Lu₂O₃): 2.1%\nTrace Elements: < 2% (Yttrium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Dysprosium)\n***\nWhat the...?,\nLiam reacted in shock when he saw the result.\n\"Sir, these concentrations are 10,000 times richer than Bayan Obo in Inner Mongolia, currently Earth’s largest rare earth mine,\" Lucy said.\nLiam nodded slowly in agreement to what she said. He was still trying to process everything.\nAll he did was just analyze a pinch of dust, and it wasn’t just sand or dead sediment. Instead, he had just discovered that it contains high concentrations of rare earth oxides like neodymium, europium, lutetium, etc.\nOn Earth, these materials are mined in extremely small quantities, often in politically sensitive regions like China’s knowm for their dominance in rare earth mining.\nWhat does this mean for Liam? This means the entire wasteland is potentially layered with strategic elements far more concentrated than Earth’s richest mines.\nOn Earth, rare earth scarcity is one of the biggest bottlenecks for advanced technology like magnets, lasers, semiconductors, nuclear materials, quantum devices.\nBut Liam now has a private world where these elements are abundant, free of geopolitical risks, labor issues, or scarcity.\nAnd his assembler can refine the raw dust into 100% purity metals, which is impossible with current Earth refining tech.\nWhich also means that effectively, he has monopoly control over critical resources that can shift global industries.\nThis level of abundance is world-shaking if it’s ever revealed. Governments wage wars over grams of europium or lutetium. But Liam has tons just sitting in the dirt.\nIf anyone found out, they wouldn’t just investigate him. They will hunt him.\nBut Liam doesn’t need to worry about anyone finding out as this is private space and no one can access it beside him.\n\"The system really knows how to outdo itself every single time,\" Liam said, as he let out a small laugh.\nAfter discovering that this barren Earth sized pocket realm is potentially a treasure trove, he no longer felt bad about its barren state.\nCurious to know more, Liam decided to analyse the slab. He pinched the edge and adding a bit of strength, he broke off a tiny piece from it.\nHe slid out the compartment that was now empty, as the dust sample had been atomised during the process of analysing it.\nLiam placed the slab sample into the compartment and slid it back in. And the device immediately started analysing it.\nTwo seconds later, the result was out.\nSilicon Dioxide (SiO₂): 34%\nAluminum Oxide (Al₂O₃): 22%\nIron Oxide (Fe₂O₃): 18%\nTitanium Dioxide (TiO₂): 8%\nRare Earth Elements (Nd, Eu, Tb, Dy, Yb, Lu): 12%\nTrace Elements (U, Th, Pt, Ir): 6%\n***\n\"Wow! This is huge. The valley walls contains even resources,\" Liam said slowly in a low voice.\nThis result has confirms that the Dimensional Space is more than \"sandbox terrain.\" It’s a planet-scale treasure vault.\nThe dust on the plains was like \"surface scatter\" and but it was already valuable. But the cliff wall is the true ore body: solid rock laced with dense seams of rare earths and strategic metals.\nOn Earth, mining companies dig miles of tunnels to extract fractions of a percent of these metals. But here? The valley walls are basically pure concentrated ore.\nIf he starts mining them, he would no longer have to rely solely on Daniel sourcing raw materials through the shell companies. A process that is not only slow, but also risky as it’s traceable.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn\n\"Thank you, system. You’re the best,\" Liam muttered in a soft voice.\n[It’s my pleasure to serve, Host]\nLiam smiled and turned to Lucy.\n\"Lucy, what’s your progress with the program?\" He asked.\n\"A few more minutes, please. I’m almost done with it.\"\n\"No rush. Take your time. Just let me know when you’re done,\" Liam said, and left the space and returned almost immediately.\n\"The program is ready,\" Lucy said when he appeared.\n\"Good. Let’s get started,\" Liam said, as he took his seat.\nNow, let’s connect to the nanites’ swarm AI.",

      "content": "Chapter 89: Traits Infusion\nLucy, have you locked onto the swarm’s control signal?\" Liam asked, his voice steady though his heart beat quickened in anticipation.\n\"Yes,\" she replied after a moment’s pause. \"Just now.\"\n\"Good. Let’s get started. Wake it up.\" Liam said, with his eyes gleaming with even more anticipation.\n\"A second, please. I am currently decoding the signal’s rhythm and structure,\" Lucy said.\nLiam gave a sharp nod, his jaw tightening. He knew what she was doing. She was translating the strange low-frequency pulses the nanites always broadcast into something she could understand. The frequency can be called the nanites’ language.\nSeconds ticked by in silence. The endless barren expanse of the Dimensional Space around him only made the moment heavier. Then Lucy’s voice cut through.\n\"I have completed the decoding. Wake-up instructions have been sent.\"\nThe effect was immediate.\nLiam’s breath caught as a cold shiver ran across his entire body. It felt as though countless unseen eyes had snapped open inside him all at once, every single one turning toward him with eerie synchronization.\nHis lips parted in shock.\n\"Holy—\" He let out a nervous laugh, rubbing the back of his neck. \"That was... scary as hell.\"\nThe sensation wasn’t painful, but it was primal, unnerving. It was the awareness of being observed at the most intimate level — not by people, but by something that lived inside his very cells.\n\"The swarm AI is awake and awaiting instructions, sir.\" Lucy’s voice came again.\nLiam steadied his breathing and forced the thrill in his chest into calm focus. \"Perfect. Let’s get started.\"\nHe reached up and tugged a few strands of hair from his scalp, placing them into three separate sample boxes arranged neatly on the long, obsidian table. The follicles glistened faintly, roots intact.\n\"Give the instruction, Lucy,\" Liam said simply. He had already told her his plan earlier. There was no need to repeat it.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nThe nanites were hardwired to Liam’s biological signature, but placing these living samples outside his body gave the swarm something to anchor to externally.\nAs the swarm AI extended itself through the follicles, Liam felt another faint ripple inside his body, like an invisible tether had been pulled taut.\nThe process began.\nThe nanites swarmed over the samples, breaking them down at the molecular level with surgical precision. Every strand of DNA was unraveled and scanned.\nUsing Lucy’s massive genomic database as a reference, they began isolating trait genes: the eagle’s super-dense retinal photoreceptors, the starfish’s limb regeneration pathways, the axolotl’s scarless healing protocols.\nIt was breathtaking in its simplicity — like uploading files from ancient libraries, then rewriting them into new blueprints.\n\"Sir,\" Lucy said minutes later. \"The digital trait blueprints are complete. Shall I begin the infusion?\"\nLiam’s chest rose and fell with a forced calm. He was really trying hard to hold himself back. This was the step he’d been waiting for.\n\"Yes,\" he said firmly.\nAt once, a wave of alien sensation swept through him. His eyes prickled, his skin itched, and deep within his muscles he felt a faint, crawling, almost electrical vibration.\nIt wasn’t painful. Not exactly. It was more like every cell in his body was stretching, yawning awake after centuries of sleep.\nLiam gritted his teeth, then forced his body to relax. He leaned back in the chair, shutting his eyes. The more he resisted, the worse the itching became. Better to let it wash over him, to accept it as part of the process.\nThe swarm worked in silence.\nThe eagle’s vision infusion would finish first — just hours, as Lucy had explained to him after he told her his plan. The nanites will modify the structure of his photoreceptors, sharpening neural pathways, upgrading how his visual cortex processed light and motion.\nThe starfish’s regeneration would take longer. Days, maybe more. Because every stem cell in his body needed to be rewritten with the capacity to trigger whole-tissue regrowth. That meant muscles, skin, even bone marrow would have to carry the upgrade.\nThe axolotl’s trait would be the longest. Scarless healing wasn’t a simple trick. It rewrote how his body handled damage at every level — immune response, blood vessel repair, collagen deposition, nerve regrowth. It was a symphony of genetic editing.\n\"Lucy,\" Liam said softly, opening one eye, \"monitor everything closely. If there’s even a hint of mutation, rollback immediately.\"\n\"Already done, sir,\" she said. \"A full backup of your genome has been stored. There is no danger.\"\nLiam smiled faintly. \"Good. Without you, this would’ve been suicide.\"\nAnd it was true. Without Lucy, the swarm would’ve been blind, operating with brute efficiency but no context. They could’ve shoved alien genes into his DNA without considering compatibility, possibly triggering cancerous mutations or catastrophic errors. But with Lucy as interpreter, the swarm worked with elegance and precision.\nThe itching dulled after a while, fading into a strange warmth, with a very faint vibration that seemed to radiate from his chest. Liam rolled his shoulders once, then sat up.\n\"Alright,\" he muttered, shaking his head clear. \"Let’s multitask. Lucy, connect to the assembler and the analyzer.\"\n\"Already connected, sir,\" Lucy replied instantly.\n\"Good girl.\" He pushed himself to his feet and grabbed the jagged slab he had brought back from the valley.\nHe walked toward the molecular assembler, the sleek container-like machine still hovering slightly above the barren ground.\nHe slid open one of its raw material compartments and placed the slab inside. On impulse, he also scooped up a handful of dust from the plain and poured it in.\n\"Lucy,\" Liam said, brushing his hands together. \"Have the assembler disintegrate this slab. Extract these elements.\"\nHe paused and gave her the list of elements he needs. Which are also the elements for creating the gear glass.\n\"Transmutate elements if you must, but I want every usable atom extracted.\"\n\"Understood,\" Lucy replied.\nThe assembler came to life. Its fabrication arms unfolded like metallic serpents, their platinum joints gleaming under the sterile light.\nInside the core chamber, beams of blue light lanced downward, atomizing the slab into a shimmering mist of particles.\nLiam stepped back instinctively, giving the machine room to work.\n\"Transmutation engaged,\" Lucy announced.\nLiam’s eyebrows rose. He knew what that meant: the assembler wasn’t just separating atoms, it was rearranging them — shifting protons and neutrons, turning one element into another like an alchemist with the precision of quantum engineering.\nNormally, such a process would demand astronomical amounts of energy. On Earth, it was barely possible, reserved for nuclear labs. But the assembler ran on zero-point power — infinite energy harvested from the vacuum of space. Energy was no obstacle here.\nThe only true limit was mass. One kilogram of slab input meant one kilogram of elemental \"clay\" to sculpt into new matter. No more, no less.\n\"So that’s the trick, huh? Mass in, mass out,\" Liam smiled.\nBut even so, the thought sent a thrill through him. He was watching the laws of chemistry bow to his command.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nThe assembler worked for several minutes, its arms weaving graceful arcs as beams pulsed, stripped, and rebuilt matter atom by atom. The chamber glowed with shifting colors — emerald green, electric blue, molten gold — as elements were distilled from chaos.\nMeanwhile, Liam crouched down near the edge of the wasteland. He clenched his fists, then drove one into the ground with his full strength.\nThe result was thunderous.\nThe ochre ground split apart with a violent crack, fissures spidering outward in jagged webs. Chunks of solid earth leapt into the air from the shockwave, scattering in a loose rain of fragments.\nLiam grinned and gathered the shards, carrying them back to the obsidian table. He repeated the process again, this time sprinting back to the valley and tearing more chunks from its broken wall.\nWhen he returned, Lucy’s voice was waiting for him.\n\"Sir, extraction and transmutation are complete.\"\nLiam froze, excitement surging through him. \"Perfect. Show me the results.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 90: The Gear Glass\n\"Perfect. Show me the results,\" Liam said, his voice steady even though a knot of anticipation twisted in his chest.\nThe assembler obeyed. A soft hum rippled through the barren Dimensional Space, and from its control console, a holographic display bloomed into the air, and lines of text cascaded down.\nLiam leaned forward instinctively, his eyes scanning the figures as they compiled into an output list.\nOutput:\nSilicon (Si): 142.6 kg\nAluminum (Al): 91.3 kg\nIron (Fe): 73.4 kg\nTitanium (Ti): 31.8 kg\nNeodymium (Nd): 22.5 kg\nEuropium (Eu): 9.6 kg\nLutetium (Lu): 6.8 kg\nTrace Rare Earths (Y, Tb, Dy, Gd): ~8.2 kg combined\nPlatinum Group Elements (Pt, Ir): 3.9 kg\nUranium/Thorium (U/Th): 1.1 kgThɪs No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n...\n...\nTotal Elements Outputs: 33\nTotal Mass Output: 411.2 kg\n***\n\"....\"\nThe numbers swam in front of his eyes. Liam’s throat tightened.\n\"Four hundred... eleven kilograms?\" he muttered, blinking as though the text might vanish if he looked again. \"From just the slab and a handful of dust???\"\nHis voice cracked on the last word.\nHe knew the assembler was insane — he had read about it, absorbed the knowledge from the omni-science package. But knowing it in theory was one thing. Seeing it, watching reality itself disassembled and rebuilt atom by atom... that was something else entirely.\nThe slab had barely weighed more than 50 kilos. The dust he’d scooped up earlier? Nothing, just grams. Yet here the console was, telling him he had over 400 kilograms of perfectly refined, transmuted elements. Not ore. Not compounds. Pure elements.\nLiam dragged a hand through his hair, pacing around the machine in disbelief.\n\"Sir, are you surprised by the result?\" Lucy’s voice came gently from the laptop perched on the desk.\n\"Surprised? Lucy, I’m stunned,\" Liam shot back, shaking his head. \"I expected something useful, maybe a dozen kilos of iron, aluminum... some trace rare earths. But this? This is borderline impossible. Just how insane is this tech?\"\n\"I completely understand your reaction, sir,\" Lucy replied calmly. Her voice carried a curious mixture of pride and professionalism, like a teacher unveiling the answer to a riddle.\n\"The molecular assembler is, by all measures, a terrifying machine. On Earth, refining even a few grams of rare earths or semiconductor-grade materials requires massive industrial plants, colossal energy expenditure, and generates mountains of toxic waste. Yields are low, precision is limited, and even the best efficiency rarely crosses one percent. Humans dig tons of rock for grams of usable material.\"\nThe holographic display flickered as Lucy continued, as if syncing her words with the data.\n\"But this device doesn’t refine the way humans refine. It doesn’t smelt, crush, or leach. It disassembles at the atomic level with perfect precision and zero waste. Every proton, neutron, and electron accounted for. Every atom re-used. And more — transmutation is on the table. If a sample contains 18% iron but you need cobalt or gallium instead, the assembler simply rearranges the protons and neutrons until the right element exists.\"\nHer tone softened. \"And the reason it can do this? The cheat factor, as you like to call it: zero-point energy. The assembler has access to an infinite well of power drawn from vacuum fluctuations. So unlike Earth, where energy cost is the bottleneck, here there is no bottleneck.\"\nLiam stopped pacing and rubbed his temples.\nHe knew all of this already. The knowledge foundation had explained it to him. He understood it logically. But logic and reality were two different beasts.\nThis machine wasn’t a supercomputer or a next-gen prototype. It was alchemy made real.\nAnd the result wasn’t just impressive. It was terrifying.\nThe total output — 411.2 kilograms — was enough to make hundreds, maybe thousands of units of his planned Gear Glass devices. All from a single rock and a pinch of dirt.\nIt made Daniel’s careful procurement channels, the shell companies, and the risk-laden raw material sourcing... look like child’s play. Why bother smuggling rare earths from Earth when his private dimension’s dust was already richer than the planet’s most jealously guarded mines?\nLiam exhaled slowly. \"No wonder the assembler costs so much. But now... now I see it. Compared to what it can do, it’s dirt cheap. Hell, if governments even knew this thing existed...\"\nHe trailed off, his mind painting the image: armies, spies, corporations, even nations bleeding themselves dry for a shot at this technology. Billions? Trillions? They would pay, fight, and kill without hesitation.\nA single assembler could make oil obsolete, gold worthless, nuclear arsenals irrelevant. It could unravel economies, topple empires.\nAnd he had one. Sitting in his private, unreachable dimension.\nLiam clenched his fists, steadying his breath. He couldn’t afford to keep losing composure every time the system dropped a miracle into his lap. He needs to adapt.\n\"Alright,\" he said at last, his voice firmer. \"Now that I have enough, I can start creating the Gear Glass. But let’s be smart about it. I’ll make one unit first. A prototype.\"\nHe walked back to the obsidian table and dropped into the chair. His pulse was still racing, but his mind was already shifting gears.\n\"Lucy,\" he said, leaning forward, \"we have work to do. Big work.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Lucy replied, her voice steady and ready. \"What are we working on?\"\n\"It’s a device. A device that will change the world,\" Liam said quietly, almost reverently.\nAnd then he began to explain.\n***\nThe blueprint of the Gear Glass unfolded in words first, then in sketches, then as a full holographic design rendered by Lucy on the assembler’s console.\nThe idea was simple, deceptively simple: a device that looked no different from ordinary sunglasses. Lightweight. Stylish. Inconspicuous. But beneath that mundane exterior, it would pack the punch of the most advanced computer in human history.\nIt would be VR and AR combined, but seamless. Direct retinal projection fused with neural visual overlay. The user wouldn’t just see augmented reality; they would live it, as if their brain itself had become the display.\nNavigation? Eye-tracking and micro-expressions, mapped flawlessly. The lenses would read the slightest flick of the pupil or twitch of a brow. Intent would flow directly into the system via neural interface — thought-based interaction. No hands, no scrolling. Just willpower.\nMotion capture? Not just arms or head gestures like Earth’s primitive VR. Full-body mapping, down to the individual fingers, tracked and mirrored perfectly.\nConnectivity? Not Wi-Fi. Not 5G. Not even fiber. The Gear Glass would be the first device to hook into the quantum ecosystem Liam planned to build. A private, unbreakable network faster than anything Earth’s infrastructure could even dream of.\nAnd all this... in a frame no heavier than ordinary sunglasses.\nBut Liam wasn’t blinded by ambition. He knew power without restraint was a curse.\n\"Precautions,\" he said firmly, cutting into the blueprint draft. \"This thing is dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands. We need safeguards, both for me and for future users.\"\nLucy’s hologram pulsed as she listened, recording every word.\n\"For starters: layered authentication. Multi-factor security keyed to neural pathways authentication and retina scan. If stolen, it’s nothing more than a pair of lenses,\" he said, and continue listing more precautions.\nHours blurred into days inside the Dimensional Space. Liam and Lucy worked tirelessly, sketching, coding, refining.\nLiam dictated specifications while Lucy simulated outcomes, adjusting the design in real time. Every choice was tested — lens curvature, micro-projector angle, neural electrode placement, even the alloy of the frame.\nBy the end of the fifth day inside the Dimensional Space — barely five minutes Earth’s time — the blueprint was finalized.\nThe hologram above the assembler shimmered one last time, resolving into a sleek, jet-black frame with lenses that seemed to drink in light, platinum pinstripes glinting faintly along the arms.\nThe Gear Glass.",

      "content": "Chapter 91: The Gear Glass (2)\n\"Okay, Lucy. Let’s bring it to life,\" Liam said, standing a small distance from the assembler’s control console.\n\"Yes, sir. The assembler has started building the device,\" Lucy replied, her voice as calm and steady as ever.\nLiam nodded, folding his arms as he quietly stood there, watching and waiting. His heart thudded faintly in his chest. Anticipation was written across his face. This was it. The first real manifestation of all his work, all his preparation.\nBut he knew better than to stand idle, just staring. That would only make the waiting worse.\nHe moved back to the desk, sat in his chair, and pulled the sleek laptop closer. With a swift flick of his fingers across the keys, he opened a new workspace.\nHis goal: the foundation of everything the Gear Glass would run on. The Quantum Operating System.\nHe bent his head, hands flying across the keyboard, the sound of rapid keystrokes filling the barren wasteland.\n***\nInside the Assembler’s Core\nMeanwhile, the molecular assembler stirred to life.\nThe central fabrication chamber glowed with sterile white light. Mechanical arms unfolded with the smooth elegance of metallic serpents, each one tipped with instruments finer than a human hair — plasma nozzles, atom-level applicators, scanning nodes, and projection lasers.\nA beam of pale blue light lanced downward into the chamber, striking the empty fabrication platform at its center.\nThe process began.\nFirst came the substrate layer — a perfectly smooth foundation, a wafer-thin sheet of carbon-alloy lattice. Atoms arranged themselves one by one in a flawless hexagonal grid, stronger than diamond yet feather-light.\nThe base frame for the Gear Glass arms began to grow from that lattice, rising slowly like delicate black vines curving into shape.\nThen the optical structures. Transparent silicate sheets shimmered into being, condensed from vapor into lens-thin layers.\nThe assembler etched nanostructures across their surfaces, layering quantum-dot coatings that would refract, filter, and project light directly into the human retina.\nThe frame materialized next. Platinum-infused carbon composite, woven molecule by molecule for resilience and elegance. The assembler sculpted it into the sleek contours\nLiam and Lucy had designed — jet-black with platinum micro-flakes shimmering like starlight, and that single hand-painted platinum pinstripe running from hinge to temple tip.\nFibers of conductive alloy — thinner than spider silk — were laid seamlessly into the arms. They formed the nervous system of the device: circuits invisible to the eye, yet capable of carrying quantum-level signals with zero resistance.\nThe fabrication arms danced faster, a blur of platinum and blue light.\nThe micro-projectors formed in the lens cavities, tiny crystalline modules nestled into each corner. Each projector was no larger than a grain of rice, yet together they carried the power to render entire worlds before the wearer’s eyes.\nNext came the neural interface nodes. Gold-plated nano-electrodes were etched along the inner frame, invisible to casual sight. These would read the faintest electrical impulses from the brain — eye flicks, micro-expressions, thought patterns — and translate them into commands.\nThen the quantum chip. A product that should had been a standalone but is part of the Gear Glass.\nThe assembler built it in layers, stacking atomic lattices like cards until a glowing core emerged, pulsing faintly with a soft, white-blue light. This was the heart of the device, the gateway to Liam’s future ecosystem.\nMinutes stretched into nearly an hour as the process continued, each stage layering more complexity into the sleek silhouette.\nFinally, the assembler polished the entire device with a coat of obsidian-black nano-film, the surface smooth enough to reflect Liam’s face if he were standing close.\nWith a soft hiss, the finished product slid gently into the finished compartment, cushioned by a tray lined with pale-blue light.\nThe Gear Glass was complete.\n***\nLiam didn’t notice at first. His fingers were a blur across the laptop keys. Code streamed down the screen, structured, elegant, precise.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nThe Quantum Operating System wasn’t bulky or bloated. It wasn’t Earth’s style of millions of lines of legacy code stitched together. No, this was sleek, minimalist and elegant.\nDespite the name, it was astonishingly simple. Lightweight enough to boot instantly, yet powerful enough to handle trillions of operations across neural and quantum networks simultaneously.\nIt was the spine of his ecosystem — designed not to trap the user in complexity, but to disappear into the background, so natural that the interface itself would feel like an extension of thought.\nHours blurred inside the Dimensional Space. Liam worked tirelessly, though his body never tired, not with his enhanced stats. The warm, golden glow of the laptop screen painted his face as he wrote and refined lines of codes.\nBut Liam didn’t need to build everything himself. He only had to carve the skeleton — the guiding framework. Lucy would handle the rest.\nAt last, he leaned back, stretching his arms. \"Lucy,\" he said softly, \"I’ve done my part. Take it from here.\"\n\"Understood,\" she replied instantly. \"Optimizing, compiling, and expanding the code now.\"\nLiam exhaled slowly, his chest rising and falling in calm satisfaction. He pushed back from the table, stood, and walked toward the assembler’s finished compartment.\nHe pulled the compartment and with a hiss of released pressure, it slid open. And there it was.\nA pair of sunglasses.\nLiam reached forward, his fingers trembling slightly as he lifted it from the tray.\nThe weight was perfect. It was balanced, as it was neither heavy nor suspiciously light. Solid enough to feel real, delicate enough to vanish when worn.\nHe ran his thumb along the temple arm, feeling the smooth texture. Cold at first, then warming against his skin.\n\"Just as I wanted it,\" he whispered.\nHe walked back to the chair, sank into it, and cradled the Gear Glass gently in his hands.\n\"Lucy,\" he said. \"Are you done with the OS?\"\n\"Yes, sir. The Quantum Operating System is fully compiled and ready.\"\n\"Transfer it to the Gear Glass.\"\n\"As you command.\"\nLiam put on the Gear Glass and immediately, it came alive as the booting process was projected directly into his retina and his brain.\nThe animation that was chosen for the booting process was a very short simulation starting from the middle of the universe, then zooming out rapidly, before everything descends into darkness.\n\"This really looks beautiful,\" Liam muttered in awe at the animation.\nAfter the device booted up, it was time to set up a user profile but before that, security comes first.\nThe device asked for permission to perform retina and neural scan for 2-factor authentication. With the two scans, no one will be able to access the device except the original owner.\nIf they lose it and someone else picks it up, it will be nothing but a sunglass to them. Also, the account is synchronised to be one per user, just like īClouds and Gōōgle accounts.\nBut the only difference with this is that it can be easily recovered with a retina and neural scan. You won’t be hounded when trying to recover your account.\nLiam gave his permission and a couple of seconds later, the scans were done.\nA welcome message was displayed and the next moment, Liam found himself in a white space, the user lobby, and was asked to create his character profile.",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Gear Glass Games\nThe moment the scans completed, Liam felt a subtle click in his mind. His vision darkened for half a heartbeat, then flared back into clarity.\nHe was no longer looking at the wasteland. Instead, he stood in an endless white expanse.\nIt wasn’t blinding. The light wasn’t harsh or artificial. It was soft, diffuse, and strangely comfortable, as if it were coming from everywhere and nowhere at once. The air was weightless, soundless. There was no echo, breeze. The whole place was filled with just stillness.\nAnd in front of him floated a single figure. Or rather, the outline of one.\nA blank avatar.\nIt stood motionless, its body featureless and smooth, like a mannequin carved from light. No face or clothes.\n\"Welcome,\" Liam murmured to himself, with a small smile.\nThis was the Gear Glass lobby. His lobby.\nHe knew what this was meant to be: the personal \"home screen\" of the device. For ordinary users, it would be where their digital lives began each time the Glass powered on.\nRight now, though, it was empty. A blank stage. Nothing but the figure before him, waiting for its first spark of identity.\n\"Now,\" Liam said softly, focusing on the figure. \"Let’s create a character avatar.\"\nThe moment his thought touched the avatar, it stirred. Its surface rippled like disturbed water, features emerging as though sculpted by invisible hands. A jawline, cheekbones, the bridge of a nose. Strands of hair unfurled across its scalp, flowing down in dark waves. And eyes formed. Deep ocean-blue color. Eyes that were unmistakably his.\nWithin seconds, Liam was staring at himself.\nHe blinked, a laugh slipping past his lips despite the eerie sensation crawling up his spine.\nThe avatar not only looked like him — it was him. From the faint crease between his brows to every other part, the likeness was flawless.\nAnd it wasn’t just the face. He glanced down and saw the avatar was dressed exactly as he was now: a simple black shirt, fitted trousers and sneaker. Even the folds of the fabric and the glint of the buttons were identical.\n\"Okay... that’s insane,\" Liam muttered. \"Insane and... honestly kind of creepy.\"\nThe avatar smiled at the same time he did, and that made him pause. It was unsettling, like watching a mirror that knew too much.\nBefore he could dwell on it, a window shimmered into existence beside the avatar. It was a neat, translucent panel, hovering at chest height.\nUser Profile:\nName: Liam Scott\nAge: 18\nSex: Male\nHeight: 6’0\"\nIt was all basic data. Simple and clean. But to Liam, the implications were enormous.\nThis wasn’t just an avatar. This was identity. The Glass was binding his profile, anchoring it to him at a fundamental level. Every session, every interaction, every creation he would ever build here will all tied back to this foundation.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nHe gave a satisfied nod. \"That’ll do.\"\nThe window faded away with a soft pulse of light.\n\"Lucy,\" he said aloud, his voice steady in the quiet void. \"Connect to the Gear Glass. From now on, you’ll be my personal AI assistant for this device.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Lucy’s voice replied — not from the laptop this time, but from within his own mind.\nThe sound wasn’t in his ears. It was inside, a thought threaded seamlessly through his consciousness.\nLiam’s lips parted slightly in awe. \"Direct mind-link,\" he whispered. \"Perfect.\"\nHis plan was simple, but revolutionary. Every user of the Gear Glass would have a personal AI assistant bound to their account. It wouldn’t be invasive, as there will be no spying or any no hidden agendas. Its default function would be safety.\nThe AI would monitor a user’s vitals during use: pulse, breathing, neurological stress. If someone fainted while gaming, the AI would alert them.\nIf their heartbeat spiked abnormally, it would advise them to stop. And if things ever tipped into real danger — a seizure, a heart attack, a panic spiral — the AI would call emergency services and shut down the device.\nThis was a built-in safeguard that no tech company on Earth had ever dared to prioritize.\nAnd more importantly, the AI would enforce Liam’s greatest restriction: a daily usage limit of twelve hours.\nLiam’s expression hardened as he thought about it.\nHe had seen enough movies, read enough books to know where unchecked VR could lead. Worlds so immersive people forgot reality. Lives abandoned in favor of digital fantasy. Whole generations lost in artificial heavens.\nNot under his watch.\n\"I won’t let humanity turn this into an escape,\" Liam muttered, narrowing his eyes. \"This tech will enhance the world, not replace it. And if people hate me for it... so be it.\"\nHe doesn’t mind if people riot and stop using the device before he knew that it was impossible. Once they’ve tasted it, they’ll never quit. They’ll adapt to the rules.\n\"Then let’s move forward.\" he said, as he turned back to the avatar.\n\"Lucy,\" he said, his tone crisp. \"You have full permission to access the information about the games in my mind.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nSince the Gear Glass will be introduced as a gaming device before its future evolution into something more, he needs to create games for it. And he already has has multiple game ideas for it.\nAt once, he felt a faint pressure at the back of his mind. It was gentle, like a fingertip brushing against glass. Lucy wasn’t prying, only receiving what he chose to send.\nHe pictured the first sketches of his game ideas, the fragments of worlds and mechanics he had been dreaming of since the moment the Gear Glass concept formed.\nLucy absorbed it all in silence, like water filling a vessel.\nThe first game is the device’s flagship game, Terra. It’s concept is full 1:1 Earth and Universe simulation. It will be like VR version of Earth but with sweet god mode and creator mod where users can create whatever they want but won’t affect the base game.\nThey can give themselves the ability to fly and do whatever they want with the ability but in the base game, nothing changes.\nIn the game, users can do whatever they want, as long as it’s within the game’s rules.\nThere’s the second game which is a creative sandbox game with infinite freedom and users can design, and build whatever they want.\nThen there’s the RPG and fantasy game. This one will be a killer due to the advantage of the extreme realism of the device. Wielding magic and swords, deep combat and going on adventures. That’s the core of the game.\nIt will naturally have quest-driven narrative, and co-op or solo mode. It will be the first fantasy MMORPG.\nThe fourth game will be a PvP shooter game. Not much explanation is needed for this as one can already imagine feeling the violent vibration as a grenade explodes nearby, and the insane neural-haptic feedback as a gun. And let’s not forget those possible insane maps.\nThere will also be football and basketball game. Though the two will slightly complicated for some reasons but Lucy will work around it.\nThen there’s the kids and other causal games.\nThe one selling points of this games is their realism. Except for the children games that will feature cute chibi characters, the other games won’t have that. The in-game characters will have realistic appearances.\nThese games still have to be worked on extensively and Liam trust Lucy to do the job.\n\"I have the frameworks. I’ll begin work immediately,\" Lucy said.\n\"Good,\" Liam murmured.\nWith all that settled and Lucy now working on the games, Liam can finally go back to the Earth and rest.\nIt’s only been less than half an hour on Earth but he has spent more than two weeks in the Dimensional Space. He really needs to rest but he knew that it might not be possible, as he was still expecting calls from the IR department of the companies he received their shares.\nAhhh... Whatever.\nHe left the space and returned to his room. He collapsed on the bed and closed his eyes, trying to sense the nanites doing their work in his body.\nUnfortunately he couldn’t sense anything and he didn’t feel anything. Not even the initial itch.\nLiam sighed and stopped, as he decided to really rest. But before he could do that, his phone started ringing and it was an unknown number.\nLiam picked it up and just as expected, it was the IR department of one of those companies.",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Eagle’s Vision Trait Infusion Completed\n\"Ahhh... that was exhausting,\" Liam sighed heavily as he collapsed back onto his bed.\nHe had just gotten off a call with the last company’s IR department. After the first call, it was like a domino effect had been triggered — one after another, they came, each wanting to introduce themselves, congratulate him, and walk him through the perks and rights that came with being a major shareholder.\nIt was polite, professional, and honestly repetitive. There wasn’t much variety in what they said, though each company tried to make it sound as though they were giving him something special.\nLiam listened with patience, gave polite responses, and made notes where necessary. But at the end of the day, they were all saying the same thing: Welcome to the table. You’re one of us now.\nThe table being the world’s corporate elite.\nLiam stared at the ceiling, exhaling slowly. \"Finally,\" he murmured. \"That part’s done. I’m free for the day.\"\nHis original plan had been very different. He’d been thinking about going on that familiarization tour Captain Adler had arranged for the Airbus A380 Flying Palace.\nThe thought of stepping aboard, seeing the crew, walking through the compartments, and experiencing the reality of what had once only been a rumor felt thrilling. But as much as he wanted to, Liam held himself back.\nThe same went for the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium. The car had been delivered, pristine and waiting in his garage, but he hadn’t taken it for a spin yet.\nWhy? Because until Daniel accepted his offer, he didn’t want to make any public moves with these assets.\nIt wasn’t fear — not exactly. It was discipline. Liam understood the moment he took either the aircraft or the Cabriolet out in public, Forbes, Bloomberg, and every financial watchdog in the world would be on him like hawks.\nThey would connect the dots: the mansion, the hypercars, the equity stakes, the impossible acquisitions. The narrative would spin faster than he could contain it.\nDaniel was more than just a private banker now — he was Liam’s shield. His Chief of Staff in all but name. And if Liam went public with these toys before Daniel officially crossed over, then he would be exposed without his primary defense. That was unacceptable.\nDiscretion first, spectacle later.\nSince he had nothing urgent to do, Liam decided to stay home. He hadn’t had a true day of rest in days. Between building Lucy, her exhaustive training, the assembler, the Dimensional Space exploration, and his rapidly expanding wealth, his life had turned into a whirlwind.\nIt wasn’t that he was tired in the normal sense as his enhanced stats left his body overflowing with energy. But mentally, he needed stillness.The most update n0vels are published on Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nHe picked up his phone and opened a chat group he hadn’t looked at in a while. Dozens of unread messages blinked at him, a storm of activity he couldn’t be bothered to scroll through. Instead, he simply sent a single line:\n\"Hey guys.\"\nHe had no idea if anyone was free to reply. If they weren’t, he didn’t mind. His eyelids were already heavy, not from fatigue but from the rare luxury of being unburdened.\nAnd so, Liam let himself drift off. He slept through the entire afternoon.\n***\nEvening\nLiam groaned softly as his eyes fluttered open. He saw the familiar ceiling of his bedroom, the golden-orange wash of late sunlight through the curtains.\nBut then, something changed as a faint tingle pulsed behind his eyelids, like static electricity.\nWhen his vision cleared, the world looked... different. Too bright, too sharp, too much. His pupils adjusted unnaturally fast, snapping into clarity rather than gradually.\nThe sunlight seemed to blaze with a piercing intensity, every ray separated, and every reflection almost blinding. But then his brain caught up, adapting instantly, filtering the flood of detail into something usable.\n\"Sir,\" Lucy’s voice said in his mind. \"The nanites have completed the eagle’s vision trait infusion.\"\nLiam sat up slowly. His gaze fell on his bedsheets and he froze.\nHe could see the fibers. Not the weave, the thread count, but individual fibers, twisting together like microscopic ropes.\nHe turned his head and looked at the curtains. Where before there had been simple fabric, now there was a vast interlacing of faint threads, each strand distinct, and each junction clear.\nAnd when he glanced at the air itself, he saw dust. Tiny specks drifting in shafts of sunlight — not as vague dots, but as worlds of their own, glowing like tiny planets caught in beams of fire.\nLiam stood, his bare feet sinking into the carpet, and walked to the window. He parted the curtain and looked outside.\nThe neighborhood stretched before him, calm and still. But his eyes pierced distances that should have blurred into haze.\nA rooftop of a building located quite a distance away from the block resolved into perfect clarity, as he could see the faint grit of shingles and the rusted edge of a vent clearly.\nA bird soaring lazily overhead was so detailed he could count each feather mid-flight, the subtle iridescent sheen along its wing.\nHis gaze dropped lower, catching the near-invisible micro-movements of insects darting between flowers. And when he glanced toward a garden down the street, his breath caught. He could see ultraviolet fringes blooming along petals, spectral gradients that no human eye was ever meant to perceive. The metallic glints of pollen sacs shimmered like faint stars.\n\"Wow,\" Liam whispered.\nHe had known the eagle’s vision would enhance him. But this... this was beyond anything he’d imagined. It wasn’t just sharper eyesight. It was a new spectrum of perception.\nAnd he also suspected the effect was amplified because his vision had already been enhanced by the nanites. The nanites had taken something already superhuman and layered it with nature’s best predator optics.\nCurious to test its limits, Liam entered the Dimensional Space. He gazed into the horizon, searching for detail. But the wasteland stretched endlessly, uniform and monotonous. He could see impossibly far, but without variation like mountains, trees, and other structures, there was nothing to anchor his perception.\nHe sighed. \"Not the best place for this.\"\nDecision made, he returned to Earth and went downstairs. Mason and Nick noticed him heading toward the garage and exchanged glances.\n\"Sir, should we accompany—\" Nick began.\nLiam waved them off. \"Not this time. Stay here.\"\nThey hesitated, but they decided not to argue with their boss. Liam slid into the Maserati GranTurismo, the engine growling to life, and rolled down the long driveway.\n***\nThe moment he exited the mansion’s gate and turned onto the street, his jaw tightened in awe.\nHe could see the end of the street. Not as a blur. Not as distant lights. He saw it clearly. Cracks in the asphalt at the far curb. A dent in a mailbox a quarter mile away.\nAs he drove, weaving through the familiar streets of Holmby Hills, he pushed the test further.\nOn Rodeo Drive, he slowed the Maserati and glanced down the luxury-lined street. From one end, he could see the other as though it were only a block away. The window mannequins, store logos, even faint fingerprints smudged against polished glass.\nOn Sunset Boulevard, his vision cut through the evening haze with surgical precision. Neon signs flickered in brilliant detail. People walking far down the block were no longer strangers in a crowd. He could see their expressions, the way their lips moved, even catch snippets of micro-gestures.\nFinally, he reached the coast. He parked near the beach, the Maserati purring softly as he stepped out. The ocean roared before him, waves crashing in endless rhythm. He stood on the sand, staring out at the horizon.\nThe sea foam glittered under the fading light, each droplet distinct. Gulls wheeled overhead, their feathers etched against the violet sky.\nFar out, beyond where any human eye should pierce, he could see the faint shadow of a fishing trawler cutting across the water.\nThere wasn’t much use for the traits and his insane strength now, and he’s waiting for when he starts jumping between worlds.\nHe exhaled slowly, putting his arms into his pocket.\nThree weeks ago, none of this existed for him. He had been ordinary. He had plans, ambitions, sure but no system, no mansion and no impossible wealth.\nNow? He was walking proof of a new reality. His life had changed beyond recognition.\nAnd yet... a shadow lingered.\n\"There’s no free lunch,\" he muttered, voice low. The words were carried away by the sea breeze.\nThe system had given him everything. More than everything. But for what? There had to be a cost. A hidden clause. And he had no idea if he would ever be able to repay it — or what repayment would even look like.\nThe fear was real, though he hid it beneath calm breaths.\nLiam sighed and decided not to think too much about it. He can’t exactly do anything about it. He can only just go with the flow of things and do what’s necessary whenever he could.\nHe stood there for over an hour, letting the rhythm of the waves ground him. Eventually, the sky darkened fully, and the first stars began to prick the heavens.\nLiam turned back to his car, sliding into the driver’s seat. His reflection caught in the rearview mirror, and he smiled to himself.\n\"Time for dinner,\" he murmured.\nThe Maserati roared as he pulled away from the beach, heading back toward Bellemere Mansion.",

      "content": "Chapter 94: The Games\nLiam sighed softly as he sat down on his bed. He had just finished dinner, and his thoughts had been circling around the same thing for more than over an hour: the games.\nLucy had informed him earlier that she was done creating all seven. He had been a little surprised at first.\nShe seven full games in less than a day of real-time?\nOn Earth, that was a feat that required decades, with hundreds of developers, artists, writers, and engineers. But then he reminded himself: Lucy wasn’t an ordinary AI. She was an AGI, running on a laptop with petascale computing power, in a dimension where every minute outside was an hour inside. Time and resources were bent in her favor.\nSo no, he wasn’t surprised anymore.\nHe picked up the Gear Glass from his nightstand and slipped it on. The device powered on instantly, synchronizing to his retina and neural pattern without the faintest delay. The familiar ripple of darkness passed over his vision before it cleared, and he found himself back in the user lobby.\nBut it wasn’t empty this time. The pure white expanse that had greeted him on the first boot had transformed.\nNow, in front of him are different glowing icons, each marked with a name — Terra, Genesis Sandbox, Eternal Realms, Frontline, Virtual League: Football, Virtual League: Basketball, Children’s Arenas.\nThe icons weren’t static, either. Each one shimmered faintly, like a living window into its world. Terra’s icon showed a rotating hologram of the Earth. Eternal Realms displayed a knight holding a flaming sword, the fire curling realistically even though it was just an icon. The Children’s Arenas pulsed in bright pastel colors, like an invitation.\nLiam smiled faintly. \"Let’s start there,\" he murmured, his eyes locking on the children arena’s icon.\nThe icon pulsed once, then expanded in his vision until it filled everything.\n***\nThe white void disappeared.\nIn its place, Liam found himself standing in the middle of a massive theme park. Bright balloons floated overhead, cheerful banners rippled in the breeze, and pathways stretched out in every direction, each leading to different \"mini-worlds.\"\nA cheerful NPC — a mascot-like figure with oversized gloves and a welcoming smile — appeared beside him.\n\"Welcome to the Children’s Arenas!\" the NPC said in a chirpy voice. \"Would you like a quick tour?\"\n\"Yes,\" Liam replied.\nAt once, the mascot raised a hand and pointed. The park’s layout shimmered in his vision, expanding into a holographic map. Each arena was represented as a floating bubble.\nObstacle Dash — a wipeout-style game where kids could race across giant padded obstacles, bounce on trampolines, and slide down enormous ramps.\nTreasure Hunters — an exploration game set in bright, cartoonish ruins, where kids searched for hidden gems while avoiding playful traps.\nAnimal Friends — a nurturing game where players cared for and played with magical creatures.\nPaint Blasters — a safe PvP game where kids could shoot each other with neon paint guns, splashing colors across arenas.\nSky Riders — a flying mini-game where kids mounted hoverboards or cartoonish wings to race through floating hoops in the sky.\nThe last mini game reminded Liam of one game from a movie.\nEach game was chibi-styled. The characters — including his avatar — had been simplified into cute, rounder proportions with big heads and expressive faces.\nLiam chuckled softly when he saw his reflection in a mirror-like fountain. His usually sharp features had been replaced by a cheerful chibi version of himself.\n\"Okay, Lucy,\" he muttered, \"this is adorable.\"\nThe NPC guide explained the mechanics: each arena was designed to be safe, lighthearted, and social. Even falls or \"hits\" didn’t cause pain but playful vibration feedback, like being tapped on the arm.\nLiam tested a few of the arenas. He dashed through Obstacle Dash, leaping from inflatable platforms and laughing quietly to himself when his avatar slipped comically and bounced off a trampoline.\nHe tried Paint Blasters, splattering the bright walls in neon orange and dodging AI opponents that laughed every time they \"hit\" him.\nThe immersion was staggering. It wasn’t like watching a screen or moving a joystick. It was living inside the game. For children, this would be magic — a fantasy playground that felt as real as life, yet safe and filled with joy.\nWhen he exited back to the lobby, Liam smiled with genuine satisfaction.\n\"Lucy... you outdid yourself with that one. Kids will lose their minds.\"\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Lucy replied in his mind. \"I also created an AI overseer for the arenas to ensure constant safety and fairness.\"\nOf course she had to. It wasn’t only for the game but all the games.\nNext, Liam’s eyes fell on the football icon. He selected it.\nThe next moment, he was standing on the edge of a roaring stadium. The crowd’s chants rumbled like thunder, and the floodlights painted the lush green field in perfect clarity.\nNormally, instead of the chanting, it should had been music but Lucy didn’t use it because Liam asked her not to. He doesn’t want get himself into some legal squabbles.\nUnlike the two main football games, Lucy didn’t use real world players and their information but created players modelled after them.\nThe game has two main game style — classic, traditional third person POV and the immersive POV — the enhanced version of first person POV.\nGamers can control the players through neural intents or physical overlay. This means that they control the players through their thoughts — intents — or physical action.\nBut Lucy made sure that physics wasn’t broken as she plugged in the necessary rules and limits to create a gameplay that looks indistinguishable from real life football matches with a crazy level of immersion.\nThe game has three game modes. The first is the default single player mode. In this mode you control one player, AI controls the rest. This mode feels more like a classic console game. Especially with the third person POV.\nThen the next mode is the multiplayer mode. In this mode, instead of the other players being controlled by AI, each is being controlled by a different gamer. Two different squads with all 22 players being a gamer. It’s like a real football match. That also includes the fact that the in-game and playable characters looks and feels no different from human.\nThis was all the same for the basketball game too.\n\"I can already see the crazy esport tournament potential of these two games,\" Liam said to himself, as he exited the basketball game.\nHe doesn’t even need to think about it to know it.\nAfter that, Liam launched the fourth game, Genesis Sandbox\nSuddenly, Liam saw that he was standing on a floating island. This was called a neutral ground. It was flat, simple, with endless skies stretching above and below.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nAn NPC guide appeared beside him — a tall, robed figure with a friendly smile.\n\"Welcome to Genesis Sandbox,\" it said warmly. \"Here, you can build anything.\"\nThe guide explained the mechanics. Tools for creating objects. Editing functions that let him stretch or shrink reality. Physics engines that obeyed natural laws unless toggled off. Publishing systems to share creations with others.\n\"I’ve never played a sandbox game before. I wonder how good they are and how good this is,\" Liam said to himself, after he was done listening to the guide’s explanation.",

      "content": "Chapter 95: The Games (2)\nAfter guide’s explanation of the Genesis Sandbox, Liam found himself faced with three choices.\nThe first was to enter a tutorial world where he could learn the basics of building. The second was to check out the public creation hub, where players could visit the worlds of others who had set their plots to public — though for now, it was empty. He was still the only registered player. And the third, the one that truly mattered, was to step onto his own island: his personal sandbox, a blank canvas.\nEach new player was given one of these small islands. They started simple — a floating stretch of land surrounded by endless sky — but they could be expanded over time. Progress was persistent. Every tree, every wall, every piece of furniture placed would remain, ready to be built upon whenever the player returned.\nThe game’s tools were intuitive. Basic builder kits came preloaded: shape tools for adding or removing blocks, terrain sculpting to raise hills or carve valleys, object placement for trees, rocks, walls, or furniture. There was even an avatar customization station.\nBut since the sandbox game was tied to the Gear Glass account, the avatar wasn’t some alternate persona. It was the account avatar — in Liam’s case, his own face and body.\nThe effect was almost unsettling. Looking down at his hands, then catching his reflection in the still water at the island’s edge, Liam saw himself staring back, rendered with impossible precision.\nThere were more advanced functions too, though simplified for beginners: physics toggles for gravity, light, and sound. Presets like \"realistic gravity\" or \"low-gravity playground.\" Templates and presets for structures: houses, shops, castles, even parks. Theme packs ranging from sci-fi to medieval, from modern skyscrapers to lush fantasy forests.\nAnd for those who needed guidance, there was a clear learning path:\nBeginner: Build a house.\nIntermediate: Add NPCs or animals.\nAdvanced: Layer in logic — opening doors, creating quests, scripting puzzles.\nEvery player was also assigned an AI helper — their personal assistant, the same AI bound to their Gear Glass account. It would walk them through tools, demonstrate features, and even generate starter assets if requested.\nLiam stood on his little island, the wind tugging at his hair, listening to Lucy’s calm explanation. The skies stretched endlessly above and below, a twilight void painted with soft clouds. The silence was absolute, but not unpleasant.\n\"Lucy,\" he said, \"summon me something. A tree. A large Oak tree.\"\nAt once, the ground beside him shimmered. In an instant, a towering oak tree grew out of nothing, its branches swaying naturally, its bark rough and detailed enough that Liam could see every fissure.\nHe reached out and touched it, running his fingers across the grooves. It felt solid, real, like any tree he might find outside Bellemere Mansion.\n\"Good. Now a house. Something simple.\"\nBefore his eyes, planks of wood appeared one after another, assembling themselves into a cabin-like structure. Walls rose, a roof formed, windows slotted into place. Within seconds, a neat house stood waiting for him. He stepped inside. The interior smelled faintly of pinewood, the floor creaked realistically under his weight, and shafts of light streamed through the window panes.\nActually, this wasn’t how the game was to be played exactly. The tree’s seed is planted and allowed to grow. Player can use time acceleration to speed up its growth. The house have to be built step by step by themselves, but the players can bypass that if they have a builder character.\n\"This...\" Liam murmured, \"this is really dangerous.\"\nHe didn’t mean it in a bad way. He meant it in the way visionaries did when they realized they were standing at the edge of a cultural revolution.\nA child given this game wouldn’t just play. They would create. Build their own towns, sculpt their own worlds, share them with friends. They would stop being consumers and start being architects of digital civilizations.\nEven adults would find it irresistible. With infinite freedom, infinite possibilities, who wouldn’t want to create?\nSatisfied, Liam exited the sandbox. He had seen enough to know: this game alone would dominate the industry. And it wasn’t even the flagship.\n***\nBack in the Gear Glass lobby, Liam’s gaze drifted across the glowing icons. His eyes fell on the largest of them with the image of Earth rotating in space.\n\"Terra,\" he whispered.\nHe focused on the icon and it expanded, engulfing his vision.\nLiam blinked and found himself... in his bedroom.\nFor a split second, his mind stuttered. He looked around, confusion creeping in. The bed, the desk, the lamp on the nightstand — everything was exactly as it should be.\nBut no. His real body was still lying on that same bed. Here, he was in the game.\nTerra had spawned him into an exact replica of his surroundings. Not a generic template, but his actual room, down to the smallest detail.\nHe touched the desk and felt the smooth wood. He brushed his hand across the lamp and saw the faint smudge of his own fingerprint.\n\"This is... unsettling,\" Liam muttered.\nFor ordinary players, the first spawn point would be their real-world location too — their homes, their streets, their cities.\nThe Glass mapped reality itself, grounding the game in the familiar before inviting players to expand outward.\nBut his bedroom spawn point is actually something unique to Liam because other players will be spawned on their first time in a general location of their real-time location.\nLiam stood, walked out of his bedroom, and descended the stairs. The mansion was empty, eerily silent. He opened the front doors and stepped into the street.\nThe cool night air hit his face, real enough to make him pause. He walked down the familiar road until he reached Sunset Boulevard.\nIt was nighttime here as well. The neon lights were dim, stores shuttered, and the streets were empty. No pedestrians or cars. Just silence. Eerie silence.\nIf not for the faint markers glowing in his vision — the UI elements reminding him he was inside the Gear Glass — he would have believed he was awake in a city where humanity had vanished overnight.\nThe emptiness was haunting. A deserted Earth.\nAnd yet, Liam could already see the potential. Terra wasn’t just a game. It was a simulation. A 1:1 recreation of Earth itself, with the possibility of expansion into the stars.\nIt was a platform where players could live second lives, explore alternate realities, or create entire civilizations.\nHe exhaled softly and returned to the lobby.\nOne icon remained. The last game.\n\"Eternal Realms,\" Liam murmured, selecting it.\nThe world around him blurred. When it cleared, he was standing in a small village. Cobblestone streets wound between timber-framed houses. NPCs bustled about — vendors shouting from stalls, children running past, guards patrolling with spears.\nThe air smelled faintly of woodsmoke and fresh bread. The sound of blacksmiths hammering echoed from a forge nearby.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nLiam’s smiled to himself when he saw this. It was all too familiar. It was like straight out of the fantasy MMORPGs web novels he had read, except here, it wasn’t through a screen. He was experiencing it.\nThe NPCs weren’t stiff models or clumsy animations. They looked human. Their eyes moved naturally, their gestures fluid.\nWhen one villager accidentally bumped into him, she bowed her head and muttered an apology, her tone weary yet polite.\n\"This...\" Liam whispered. \"This is it.\"\nHe didn’t need a full explanation. He knew how it worked. Eternal Realms was the first true fantasy MMORPG in history. Quests, dungeons, exploration, magic, combat — all rendered with a realism no developer on Earth could ever match.\nHe walked toward the blacksmith, with his curiosity piqued. The man greeted him with a nod.\n\"Need a blade, traveler?\" the NPC said, his voice rough, his expression sharp, as he pointed to the already made swords on display.\nLiam reached out and grasped the hilt or one of the sword. It was heavy but perfectly balanced — according to his Formless Combat Doctrine skill. He swung the sword once, feeling the weight shift naturally in his hand.\n***\nLiam sat on his bed in the real world, removing the Gear Glass and setting it on the nightstand, and he let out a long breath.\n\"All seven games...\" he murmured. \"Every single one of them is a hit.\"\nHe didn’t even need to think too deeply. The children’s arenas would dominate the younger market. Football and basketball would ignite esports on a scale the world had never seen. Sandbox would unleash creativity. Terra would become the foundation for a new digital civilization. And Eternal Realms? That was fantasy brought to life.\n\"Lucy,\" he said softly, \"you really outdid yourself.\"\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Lucy replied warmly.",

      "content": "Chapter 96: Sometimes, Storms Were Where Men Proved themselves\nThe front door creaked open, and a familiar face stepped inside.\n\"Uncle Daniel!\" Harper shouted, springing up from the sofa with boundless energy. His feet pounded across the wooden floor as he bolted toward him.\nDaniel laughed softly, bending down just in time to catch the boy as Harper flung himself forward. Daniel wrapped him in a warm hug, lifting him slightly off the ground before setting him back down.\n\"Hey, Harper,\" Daniel said with a smile, ruffling the boy’s hair in that way only uncles could get away with. \"It’s been a while.\"\n\"Yeah, Uncle Daniel, it’s been a while. You came to see my dad?\" Harper asked eagerly, his eyes shining.\n\"Yeah,\" Daniel nodded, still smiling. \"There are some things I want to talk to him about. And I also need his advice on it.\"\nHarper beamed, satisfied with the answer, and looped his arm around Daniel’s wrist as if to personally escort him into the living room. His parents were already watching, both smiling at the scene.\n\"Daniel,\" said his older brother, Marcus Conley, rising slightly from the sofa. His voice carried warmth, that subtle mix of pride and familiarity only an elder brother could have.\n\"Marcus,\" Daniel greeted, offering a warm smile in return.\nBeside Marcus sat his wife, Anna, her features soft and welcoming. \"It’s good to see you, Daniel,\" she said kindly.\n\"Good to see you too, Anna,\" Daniel replied, inclining his head with quiet respect.\nMarcus stood fully now and crossed the short distance, wrapping his younger brother in a firm embrace. They both smiled faintly, but there was more than just brotherly affection in that hug. There was something unsaid, some weight Daniel carried that Marcus immediately sensed.\nWith unspoken understanding, Marcus gave a small nod toward the patio. Daniel responded with the barest tilt of his chin. The brothers excused themselves quietly and stepped outside, leaving Anna and Harper behind.\nThe cool evening breeze met them as they walked into the backyard. The sky was painted in soft hues of lavender and gold, the last rays of sunlight fading over the horizon. The air was still, broken only by the rustle of leaves in the garden.\nMarcus leaned against the railing of the deck, arms crossed loosely. He studied his brother for a moment before speaking. \"So, little brother,\" he said in that affectionate but serious tone he often used when they were children. \"What’s the problem?\"\nDaniel smiled faintly but didn’t answer immediately. He sighed once, then smiled again, but the smile faded into another sigh. His body seemed restless, like a man caught between excitement and fear.\nMarcus noticed. He didn’t push. Instead, he gave his brother time.\nFinally, Daniel raised his head, his eyes tracing the sky above them, with a small, almost disbelieving smile on his face.\n\"I got an offer,\" he said quietly.\nMarcus’s brow furrowed in curiosity. \"An offer? From who?\"\nThere was a pause, and Marcus caught the flicker in Daniel’s eyes. His breath stilled slightly.\n\"...Don’t tell me it’s from who I think it is?\"\nDaniel sighed, then nodded slowly.\nMarcus’s brows shot up, his composure momentarily broken. He leaned forward slightly, lowering his voice.\n\"Wait. You’re telling me that person made you an offer?\"\nDaniel gave a short, almost reluctant nod of confirmation.\n\"Wow...\" Marcus muttered under his breath. His gaze drifted ahead, unfocused, staring at nothing in particular. He needed a moment to process this.\nHe turned back. \"What exactly did he ask of you?\"\nDaniel’s throat tightened before he spoke. \"He wants me to set up a Family Office. And oversee it... as his Managing Director.\"\nMarcus’s eyes widened in genuine shock. His breath caught. \"A Family Office?\" He exhaled heavily. \"And not just any Family Office. His Family Office.\"\nDaniel nodded again. \"Yes.\"\nMarcus shook his head slowly, rubbing the bridge of his nose. He understood now why Daniel had been sighing so much inside. Offers like this weren’t just rare. They were almost mythical. They weren’t made to just anyone.\nFor a man like him — with power, wealth, and influence stacked beyond comprehension — to entrust Daniel with such a responsibility meant he saw something special in him.\nBut Marcus also knew the darker truth: nothing with advantages comes without disadvantages. Especially when those advantages are enormous. There’s no such thing as a free lunch.\nBut God, this was a tempting lunch.\nHe looked at his brother, who stood there looking both lost and hopeful, and Marcus placed a hand on Daniel’s shoulder. His voice softened. \"Tell me, little brother... what do you feel about the offer?\"\nDaniel gave a small smile, hesitant but honest. \"I want to take it,\" he admitted, his voice low. \"But...\"\nHe didn’t finish. He didn’t need to ask Marcus understood what the\nbut\nmeant. The risks, the dangers and the unknowns.\nDaniel couldn’t but think:\nWhat if I fail him? What if I gamble my career at JP Morgan for something that crumbles?\nMarcus nodded slowly, his gaze thoughtful. Then, after a pause, he said simply, \"Take it.\"\nDaniel blinked. He turned sharply to his brother, almost in disbelief. \"What? Really?\"\nHis expression was incredulous.\nHis older brother was meticulous, careful to a fault. Marcus was the kind of man who would calculate probabilities a hundred times before even making a small decision. And now here he was, telling him to take it.\nDaniel’s voice trembled slightly with shock. \"Why? Why would you say that?\"\nMarcus sighed, then smiled faintly, the weight of years behind his eyes. \"Because while weighing risks and benefits is important, sometimes you just have to take the plunge. Some of my most profitable deals...\" He chuckled softly. \"...were my riskiest ones. Ones your sister-in-law told me to dive into when I was hesitating.\"\nDaniel listened in silence.\nMarcus continued, his voice firm now. \"You can sit here and calculate the risks all day. You can convince yourself it’s too dangerous. Or you can take it, and see where the ride takes you. At the end of the day, you still have a career to build. JP Morgan is comfortable, yes. But don’t forget what Dad always said.\"\nHe paused, with his eyes softening as he quoted: \"Comfort is a poison. The moment you settle into your comfort zone, you lose that fire inside you. You stagnate. Or worse, you regress.\"\nDaniel chuckled quietly, shaking his head. \"I can’t believe you’re quoting Dad at me right now.\"\n\"Why not? He was right more often than he was wrong,\" Marcus said with a shrug.\nDaniel tilted his head back, looking at the sky. He let out a long breath, then nodded. He reached out and patted his brother’s shoulder.\n\"Thank you,\" he said quietly. \"I know what to do now.\"\nMarcus smiled and nodded. \"Good. I’m glad I could help.\"\nThey stood in silence for a moment, the evening air cool against their skin. Finally, Marcus asked, \"Are you leaving already?\"Nᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nDaniel nodded slightly. \"Yeah. I should go. But I’ll visit again soon.\"\nMarcus gave him a knowing look. \"Do that. Harper misses you.\"\nA faint smile touched Daniel’s lips. \"I’ll make the time.\"\nMarcus nodded approvingly. \"Good.\"\nThe two brothers embraced once more. Marcus stood at the railing, watching as Daniel walked to his car. He waved goodbye as the engine purred to life, headlights cutting across the driveway.\nDaniel gave a small wave back before driving off into the evening.\nMarcus stayed there for a long moment, watching the taillights fade. His mind was heavy but proud. Whatever lay ahead for his brother, he knew one thing: Daniel had just stepped into a storm. But sometimes, storms were where men proved themselves.\n\"I wish you all the best, little brother,\" he muttered as the car disappeared into the horizon.\n***\nBellemere Mansion, Holmby Hills.\nAfter checking out the games, Liam had finally settled in for the night, sleeping soundly like a baby with a small smile on his face.\nBut of course, he was using the device while asleep and playing Eternal Realms.",

      "content": "Chapter 97: The Games’ Economic Systems\nBefore going to sleep last night, Liam told Lucy to start working on creating a digital economy for the whole Gear Glass ecosystem.\nThis was part of a bigger plan of his involving the ecosystem. While the planned ecosystem can’t be released at once with the Gear Glass, Liam will take things slow and roll them out when he feels it’s time.\nAs for the digital economy, it will be a default part of the Gear Glass ecosystem and will immediately be available on release.\nThe framework for it was simple really. It’s just about creating a wallet, the digital currency to go with it and the marketplace.\nOn release, each user’s wallet will be given the same amount of the digital currency. This currency can be exchanged into other games’ currency.\nYes, each games have their own separate in-game economy system. Except for Terra, Genesis Sandbox and Eternal Realms, the other games didn’t have an elaborate economy.\nSince Terra is an exact replica of Earth and a simulation where people can live a whole other life on Earth, it naturally needs a very elaborate in-game economy system.\nWith everything that Terra has to followed, it will be undoubtedly be the game with the biggest economy among them all.\nAs a game that offers a very extremely realistic visuals, it will be a major virtual chatting hub, as people will be happy to chat with their friends without leaving the comfort of their homes.\nNot only that but the game will have business. All types of businesses will be allowed to fe operated in the game, except for the red light district business model and the illegal businesses. Liam doesn’t want to get himself into any sort of unnecessary troubles with the authorities.\nHe also had Lucy put in restrictions that the highest level of intimacy that can be achieved in the game is light kissing. If they try to push further like roaming their hand or trying to get undressed, the command won’t register.\nLiam knew that humans have the habit of pushing things to its limit and always doing whatever in their power to have their way. And that was why he took away that power completely.\nAnd for businesses that are allowed, it also include the real estate. Actually, this might become one of the biggest part of the game. The game’s real estate market. It will be huge.ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nTerra is an exact replica of Earth. All buildings and structures in it are exactly as they are in the real world. And yes, even underground structures.\nLiam has exactly no idea.giw Lucy did that part but she did it. He felt that she probably hacked into some systems and stole the digital copies of the structures’ plan.\nBut he knew that it wasn’t all the underground and hidden structures around the world that she knew. Like the secret plans or the undocumented, there was no way for her to get her hands on those.\nAfter Terra, the game that has the potential to have the second biggest economy is Eternal Realms. The game’s economy system is just as elaborate as Terra’s.\nGold, silver and copper coins. Continents, empires, kingdoms, guilds, dungeons filled with monsters that drops loots, myriad fantasy races, organisations and the rest.\nIn a way, it has an elaborate economy system than Terra. This was actually one of the part where the marketplace comes into play.\nIn the marketplace, players can easily trade between themselves. They can sell items from all the games.\nYes, all the games. You heard that right.\nThough in Eternal Realms, players can sell their items in-game to NPCs if they want to and they will be paid in either copper, silver or gold coins. But those coins would still need to be exchanged in the marketplace.\nAlso, while the other games doesn’t have elaborate economy system as the big three games, their systems would still far beyond any of today.\nFor the football and basketball game, players can trade in-game players like the transfer market. And clubs can be sold tok.\nLiam also has plan for the PvP shooter game. But the only Children Arena that will have a normal in-game economy system.\n***\nLiam woke up with a smile. He stretched lazily against the sheets, eyes still closed as memories of the night’s adventure lingered.\nHe had played Eternal Realms the entire time he slept, and it had been glorious.\nThe battles, the quests, the breathtaking immersion — it hadn’t felt like \"playing\" a game at all. It felt like living inside a lucid dream that went on forever.\nEvery moment had been seamless, as though he’d slipped into another world where his sword, his magic, and his choices carried weight.\n\"Good morning, sir. How was your night?\"\nLucy’s sweet, steady voice filled his mind the moment his eyes fluttered open.\n\"Good morning, Lucy,\" Liam replied, sitting up with a faint chuckle. \"My night was splendid. You’ve spoiled me. That game is addictive.\"\n\"I am glad you enjoyed yourself, sir,\" Lucy said warmly. \"I also completed the tasks you gave me last night. The framework for the Gear Glass economy, marketplace integration, and wallet system has been finalized.\"\nA grin stretched across Liam’s face. \"Perfect. I’ll check it out later.\"\nHe pulled the Gear Glass from his face and set it gently on his nightstand. Then he rose and padded toward the bathroom.\nThe shower was refreshing, warm water cascading over his skin. He didn’t need it — his nanite-enhanced body barely ever felt fatigue or stiffness anymore — but nothing beats the feeling of warm or cold water water rushing done one’s back as their takes their morning bath.\nWhen he emerged, dressed neatly in a crisp shirt and dark trousers, he left his room and walked downstairs\n\"Good morning, sir,\" Evelyn greeted him warmly, bowing lightly with her ever-present grace.\n\"Good morning, Evelyn. Good morning, girls,\" Liam said with equal warmth as the two younger maids echoed their greetings in soft voices.\nHe sat at the long dining table. Porcelain dishes were laid neatly before him, gleaming silver cutlery perfectly aligned. Today’s meal was a mix of croissants, scrambled eggs with herbs, smoked salmon, and a small side of fruit.\nLiam ate quietly, savoring the flavors. It wasn’t the extravagance that pleased him. It was the care that was taken to prepare the meal. Evelyn and her team always prepared everything with love.\n\"Thank you, Evelyn. That was excellent, as always,\" he said after finishing.\n\"It is our pleasure, sir,\" she replied with a bow.\nLiam rose, offering them a small smile before returning to his room.\n***\nHe closed the bedroom door behind him and sat back on his bed. His eyes caught the Gear Glass on the nightstand, but Liam ignored it for now. He had something else to do this morning.\n\"System, sign-in,\" he said softly. \"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host. You received $15,000,000]\n***\nJust that? Not bad, I guess,\nLiam smiled.\nHe appreciated the reward. The $15m was a lot of money and it has increased his account balance to $193m.\nLiam didn’t focus on that, as he picked up the Gear Glass, wore it. He wants to go check the thing he asked Lucy to do last night and if there was something else that was needed.\nA few minutes later, after checking the wallet, the digital currency and the marketplace, he was really satisfied. But he noticed that there’s something’s missing.\n\"You noticed it too, sir,\" Lucy said.\n\"Yeah,\" Liam nodded. \"Tell me more about it.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 98: Daniel’s Resignation\n\"Yeah,\" Liam nodded. \"Tell me more about it.\"\n\"The wallet works. Stela works. The marketplace works. But...\" Lucy said and paused. \"How will users purchase more Stela once they burn through their initial allocation?\"\nLiam leaned back against the headboard. That was it. The missing piece. It was so simple it almost felt insulting. It was something that he should had thought about from the beginning.\nUnder normal circumstances, Lucy would had already fixed this on her own but due to a specific instruction from Liam, telling her that he doesn’t want any third-party connection to the device, she couldn’t do that.\nNaturally, users would run out of their starter balance quickly. Between Terra’s sprawling economy, Eternal Realms’ gold-hungry progression and the massive economic activities on all the games, users would burn through their wallet balance in almost no time. And when they do, they would want to buy more.\nWhich meant linking the wallet to real-world money and allowing them to be able to purchase more Stela with it.\nAnd for something like this, old rails of finance — credit and debit cards, and others — will be needed.\nAnd that was where the problem began. Those rails are third-party connection and Liam doesn’t want them.\nAs for the reason why Liam doesn’t want them? It would mean full visibility. Every deposit and also potentially withdrawals would have to go through those institutions. And that also meant users data and an extra layer of fee.\nLiam isn’t trying to replace either traditional banks or planning anything illegal. He wasn’t interested in gray markets or laundering or backroom financial shadows.\nBut he refused to let the Gear Glass ecosystem be tethered like a dog on a leash. He understood that being chained to rails he doesn’t control will spell trouble for him in the future, and he wants to take care of that now.\nFrom the very beginning, he needed independence. It wasn’t about hiding crimes. It was about sovereignty.\n\"So we build our own rails,\" Liam said at last.\n\"Yes, sir,\" Lucy replied. \"I’ve already begun sketching the framework.\"\nThe solution was elegant. Instead of plugging into those institutions’ APIs, users would link their accounts directly through Lucy’s financial pipeline.\nAll they would need to do was input their account number and verify it with a retina and neural scan, confirming the information linked to their identity in their bank’s database.\nAs for how Lucy will access those financial institutions’ databases? Well, she will access them without asking for permission.\nBut since the transaction will go through traditional clearing houses like ACH, there was nothing to worth about.\n\"Alright. Let’s talk fees,\" Liam said, as he rubbed his chin thoughtfully.\n\"Of course, sir.\"\nThis was another crucial part since they are building their own pipeline.\n\"Casual users should feel like it’s free,\" Liam said. \"Give them a monthly free transaction limit — say, one thousand dollars. Beyond that, charge tiny fees. Half a percent, maybe one percent at most. Minimum deposit and withdrawal will be ten dollars.\"\n\"I see that you don’t want users to feel no friction until they cross into heavy use,\" Lucy said.\n\"Exactly. Since we want this to spread fast and seamlessly. The last thing I want is people complaining about hidden charges,\" Liam said.\nHe exhaled softly as he tried to realistically imagined how fast the device the device will sell, and how fast it will take for it to cross the milestones he will be setting of it.\nHe was still thinking of that when another thought struck him, and he sat up straighter.\n\"Lucy... streaming.\"\n\"Yes, sir. I considered that as well.\"\nThe words made Liam chuckle softly. How could he have forgotten? Of course people would want to stream their experiences. Terra, Eternal Realms, the PvP shooter — the sheer realism alone would create a new streaming revolution.\nBut just like other third-party connections which, streaming platforms like Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming won’t be allowed on the device.\n\"We will make our own streaming platform,\" Liam said.\n\"It is already under design,\" Lucy confirmed. \"The streaming service will be binded directly to user accounts. All data, all viewers, all transactions will stay within the ecosystem.\"\n\"And the gifts?\" Liam asked.\n\"Custom-designed, with value tiers,\" Lucy replied smoothly. \"Users can purchase gifts with Stela and send them to streamers. The ecosystem will automatically convert them to account balance.\"\n\"Perfect,\" Liam smiled.\nHe sat back, satisfaction warming his chest. The ecosystem was almost frightening in its infancy stage but it will become a colossal monster at its completion stage.\n**\"\nMeanwhile, JP Morgan Headquarters, New York City.\nThe glass towers of Park Avenue gleamed under the morning sun as Daniel Conley stepped into the marble lobby. His suit was immaculate, his strided were steady, but his heart was heavier than he let anyone see.\nHe moved through security with a nod, past familiar faces who smiled at him and he smiled back.\nThe private banking floor greeted him with soft lighting, polished wood, and hushed tones. He returned greetings with polite smiles, but his steps carried him directly to his superior’s office.\nA knock, then the quiet voice from inside: \"Come in.\"\nDaniel opened the door.\nSeated behind the desk was Jocelyn Fletcher, Managing Director of Private Banking. Her eyes widened slightly in surprise when she saw him.\n\"Daniel,\" she said warmly. \"What brings you here? I wasn’t expecting you.\"\nHe smiled faintly and closed the door behind him. \"Good morning, Jocelyn.\"\n\"Good morning,\" she said, gesturing for him to sit. \"Go ahead.\"\nHe took his seat, smoothing his tie. His smile was steady, but there was a tension beneath it, the kind Jocelyn’s sharp eyes didn’t miss.\n\"So,\" she said carefully. \"What’s on your mind?\"\nDaniel drew in a slow breath, then exhaled. He didn’t dance around it.\n\"I want to resign.\"Googlᴇ search NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nJocelyn froze, her expression slipping into disbelief. For a second, she wondered if she’d misheard him.\n\"...Excuse me?\"\nDaniel repeated, steady and clear. \"I want to resign. Effective immediately.\"\nThe office fell into silence. Jocelyn blinked, then frowned.\n\"Daniel,\" she said slowly, \"you do realize the position you’re in? With the client you’re handling, your future here is—\"\n\"I know,\" Daniel interrupted gently. \"And it’s not about dissatisfaction. Nothing happened between me and the client. I’m resigning for personal reasons. To pursue another opportunity.\"\nHer eyes narrowed, then softened. She studied his face carefully, and then, slowly, she nodded.\n\"I see.\"\nThere was more she could ask. More she wanted to ask. But the way Daniel sat there, calm and resolute, told her the truth: this wasn’t a decision made lightly.\nJocelyn leaned back in her chair, then smiled, though her eyes carried weight. \"In that case... I wish you the best. Go submit your letter to HR. And Daniel?\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"Good luck,\" she said sincerely.\nHe rose, bowed his head slightly. \"Thank you, Jocelyn. For everything.\"\nMinutes later, Daniel stepped out of the HR department, the letter had been filed and the process was now official.\nWhen he exited the building, the cool Manhattan air hit his face. He paused on the sidewalk, inhaling deeply. Then he smiled.\nIt wasn’t relief exactly. It was conviction.\nHe pulled out his phone, scrolled briefly through his contacts, and pressed the name he had been thinking about since last night.\nThe line rang once, then clicked.\n\"Mr. Scott...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 99: The Beginning Of It All\nThe study at Bellemere was quiet, save for the faint tick of the grandfather clock against the far wall.\nAfternoon light streamed through the tall windows, painting golden bars across the dark oak shelves filled with books and documents.\nLiam sat behind the wide mahogany desk, his fingers drumming lightly against the polished surface as he studied the man in front of him.\nDaniel Conley sat upright in the visitor’s chair, his posture immaculate, his expression steady but with the faintest trace of resolve, anticipation, and even nerves.\n\"Just to confirm,\" Liam said, his tone calm but edged with curiosity, \"you’re accepting my offer?\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Scott,\" Daniel replied without hesitation. His voice was clear and measured. \"I want to work for you and build something extraordinary with my own hands.\"\nLiam smiled when he heard this. He had half-expected Daniel to ask for more time, to request a period of consideration before abandoning the security of JP Morgan. Instead, the man had cut ties cleanly. That, in itself, was telling.\n\"Welcome to the family, Daniel,\" Liam said warmly, stretching out his hand across the desk.\nDaniel’s composure softened, and a smile broke through. He leaned forward, clasping Liam’s hand firmly. \"Thank you. I’ll serve you with all my heart and with my utmost loyalty.\"\nThere was no mistaking the sincerity in his voice. For a brief moment, Liam felt something unusual. Gratitude and relief. He knew that in a world where power and wealth drew sharks by the dozen, loyalty was the rarest currency of all.\nLiam leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing slightly with thought. \"So, what’s next? Do you plan to take some time off? Handle personal matters before diving in?\"\nDaniel shook his head. \"No, everything on my end is already settled. I intend to begin immediately. Though, technically, I’ll be placed on garden leave. It won’t affect me.\"\nGarden leave\n? Liam tilted his head slightly.\n\"Lucy, what does that mean,\" he asked her through the Gear Glass.\n\"Garden leave is when a departing employee is still on payroll but restricted from taking on competitors’ business or accessing sensitive information. They’re essentially sidelined, but compensated, to protect the firm.\"\n\"I see. That makes sense.\" Liam gave the slightest nod of acknowledgment, then returned his gaze to Daniel.\n\"Yes,\" Daniel said. \"It’s a formality. But it means I’ll have the freedom to dedicate myself to you without obstruction.\"\n\"Good.\" Liam steepled his fingers, studying the man intently. \"What’s your first move, then?\"\nDaniel’s expression firmed with professional certainty. \"The Family Office. I’ll begin by creating the legal structure and framework. After that, I’ll start assembling staff — accountants, legal counsel, portfolio managers, estate managers, security consultants. I’ll build a proper skeleton before we flesh it out. Once the framework is ready, I’ll contact you directly to review everything.\"\nLiam nodded slowly, satisfied. \"Excellent. If you need resources, tools, or connections, you’ll have them. Don’t hesitate to ask.\"\n\"Understood,\" Daniel replied. He rose smoothly to his feet, bowing his head slightly before taking his leave.\nAs the door clicked shut, Liam leaned back in his chair, exhaling slowly. A smile spread across his face. Daniel was now officially on board. That alone eased a lot of weight for him. With Daniel managing things, Liam could focus on what truly mattered: building and adventure.\nWhen the time is right, I’ll tell him about the aircraft. The Flying Palace will be under his coordination. Not yet, though as I don’t want to crush him under too much too quickly.\nHe also plans to tell Daniel about Lucy. Since Daniel is going to be working for him, he will have to trust him with some things and him having Lucy to assist him will make things easier for him. He also plans to give him a Gear Glass and to all his staffs too. But the staffs will get theirs when the device hits the market.\nLiam’s smile deepened. Yes, things were falling into place.\nHis phone buzzed against the desk, jolting him from his thoughts. The caller ID showed a New York number. His brows furrowed faintly, but he answered smoothly.\n\"Hello?\"\n\"Mr. Scott, good afternoon.\" The voice was warm, polished, with the practiced ease of a seasoned professional. \"This is Jocelyn Fletcher, Managing Director of Private Banking at JP Morgan. I hope I’m not calling at a bad time?\"\n\"Not at all,\" Liam said, his tone cordial. \"Good afternoon, Ms. Fletcher.\"\n\"Thank you. I wanted to reach out personally regarding Daniel Conley. I understand he’s recently submitted his resignation. We greatly value the relationship you’ve built with him, and I want to assure you that JP Morgan remains fully committed to supporting you.\"Google seaʀᴄh ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nLiam leaned back, smiling to himself. Of course. They moved quickly.\n\"I appreciate the call,\" he replied evenly. \"And I wish Daniel the best.\"\n\"Of course.\" Jocelyn’s voice didn’t waver. \"In the meantime, we’d like to introduce you to a new senior banker. Someone with over two decades of experience managing ultra-high-net-worth clients. They’ll ensure continuity so you won’t even feel Daniel’s absence. You’ll also retain full access to our private banking platform, global credit facilities, and our estate and family office advisory group.\"\n\"I appreciate the offer,\" Liam said politely, \"but I won’t be needing a replacement. Daniel has already been handling things for me, and I’ll continue with him directly.\"\nThere was the small pause on the line. Jocelyn recovered quickly. \"I understand. But please allow me to emphasize—our team offers far more than just a single relationship manager. We can provide private placements, bespoke lending, access to global IPO allocations, and even introductions to strategic partners. We would hate for you to miss out on the advantages our platform can provide.\"\nLiam’s smile sharpened. She wasn’t wrong. The perks she dangled were tempting. But he wasn’t naive. Each offer was a leash, a soft tether designed to keep him in orbit around their institution.\n\"Those are generous offers, Ms. Fletcher,\" he said. \"but I’ll decline. My affairs are already covered. Daniel has been excellent, and I trust him completely.\"\n\"...Of course.\" Jocelyn’s tone softened, though beneath it Liam caught the slight disappointment in it. \"May I at least keep you connected to our desk? Even if you’re working with Daniel independently, we’d be happy to extend invitations to our private conferences, exclusive client events, and global economic briefings. You don’t have to make any commitments — simply consider us an open resource.\"\n\"That’s thoughtful of you,\" Liam said, with a gracious and firm tone. \"And I’ll keep it in mind. But for now, I’ll stay as I am.\"\nAnother pause, then Jocelyn exhaled quietly. \"...Very well, Mr. Scott. We completely respect your decision. Please remember you can reach me directly at this number anytime. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, should you ever need anything at all.\"\n\"Thank you, Ms. Fletcher. I’ll keep that in mind.\"\n\"It’s our pleasure, Mr. Scott. We wish you continued success, and please don’t hesitate to call. Goodbye.\"\n\"Goodbye.\"\nThe line clicked off.\nLiam set the phone down, staring at the polished surface of his desk and he chuckled softly.\n\"Nice try, Ms. Fletcher,\" he murmured to himself, with a smile. \"But Daniel’s with me now.\"\nHe leaned back in his chair, the golden sunlight spilling across the desk. He had already settles everything on his end, now all he just needs to wait and watch the gear move accordingly.\nThis is beginning of it all.",

      "content": "Chapter 100: The Urges Vs The Necessities\nAfter the meeting with Daniel and the call from the head of JP Morgan’s private banking department, Liam’s day went by quickly and slowly, as he spent the whole day busy playing Eternal Realms.\nYeah, he will admit it, he was addicted but who can blame him? Playing a game with such realism, one would easily get addicted.\nHe was actually starting to imagine how much dissatisfaction he will earn from the users for the time usage limit he plans to impose on them.\nThis was especially with how content-rich the game is. They might actually petition for the time limit to be lifted and try to force his hand. And things might get even more intense when they start earning actual money from the game. Not from streaming but by either selling the in-game items or when in-game currency gain actual value.\nBut the question is if Liam will cave into the pressure they will mount on him. And the answer is a solid no.\nHe already made a decision and he will be firm on it. He can’t be wishy-washy about it or the users might think that they can push for anything and they will have it.\nIt’s just as the saying goes: \"If you give them an inch, they will want a mile.\"\nHe also doesn’t mind if they take the company to court. He was more confident that they won’t win even if someone pull some strings.\nBut the main question remains: when will Liam release the device into the market? And the answer to that question is that he has no idea.\nNot that he doesn’t exactly have any idea when as he already have vague date in his mind, but he has no idea because he doesn’t want to release the device before the family office is set up by Daniel.\nHe had previously planned to release it like two weeks after the raw materials arrived at the industrial base at Nevada, but that was before when Daniel was just the head of his private banking team. But now working on setting up the family office, he want to release it after his shield has been set up and sturdy to help him bear the brunt of the wave that will come for him.\nActually, the truth is that Liam wants to release the device immediately, but he knew better than to be reckless. He knew that things will get heated with the release of the device. It’s going to be a type of heat that has a high chance of destroying his misunderstood and perceived identity.\nWhich means that he needs something more tangible than just that. And that thing isn’t something that a private banker would be able to give him.\nHe will need a family office for the legal firepower part that will come, as people love litigations. He will also need it for political shielding and PR management.\nIn other words, if he rushed the launch before the Family Office existed, he’d be exposed and become vulnerable to lawsuits, hostile takeovers, government seizures, or just being crushed under corporate pressure.\nNow, one might ask why Liam didn’t start small? Like maybe creating something that’s not too disruptive but still a little groundbreaking? And his answer to that is why?\nWhy settle for less? He has a level of knowledge that that can will shock even the best of those in the science community, so why should he start small?\nBesides, it’s not like the Gear Glass is a technology that’s completely new. It’s just a major advancement of already existing technologies, and the best to ever exist even in the future.\n\"But really, when exactly can I release the device?\" Liam asked himself, as he looked out the window, enjoying the magnificent view of the night sky.\nThanks to his super enhanced vision, courtesy of the newly acquired Eagle’s vision trait, he could see quite far into the night sky.\n\"Maybe I should had taken Mrs Fletcher’s offer...,\" he said, and then shook his head the next moment.\nNahhhh... That won’t work. It’s better for me and them this way.\n\"Sigh... but I really want to release the device soon. Should I ask Daniel for the timeframe of the family office set up?\" He said, thinking to himself.\nHe thought about it for a while and shook his head. He doesn’t want to rush Daniel or pressure him. He has already taken care of everything else that needs to be taken care of, and there was no need to rush.\nBut this wasn’t entirely about Gear Glass release into the market. It was also about the new car and the aircraft. He would be lying if he said that he wasn’t in a hurry to take both out for a spin. But he also understand that he can’t just do that. It was just like the device.\nAhh... So many restrictions,\nLiam sighed.While he was still thinking of that, he thought of something else; accumulating his sign-ins.\nThe reason why he had refused to let it accumulate before was because of the money he needed to purchase the molecular assembler. But now that he had done that and also quite a bit of funds remaining, it was time to let it accumulate.\nHe also remembered that the system said that he can accumulate more sign-ins for better rewards. Also, Liam was curious to see how much more better the sign-in rewards can get.\nI guess that’s settled then. I will be accumulating my sign-ins for the rest of the week, until the last day of the week which is also my first monthly sign-in.\nTalking about his first monthly sign-in, Liam was dey me curious about how it will go. He was curious to see what sort of mind blowing rewards he would receive. But he knew that he can only wait and see.\n\"Time to sleep,\" Liam said, as he placed the Gear Glass on the nightstand and snuggled more comfortably into his bed.\nHe had spent the whole day gaming, it wouldn’t feel right to game in his sleep tonight. Tomorrow’s another day and he can continue when he wakes up.\nClosing his eyes, Liam fell asleep almost immediately, with the sound of his soft breathing filling the room.\n***\nThe next morning.\nAfter waking up, Liam walked to the bathroom to clean up. After he was done with that, he got dressed and went down for breakfast.\nIt was delicious as always, and he enjoyed it. He thanked Evelyn for the meal and came back to his room after he was done.\nHe sat down on the bed and put on the Gear Glass. And a couple seconds later, he heard Lucy’s voice.\n\"Good morning, sir,\" she greeted.\n\"Good morning, Lucy. Anything new information for me?\" Liam asked.\n\"Yes, sir. The starfish regenerative trait infusion had been completed.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 101: Four Days\n\"....The starfish regenerative trait infusion had been completed.\"\n\"It has? Perfect,\" he muttered.\nHe flexed his fingers, turned his wrists, rubbed his forearms, half-expecting something dramatic. Even if not dramatic, at least something. Maybe even a faint itch under his skin. But there was nothing. His body looked and felt the same.\nNot that it surprised him. Even before this infusion, the nanites had already worked wonders. They’d repaired every scar, every faint remnant of childhood scrapes, hidden microfractures in bones, even the tiny muscle tears accumulated from ordinary living and the days he spent working those physically taxing job. His body was pristine, almost unnaturally so.\nStill, the whole point of the starfish’s regenerative trait wasn’t cosmetic. It was about what happened when things went wrong. And there was only one way to test that.\nLiam sat on the edge of his bed for a moment, weighing the idea. A small chuckle escaped him. \"I guess the only way to check it out... is to cut myself.\"\nHe stood, exhaled softly, and vanished into the Dimensional Space. The barren ochre wasteland greeted him for an instant before he teleported again, reappearing in the sleek kitchen of his penthouse.\nThe room was quiet, almost sterile. Stainless steel counters gleamed under soft lighting. He walked to the knife rack, fingers hovering briefly over the handles before choosing one. A chef’s knife, sharp and clean.\nHe turned it in his hand, studying the gleam of the blade. For anyone else, this act would’ve been madness or the act of a suicidal maniac. But for him, it was curiosity.\nLiam sighed, then closed his eyes for a moment, centering himself. His free hand hovered over the edge of the counter.\n\"Here goes nothing.\"\nWith deliberate calm, he pressed the knife against his left palm and drew it across, just deep enough to break skin.\nA sharp sting lanced through him as crimson welled up instantly, a thin line of blood swelling into a bead, then spilling. He hissed softly under his breath, more out of reflex than pain.\nFor a few seconds, nothing happened. The blood dripped slowly, trickling down toward his wrist. The cut stung, hot and raw. It looked and felt perfectly ordinary.\nBut then...\nThe bleeding slowed. Not gradually, but unnaturally fast. The crimson bead at the center of the wound clotted in seconds, darkening into a thin film. The edges of the cut twitched, then knit themselves together as if invisible hands were weaving the flesh back into place.\nIt was subtle at first, then undeniable. The raw gap sealed. The faint redness faded. By the time thirty seconds had passed, the wound was gone. Not even a scar or a faint white line. It was without flawless.\nLiam stared at his palm, silent, then grinned.\n\"Holy hell...\" He whispered, flexing his fingers again. The skin stretched, looking smooth and unmarred.\nHe muttered under his breath, satisfaction dripping from every word. \"That’s... incredible.\"\nHe had expected something impressive. But to watch his own body heal in real-time — faster than stitches, faster than any treatment in the world — it was surreal. He felt like he’d just stepped outside the bounds of what it meant to be human.\nHe also felt that it wasn’t the trait but also the nanites at work. They had speed up the healing process and also made it even better.\nSatisfied with the single test, he set the knife aside. He could cut deeper, try more dramatic wounds, but what would be the point? He wasn’t a masochist. Hurting himself repeatedly just to marvel at the healing wasn’t smart. He had proven the point.\nBesides, Lucy had already assured him the regenerative process was layered. Minor wounds would seal instantly. More serious injuries would take longer but still resolve without scarring. Even full limb regeneration was on the table if he allowed the nanites and the trait enough time.\nThat was enough for now.\nHe smiled to himself as he walked to the penthouse bedroom. He got to the bedroom and dropped onto his bed, allowing himself to collapse against the sheets with a soft sigh.\nWithin seconds, his vision rippled into the familiar white lobby before plunging into the colorful world of Eternal Realms.\n***\nThe hours melted away as he buried himself in quests, battles, and exploration.\nBy the time he resurfaced from the game, night had fallen in the real world.\nHis phone started ringing and he checked the caller ID, and immediately picked the call.Follow current novels on ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\n\"Daniel.\"\n\"Good evening, Mr. Scott,\" Daniel’svoice came from the other end, and Liam could sense a hint of excitement. \"I just wanted to update you. The Family Office setup is proceeding more quickly than expected.\"\n\"Oh?\" Liam leaned back, his eyebrows raised in curiosity.\n\"Yes. Initially, I estimated it would take three months minimum before we even had the basic skeleton ready. But with the connections I’ve leveraged and the team I’ve started assembling, I believe we’ll have it operational within a month. At least at a functional level.\"\nLiam gave a small smile, nodding to himself. \"Faster than expected. That’s good. Very good.\"\n\"We’ll still need more time to fully flesh it out, of course,\" Daniel added. \"But the foundation — legal frameworks, initial staffing, compliance structures — they’ll be ready far sooner than I imagined.\"\n\"Thank you, Daniel,\" Liam said warmly. \"I appreciate everything you’re doing. Keep me posted.\"\n\"It’s my pleasure, Mr. Scott. I’ll update you again soon.\"\nThe call ended.\nLiam set the phone aside, still smiling. His \"shield\" was being built faster than expected. That eased his mind more than he’d admit. With the Family Office taking shape, the looming storm of media, lawsuits, and government curiosity didn’t feel quite so threatening.\n***\nThe days that followed blurred together. Liam alternated between exploring Eternal Realms, refining the little details of the infancy level Gear Glass ecosystem with Lucy, and checking in with Daniel when updates came through.\nEach day, his anticipation grew. Not just for the Family Office, but for something even bigger: his first monthly sign-in.\nHe had stopped doing daily sign-ins, choosing instead to let them accumulate. The weekly sign-ins had already been mind-blowing, but now he wanted to see what happened when everything stacked up — and when it coincided with his first monthly sign-in.\nHe could only imagine what the rewards would be. Money? Shares? More legendary vehicles? Or something even crazier — something that would change his life again the way the Dimensional Space had.\nWhatever it was, he knew one thing for certain: it would be monstrous.\n***\nFinally, the morning came.\nLiam woke early, the first rays of sunlight spilling across his room. He sat up slowly, rubbing his eyes, his heart already beating a little faster.\nHe let out a soft sigh and called up his status screen to check how many system points he had gotten from accumulating his sign-ins over the past four days.\n[Host: Liam Scott]\n[Age: 18]\n[Lifespan: 220 Years]\n[System Level: 3]\n[Strength: 54]\n[Agility: 53]\n[Stamina: 54]\n[Attribute Points: 0]\n[System Points: 40]\n[Skills: Pro-level Vehicular Operation, World-Class Etiquette, World-Class Culinary Arts, Formless Combat Doctrine, Perfect Memory, Universal Linguistics]\n[System Function(s): Sign-in, System Store, Dimensional Space]\n***\n\"Forty? That’s very little,\" he said to himself, before looking away.\nThe reason why he has accumulated was because of his curiosity to see how much of an effect it will have on his first monthly sign-in. The system points was an added bonus.\nWithout wasting time any further, Liam said the words, \"System, sign-in.\"",

He was completely at loss for words.\nAfter a minute, he closed his eyes, as he took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, doing his best to control his emotions. He inhaled and exhaled a few times but he realised that it wasn’t working.\nHe can’t bottle up what he’s feeling at the moment. Even the World Class Etiquette skill wasn’t doing sh*t to help him with his emotions. He has to let it out. He has to scream out at the absurdity level of the rewards he had just received.\nImmediately, he vanished from his room and appeared in the Dimensional Space. And the next thing he did was to scream at the top of his voice.\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!\"\nHis voice reverberated through the air, echoing into the distance before quickly fading.\nLiam sighed heavily as he collapsed into the chair. He still has no idea what to say but the scream had lessened the shock he was feeling.\nWith a small smile on his face, he took a look at his phone and when he saw his account balance which has increased to $678m, he chuckled lightly, putting on a stoic expression. But it was all a facade, as behind that expression was still shock and disbelief.\nHe tried to calm his emotions again, as he closed his eyes briefly and did another round of breathing exercise. And fortunately for him, he succeeded.\n\"I should really learn to get used to the system’s surprises,\" he said to himself with a low voice.\nLiam decided to check his account balance again and he saw the half a billion dollars comfortably sitting in it.\n$500m... This amount is enough for me to do or buy literally almost anything,\" he muttered, staring at the mind boggling figure.\nOn Earth, fortunes like this were the kind of things you read about in financial news headlines. CEOs celebrated record bonuses. Hedge funds bragged about record-breaking years. Billionaire heirs strutted around in magazines.\nBut here he was, an eighteen years old, treating half a billion as just another daily surprise from his system. At least he’s trying to do that.\nHe didn’t focus too much on the money as he quickly turned his attention to one of the more important rewards: the shares.\n\"3% of Nvidiā,\" Liam whispered, grinning.\nThe company wasn’t just a giant. It was the king of AI and semiconductors, the lifeblood of the future. Its GPUs powered everything from deep learning to supercomputing.\n\"Three percent... that’s worth $122 billion. More than the previous value of my equity portfolio,\" He chuckled softly, but there was disbelief in his voice.\nHe tried not dwell too much on it as his mind processed the next reward.\n\"3% of Miçrōsōft...\"\nThis wasn’t just some company. Miçrōsōft is one of the Big Four. The titan of software, cloud, and AI. If Nvidiā was the king of GPUs, Miçrōsōft was the emperor of digital infrastructure. It was a company with decades of dominance, from Windows to Azure cloud computing, to their massive stake in OpenAI and beyond. Their reach was everywhere — offices, homes, schools, the internet itself.\n\"Three percent of Miçrōsōft,\" Liam muttered again. \"That’s $111 billion.\"\nHe let out a sharp laugh and rubbed his face with both hands. \"God, that’s... insane. I’m eighteen and I already own so much.\"\nHe inhaled sharply through his teeth, as he turned to the next reward .\n\"Brōadcōm... the semiconductor giant. Networking, storage, chips in everything from smartphones to data centers.\"\nHis 3% stake in it is valued at $42.2b!\nBut it wasn’t just the money. It was the positioning. Nvidiā, Miçrōsōft, and Brōadcōm together gave him direct influence across AI, semiconductors, and global computing infrastructure.\nBut the next reward made him realise that there was more going on. TSMC wasn’t just a company. It was the backbone of modern technology. From Apple’s iPhones to military hardware, the world’s entire chip supply chain depended on them.\nNot just that. It’s also a company that earned its country so many favourable deals from other countries, and created a tension between the two biggest economies in the world — USA and China.\nAnd Liam now owns a 3% stake which equates to $37.8b, also a stake in one of the world’s most strategically sensitive companies.\nWith today’s monthly sign-in rewards, Liam had finally understood the system’s end goal. It wasn’t just giving him this rewards for nothing, it was also quietly giving him control of the world.\nWith the amount of shares he has, he can move the world to dance to whatever tune he wants. But he also needs a form of security and that is where the money, the leverage power from the bearer bond and the Family Office that Daniel’s setting up comes in. And also his personal strengths and his escape channels.\nWell, it could actually be that or it could be that I’m just overthinking it had the system is just giving me whatever it feels like. But I highly doubt that.\nAnd the remaining rewards made him doubt it even more.\n\"3% stake in Eli Līlly?\" Liam murmured.\nEli Līlly was the undisputed giant of the pharmaceutical world — one of the infamous Big Pharma. They control the insulin, weight-loss drugs, cancer therapies market. And they are reshaping medicine at a global level.\n3% stake in the company meant that his portfolio’s value has grown by $19.5b.\nWhen Liam saw the next reward, his eyes softened slightly. Jōhnson & Jōhnson wasn’t flashy like Nvidia or Microsoft, but it was a global behemoth of healthcare, medical devices, consumer products.\n3% of the company adds $12.8b to his portfolio.\nThe next thing Liam did was to tally up the numbers and when he did, his chest tightened.\n\"Shares total... three percent Nvidia, Microsoft, Broadcom, TSMC, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson...\"\nHis lips moved as he ran through the numbers quickly.\nNvidia: $122b\nMicrosoft: $111b.\nBroadcom: $42b.\nTSMC: $37.8b.\nEli Lilly: $19.5b.\nJohnson & Johnson: $12.8b.\nTotal: $345.6b.\nAdded to his previous equity portfolio, the number was staggering.\n$462b.\nLiam froze as his throat tightened.\n\"Four hundred and sixty-two billion,\" he whispered, as his hands trembled slightly.\n\"I’m... the richest person in the world.\"\nThe words sounded insane even as he said them. The richest man on Earth. Richer than Musk, Arnault, Bezos, all of them. And he was only eighteen.\nFor a long moment, he just sat there in silence, his breath coming in shallow bursts. Then he sighed heavily and collapsed head-back on the chair.\n\"Richest in the world... at eighteen and in just one month,\" he muttered in a very low voice, shaking his head.\n\"This system is... too much. Just too much.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 103: The System Is Just Too Much (2)\nSome minutes had passed and Liam was still in that same position, his head resting on the headrest as he gazed at the monotone sky of the Dimensional Space, lost in thought.\nOver the past minutes, he has been thinking about a lot of things, but his thoughts were mostly focused on the direction his life will take if he gets exposed.\nBut after thinking about extensively, he came to realise something: he was worrying his head too much.\nThings he knew for sure wa that no matter how hard he tires, he won’t be hide his equity portfolio from the world forever.\nAnother he knew was that while things will be heated and probably chaotic at the beginning, but as time passes, everything will fade into the background.\nAll he just have to do is to survive the onslaught of interview requests, paparazzis and global attention at the beginning, and he will be fine when everything fades. The only problem he will have is how long the whole thing will last.\nBut he knew that the world won’t stop because of it and people won’t stop living their lives. So, he should stop worrying about things he can’t control and focus on other things.\n\"Yeah. That’s the best option,\" he said, letting out a long sigh, as his eyes drifted to the long obsidian table where two new documents sat neatly side by side.\nHe reached for the first document and picked it up.\nFloor 85, Central Park Tower, New York City.\nTʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nThat was the first thing Liam saw when he opened the folio, and his breath caught in his throat as his eyes moved to the glossy photographs inside.\nThe images showed a sprawling luxury floor with a size of over 7,000 square feet suspended high above Manhattan.\nGlass walls stretched from floor to ceiling, offering panoramic views of Central Park to the north, the Manhattan skyline to the south, and the Hudson River glinting in the distance.\nThe interiors were impossibly bespoke. Hand-carved marble floors, sculpted wood paneling, crystal chandeliers suspended like constellations. The living room alone looked like it belonged to royalty — wide, airy, with plush furniture in warm tones, designed by some of the world’s best names in luxury.\nThe master bedroom was a sanctuary: soft white linens, panoramic windows on both sides, and a bathroom clad in Italian marble with a soaking tub overlooking the skyline.\nLiam went through the property’s document and he saw that it even had a private elevator, biometric security, and 24/7 concierge service.\nIt was like fortress in the sky.\nAnd it’s value? $150 million.\n\"Naturally. I would had actually been surprised if the price tag wasn’t that high. Especially with its location and the building it’s located in. It’s worth the price,\" Liam said to himself, closing the folio, and picking up the second.\nHe opened it, and for a moment, he forgot to breathe. Almost literally.\nSan Caerola Key, Caribbean\nPhotographs of the island filled the pages. It was a private island, with beaches pristine and white as powdered sugar, waves lapping in crystalline turquoise. Dense tropical vegetation swayed gently in the wind, concealing freshwater streams and hidden lagoons.\nThe aerial shots showed its sheer scale — 8.6 square kilometers, or about 3.3 square miles.\nThere were already infrastructures in place: a luxurious villa with wide verandas overlooking the sea, staff quarters tucked neatly behind a grove of palms, a paved five-kilometer airstrip cutting across the island like a hidden runway.\nThe marina in the photo gleamed with polished wood and steel, large enough to berth superyachts. Solar panels glittered in the sunlight, backed by wind turbines.\nAnd according to the document, there was also an underground freshwater reservoir, ensuring permanent self-sufficiency of the island.\nHmmm... Smart move, system.\nHe continued reading and his eyes narrowed slightly at the line that followed: \"Island coordinates undisclosed. Location hidden from satellites and mapping platforms. Only those you name may know it exists.\"\n\"A ghost island,\" he murmured, as he exhaled slowly.\nThe island didn’t have a price tag and Liam didn’t bother to put one on it, but he felt that it should cost a minimum of $1b, especially with everything it has. Maybe even more.\nWith all that done, Liam could finally focus on the new function that was unlocked. He called up his status screen.\n[Host: Liam Scott]\n[Age: 18]\n[Lifespan: 220 Years]\n[System Level: 4]\n[Strength: 54]\n[Agility: 53]\n[Stamina: 54]\n[Attribute Points: 150]\n[System Points: 40]\n[Skills: Pro-level Vehicular Operation, World-Class Etiquette, World-Class Culinary Arts, Formless Combat Doctrine, Perfect Memory, Universal Linguistics]\n[System Function(s): Sign-in, System Store, Dimensional Space, Transdimensional Travel]\n***\nHe wanted to ask the system about the new function immediately but he held himself back, deciding to allocate his attribute points first.\nHe divided the points equally among the three attributes, allocating 50 points to each of them.\nThe next moment, Liam felt that familiar warm energy as it originated from his chest, before spreading throughout his body like a stream.\nBut there was a difference this time. The energy flow wasn’t as gentle like the previous times. This time, it was like a flooded.\nLiam sucked in a sharp breath as the energy coursed through his veins like liquid fire. His muscles tensed involuntarily and his heartbeat thundered in his ears, faster, stronger, louder. It was as though his chest had turned into a war drum.\nThe energy raced through his arms and legs, into his bones and tendons. He clenched his fists as veins stood out sharply against his skin.\nRaw and undeniable strength welled up inside him until his body felt almost too small to contain it.\n\"Ughhh...\" he groaned, gritting his teeth as the sensation grew heavier.\nHis senses sharpened at an alarming pace. Every faint vibration in the Dimensional Space echoed in his ears. He could hear the whisper of dust motes brushing across the obsidian table. His enhanced vision rippled, flickering as though his eyes were trying to pierce layers of reality itself.\nAnd then he felt a faint prickling behind his eyes. He frowned, pressing his temples, trying to shake it off. But it didn’t stop, as it grew instead.\nThe sting spread from behind his eyes to the center of his skull, then radiated outward like cracks in glass. The warmth that had once been empowering now felt sharp, invasive.\n\"Uhhhnn... ahh!\" Liam hissed, clutching his head as the pain flared white-hot.\nHis knees buckled, and he dropped to the floor, his forehead nearly touching the smooth ground.\nThe sting became a burn. The burn became a throb. The throb became a splitting agony.\nIt was as if his skull was being forced open from the inside, every nerve lit up, screaming. His vision blurred. The ground beneath him seemed to tilt, the sky above wavering and bending like molten glass.\n\"Ghh—hhhnnn!\" He ground his teeth, biting back a scream. His hands clawed at his head, fingernails digging into his scalp. Sweat poured down his temples, stinging his eyes, dripping onto the floor.\nAnd yet... even through the torment, he could feel it.\nSomething was changing in his mind.\n\"Aaaaahhh—!\" He couldn’t hold back anymore and his scream ripped through the silence of the Dimensional Space.\nThen what he knew next was darkness, as the pain crescendoed all at once, a blinding spike of white heat that drowned out every thought. His body convulsed once before going completely limp.\nLiam collapsed against the floor of the Dimensional Space, his chest heaving once, then going still. His eyes fluttered closed, and his consciousness slipped away into the void.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, you’ve met the stat requirements. You’ve awakened...]",

      "content": "Chapter 104: Telekinesis\nAn unknown amount of time passed before Liam finally came to. He looked around him and he could see nothing but the endless wasteland his face was planted on.\n\"Ughhh! What happened?\" He groaned, as he got up and collapsed on the chair.\n\"Lucy, what happened?\"\n\"I have no idea. You were talking to yourself about something and the next thing I know your body started going through some mysterious massive changes, especially in your brain as I noticed unprecedented neural firing patterns. Then you screamed and passed out,\" Lucy replied.\n\"Is that so?\" Liam sighed, as he looked at his hands, observing it if anything had changed.\nIt seems like whatever changes my body went through wasn’t something physical. Or was it just my brain?\nLiam has no idea that the changes Lucy was talking about was the increase in his strength after he had allocated the attribute points.\nHe currently has a million and one questions, and he knew that it was only the system that can give him the answers to his questions. And he was about to ask it, when a notification popped up in his retina.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, you’ve met the stat requirements. You’ve awakened your superpower: Telekinesis]\n***\n\"... awakened my superpower? Telekinesis? What the...?\" Liam spluttered out in a mix of shock, disbelief, and confusion.\n\"System, what’s the meaning of this?\" He asked, immediately seeking answers to his increasing questions.\n[You read the notification right, Host. You met the stat requirement and awakened your superpower.]\n\"What was the stat requirement?\"\n[Minimum of 100 stat points per attributes.]\n\"So, first things first. Is this something unique to me or it’s a general stuff?\" He asked.\nLiam felt that this was one of the more important questions because it will change how he perceives the world.\nHeck, the fact he awakened a superpower has already done that.\n[Yes and yes, Host]\nLiam couldn’t help but frown at the system’s response.\n\"Yes and yes? What do you mean by that, system?\" He asked.\n[You awakening is something that unique to you but it’s also something that anyone in your home universe can do if they meet the requirement.]\nLiam’s eyes closed to a thin slit, as he processed what the system had just said.\n\"If I’m correct, system, then what you mean is that everyone in my home universe can awaken their superpower when they attain a minimum of 100 points per attributes?\" He said, asking for confirmation from the system.\n[Correct, Host]\n\"Also, if I’m correct again, me being able to awaken is unique to me because you helped me to increase my strength. So, I’m the only person in my home universe with superpower?\"\n[Exactly, Host]\n\"Wow... That’s... This is...\" Liam sighed heavily.Thɪs\nHe was not just short of words but also completely at a loss. But there was one sentence he kept repeating in his head over and over again: he now has superpower!\nHaving superpower? That was the dream of every kid, especially boys. While they also want the finest things in life like sneakers, phones, video games, cars, money and the rest. Nothing will ever beat having superpower.\nFor Liam, this is like a dream come true. He was even already thinking about everything he could possibly do with his superpower.\nWhat was telekinesis? It was the most versatile and overpowered superpower. With just enough mental strength and creativity, whoever wields it is unstoppable.\nLiam smiled as he imagined the things he could do with his new power. But he quickly decided to stop imagining the future and instead check out what he can do now.\nHe sighed softly, closing his eyes briefly as he reached out his hand for a key fob on the table, and he focused his thought on it, trying to lift it off the table.\nAt first, he felt nothing and the key fob didn’t budge from its position. But he saw result the next moment, as it vibrated slightky and slowly lifted off from the table, and floated towards him.\nLiam smiled to himself but made sure to maintain his focus on the object as it continued floating towards it, until it settled into his hand.\n\"Wow! I did it!\" He whispered softly, smiling proudly to himself.\nHe looked at the key fob in his hand and controlled it to hover above his hand, and it did just that. He held it like that for a while, curious to see how long he hold an object of its size before he starts feeling headaches.\nBut after more than a minute, he felt nothing. He decided to stop, as he sent it back to the table.\n\"So, I have superpower...\" He muttered to himself, staring at the blue diamond on the table.\nHe focused his thought on it and it slowly lifted from the table, and drifted towards him. It reached his face but he didn’t reach out to grab it, as he held it like that in the air.\nWhile, doing that, he decided to multitask as he flipped the pages of the island’s documents, and took a photo out of it. It drifted upwards and was now hovering beside the diamond.\nCurious to see how far, he can push himself, he focused his thought on the document and made it drift upward and hover beside the diamond, and the photo.\n\"Not bad,\" he muttered himself, with a face and voice filled with satisfaction, and pride.\nHe had expected it to be difficult at first but it felt easy. Too easy actually. There was no headache, nosebleed or anything.\n\"Well, time to check the new system function,\" he said. \"System, please tell me everything I should know about it.\"\n[Transdimensional Travel function will allow you to travel to any world and in any universe. To use it, you will have to choose a universe and the world you want to travel to there.]\nLiam nodded, as he digested everything the system was saying.\n[There are two universes you can choose from: one of magic and one of cultivation — mana and spirit qi. You chose any word in one universe, you will be able to travel there and you can set up an access point to link the world to the Dimensional Space. That way you can easily move between that universe, the space and Earth]\n\"I see... But why just two universes? I thought they are countless out there?\" Liam asked.\n[They are countless worlds but only three universes. Each universe has its own unique energy. Yours has dark energy, the second has mana and the last is spirit qi. Each universes holds countless worlds and in each words are countless planets.]\n\"Dark energy? Three universes? Countless worlds?\" Liam’s eyes widened slightly in shock, As he tried to process what the system said.\n\"So, if my universe has dark energy, can we, I, get stronger by absorbing it?\"\n[No, Host. Dark energy can’t be absorbed. Its use doesn’t go beyond sustaining your universe and everything in it.]\n\"But why? If those people in other universes can absorb the energy in their universe, why can’t we?\" He asked.\nForgive him but he found it unbelievable and unfair at the same time.\n[The laws of those universes allow them but not for yours.]\n\"I see...\" He still found it to be unfair, but he doesn’t want to start arguing with the system.\n[No, Host, I can’t help you bypass the restrictions of your universe... yet.]\n\"Wait I didn’t even ask... Ohhh,\" Liam nodded slowly, smiling in understanding.\nI will be waiting for you you’re able to. Till then, let’s explore these brave new worlds.\n\"System, can I see a list of cultivation worlds available?\" He asked.\n[No, Host. But I can send you to the universe and you can choose whatever world you want to go to.]\n\"Ok. Do that.\"\nJust as he said that, his environment shifted instantly and he found himself standing in deep space.\nHaving experienced this with the Dimensional Space, he was no longer fazed. But there was something different about this experience. It wasn’t just stars he was seeing, he was also seeing what looks like planets, floating landscapes with ancient looking structures, massively monstrous looking monsters sleeping on want looks like stars and there was also shining rivers.\nBut he couldn’t see everything even with his eagle vision trait and he was struggling to comprehend the scale of what he was seeing too.\n\"Wow! Just amazing.\"\nHis eyes darted to the near countless, equally massive planets before settling on one.\n\"That one,\" he said.\nThe next moment, he felt an incredible force of attraction from the planet and he disappeared from his position.",

      "content": "Chapter 105: A Brave New World\nLiam looked around his surroundings, having completely no idea where he was. He was surrounded by nothing but countless tall trees, and there was no soul in sight.\nThe last thing he remembered was choosing a planet while standing in deep space. Then he disappeared and found himself in this eerily silence and large forest.\n\"System, where am I?\" He asked in a very voice, that was almost a whisper.\nUnfortunately for him, he got no response.\nLucy?\nHe tried to contact her through the Gear Glass, but she also wasn’t responding.\nThe device has lost connection with the Dimensional Space. I should set up an access point fast.\nHe looked around his surroundings and wass about to designate the spot as an access point, but the atmosphere made him rethink his decision.\nBut he knew that he had no choice and he decided to go ahead with it. Immediately after doing that, he heard Lucy’s voice.\n\"Sir? Master? Sir? Master Liam?\" She called out repeatedly.\nYes, Lucy. I can hear you\n, he said, smiling in relief.\n\"I’m so glad you’re safe, sir. I was scared when you vanished and I lost connection with the device,\" Lucy said.\nLiam could swear that he sense sadness, relief and happiness from her voice. Also, if he didn’t know better, he would had said that she had actually sighed in relief.\n\"Well, I’m safe but I have absolutely no idea where I am,\" he muttered.\n\"I’ve tried to pinpoint your location using GPS but I can’t find you anywhere,\" Lucy said. \"I’ve also scanned your immediate surroundings through the device but I have no data matching the trees and plants around you.\"\n\"It’s fine. It will be weird if you can actually identify them,\" Liam said, as he bent down to pluck a plant.\nBut right before he was about to pluck it, he heard a roar and his hand froze just inches from the leaf he had been about to pluck. His fingers hovered midair, the roar still vibrating in his chest like distant thunder.\nThe roar was a powerful cry torn straight from the guts of some creature far larger than anything he had ever encountered on Earth.\nHe swallowed hard, his eyes darting in the direction of the sound, though the thick canopy and endless rows of giant trees made it impossible to see more than a dozen meters ahead.\nCuriosity burned inside him, yes. But instinct — cold, unshakable instinct — told him to stay away.\nHe slowly pulled his hand back from the plant, clenching it into a fist. \"Not smart, Liam. Not smart at all,\" he muttered under his breath.\nThe forest around him was massive. The trees weren’t normal by any stretch—they towered like skyscrapers, their trunks so thick that it would take ten men holding hands to encircle just one. Their leaves, bathed in the faint silver glow of the full moon above, rustled in a rhythm that seemed almost... alive.\n\"Sir,\" Lucy’s voice came again, softer this time, as though she too feared disturbing the silence. \"That roar... you should return to the Dimensional Space? It would be safer.\"\nLiam exhaled slowly, his breath curling faintly in the cool night air. \"No. Not yet. If I return now, here will be consider this spot my entry point. And the next time I come back, I’ll just reappear here again.\"\n\"So you mean—\"\n\"Exactly,\" he said, cutting her off. \"I need to find a safer place. Somewhere open. A landmark hopefully. This forest... feels like a trap.\"\nSomeplace I can set as a proper access point or capture with my eidetic memory.\nLucy hesitated. \"...Understood, sir. But please, proceed with caution as it’s night time.\"\nHe gave a faint smile. \"I will. Thanks for worrying about me, Lucy.\"\n\"You’re my master. I have to worry about you.\"\nLiam smiled and turned his gaze skyward. The moon hung heavy and bright, casting ghostly light through the canopy. Shadows stretched long and thin, distorting with every breeze.\nHe picked a direction — north, he guessed, though in truth he had no idea — and began moving, careful with every step.\nHis enhanced body carried him silently. His stamina stat meant fatigue was a distant concept, his agility kept him steady even on uneven ground, and his sharpened senses picked up the faint crunch of leaves, the soft flutter of night insects, the far-off groan of wood as a tree swayed.\nBut the silence after that roar was oppressive. It pressed on him like a heavy weight between the ribs.\nMinutes stretched, then it came again: another roar.\nBut it was closer this time. Also louder. And this one wasn’t pain-filled. It was pure rage.\nThe sound rattled the trees. Birds—if they were birds—exploded upward in a storm of beating wings, vanishing into the night sky.\n\"Shit,\" Liam muttered, quickening his pace. He didn’t sprint but his walk shifted into a purposeful jog, weaving between roots and fallen logs. He didn’t need anyone to tell him this wasn’t good.\nThen, faintly, he heard something else.\nIt was voices.\nAt first, they were low, indistinct. But as he moved toward them, they sharpened. Urgent. Panicked. And then—\nA scream. Human scream.\nIt cut through the night, and it sounded raw, and terrified, before ending in a choked gasp.\nLiam’s pulse spiked. He slowed, listening, creeping forward until he pushed past a thick clump of ferns.\nAnd there—\nThree figures burst into view, running down a narrow animal trail between the trees.\nTwo women, one man. Their clothes were strange — robes tied with sashes, boots reinforced with some kind of leather Liam didn’t recognize. The three of them each clutched a short blade that glimmered faintly in the moonlight.\nFor a moment, Liam froze. The scene was so surreal it might as well have been a movie. But then the man spotted him.\nHis eyes widened, and he shouted something, his words sharp and foreign—except Liam understood them perfectly.\n\"Ironblood Bear! Run for your life!\"\nLiam blinked in shock. \"What the—\"\nBut before he could even process the miracle of understanding a completely alien tongue, the forest answered as the roar returned.\nThis time, it was so close the ground shook. Branches snapped, trees trembled, and a storm of noise rushed toward them.\nLiam barely had time to turn when the thing burst into view.\nA bear?\nBut it was like no bear he had ever seen on Earth.\nIt was colossal and easily twelve feet tall at the shoulder when it stood upright, its body rippling with muscle under a coat of dark, matted fur. Its eyes glowed faintly red, burning like coals in the moonlight. Foam flecked its jaws as it bared teeth longer than knives.\nIt saw Liam and roared again, the sound deafening at this distance, and it charged.\n\"F*ck!\" Liam shouted, the word escaping before he could even think.\nThe ground shook as the beast thundered forward. Some small trees around splintered as it barreled through, roots tearing free from the earth and soil exploding into the air.\nLiam’s body reacted before his mind did. His instincts screamed at him to move, and he did — diving to the side as the bear’s massive paw slammed down where he had been standing. The impact cracked the earth, sending shards of stone and dirt flying.\nHe rolled, came up to his feet, and looked at the beast with wide eyes.\nHis stats were high. His strength, agility, stamina—all over 100. He also had telekinesis now. But he had never fought something like this. Heck, he has never been in any type of fight before.\nThe bear turned its head toward him, saliva dripping from its jaws, and growled low. Then it lunged again, faster than something that size had any right to move.\nLiam’s hand shot out on instinct. His mind screamed a single command.\nStop!\nThe bear’s momentum faltered mid-stride. Its body jerked unnaturally, as though invisible chains had wrapped around its limbs. Dust swirled in the air, leaves shuddered, and for a brief second, the beast hung in place.\nLiam’s temples throbbed instantly. His skull pulsed with pressure, his vision blurring at the edges. The raw force needed to hold something so massive was staggering.\n\"Move, dammit!\" he hissed, focusing with all his will.\nThe bear roared in defiance, straining against his telekinetic grip. Its claws gouged trenches into the soil as it forced itself forward inch by inch, muscles bulging against invisible restraint.\nLiam grit his teeth, sweat already beading on his forehead. He had no idea how long he could keep this up. Seconds? A minute, maybe?\n\"Sir, retreat!\" Lucy’s voice rang in his mind, sharp with urgency.\n\"I know!\" he snapped back, though his feet refused to move.\nHis pride, his shock, his raw disbelief all held him in place. This was his first real test. His first real fight. He doesn’t want to run away from it.\nThe bear roared again, breaking part of his hold, and surged forward another step. Liam stumbled back, his concentration slipping.\n\"Sh*t—!\"\nHe flung his other hand out, summoning every ounce of telekinetic strength he could muster. Small rocks tore free from the ground, ripped upward, and hurled themselves at the beast.\nThey smashed into its head, its chest, its legs—thudding against muscle and fur with brutal force, but it was like the creature’s body was made of steel. But they did something as the bear staggered, momentarily slowed, but not stopped.\nAnd then its eyes locked onto Liam again, burning brighter with more rage.\nIt bellowed, a sound that tore through the night, and lunged once more.\nThis time, Liam knew—he couldn’t just hold it back. He had to fight.\nHis heart hammered as the beast closed the distance, its shadow swallowing him whole.\n\"Alright then,\" Liam muttered, bracing himself, a grin breaking across his face despite the fear coursing through his veins. \"Let’s see what I’m really capable of.\"\nɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt",

      "content": "Chapter 106: Liam Vs Ironblood Bear\nThe Ironblood Bear roared again, a thunderclap that made the air vibrate in Liam’s chest. Saliva flew in steaming arcs as it bared its teeth, its crimson eyes fixed on him like a predator sighting prey.\nLiam tightened his fists and spread his stance, lowering his center of gravity. He had no idea how strong he truly was compared to this monster, but his instincts screamed that he couldn’t just run.\nHe needed to test himself here, to know what his new body and powers were worth. And if things went south, he could always slip back into the Dimensional Space.\nThe bear lunged and it’s movements was like an avalanche in motion, each step shaking the ground. Its paw, broad as a shield, swept sideways with crushing force. Liam ducked, the wind of the swing brushing his hair, and drove his fist forward into its ribs.\nBoom!\nThe impact echoed like stone cracking under a hammer. The beast staggered half a step, its body jerking from the force, but then it roared even louder, swiping again with murderous rage.\nLiam leapt back, his enhanced agility saving him by a hair’s breadth. His chest rose and fell, excitement surging through him. \"Not bad. My hits work... but not enough.\"Follow current novᴇls on\nHe darted forward again, fists flying in a flurry. His knuckles slammed into its torso, his kicks hammered its thighs, each blow landing with a thud that would have shattered concrete walls. Yet the beast endured, muscles rippling under its dark fur, hide that was like iron.\nThe bear swung down with both paws, the ground erupting in dirt and stone as Liam rolled aside. A claw grazed his arm, slicing through fabric and leaving a shallow cut. Blood welled, but almost immediately the wound knitted shut, the starfish regeneration trait working its wonders.\nThe bear’s red eyes widened briefly at the sight of the wound closing. Then it roared again, furious, pressing its assault.\n***\nA distance away, hidden behind a fallen log, the three cultivators who had fled earlier now stared with wide, incredulous eyes.\n\"That... that mortal is still alive?\" whispered the younger woman, with a pale face.\nThe older mad clenched his sword hilt so tightly his knuckles turned white. \"Alive? He’s fighting it! With his bare hands!\"\nThe second woman shook her head in disbelief. \"Impossible. A mortal against an Ironblood Bear? Even Senior Brother Zhou who just reached the Foundation Establishment realm had to run away from confronting it.\"\nTheir eyes followed the youth in black, as he was forcing the beast back step by step.\n***\nLiam ducked under another paw strike and slammed his elbow into the bear’s jaw. The crack echoed, and the beast staggered sideways with a guttural snarl. But before Liam could follow up, its bulk twisted unnaturally fast, its hind leg sweeping out.\nThe kick connected.\nLiam grunted as his body lifted off the ground, pain exploding across his ribs. He smashed through a tree trunk, splinters raining over him, before tumbling back onto his feet. His breath came ragged, but his body was thankfully unbroken.\nThe bear growled, foam still dripping from its jaws, and charged again.\n\"Alright... let’s up the stakes,\" Liam muttered, wiping blood from his lip. His eyes narrowed as he thrust his hand forward, mind locking onto the beast.\nInvisible force slammed into the bear, halting its charge mid-step. Its claws gouged trenches into the soil as it strained, muscles bulging against the unseen restraint.\nLiam’s skull throbbed instantly, his vision tunneling at the edges. The sheer mass of the beast was monstrous; holding it felt like trying to stop a freight train with bare hands. Veins stood out on his temple, sweat dripping down his face.\n\"Down!\" he snarled, focusing harder.\nThe ground trembled as the bear’s forelegs buckled under the telekinetic pressure. With a strangled roar, the beast toppled sideways, crashing into the earth with an impact that sent shockwaves through the forest.\nFor the first time, the Ironblood Bear looked stunned, as its crimson eyes widen, its limbs flailing as it tried to rise.\nLiam didn’t give it the chance.\nHe dashed forward, his every muscle coiled like a spring, and he slammed his fist into its snout. The crunch was sickening. The beast’s head snapped sideways, blood spraying from its nostrils.\nBut Liam didn’t stop as again and again, he continued raining blows like hammers against the beast’s skull, its chest, its limbs. Each punch carried the weight of a battering ram. The bear roared and swiped desperately, but Liam slipped past..\nBones cracked under his strikes. Fur and flesh split. The once-mighty predator staggered backward under the storm of blows, its roars turning from rage to pain, then to fear.\n***\nThe cultivators watching from afar could only gape.\n\"This... this can’t be real,\" the older man whispered hoarsely.\n\"He’s... winning,\" the younger woman said, her voice trembling.\n\"No, look at it,\" the other muttered, pointing. \"The bear’s eyes. It’s... terrified.\"\nSure enough, the beast that had once charged with unstoppable ferocity was now recoiling. Its crimson eyes, once blazing with bloodlust, was now filled with fear of the mortal before it.\n***\nLiam struck once more, his fist slamming into the bear’s chest so hard it collapsed onto its side, coughing blood. The ground cracked under its weight as it let out a low, pitiful groan.\nPanting hard, Liam stood over it, fists clenched, ready to finish it. But then he froze.\nThe beast’s massive eyes met his. It was no longer glowing with rage, but wide and trembling. It whimpered, a sound that rumbled like distant thunder but carried none of the earlier malice.\nIt was begging.\nLiam blinked, lowering his fists slowly. His chest heaved as his heartbeat thundered in his ears. He had dominated it, broken its will. And all that was left was to kill but he felt that it wasn’t necessary.\nIf he was deduce what happened from the roars he had heard. The people he met earlier went looking for trouble. Injured or killed one of the beast’s family and angered it.\nHe thought about this, exhaled sharply and stepped back. \"Go. Get out of here.\"\nFor a long moment, the bear didn’t move. Then, with a low groan, it staggered onto its trembling legs. Blood dripped from its jaws as it backed away, eyes never leaving Liam’s. Then it turned, crashing clumsily through the trees before vanishing into the night.\nSilence followed.\nLiam stood still, the adrenaline still coursing through him, his fists trembling from the release of tension, and his temples throbbed fiercely from the telekinetic strain.\n\"Wow! So awesome!\" He said, smiling from ear to ear.\nHe turned, his eagle-sharp eyes flicking to the shadows where the three cultivators hid. Their faces were pale, their bodies frozen as though they’d just witnessed the descent of a god.",

      "content": "Chapter 107: Senior?\nLiam was still reeling from the thrill of his first actual fight. And not just any fight but against a beast from another world. A cultivation world beast.\nHis lungs burned, his temples still throbbed faintly from the strain of telekinesis, and his knuckles tingled with the memory of hammering against bones as dense as steel. His chest heaved as he stood there in the eerie stillness of the forest, the Ironblood Bear’s retreating form already swallowed by the night.\nHe had never felt so alive.\nThe adrenaline coursing through his body felt like fire in his veins, keeping him sharp, restless. He had never been in a real fight before. Not a street brawl or a sparring match, nothing. His life had been nothing short of ordinary... and boring. But now? Now he understood why warriors lived for the battlefield.\n\"This... this is insane,\" Liam muttered to himself, with a grin on his face. \"I didn’t know I was missing out on something like this.\"\nOf course, he knew Earth could never give him this kind of experience. Unless he walked into the gray, violent underworld of crime or mercenary work — something he had no interest in — he would never feel this rush.\nThe fight had pushed him to the brink, even if he hadn’t shown it. Already, with the adrenaline slowly ebbing, he was starting to feel the aftershocks. His back ached where he had slammed into the tree, his ribs throbbed faintly where the bear’s kick had connected, and his temples still ached slightly from the telekinetic strain.\nBut the pain wasn’t unbearable. It was manageable. It was like a badge of proof that he had survived.\n\"Alright... time to move,\" Liam exhaled.\nHe rolled his shoulders once and winced slightly before straightening his back. His eagle-like eyes swept the darkness of the forest until they caught the faint outlines of the three cultivators who had hidden themselves during the battle, and he walked toward them with steady steps.\nThe trio stiffened. The older man, sword still clutched in hand, straightened his back and stepped forward. The two women — one younger, one closer to his age — quickly followed, their expressions a mix of awe and fear.\nWhen Liam finally stood before them and their reaction was immediate. They lowered their heads and greeted him with formal bows.\n\"Senior,\" the older man said hurriedly, with his voice hoarse with tension. \"Forgive us. If we said or did anything that was disrespectful earlier... we beg your pardon.\"\nLiam blinked in faint surprise. Senior? Him?\nHe almost laughed but caught himself, his lips twitching with amusement. These three saw him as some kind of expert. Perhaps even a hidden master wandering the mortal world. If only they knew he was an eighteen-year-old kid from Earth who just unlocked his powers a few minutes ago.\nStill, he gave them a small smile and shook his head. \"No offense taken. Relax.\"\nThe cultivators exhaled in relief. The younger woman’s shoulders slumped slightly, as though she had been holding her breath the entire time.\nLiam kept his tone casual as he asked, \"I need directions. How do I get out of this forest?\"\nThe three exchanged glances, clearly surprised. But the older man quickly recovered and gestured toward the east. \"Senior, if you follow that path for two hours, you’ll find the forest’s edge. Beyond that is open plains.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam nodded. \"Thank you.\"\nHe turned without hesitation and began walking in the direction they indicated. Behind him, the trio exchanged bewildered glances but quickly fell into step, following him at a respectful distance.\nThe forest stretched endlessly around them. Every step echoed softly against the earth, crunching leaves and snapping twigs. The trees towered above like ancient guardians, their massive trunks blotting out most of the moonlight.\nThe journey was long and silent. The cultivators dared not speak in the presence of this mysterious \"senior,\" while Liam himself was preoccupied.\nIn truth, while his body walked on autopilot, his mind wasn’t here. Through the Gear Glass interface, he was already replaying the battle with the Ironblood Bear in augmented reality. The fight hovered before his eyes like a holographic recording, every movement slowed, every strike analyzed.\nHe studied the bear’s swipes, his own dodges, the moment when telekinesis nearly buckled under the strain. His Perfect Memory played each detail with flawless precision, allowing him to spot gaps in his stance and inefficiencies in his strikes.\n\"I need to strengthen my control,\" he muttered under his breath. \"Too much strain for too little hold. If I refine it, I can do more with less.\"\nThe cultivators glanced at him when they heard his voice but quickly looked away, afraid to interrupt his thoughts.\nAfter what felt like hours, the oppressive canopy began to thin. The air grew lighter, fresher. Liam stepped out from the treeline, and suddenly the world opened up.\nA wide clearing stretched before him, bathed in silver moonlight. The enormous moon hung low in the sky, its pale glow painting the plains in ethereal hues. For the first time since arriving, Liam could truly see the sky.\n\"Beautiful,\" he whispered, his gaze lingering on the colossal moon. For all the strangeness of this world, its beauty was undeniable.\nHe turned back to the three cultivators, who had stopped a short distance behind him, watching nervously.\n\"One more thing,\" Liam said calmly. \"Which way to the nearest village?\"\nThe question stunned them again. A master of his level, asking for directions like a traveler? The younger woman blinked, then quickly bowed and pointed toward the distant hills. \"Senior, three hours that way. You’ll find a small settlement.\"\nLiam nodded, a faint smile tugging at his lips. \"Thanks again.\"\nHe turned, bent his knees slightly... and then vanished.\nOne heartbeat he was there, the next he was gone, his body disappearing like mist under the moonlight.\nThe cultivators froze, their eyes wide with shock.\nThe older man’s sword arm trembled slightly before he let it fall slack at his side. He exhaled heavily, shaking his head. \"An expert... we truly met an expert tonight.\"\nHis gaze lingered on the place where Liam had stood. Regret flickered across his features. \"And I... failed to even ask his name. What an opportunity missed. I pray we cross paths again.\"\nThe women nodded silently, still shaken.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\n***\nMeanwhile, Liam appeared back in the endless wasteland of the Dimensional Space.\nHe collapsed into the chair with a long exhale, rubbing his temples as the tension finally drained out of him.\n\"Sir? Master Liam? Are you alright?\" Lucy asked with worry clearly evident in her voice.\n\"I’m fine,\" Liam said with a chuckle, leaning back. \"More than fine. Just... a little exhausted. How long was I gone, Lucy? On Earth’s time.\"\n\"Checking now...\"\nA brief pause, then her answer came. \"Less than a minute.\"\nLiam sat up straight, his eyes widening slightly. \"A minute? No way. I was in that forest for hours.\"\n\"Time dilation appears to apply differently there,\" Lucy explained. \"If you felt hours pass, but Earth only experienced seconds... then that world runs much faster than your home universe.\"\nLiam’s brows furrowed in thought. That meant he could spend weeks, even months, in that cultivation world, and barely any time would pass on Earth. It was just like the Dimensional Space.\n\"Interesting,\" he murmured, tapping his chin. \"Very interesting.\"\nHe was curious to know more but he decided filed the thought away for later. He was curious, yes, but curiosity alone wouldn’t solve anything right now. He would test it further when he returned during the daytime, when the world was clearer and safer to explore.\nFor now, he leaned back, closed his eyes, and smiled to himself.\n\"Alright,\" he said softly, rising from his chair. \"Back to Earth. I need a shower.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 108: Updated System Store\nLiam walked into the marble-lined bathroom of Bellemere Mansion, turned on the shower, and let warm water cascade down his body.\nThe wasteland’s dust, the forest’s grime, and the sweat from his clash with the Ironblood Bear all washed away, swirling down the drain.\nHis body had endured blows that would have crushed an ordinary man, and while the starfish’s regeneration had already done wonders for the shallow wounds, there was still faint soreness in his ribs and muscles. But he was actually proud of the pain.\nIt’s not that he’s a masochist but this was his first actual fight, and with a monster no less. And it was a battle in which he came out alive from. He felt that he should be proud of the pain.\nJust like one person said; only through experiencing pain can the world understand true peace.\n***\nAfter Liam was done bathing, he dried himself off and changed into comfortable clothes, before slumping onto his massive bed, sinking into the soft mattress.\nThe ceiling fan spun lazily above, but his attention was elsewhere, still restless and filled with the thrill of it the battle. He just can’t get it out of his head. It will take a bit of time.\nWhile still thinking about that, he heard Lucy’s voice.\n\"Sir, I thought you should know that the axolotl regenerative trait infusion has been completed.\"\nLiam blinked in surprise, then smiled, before rolling onto his back. \"Already?\"\n\"Yes. It was actually completed a few seconds ago.\"\nAs if to confirm her words, the faint ache in his ribs faded away almost instantly, dissolving into nothing. Even the mild stiffness in his back evaporated. He exhaled slowly, stretching his arms above his head.\n\"Perfect. With this, I can push myself in that world as much as I want,\" he whispered, smiling to himself.\nThe starfish had given him rapid regeneration, yes, but the axolotl trait was different. It was refined. His cells were now healing perfectly, leaving behind no scar tissue, weakness or imperfection.\nFor a moment, Liam was tempted to jump straight back into the cultivation world. To feel that rush again, to push himself even further now that he had three regenerative traits stacked on top of his nanite enhancements. But he stopped himself, forcing patience.\nNo need to act reckless. I’ll wait. Ten minutes, maybe thirty. Then I’ll go back.\nWhile he waited, another thought surfaced — a very important one. He sat up slightly, eyes narrowing as the idea crystallized in his mind.\n\"System,\" he said aloud, \"tell me something. Can I sign-in in the cultivation world?\"\nIt was an important question because being able to sign-in there will open a whole new door of opportunities for him. Even without yet receiving a response from the system, he was already imagining the type of rewards he will receive from the sign-in and how crazy they are going to be.\n[Yes, Host. You can perform sign-ins in other worlds. Rewards will match the universe you are currently in.]\nLiam froze, when he heard. Then he smiled to himself.\n\"Rewards that match the universe...\" he whispered.\nHe could already picture them. Spirit stones, rare herbs, cultivation techniques, treasures straight out of the novels he used to read.\nIf Earth gave me Nvidia and Microsoft shares... What kind of insane treasures would a cultivation world offer? Legendary martial arts manuals? Ancient divine weapons? Heaven-and-earth treasures that could shatter bottlenecks? Maybe even my own personal hidden realms. Just imagining it is making me want them more!\nHis pulse quickened just thinking about it.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\n\"System,\" he asked again, \"what about timing? Will the sign-ins be based on Earth’s time or the cultivation world’s?\"\n[Sign-ins will be calculated using Earth’s time.]\n\"Perfect,\" Liam muttered with a sharp nod. \"That means no matter how much time passes in that world, my rewards will stay aligned to Earth. I won’t lose out.\"\nHe leaned back on his bed, a satisfied smile tugging at his lips. \"Thanks, system.\"\n[It is my pleasure to serve, Host.]\nLiam chuckled softly, shaking his head. Still, there was one thing that gnawed at him: he had already performed his daily sign-in earlier. Which meant, even with the new universe unlocked, he couldn’t test the feature yet.\n\"I’ll just have to wait until tomorrow,\" he sighed, but his smile returned quickly, though. \"And when tomorrow comes... God, the rewards are going to be insane. I just know that.\"\nWith nothing else to do, Liam shifted his focus. He decided to check the system store to see what new items were added as a new universe has been unlocked. He remembered what the system said then about items in the store being affected by the universe available.\nHe opened the system store interface, the sleek blue panels of light appearing before his eyes and he saw a couple of notifications.\n[Ding!]\n[New universe detected. Items in the store have been updated.]\n[Host can exchange new world’s currencies for system points.]\n[Exchange Rates:\n10 Gold Coins = 1 System Point\n1 Low-Grade Spirit Stone = 1 System Point\n1 Mid-Grade Spirit Stone = 10 System Points\n1 High-Grade Spirit Stone = 100 System Points\n1 Top-Grade Spirit Stone = 1000 System Points]\nLiam sat up straighter, staring at the floating text, slightly taken aback by the exchange rate.\n\"So... ten gold coins equals a single system point,\" he muttered. \"And spirit stones... they scale up insanely.\"\nHe frowned slightly. Based on the novels, spirit stones weren’t just money. They were cultivation fuel, cores of pure spiritual qi condensed into crystalline form. Which meant they were infinitely more valuable than gold.\nBy this logic... one top-grade spirit stone equals one thousand system points. That was ridiculous.\nHe leaned back, exhaling slowly. His head tilted as he considered it from a financial perspective.\n\"If one gold coin equals one thousand dollars... then ten gold coins are ten thousand. Which means one system point equals ten thousand dollars. Still the same rate as Earth’s.\"\nHe paused, then shook his head. \"No. That’s too simple. I’ll only know the true value once I’m there. Exchange rates are one thing, but purchasing power... that’s what matters.\"\nHe decided not to waste time theorizing further. He would figure it out soon enough.\nInstead, he scrolled deeper into the updated system store and his eyes widened slightly in disbelief when he saw the new items.\nQi Condensation Pill\nCost: 50 SP\nDescription: A basic pill that assists a cultivator in stepping into Qi Condensation Realm. Purifies meridians, clears minor blockages, and stabilizes spiritual roots.

      "content": "Chapter 109: Meeting The Cultivators Again\nLiam stared at the glowing panels of the system store, his eyes darting across rows of items that seemed pulled from the wildest cultivation novels he had devoured back on Earth.\nQi Condensation Pills, Spirit Recovery Pills, jade formation disks, sword arts, alchemy manuals — all of it was already overwhelming. But then he scrolled lower, deeper into the listings.\nThat was when the names began to change.\nDao Bone Fragment. Primordial Chaos Essence. Dao Fruit of Eternity.\nHe froze, staring at the descriptions. Each line of text felt like it was humming, alive with promise and danger. These weren’t trinkets. They were concepts given form, the kind of treasures that sects in novels waged wars across continents for.\nDao Bone Fragment\nCost: 50,000\nDescription: Remnant shard of a primordial being who walked the Great Dao. It carries inscribed tubes and techniques of the Dao itself. Can transform mortal marrow into divine marrow.\nPrimordial Chaos Essence\nCost: 100,000\nDescription: Condensed drop of chaos before creation. Can temper meridians or forge chaos bodies.\nDao Fruit of Eternity\nCost: 500,000\nDescription: Rare fruit born once every million years at the heart of the World-Connecting tree, Jianmu. Grants enlightenment of a single Dao and extends lifespan indefinitely.\n***\nLiam sucked in a sharp breath. His pupils contracted as he scrolled even further.\nWeapons that could annihilate star systems. Armors woven from cosmic laws. Immortal techniques etched into heaven and earth themselves.\nEvery description was so grand that it made his head spin.\nHe chuckled softly, shaking his head. Of course.\nThis is the system. It never plays small.\nBut his grin faded when he saw the prices. Even the cheapest among them — the Dao Bone Fragment — cost 50,000 system points.\nHe clenched his jaw at this. That translated to $500 million. Almost everything he had. And that was just the cheapest.\nLiam sighed and finally closed the store. A strange mix of sadness and hope colored his expression.\n\"Obe day,\" he muttered.\nHe knew he would eventually get there. The system’s rewards only grew more monstrous with time. But for now, he was still too far from being able to casually burn hundreds of thousands of SP.\nFocus, Liam. One step at a time.\nHe pulled out his phone and glanced at the time. He had already lingered long enough on Earth. The cultivation world was waiting.\nBut before leaving, a thought struck him. He looked at the ceiling, speaking softly:\n\"System, can I go directly to that world from Earth... and back again?\"\n[Yes, Host.]\nLiam nodded, exhaling a soft breath. \"Good.\"\nHe closed his eyes and visualized the spot where he had vanished from — the forest’s entrance, with its massive, looming trees.\nThe next moment, he vanished from his bed.\n***\nWarm sunlight greeted him.\nHe opened his eyes and found himself standing exactly where he had pictured, at the edge of the vast forest. Overhead, a colossal golden sun spilled light across the land, its brilliance both harsher and more vibrant than the Earth’s.\nLiam smiled faintly and drew in a deep breath. The air felt refreshing, almost rejuvenating, as if each inhale was nourishing his body.\nLiam felt that it was probably because of the spirit qi infused in it.\n\"Not bad,\" he murmured.Googlᴇ search\nHe straightened his back and muttered to himself, \"First thing first though... Let’s find a village or town.\"\nHe remembered the directions that group of cultivators had given him the night before and started walking.\nThree hours later, the dense forest had given way to plains, and on the horizon his eagle saw a huge stone wall rising from the earth like a fortress. A massive gate yawned at its center, with a long line of people queued up before it.\nAs he got closer, he began to pick out the voices.\n\"Next! Two copper coins each, three for a badge.\"\n\"Move forward! Don’t block the line.\"\nPeople in robes and traveling gear fumbled with pouches, handing over small glimmering coins in exchange for stamped wooden badges. Guards in light armor stood watch, with swords, spears and bows spears in hand, occasionally barking orders.\nLiam’s brows furrowed slightly.\nAn entry fee.\nIronically, he had none of their currency. Not a single coin. His bank account was filled with dollars, but here those might as well be scraps of paper. He considered it for a brief second — what if he offered them a few crisp $100 bills? Would they laugh? Arrest him? Worse?\nNo. The currency here was useless.\n\"And I can’t sign-in yet,\" he muttered under his breath. \"So I can’t rely on rewards to bail me out.\"\nHe rubbed his chin, weighing his options. Perhaps he could slip through unnoticed using agility and telekinesis, tricking the guards? But it was risky. Too risky.\nHe was still racking his brain when a familiar voice called out behind him.\n\"Senior!\"\nLiam turned and his sharp eyes locked onto the speaker.\nIt was the young man from the night before — the one who had given him directions out of the forest. His name was Zhou Lu, if Liam recalled correctly. And beside him walked an elderly man with a flowing blue robe and a long white beard. Between them, suspended carefully on a makeshift stretcher, was a wrapped body.\nLiam’s lips curled into a smile.\nWell... looks like my money problem just solved itself.\n***\nThe day before, when Zhou had returned to the sect, his expression had been grim. His clothes were torn, his junior sisters pale and shaken. He went straight to his master’s courtyard, bowing deeply.\n\"Master,\" Zhou said, voice low and bitter, \"our mission... failed.\"\nThey had gone into the Thousand Mist Forest to hunt a Grade 1 Ironblood Bear, its blood an essential ingredient for the Foundation Stabilizing Pill their master was refining. Everything had gone according to plan — until disaster struck.\nBecause the Grade 1 beast had not been alone. Its mate, a Grade 2 Ironblood Bear, had been nearby.\nThis was strange as they were just a few distance from the entrance of the forest where ordinary ferocious beasts and very few Grade 1 spirit beasts roam.\nZhou’s junior brother, at the seventh stage of Qi Refining, had been killed instantly. Swatted aside like a fly. Zhou himself had exchanged three desperate moves with the beast, only to be hurled back, defeated.\nHe had wanted to fight on. His blood boiled with rage, but one look at his terrified junior sisters had snapped him back. He couldn’t let them die too.\nSo they ran.\nAnd while fleeing, they had seen him.\nThe mysterious senior. A man they had mistaken for a mortal... until he had crushed the Grade 2 Ironblood Bear into the dirt with nothing but his fists and an incomprehensible power.\nEven their master, a Golden Core elder, might have needed techniques to subdue such a beast. But this senior? He hadn’t even drawn a weapon.\nZhou had bowed deeply, committing the man’s face to memory. Such strength... hidden so casually. A senior expert, roaming the world in disguise.\nWhen he finished reporting, his master had been silent for a long time, his eyes sharp with thought. Finally, he had ordered Zhou to accompany him the next morning to retrieve the fallen disciple’s body.\n***\nAnd now here Zhou was, standing outside the city gate, staring at the very same senior.\nHis heart surged with both excitement and relief.\nHe clasped his fists respectfully and bowed. \"Senior! It is truly fate that we meet again.\"\nBeside him, the elder with the white beard narrowed his eyes, studying Liam with an intensity that made the air feel heavier.\nLiam, for his part, only smiled, saying nothing for now.",

      "content": "Chapter 110: Blackstone City\nLiam stood before Zhou and the elderly man, his eagle-sharp eyes catching every subtle shift in their expressions.\nZhou was slightly winded from travel and the elder in blue robes carried himself, with a piercing gaze and his long white beard swayed faintly in the breeze.\n\"Senior,\" Zhou said hurriedly, clasping his fists and bowing low. His voice trembled with a mix of respect and relief. \"This is my master, Elder Han of the Nine Heavens Thousand Blades Sect. Master, this is the expert I told you about — the one who saved us from the Ironblood Bear.\"\nLiam gave a small nod and offered a smile. For a moment, he considered giving them a made-up name, something that would blend in with their world. A fabricated identity might make it easier to navigate this society unnoticed. But he dismissed the idea just as quickly.\nWhy hide? Why pretend?\nA false name would change nothing. His aura, his strangeness, his very existence already set him apart. In a world ruled by strength, masks didn’t matter. Power did.\nSo he straightened, his tone calm but steady. \"My name is Liam Scott.\"\nZhou and Elder Han both blinked in faint surprise. The name was alien to their ears, harsh in sound, nothing like the flowing syllables of their world’s cultivators. For a heartbeat, silence stretched between them.\nThen Elder Han smiled, his eyes narrowing as though filing this peculiar detail away.\n\"Liam Scott,\" he repeated, rolling the words carefully on his tongue. \"A strange name, but fitting for one as peculiar as you.\"\nZhou bowed again, his respect growing.\nLiam chuckled lightly, shaking his head. \"I didn’t do anything extraordinary. I was simply unlucky enough to encounter the beast... and lucky enough to survive. Nothing more.\"\nZhou and Elder Han exchanged glances. To them, his words were the height of humility. To dismiss defeating a Grade 2 Ironblood Bear as mere luck? Either he was too modest to flaunt his strength... or his true power was so overwhelming that such a battle meant nothing to him.\nElder Han inclined his head. \"Still, you saved my disciples’ lives, even if indirectly. For that, you have my gratitude. I hope one day I may repay this favor.\"\nLiam waved it off casually, but his smile remained. \"No debt between us. It was just circumstance.\"\nZhou stepped forward then, his tone gentler, almost cautious. \"Senior, forgive my bluntness, but... are you perhaps entering the city as well? If so, do you require assistance?\"\nHis eyes flickered briefly to Liam’s attire. To him, Liam’s clothes looked plain and foreign, his sleek black trousers, his strange looking shoes and his fitted shirt standing out sharply from the flowing robes of other cultivators.\nAnd then there was the artifact on his face—the Gear Glass. Zhou couldn’t sense any spiritual fluctuations from it, yet he was certain it wasn’t ordinary. A senior expert wouldn’t wear something without purpose.\nLiam tilted his head slightly, suppressing a smile. He had expected this question.\n\"Yes,\" he said simply. \"I was waiting in line to enter.\"\nIn truth, he hadn’t anticipated a city at all. He thought he would pass by a modest village, perhaps a cluster of huts at most. Yet here stood towering stone walls and a gate bustling with life. Perhaps the girl from the night before had been exaggerating—or perhaps in this world, even a \"village\" dwarfed Earth’s towns.\nZhou nodded quickly, relief flickering across his features. \"Then please, follow us. You won’t need to worry about the gate fee. I’ll handle it.\"\nLiam gave a small bow of his head. \"My thanks.\"\nThe group moved forward together, drawing curious glances from those waiting in line. The guards, clad in light armor with swords at their hips, scrutinized every entrant carefully. Some people, mostly merchants, paid in gold coins, others with copper, but everyone was required to purchase a stamped wooden badge.\nWhen their turn came, Zhou stepped forward. He reached into his pouch and handed five copper coins to the guard in charge.\nThe guard nodded curtly, accepting the payment. Another guard took out a wooden badge and pressed a heated iron seal into it, leaving behind a crisp imprint. Zhou collected it and turned, presenting it to Liam with both hands.\n\"Here, Senior. Your badge.\"\nLiam accepted it with a faint smile. The wood was warm under his fingers, the faint smell of scorched fibers rising from the fresh seal. He slipped the badge onto his pocket, and into the Dimensional Space, and inclined his head. \"Thank you, Zhou.\"\nWith that, the group passed through the gates.\nAnd then Liam stopped in his tracks.\nThe world before him unfolded like a painting come to life.\nThe city was alive. More alive than anything he had seen on Earth. Streets paved with smooth stone stretched in every direction, wide enough for caravans to roll side by side. Buildings of timber and stone rose high, their tiled roofs adorned with hanging lanterns that swayed gently in the breeze.\nVendors shouted from colorful stalls, their wares spilling out in bright displays: spirit herbs, weapons of steel and jade, talismans etched with runes.\nThe air was filled with a symphony of sound. Merchants haggled, children laughed, hammers rang in the distance from a blacksmith’s forge. The faint scent of roasting meat mixed with fragrant incense, wrapping the streets in a heady aroma.\nAnd above it all, the people. Cultivators with sharp gazes strode confidently, their robes fluttering in the faint breeze. Ordinary mortals bustled alongside them, carrying baskets, pushing carts, leading beasts of burden. The contrast was stark but seamless. This was a society where the mystical and the mundane coexisted.\nLiam’s eyes widened slightly, his lips curling into a faint smile.\nSo this is no village\n, he thought.\nThis is a city. A true cultivation city.\nZhou noticed his reaction and smiled knowingly. \"Senior, this is Blackstone City. Modest compared to the great sect capitals, but a thriving place nonetheless.\"\nElder Han gave Liam a long look, then turned to Zhou. \"It’s time for us to return. The fallen disciple must be laid to rest properly.\"\nZhou nodded. Then he turned back to Liam, his expression earnest. \"Senior, the path ahead may be inconvenient. Please accept these coins as travel funds. It is but a small token, but I hope it will spare you trouble.\"\nHe held out a small pouch, its drawstrings tied neatly.\nLiam blinked, caught slightly off guard. The weight of the pouch in Zhou’s hands told him there was a decent sum inside. He could see the sincerity in Zhou’s eyes, and in Elder Han’s quiet nod. They weren’t offering out of pity, but out of respect.\nAfter a heartbeat, Liam reached out and accepted it. \"Thank you,\" he said warmly. \"I’ll make good use of this. I hope we meet again.\"\nElder Han smiled faintly. \"Should you ever need assistance, come to the Nine Heavens Thousand Blades Sect. We will welcome you.\"\nLiam inclined his head. \"I’ll remember that.\"\nThe group clasped fists in farewell, and then Zhou and his master turned, heading deeper into the city toward their sect’s branch estate.\nLiam watched them go for a moment, smiled to himself. \"Not a bad start, I guess.\"ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nHe turned and began walking aimlessly down one of the busier streets, letting his eagle eyes drink in every detail. Children darted between legs with sticky sweets in hand. A merchant shouted about the effectiveness of his talismans, claiming they were blessed by an elder of the Seventh Heaven Pavilion. A pair of cultivators argued heatedly over the price of a spirit herb.\nEverywhere he looked, there was life, energy, and opportunity.\nAnd as he turned a corner, he saw a two-story building with lacquered wooden panels, red lanterns hanging from its eaves, and a carved signboard that read in bold golden characters: The Azure Crane Restaurant.\nThe air wafting from its open windows carried the unmistakable aroma of spiced meats and fragrant broths. Laughter and conversation spilled from inside, mingling with the clatter of dishes and the strumming of a lute.\nLiam’s lips curved into a smile. \"Perfect.\"\nHe adjusted the pouch of coins at his waist, pushed open the door, and stepped into the restaurant.",

      "content": "Chapter 111: Trouble Always Comes Knocking\nStepping into the restaurant, Liam was met with a scene he knew he would never forget.\nThe Azure Crane was alive in every sense of the word. The moment he crossed the threshold, a tide of sound and scent rushed over him.\nThe chatter of voices overlapped in a chorus of noise: travelers boasting of their journeys, cultivators debating techniques and prices of spirit herbs. Wooden chopsticks clicked against ceramic bowls, cups clinked as wine was poured, and laughter rolled like thunder from one corner where a group of burly men played an unknown game.\nThe smell was intoxicating. Rich broths laced with fragrant herbs simmered somewhere in the kitchen, mixing with the savory aroma of roasted spirit beast meat. There was also the earthy scent of spirit grains being steamed.\nThe décor was no less eye-catching. Lanterns painted with cranes in flight swayed gently from the rafters. The walls were decorated with ink paintings of mountains and rivers.\nIt was vibrant. It was alive. It was a place where mortals, cultivators, and wanderers alike gathered at the edge of Blackstone City’s gates to eat, rest, and trade rumors.\nLiam smiled faintly to himself. Compared to the world of Eternal Realms in the Gear Glass, this felt different. The game was immersive, yes, but here, there was no \"exit button.\" Every voice, every smell, every detail was real.\nHe had fought countless battles in Eternal Realms. Against monsters, humans, and even other races. Endless grinding, endless duels, endless quests. And while at the time he had thought of it as just entertainment, he realized now how much of that accumulated experience had been etched directly into his mind and body.\nThe neural intent control of the Gear Glass meant that everything — combat stances, footwork, reaction speed, reading an opponent — had been integrated into his instincts. When he fought the Ironblood Bear earlier, he hadn’t fought like someone new to combat. He had fought like a seasoned warrior who had survived hundreds of battles.\n\"If not for those experiences,\" Liam muttered under his breath, \"I probably wouldn’t have survived... or at least not with that much ease.\"\nHe chuckled softly and shook his head, bringing himself back to the present.\nScanning the room with his sharp eyes, he found an empty table near the window. He walked across the polished wooden floor and took a seat.\nA young waitress in a simple dress moved quickly between tables, balancing a tray with practiced grace. Liam raised a hand slightly and called for her.\nFortunately, thanks to his Universal Linguistics skill, the language here wasn’t an obstacle. To his ears, it sounded like a highly complex form of Mandarin, with archaic tones and accents, but the skill smoothed it into something perfectly natural.\nThe waitress turned at his call. She froze for the briefest of moments, her eyes widening slightly as she took in his peculiar appearance.\nBlack trousers of unfamiliar cut, sleek shoes unlike anything she’d ever seen, and a fitted shirt with no obvious fastenings — Liam looked completely out of place in a world where robes and sashes were the norm.\nWhile she has seen a lot of peculiar things while working here in the past two years, but this one’s different. Actually, it wasn’t just her that noticed Liam’s appearance. Just as he walked across to his table, quite a bit of curious eyes turned toward him, sizing up this strange foreigner. Some of them glanced briefly before dismissing him as eccentric, while others continued to watch, intrigued by his outlandish appearance.\nLiam ignored their stares, sitting calmly as the waitress finally approached.\nBefore she could speak, Liam reached into the Dimensional Space and pulled out the pouch Zhou had given him. He opened it discreetly under the table and quickly counted at least five gold coin.\n\"This is a lot. More than $5,000 equivalent. I’m very sure that they gave me this much because they are cultivators. The amount is more than enough for me,\" Liam murmured to himself. Enough to eat, enough to rent a room if necessary.\nHe slipped the pouch back into the Dimensional Space immediately. The last thing he needed was to invite trouble by flashing wealth in a tavern full of strangers.\nNovel clichés were clichés for a reason. And he had no intention of becoming the next \"poor foreigner robbed in a restaurant\" story.Google seaʀᴄh Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nStill, he knew it wouldn’t matter much. With how different he looked, trouble would find him eventually. It always did.\nThe waitress bowed slightly and asked politely, \"Honored guest, what would you like?\"\n\"Can you tell me what dishes you have? And the prices?\" Liam asked smoothly.\nShe nodded and began listing the options.\n\"Spirit Grain Rice, one silver for a bowl. Twin Tusks Boar Ribs, 500 copper coins. River Cloud Fish steamed with lotus herbs, two silver. Spirit Chicken Soup, one silver and five copper. We also have roasted Dire Wolf Haunch, three silver, and for cultivators, Clear Qi Wine brewed with spiritual herbs, one silver a cup. For the wealthier guests, a full Spirit Beast Banquet begins at one gold...\"\nLiam raised his brows slightly at the variety. He mulled it over, then decided on something quality but not ostentatious.\n\"I’ll have the River Cloud Fish and a bowl of Spirit Grain Rice,\" he said.\nThe waitress smiled, bowed again, and hurried off to place the order.\nLiam leaned back, resting his elbow on the table, and let his gaze drift to the window. Beyond it, he could see the bustle of the main street: caravans rolling past, cultivators striding with their weapons, children chasing each other between stalls.\nHe smiled to himself.\nI really want to see how food here compares. If the novels were right, spirit qi makes everything taste better than the finest on Earth.\nAnd deep down, he already suspected the hype wasn’t hype at all. Vegetables nourished by spiritual soil, meats from beasts infused with qi. It would only make sense that their flavors surpassed even Earth’s premium delicacies.\nLucy’s voice echoed softly in his mind. \"It is beautiful, sir. I have tried analyzing the architecture, clothing, and goods based on my database... but there are very little to no matches. Too much variance. Too many unknowns.\"\n\"Don’t stress yourself too much,\" Liam replied inwardly. \"I’ll gather information manually. I’ll explore, observe, and ask questions.\"\n\"Thank you, sir. What is your plan after you eat?\"\nLiam chuckled softly. \"No idea. Maybe I’ll go gather information. Or maybe I’ll just see where the day takes me. Let’s eat first. Oh, and remind me when it’s time for dinner back on Earth.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nHe smiled faintly at her reply and let his thoughts drift.\nBut his peace didn’t last long.\nHe noticed a couple of shadows looming over his table.\nSlowly, he raised his head.\nStanding before him was a young man dressed in what was unmistakably luxurious attire for this world.\nHis robe was embroidered with golden cranes, his sash adorned with a jade ornament that glimmered faintly. His hair was tied neatly with a jeweled clasp, and on each side of him stood two people who are probably his attendants. Two tall, broad-shouldered cultivators with hands resting near their weapons.\nThe young man’s expression carried the kind of arrogance that was universal across worlds. A smirk painted his face, and his eyes glittered with disdainful curiosity.\nAround them, a hush fell across the nearby tables. Diners pretended not to look, but their ears strained, their eyes darted. Everyone knew this setup.\nLiam didn’t need to think hard to understand the situation.\nThe typical young master cliché.\nHis lips twitched upward in a small smile.\nWell... guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.",

      "content": "Chapter 112: Taking Care Of Pests\nLiam smiled wryly as he leaned back in his chair. It hadn’t even been five minutes since he sat down, yet already trouble had found him. But he wasn’t surprised. Not even in the slightest.\nWith his eagle-sharp hearing, he caught the whispers, as the customers murmured to each other in low tones, words like \"Third Young Master\" and \"top five family\" slipping out.\nHe didn’t even need to piece it together. Their whispers had already told him the entire story.\nThe arrogant youth standing before him, dressed in embroidered robes of gold-threaded cranes, was none other than the third young master of the Xuan family — one of Blackstone City’s top five families.\nAnd apparently, Liam was the unlucky target of the young master’s \"entertainment\" for today.\nThe nearby customers weren’t subtle about their pity either.\n\"Poor man. The young master never lets things go... He should’ve sat anywhere but here. I almost pity that foreigner,\" muttered one merchant with a shake of his head.\nAlmost pity?\nLiam chuckled inwardly when he heard that. Almost pitying him because he had caught the eye of a spoiled brat? How amusing.\nTop family or not, he had no intention of bowing his head to nonsense. But neither did he wish to stir trouble needlessly.\n\"What do you want? What can I help you with?\" he asked with a calm and casual tone, looking up at the smirking youth.\nThe young master smiled in disdain, before glancing at his attendants. Both men mirrored his sharp-toothed and humorless grin.\nOne of the attendants, a burly man with a shaved head and arms like tree trunks, stepped forward.\n\"Stand up. You’re occupying our young master’s table,\" he said flatly, his tone carried the kind of false politeness that was worse than outright hostility.\nAs though that wasn’t enough, the young master himself chimed in, his smirk deepening. \"And while you’re at it, take off your clothes and shoes. Leave them behind.\"\nThe restaurant fell into near silence. Chopsticks paused mid-air and conversations paused. Everyone knew this routine. First the humiliation, then the beating.\nLiam’s eyes widened slightly, then he let out a brief, genuine laugh.\nWhen he looked back up at the young master, his face had turned serious.\n\"No. And before you get any ideas, I don’t swing that way,\" he said, with his voice was edged with dry sarcasm.\nThe mocking calmness of his tone made the attendant’s expression harden. The man leaned forward, lowering his face until it was inches from Liam’s.\n\"You must be deaf. I said: take off your clothes and shoes... and scram. Now, he growled, his voice dripping with false patience. His breath was hot and foul, and his eyes flashed with menace\nHe clenched his fists tightly, but restrained himself from striking just yet. After all, his young master wanted those clothes intact.\nLiam’s expression soured. He pinched his nose with exaggerated disgust.\n\"Your mouth and everything coming out of it stinks far worse than a garbage dumpsite. Step back. Stop ruining the atmosphere for me,\" Liam said coldly, with a sharp voice.\nThe attendant’s lips twitched. His eyes burned with fury.\nHe turned to glance at the young master, who gave him the faintest of nods. Permission.\n\"Make sure his clothes and shoes don’t get stained,\" the young master ordered casually, as though this was nothing more than a theatrical display.\nThe attendant grinned, sharp and viciously. He turned back to Liam, with a gleeful look on his face.\n\"Blame your damn mouth and your stupidity. You brought this on yourself,\" he said with a sneer.\nLiam raised an eyebrow, looking very unimpressed. Everything has been lame so far. Just a boring repetition of the same thing he has read more than a few times.\n\"Blame myself?\" he muttered, almost amused. \"No. I’ll blame your idiocy.\"\nThe attendant’s sneer twisted into a snarl, and he lunged forward.\nBut before his fist could even descend, Liam’s hand flicked casually through the air and a sharp crack of displaced wind followed.\nThe next thing the attendant knew, his body was hurtling backward, flying through the wooden window.\nThe entire restaurant gasped in unison. Dozens of eyes widened, staring at the calm youth still seated at the table.\nEven the young master and his second attendant froze in disbelief.\nThe silence lasted only a heartbeat before the second attendant roared in fury, his blade flashing as he lunged.\n\"Die!\"\nLiam sighed, shaking his head with exasperation and muttered in a low voice, \"Stupid. I really don’t understand the thing with some characters charging at someone when they saw that their colleague was easily defeated.\"\nAnd he waved his hand twice, in quick successions.\nThe second attendant was thrown off his feet, flying through the same window, followed immediately by the arrogant young master himself.\nThe three of them landed in a heap outside, groaning in pain. The street erupted with startled cries as passersby stumbled away from the sudden scene.\nLiam stood slowly, walked toward the window, and looked down at them.\nThe young master’s robe was ruffled, his jeweled sash hanging loose. His attendants scrambled to their feet, clutching slightly bruised arms and gasping.\nAll three glared up at Liam, their eyes burning with humiliation and hatred.\nLiam only smiled faintly and lifted his hand and waved again, three times in quick succession.\nThe trio were lifted off their feet and flung like ragdolls down the cobbled street. Cries of alarm echoed as the three tumbled further and further until they were nothing but specks in the distance.\nLiam dusted his hands together lightly and returned to his seat. His voice was calm, almost casual.\n\"The best way to deal with pests... is to throw them out.\"\nThe restaurant remained hushed but every gaze lingered on him. It was no longer dismissive but filled with raw curiosity, awe, and fear.\nLiam ignored them all, as he leaned back and waited for his order.\nHe would have loved to restrain the three idiots instead of throwing them out, but his telekinesis wasn’t refined enough yet. Throwing the three of them still drained him but not as much as when he was trying to restrain and slow down the Ironblood Bear.\n\"Sir, won’t this action bring trouble to you?\" Lucy asked, worried.\nLiam smiled and replied, \"Of course it will. Trouble always comes but I’m not scared of it.\"\n\"Please be careful, sir.\"\n\"I will,\" Liam replied, with a warm tone.\n***New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nMoments later, the waitress returned, carefully placing the dishes on his table, as her hands trembled slightly.\n\"Your River Cloud Fish and Spirit Grain Rice, sir. Please enjoy,\" she said, respectfully.\n\"Thank you.\" Liam smiled, nodding.\nHe looked down at the meal before him and even without touching or tasting it, his World-Class Culinary Arts skill told him everything about it.\nThe River Cloud Fish glistened under a light glaze of lotus herb sauce. Its scales shimmered faintly with a natural iridescence, steamed to perfection so the flesh beneath was soft white and flaky.\nThe fragrant herbs crowned the fish like a halo, their scent mingling with the delicate aroma of the broth it rested in.\nBeside it sat a small porcelain bowl of Spirit Grain Rice, each grain gleaming faintly, translucent, as though tiny pearls had been cooked and steamed to fluff. A faint, almost glowing warmth radiated from it.\nLiam picked up the chopsticks laid neatly at the side, his World-Class Etiquette skill guiding his hands effortlessly, as he angled them properly. His movements were precise and elegant, without a trace of awkwardness.\nFirst, he took a small portion of the rice.\nThe moment it touched his tongue, his eyes widened slightly.\nThe taste was unlike any grain on Earth. Soft yet springy, each grain carried a faint sweetness that melted into a warmth that spread down his throat.\nHe nodded in satisfaction, savoring the sensation, before turning to the fish.\nHe picked a tender slice from its side and brought it to his mouth, and the flavor exploded instantly.\nDelicate, buttery flesh infused with the lotus herbs that gave it a refreshing fragrance. The fish was light yet rich, dissolving on his tongue like velvet.\nLiam exhaled softly and smiled in satisfaction.\n\"This... is really good,\" he muttered.\nAnd so he continued to eat, unbothered by the stares that still lingered on him.",

      "content": "Chapter 113: Buying Information\nLiam finished the last grain of Spirit Rice and set his chopsticks down. He exhaled, savoring the aftertaste of lotus herbs still lingering on his tongue. Then he rose from his seat, collected himself, and walked toward the counter where the waitress waited.\n\"I’ll settle the bill,\" Liam said casually, retrieving the pouch of coins Zhou had given him.\nThe young woman nodded with a faint bow, tallying up his order on a slate tablet. \"That will be three silver coins, honored guest.\"\nWithout overthinking it, Liam fished out a gold coin from the pouch and handed it over. The waitress blinked, surprised at his generosity, but quickly composed herself. She took the coin, then carefully counted out his change: ninety-seven silver coins stacked neatly on a small wooden tray.\nLiam froze briefly in shock.\nWhat? Ninety-seven silver?\nHe stared at the gleaming pile, then back at the waitress. The weight of the coins pressed into his palm when he picked them up.\nSo one gold equaled one hundred silver. Not ten or even twenty. One hundred.\n\"I really need to get a handle on this world’s economy,\" he muttered under his breath. \"The logic here doesn’t match anything I’ve read before.\"\nBack on Earth, gold was valuable precisely because of scarcity. In cultivation novels, the ratios were usually ten-to-one or ten-to-ten-to-one between copper, silver, and gold. But here? This world’s economy was built on a completely different logic.\nHe tucked the coins discreetly into the Dimensional Space and gave the waitress a nod. \"Thank you.\"\nBefore he could leave, he turned back and asked, \"By the way... is there a place I can purchase information? Maps, histories, that sort of thing?\"\nThe waitress thought for a moment, then her eyes brightened. \"Yes, honored guest. The Crimson Pavilion just two streets down specializes in such things. Maps, sect records, even trade routes. They are... reputable.\"\nLiam gave her a small smile. \"Perfect. Thank you again.\"\nHe turned and walked toward the door. Just as he reached the threshold, a strange thing happened.\nA voice whispered in his mind.\nBe careful. The Xuan family will not let this slight go unpunished.\nLiam stiffened, his hand pausing on the doorframe And he smiled.\n\"Interesting.\"\nHe could have tried probing but he didn’t bother. With that person’s strength, and their ability to hide from his senses, he knew that he would never find them even if he tried.\nHe simply pushed the door open and stepped out into the bustling street, the whispers of the restaurant fading behind him.\nAs he adjusted his clothes, his gaze flicked down the direction where he’d flung the young master and his lackeys. Unsurprisingly, they were gone. Likely limping back to their clan with humiliation burning their faces.\n\"They’ll report to their elders,\" Liam muttered. \"And they’ll come back with stronger people.\"\nUnfortunately for them, they won’t find me. And even if they do, I can just slip away into the Dimensional Space.\nWith that, he turned his steps toward the Crimson Pavilion.\n***\nIt didn’t take long to find. The establishment stood taller than the surrounding shops, its crimson-painted walls gleaming under the lantern light, and its wooden signboard carved with elegant characters.\nInside, the air was cool and quiet, filled with the faint scent of sandalwood. Rows of scrolls and tomes lined lacquered shelves.\nAttendants in plain gray robes moved silently between them, guiding customers and retrieving documents.\nAn attendant approached Liam immediately, bowing lightly. \"Welcome, honored guest. What knowledge do you seek? We have maps, sect records, trade routes, even information on spirit beast territories.\"\nLiam didn’t hesitate. \"I’d like to purchase basic information. Maps of Blackstone City, its surrounding regions, and the major powers that hold influence here. I’ll also need details on sects, clans, and safe travel routes.\"\nThe attendant’s eyes brightened. \"Of course. The basic city map, sect and clan records will cost two silver. Expanded regional geography information costs three gold. And for spirit beast territories... that will be one additional gold.\"\nLiam nodded calmly. \"I’ll take them all.\"\nThe attendant bowed again. \"Please wait a moment.\"\nWithin minutes, the attendant returned with a neat stack of scrolls and two bound books. The parchment crackled faintly with spiritual ink.\n\"These contain what you seek,\" the attendant said respectfully.\nLiam nodded, slipping the entire bundle into his Dimensional Space as he picked them up. Then he paid: four gold and two silver.\n\"Safe travels, honored guest,\" the man said with a bow.\n\"Thank you,\" Liam replied smoothly, before leaving the pavilion.\nAfter purchasing knowledge, Liam’s next priority was a place to stay.\nI don’t exactly need sleep here, but I’ll need a safe base. Somewhere to return when I come back from Earth.\nFortunately, being near the city gate made things convenient, as establishments like inns, restaurants lined the streets.\nOne of the inns, in particular, stood out: The White Lotus Inn. It was larger than the others, its entrance flanked by carved stone lions.\nLiam stepped inside. The lobby was spacious, its floor tiled in polished jade stone. An ornate counter stretched across the back, where attendants were busy, attending to guests.\nHe approached one and asked evenly, \"Do you have available rooms? Tell me the types.\"\nThe attendant brightened immediately. \"Yes, honored guest. We have common rooms for three copper per night, standard private rooms for one silver, and cultivation suites with spiritual formations for three silver. But our finest option is the VIP room — five silver per night. It includes spirit beast meals, secure treasure storage, and a formation-protected door for safety.\"Follow current novels on ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nLiam thought it over, then nodded. \"I’ll take the VIP room.\"\nThe attendant’s smile widened. \"Excellent choice, honored guest. Please follow me.\"\nAnother attendant led him up two flights of stairs, their footsteps echoing softly against the jade floors. They stopped at a door carved from sandalwood, etched with runes.\nThe attendant bowed, slid the door open, and handed Liam a polished bronze key. \"This is your room. The formations will recognize you as long as you have the key. Please enjoy your stay.\"\nLiam nodded and stepped inside.\nThe room took his breath away.\nIt was spacious, more like a suite than a mere room. The floor was carpeted with woven spirit grass mats that exuded a faint, calming fragrance. The walls were paneled with polished wood, hung with scroll paintings of misty mountains. A low table stood at the center, crafted from a single slab of jade, with cushions arrayed neatly around it.\nThe bed was enormous, its frame carved from blackwood and its mattress piled with silk sheets that shimmered faintly. Beside it, a small incense burner released a subtle aroma that cleared his mind.\nIn the corner stood a secure jade chest, its surface carved with glowing formation runes — the secure storage promised.\nAnd near the balcony, a formation circle had been inscribed into the floor, radiating a faint blue light. Its purpose was clear: protection. Any intruder would be repelled the moment they crossed the threshold.\nLiam smiled faintly in satisfaction. He sat on the bed and bounced lightly once. The silk sheets were smooth, the mattress firm yet comfortable. Nowhere near his luxury back on Earth, but for a foreign world? It was perfect.\nWith a sigh of contentment, he retrieved the books he had just bought from the Dimensional Space.\nThe first was a scroll map of Blackstone City, its streets neatly marked, sect estates highlighted in crimson ink. The second book contained records of the major sects and clans — names like the Nine Heavens Thousand Blades Sect, the Moonshadow Pavilion, and the Xuan Family glared back at him from the pages.\nLiam’s eyes narrowed slightly as he skimmed the section about the Xuans. \"So, one of the top five families, with deep ties to the city lord’s mansion...\"\n\"Well, we will have to wait and see how things go in the future,\" he muttered to himself, as he continued reading.",

      "content": "Chapter 114: The World Of Cultivation\n\"Wow... quite a complex world I would say,\" Liam muttered under his breath, as he closed the last of the books he bought.\nHe had spent the last few hours poring over every single one the books, with his Perfect Memory storing every word, every sketch, every detail.\nBut even with his eidetic recall, his mind still reeled from the amount of information it had just received. The more he read, the more he realized that this world wasn’t just vast—it was volatile.\nA gunpowder keg. A storm waiting for the smallest spark.\nBlackstone City itself, where he currently is, was nothing more than a small dot in the grand scheme of things.\nAccording to the records, it was considered one of the \"border cities,\" pressed up against the Thousand Mist Forest, a place crawling with beasts of unimaginable strength.\nIts population of one million would have been considered enormous by Earth’s standards, but here? It was small. Very small.\n\"Hard to imagine. One million people... and they call this small,\" Liam murmured.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nBy comparison, the cultivation cities were sprawling hubs, each housing populations many times larger, ruled by sects with deep foundations and ruthless authority. But the truly staggering detail lay in the major cultivation cities.\nThere were five of them. Only five.\nBut each of those cities was described as being the size of an entire continent back on Earth. They weren’t just cities in the way Earthlings understood them—they were civilizations, realms unto themselves, fortified strongholds where tens millions upon millions of people, cultivators and mortals, lived under the shadow of sects that had existed for tens of thousands of years.\n\"The scale is ridiculous. A single city the size of a continent. No wonder the books made Blackstone sound like a village by comparison,\" Liam said, with a small laugh.\nThen there were the minor sects, clans, and families.\nThe minor sects are no different from major sects, except for the fact that they haven’t produced a single immortal in the last hundred thousand years or never.\nUnlike sects, families didn’t produce immortals. Their power lay in wealth, bloodline inheritance, and influence. They held armies of mortal soldiers and disciples, and while their peak experts could rival Core Formation or even Nascent Soul cultivators, but that’s their limits.\nThe clans were a step higher. They had ancient bloodlines, some dating back tens of thousands of years, and had produced a handful of immortals across history.\nA clan with two or three immortal ancestors to its name could dominate entire regions, even rival a major sect.\nAnd then there were the sects.\nNine Heavens Thousand Blades Sect—the one Zhou and his master belonged to—was considered minor, with influence stretching only across its single city. Minor sects like it numbered in the dozens. But the major sects... they were monsters in their own right.\nEach one controlled a major cultivation city and each one had multiple immortal ancestors, each one had a treasury of arts and techniques so vast that even their \"discarded\" manuals would be considered divine treasures to the families here.\nJust imagining the weight of history behind such institutions made Liam’s blood stir.\nThen there was the organizations. This part added yet another layer.\nThere was Thousand Elixirs Halls, an alchemy-based organization. According to the texts, they held dominion over everything medicine-related. Pills, herbs, prescriptions, healing arts — if it was alchemy, it passed through their hands. Not even sects dared to openly oppose them, because they controlled the supply of pills necessary for cultivation breakthroughs.\nThen came the artifact and blacksmithing association, Divine Armament Pavillion, an organization that controlled all matters of forging — weapons, armor, talismans, even formation arrays. The book said that their forgemasters could hammer divine runes into metal, birthing weapons that could split mountains or cleave rivers.\nAnd above them all, looming like a spider at the center of the web, was the Chamber of Commerce.\nLiam smiled to himself as he read. The Chamber didn’t just trade. It can be said that they owned the trade. Auction houses in every cities, major and minor, and to even the Imperial City, control of merchant guilds, caravans, and resource routes.\nThe Crimson Pavilion, where he had purchased his books, was one of their branches. In truth, this made the Pavilion more than just a bookstore. It was a hub of intelligence gathering. If one wanted to know something, anything, the Chamber either already knew it or could find it for the right price.\n\"No wonder they dominate. They control the information, which is indirectly the control the flow of everything else,\" Liam said to himself.\nAnd yet, all of these — sects, clans, families, organizations — were nothing but waves beneath the shadow of a single, immovable mountain.\nThe Great Yan Empire.\nThe books had precious little detail about it, which, in itself, was telling. The Empire was not something one studied lightly. Even minor mentions of it were laced with awe, fear, and reverence.\nIt was described as the mammoth that stood above all else. The ruling empire is locates in the Imperial City. The city is twice the size of a major cultivation city.\nThe Empire controlled every clan, every sect, every organization — not through constant interference, but through sheer, undeniable might.\nNo one knew the full strength of the Emperor, but rumours and speculations claimed he stood at the threshold of the Immortal Realm. And if the Emperor was one step shy of godhood, then the Imperial Family was no less monstrous.\nLiam was actually curious about why these sects and clans haven’t colluded to overthrow the current empire, and the next part told him what he needed to know.\nThe records spoke of it plainly: in the last ten thousand years, the Imperial Family had produced more than ten immortals who had ascended beyond the mortal plane.\nLiam’s hand froze as he read that line again. Ten immortals.\nIn contrast, each of the major sects had produced only three to seven immortals in that same span of time. The clans had produced at most two. And the families, and minor sects? None.\nAnd then there was the Imperial Academy.\nFounded by the Imperial Family, the Academy rivaled the major sects in prestige, but its reputation carried an even sharper edge.\nIt was said that its disciples, though fewer in number, were monsters among monsters —prodigies who left sect geniuses in the dust. The academy was the Empire’s furnace, refining raw talent into titans who carried the Imperial banner across the world.\nLiam sat back, staring at the ceiling of his room.\n\"The Empire rarely interferes. \"LBut when it does, even a major sect can vanish overnight,\" he murmured, quoting the book\nHe let out a low whistle. That one line alone told him everything he needed to know.\nThe word cultivator lingered in his mind.\nThat word had once been just fantasy. Term from the novels he had devoured, tales of otherworldly heroes walking paths of endless struggle. But now... they were real.\nHis body tingled as he whispered the word to himself again. \"Cultivation...\"\nThe thought sent a thrill down his spine. He could actually walk this path. Not in a game or in fiction, but in reality.\nHe couldn’t help but imagine himself soaring through the skies, wielding blades of light that could cleave mountains.\nBut he pulled himself back quickly. He couldn’t afford to lose himself in fantasy.\nConventional cultivation was nothing but boring. Sitting for hours, days, weeks and for so long to make a breakthrough. He doesn’t want that. Secondly, he can achieve flight in the future with his superpower. But still, it didn’t lessen the allure of cultivation.\nLiam’s eyes sharpened as he refocused.\nWhat do I want here? What do I intend to achieve besides cultivating immortality?\nThe answer came quickly.\nEstablishment. A name. A legacy.\nHe thought of the sects, the clans, the families. Of their power, their influence, their sheer weight in the world. If they could carve out such dominion, why couldn’t he? With the system backing him, with Lucy’s guidance, with his enhancements, why couldn’t he carve out his own place in this world?\nThe thought was exhilarating. He pictured himself at the head of a force — a clan, a sect, maybe even something greater. A banner that would shake the cultivation world. A name that would echo for generations.\nBut he knew the road would be drenched in blood, not just chaos, because this was not Earth.\nEarth was indifferent, yes. Cold, yes. But it had laws, systems and safety nets, however flawed.\nHere, there was no such thing.\nThis was a true dog-eat-dog world. Where the weak were prey and the strong wrote the rules. Where fairness was a joke and justice was whatever the powerful declared it to be.\nAnd weakness? Weakness was not just shameful. It was a capital sin.\n\"Seems like I already have my goal,\" he said softly.\nEstablish himself. Grow his strength. Walk the path of cultivation. And one day, perhaps, stand shoulder to shoulder with immortals.\nThe thought sent a shiver of excitement through him.\n\"Alright then. Let’s see just how far I can go,\" Liam whispered, closing his eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 115: Making A Decision\nLiam lay down on the bed, thinking about what he had just read and dissecting it bit by bit. And the more he did that, the more one truth became unavoidable: this world was more dangerous than anything he had imagined.\nWhile cultivation and magical worlds are inherently filled with danger, this world is even more dangerous.\nNot just because of the beasts that prowled its forests or the cultivators who wielded powers beyond comprehension, but because of the politics.\nBut also because of the possible layers of alliances, rivalries, blood feuds, sect disputes, imperial decrees. With how the politics is structured and how complex, and volatile the whole thing is, he feels that even just the casual exploration will be filled with a lot of dangers.\nIt was a storm where even the smallest ripple could trigger chaos.\nAnd while he wasn’t scared of a little push and shove, taking on a families, clans and the rest isn’t something someone like him, a nobody here, with no family name or sect backing can handle.\nHe has no bloodline to protect him. He’s a foreigner who looked out of place the moment he stepped into the Azure Crane Restaurant.\nSure, he was strong — stronger than he had ever been on Earth. He had defeated a Grade 2 Ironblood Bear and casually flung around one of Blackstone City’s so-called top family young masters. But those were isolated events. In the grand scheme of things, he was still nothing.\nAnd Liam knew himself.\nHe wasn’t someone who would simply let things slide. Yes, he didn’t care what people thought of him, but he would never tolerate anyone trampling on him.\nHe remembered how, even in high school, he had never once been bullied. Not because he was strong or popular — he had been neither. But because anyone who tried to mess with him found themselves shut down, exposed, or humiliated in ways they couldn’t predict.\nIt wasn’t that he was fearless. It was that he couldn’t stomach injustice directed at him.\nAnd that was the problem.\nBecause in this world, provocations were constant. Families, clans, sect disciples — someone would always try to test him, to step on him, to size him up.\nOf course, this was only related to people his age. He can’t exactly be fighting adults. Besides, there was no reason for an adult to come at him, unless whoever it is was utterly shameless, lacked all sense, and had nothing better to do with their pathetic life than pick on someone younger.\nBut even at that, he could already see himself replaying the same pattern as the protagonists of those cultivation novels he used to read: wandering into a new place, standing out because of his strangeness, and inevitably attracting conflict.\nAnd unlike the novels, he wasn’t ready to commit himself fully to that path. Not yet.\nLiam let out a slow breath, rubbing his temples. \"If I keep wandering here aimlessly, I’ll become a trouble magnet. And sooner or later, that trouble will come from someone I can’t afford to provoke.\"\nNo. Wandering here wasn’t just risky, it’s suicidal.\nFor now, he had to return to Earth.\nEarth was boring compared to this place, yes. It has no towering sects, no immortal emperors, and no beasts that shook the ground with their roars. But it was safe, predictable and also interesting in its own way. And he had left too many loose ends there.\nHis wealth had skyrocketed, but he hadn’t truly grown as a person. What good was being the richest man alive if he was still the same boy who had spent weeks cooped up in his room?\nHe remembered Geneva — the penthouse suite overlooking the city, the bustling streets filled with languages and faces from all over the world.\nHe had told himself he would explore, enjoy, live. But he hadn’t. He had locked himself in, coding, building Lucy, and working like a machine.\nHe had been productive, yes. He had created an AGI that should have taken corporations decades and billions to achieve. But was it enjoyable? Not really.\nHe had missed the point of life. Again.\nAnd that was actually nobody’s fault but his. The truth was that Liam is someone who have serious issue communicating and interacting with people. It wasn’t that he was scared of talking or interacting, but he can’t help but see the worst in people whenever he do.\nIt’s not that he can really be blamed especially after what happened with his parents.\nOne would find it unbelievable that he was already crippled with debt when he was a minor.\nThe reason was because after his father left and his mom also took off and went off the grid, he lived by himself in the house for weeks.\nDuring that period, the bills they left behind started piling up and lots of people came, wanting to collect their money.\nThe bills piled up to the extent that the house utilities was cut and he was thrown out of the house when the bank came to foreclose the property.\nAfter the bank got their money from the foreclosure, there was still other debts. And Liam made a decision to take on the debt.\nIt wasn’t because he wanted to be generous. No, the reason why he decided to take on the debt was because he wanted to cleanly cut ties with his parents.\nAlso, society didn’t treat him to kindly. He was cheated and used by a lot of his employers and he struggled to make ends meet daily.\nLi sighed deeply, as he pinched the bridge of his nose, forcing himself to let go of the bitterness. That was the past. And the past couldn’t be changed.\nBut the future? That was still his to decide.\nHe would return to Earth to develop himself as a person, and not just as a powerhouse with money with a system backing him.\nAs for his plans for the cultivation world while he develops himself on Earth, he will visiting from time to time, to sign-in and keep up with the progress of things. With the time difference between it and Earth, a lot can actually happen in a day.\nWith his decision made, Liam stood up from the bed, gathering the books from the table with telekinesis and slipping them into the Dimensional Space. Then he left the suite and descended the jade-carved stairs to the lobby.\nThe attendant from before greeted him with a warm smile. Liam returned it and asked, \"Can I reserve my room for a month?\"\n\"Of course, honored guest,\" the man replied, \"You may reserve it for as long as you like, provided payment is made upfront. For one month, the cost is 185 silver coins — a discount from the nightly rate.\"\nLiam nodded, appreciating the straightforwardness. He retrieved a gold coin and a stack of silver coins, an equivalent of $18,500, from his pouch, placing them neatly on the counter.\nThe attendant’s smile widened as he collected the payment. \"Excellent, honored guest. Please hold onto your key. You may return at any time during your stay.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam said simply, before turning and making his way back upstairs.\nIn his room once more, he cast a final glance around.\nSatisfied, he closed his eyes and returned to Earth.\nThe next moment, his surroundings shifted, the jade suite dissolving into nothingness.\nWhen his vision cleared, he was back in the familiar comfort of his bedroom in Bellemere Mansion. He collapsed onto the mattress with a long exhale, staring at the ceiling.\nThe day had been fruitful. More than fruitful. He had gained knowledge, perspective, and a clearer sense of direction. And it was barely noon.\nHe chuckled to himself. Time dilation was a cheat. An absolute cheat.\nHe allowed his eyes to drift shut, thinking he would finally rest but fate had other ideas.\nHis phone buzzed violently against the nightstand.\nLiam groaned, taking it out of his pocket. He glanced at the screen and smiled. The caller ID displayed was an unknown number, but Liam can already guess who it is. And he had been expecting it.",

      "content": "Chapter 116: Back To Mundane Things\nLiam dropped his phone onto the nightstand with a soft clink, exhaling deeply as the last call ended.\nHis face was still fixed in the polite smile he had worn for the past half hour, though now it melted into something of a grimace.\nThe Investor Relations department of the latest company whose shares he had received had just finished their courtesy call.\nIt had been the same as all the others before it: warm congratulations, polite probing questions about his intentions, carefully phrased suggestions about engaging their private client services.\nHe had also said the same thing which at this point seems to have become his rehearsed lines. He laughed at their carefully moderated jokes, and deflected their questions with the kind of bland professionalism that gave them nothing while leaving them satisfied enough to report \"positive engagement\" in their internal memos.\nIt was boring, monotonous, redictable, but necessary.\nLiam wasn’t naïve. These companies weren’t calling out of kindness. They were assessing him, testing him and probing the mind of the young man who had suddenly become one of their largest shareholders.\nThey wanted to know what kind of player he would be. A passive one? A compliant one? Or someone who would eventually push against them?\n\"Done for today,\" Liam muttered to himself, stretching his shoulders as he leaned back on the bed.\nThe thought should have relaxed him, but instead his mind immediately drifted to tomorrow.\nTomorrow wasn’t just another day. It was the first day his sign-ins would no longer be bound to Earth. Because from this point onward, he would be claiming rewards in the cultivation world or the magic world. And these rewards would be things that defied the natural order of Earth entirely.\nJust the thought of it sent a thrill through him.\nWhat would tomorrow bring?\nHis imagination was already painting wild possibilities when his phone buzzed again.\nHe frowned, glancing at the screen, and he smiled when he saw that it was a notification from the group chat.\nThe message was from Kristopher, tagging everyone.\nKristopher: Guys, reminder that our monthly meet-up coming soon. Time to start planning.\nLiam smiled when he saw this. He was immediately interested in the meet-up as it falls under his plan to develop himself.\nHe typed back quickly, replying to the message.\n\"Where are we hosting it this time?\"\nThe chat, which had been dormant for days, suddenly sprang to life as though Kristopher’s message had blown dust off old gears.\nKristopher: Haven’t decided yet. Waiting on everyone’s input first.\nHarper: What are we even celebrating this month?\nThe replies came in a wave, almost simultaneously.\nAll: Liam.\nLiam blinked at the screen, then burst out laughing. He sent back a shocked sticker, a cartoon character with wide eyes and flailing arms, capturing his mood perfectly.\nKristopher: Who else? I mean, look at you. A mansion, one-off car, yacht, chopper... the list is endless. We’ve never had the chance to properly celebrate any of it. This time, we will.\nLiam shook his head, still laughing softly. His fingers hovered over the keyboard for a moment as his smile turned more thoughtful.\nFriends.\nIt was only now that he realized how little he actually knew about them. He had been part of this group for over a month, chatting daily or whenever he could, joining calls, even laughing at their inside jokes. But when he thought about their lives, their families — he knew almost nothing.\nBefore they came along, his circle had been nonexistent as circumstances had made it that way. People came and went, most leaving scars rather than memories. But these people seemed different. At the very least, they had shown him nothing but positivity.\nAnd that was worth nurturing.\nHe made a decision as his thumb hovered over the screen. He made a decision get to know them better. And not just as casual acquaintances, but as people.\nThe conversation continued, shifting naturally to where the meet-up should be hosted. They all made suggestions — private villas, exclusive lounges, resort clubs. But the idea that gained momentum, unsurprisingly, was Liam’s yacht.\nMatt: Why not host it on your yacht? We’ve all been waiting to board it again.\nKristopher: Agreed. No better place. Besides, it’s poetic. We’re celebrating you; we should do it on your turf.\nLiam stared at the stream of agreement that followed, then chuckled, shaking his head.\nHe typed back: Fine. The yacht it is. A couple of days from now. I’ll handle the arrangements.\nThe group exploded with celebratory stickers and gifs. The decision was made. The meet-up would happen soon, and he would host.\nAn hour passed before the conversation shifted to casual chatter. They bombarded Liam with questions, complaining good-naturedly about how absent he had been online lately.\n\"Busy,\" he typed back with a smile.\nReally busy.\nAnd that wasn’t even a lie. A lot has happened during the week. It has been a whirlwind—sign-ins, system revelations, travels between worlds. He had lived a month’s worth of events in just a handful of days.\nHe was still trading messages when his phone rang again and it was a call from Daniel\n\"Daniel,\" He answered immediately.\n\"Mr Scott, I just wanted to give you an update. The raw materials will be arriving today and they will be stored in a warehouse close to the Nevada site.\"\nLiam nodded, even though Daniel couldn’t see him.\n\"Good. How soon until construction is complete?\"\n\"A week. Maybe less. But it won’t take more than a week,\" Daniel replied without hesitation.\n\"Perfect.You’ve been working hard,\" Liam said, in satisfaction.\nDaniel gave a short laugh when he heard this.\n\"Hard? Mr Scott, I should be thanking you. You’ve given me an opportunity most people only dream of. I won’t disappoint you.\"\n\"Don’t feel too pressured. You’re already doing great as you are,\" Liam replied warmly.\n\"Understood. I’ll keep you updated.\"\n\"Do that,\" Liam said, before they ended the call.\nWhen the line went silent, Liam lowered the phone slowly, with a satisfied smile on his face.\nPiece by piece, everything was falling into place. Not as quickly as he sometimes wished — patience had never been his strongest trait — but steady enough.\nAnd that was enough.\nHe stretched his arms over his head and let out a long breath, letting the tension roll out of him, before reaching for his phone again.\nHe scrolled through his contacts until he found the number he was looking for. He tapped it, held the device to his ear.Google seaʀᴄh Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\n\"I need to speak to the yacht’s kitchen staff....\"",

      "content": "Chapter 117: First Sign-in In Another Universe\nThe next morning.\nLiam’s eyes snapped open the moment the first sliver of sunlight slipped past the curtains. He immediately swung his legs off the bed, as his body moved on instinct, with his mind already buzzing with anticipation.\nToday wasn’t just another day. Today was the day.\nHe strode into the marble-lined bathroom of Bellemere Mansion and turned on the shower. And by the time he stepped out, toweling his hair dry, his heartbeat had already quickened.\nMinutes later, dressed in a clean set of clothes, he picked up his phone and the Gear Glass from the nightstand. He slipped the sleek device onto his face and Lucy’s voice greeted him almost instantly.\n\"Good morning, sir,\" she said.\n\"Morning, Lucy,\" Liam greeted back with a smile, as he adjusted the device against his temple.\n\"You seem... excited. Is there an occasion today?\" Lucy said, when she noticed how high the biological readings the device was feeding her was.\nLiam chuckled but didn’t answer. His excitement was impossible to hide, but explaining it wouldn’t make sense to her. Lucy doesn’t know about the system and he doesn’t have any plan of telling her about it. At least in the meantime.\nLiam inhaled deeply, then exhaled, forcing his emotions into calm order. His pulse immediately slowed and hhis mind steadied.\nOnly when he was certain his excitement was under control did he leave for the cultivation world.\n***\nGreat Yan Empire\nThe familiar comfort of Bellemere Mansion dissolved, replaced by the elegant jade-carved interior of his VIP suite in the inn.\nOutside the window, the world was draped in night. Stars glittered like scattered gems, and a silvery moon hung heavy above the plains.\n\"Night here, morning there. Almost like back on Earth,\" Liam smiled, taking in the contrast.\nHe quickly sat down on the silk-draped bed, and said the word he has been dying so much to say: \"System, sign-in.\"\nThis was followed by a wave of system messages.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, on your first sign-in in another universe.]\n[You received 10,000 Gold Coins.]\n[You received 20 Low-Grade Spirit Stones.]\n[You received a Top-Grade Spirit Rank Sword: Silverleaf.]\n[You received a Top-Grade Spirit Rank Protective Talisman.]\n[You received a Top-Grade Spirit Rank Offensive Talisman.]\n[Note: All items have been stored in the Dimensional Space.]\n***\nLiam’s lips parted slowly into a small smile. The smile stretched wider and wider until he chuckled aloud.\n\"Now that’s what I’m talking about.\"\nTen thousand gold coins. He didn’t even need to think about the system’s exchange rate as he knew it by heart: one gold coin equaled $1,000. That meant his reward alone translated to ten million dollars.\n\"10,000 gold coins... Not bad at all,\" he said to himself, with the bright sunny smile, still on his face.\nAccording to the little he knew about this world’s economy, gold coins, even though they are not as valuable as spirit stones, they are still worth a lot, as it’s highest domination of mortal currency. And since this is a mortal world, it’s extremely valuable too.\nWith ten gold coins, an ordinary family without a cultivator or anyone actively increasing their strength would be considered to be wealthy. The same level as having $1m back on Earth.\nThe timing of the gold coins reward couldn’t have been more perfect. He had almost exhausted Zhou’s \"generous appreciation gift\" of seven gold coins, whittled down to one gold and fifty silver. And now? His wealth in this world had exploded tenfold overnight.Follow current novels on NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nNo, it has exploded ten thousand fold overnight.\nCurious to see them for himself, Liam willed himself into the Dimensional Space.\nThe wasteland stretched around him, barren and endless, but he quickly focused his eyes on the obsidian table. And there, neatly arranged on one side, were his treasures.\nA gleaming pile of gold coins, stacked into small pyramids, their golden luster catching the monotone light of the space. Beside them, in a smaller pile, lay twenty cloudy stones that pulsed faintly with an inner shimmer.\nSpirit stone,\nLiam said, as he froze for a moment when he saw them.\nHis hands trembled slightly as he raised one with his telekinesis, watching as it floated toward him. It settled into his palm, heavier than it looked, cool against his skin.\nThe stone resembled cloudy quartz, its glow was faint but undeniable. With eagle-sharp vision, he could trace some hairline cracks along its surface, as though it were straining to contain the power sealed within.\n\"So this is it... the legendary spirit stone. The lifeblood of cultivation,\" he whispered.\nHe had read about them endlessly in novels. Spirit stones that cultivators used as currency, as energy sources, as cultivation fuel. They were worth far more than gold. Because gold could buy things, but spirit stones... they could buy power itself.\nHe closed his eyes, focusing on the energy & Qi — within the stone. With his enhanced senses, he could feel that there was something inside.\n\"I’d love to try absorbing it right now... But I don’t even know how. And even if I did, I don’t have a spirit root, or talent, or physique. No technique either,\" he muttered.\nIt was frustrating. Here was the key to cultivation resting in his palm, and he couldn’t even turn the lock. He sighed, shaking his head.\n\"One step at a time. If the system gave me this, it’ll give me the rest when the time’s right.\"\nHe placed the stone back onto the pile, then reached for the sword.\nThe blade was long and elegant, its body gleaming with a faint green hue, like a leaf shimmering in sunlight. The moment his fingers wrapped around the hilt, a system panel appeared.\n[Silverleaf: A sword that can cut through metal like metal.]\n\"Classic cliché. But a good one.\"Liam laughed.\nHe has read this description countless times. It was one of the most used clichè descriptions used in cultivation novels but it was also one of the welcomed clichès.\nHe swung the sword experimentally. The blade whispered through the air, so sharp it seemed to cut the silence itself. His grip adjusted automatically, his body moving with practiced familiarity.\nThanks to Eternal Realms, and the Formless Combat Doctrine skill, the weapon didn’t feel foreign. His footwork was balanced, his strikes fluid. Each motion felt natural, like an extension of himself.\n\"Perfect. Finally, a weapon worthy of this world,\" He said, as he lowered the sword with a satisfied nod.\nThis world’s artifacts, talisman, and formation ranking, starts from Spirit, Earth, Heaven and Immortal.\nAnd each rank is further divided into low, mid, high and top.\nThere’s also Mortal Rank but it’s often overlooked because items in that rank are no different from ordinary items.\nNext, Liam’s eyes drifted to the two yellow talismans laid side by side. Rectangular slips of paper, their surfaces etched with intricate runes.\nHe picked one up and instantly, another system message appeared.\n[Protective Talisman: Can create a barrier that can defend against the full-force attack of someone at the Late-Stage Foundation Establishment realm.]\n\"That’s... serious,\" He whistled softly.\nThe other talisman revealed its secret just as easily.\n[Offensive Talisman: Can unleash a sword attack equivalent to the full-force strike of someone at the Late-Stage Foundation Establishment realm.]\nLiam stared at the descriptions, his eyes narrowing in thought. He didn’t know exactly how his current strength compared to the realms of cultivators. Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment — these terms were still just words to him. But the fact that these talismans could contend with cultivators far above common mortals was more than enough reassurance.\n\"These two... they’re lifesavers,\" he muttered to himself.\nHe laid the talismans and sword back onto the table, casting a final look at the treasures and let out a long breath, satisfaction flooding his chest.\n\"Not bad at all, system. Not bad at all. Thank you.\"\nWith that, he willed himself back to Earth.\n***\nWarm morning sunlight filtered through the curtains again through the curtains of his bedroom.\nLiam stretched, rolling his shoulders as he smiled.\n\"Alright. Time to start the day. Breakfast should be ready soon.\"\nHe turned and made his way downstairs, with light footsteps.",

      "content": "Chapter 118: Floor 85, Central Park Tower\nLiam descended the grand staircase of Bellemere Mansion, with the clink of porcelain and the faint sound of conversation picked up by his enhanced senses, guiding him toward the dining room, where Evelyn and the girls had just finished setting the table.\n\"Good morning, sir,\" Evelyn greeted with her usual warm smile, stepping back to give him space. The maids echoed her, bowing lightly before resuming their tasks.\n\"Good morning, Evelyn. Good morning, girls,\" Liam returned the greetings with a smile, his eyes meeting theirs.\nEvelyn and the girls froze for a moment, their eyes widening in surprise.\nUntil now, he had always replied with a curt \"morning\" or, at best, \"morning, Evelyn.\" But today was different. His tone carried the same warmth as theirs, and the simple act of meeting their eyes left them oddly touched.\nThey couldn’t explain it, but it felt good in the sort of way an employee feels when their work is noticed, when their employer acknowledges them as more than background figures.\nAs if on cue, the three of them glanced at one another and smiled, quietly hopeful that maybe things really were changing.\nLiam had no of the ladies’ thoughts as he slipped into his seat at the head of the table. Before him was a spread fit for royalty—eggs folded delicately with herbs, freshly baked bread, sausages glistening faintly under the golden chandelier light, and a bowl of mixed fruits, their bright colors vivid against the fine china.\nHe didn’t rush himself as he picked up his fork and knife and began to eat. Each bite he took was slow as he allowed himself to savor the flavors, while his mind wandered elsewhere.\nWhat should I do today?\nThe thought rolled through him as easily as the taste of the food. At first, the obvious answer presented itself: check out the property in Manhattan — Floor 85 of the Central Park Tower — which was one of the prize of his last sign-in.The source of thɪs content is novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nHe had been itching to step foot inside the place ever since reading through its documents.\nBut almost immediately, another thought pushed against it. Logistically, going today wasn’t possible. Or at least, not convenient.\nIf he wanted to visit, he’d have to fly.\nPart of him wanted desperately to board his Flying Palace—the customized Airbus A380 sitting in Hangar 14, Imperial Terminal, South Side of Los Angeles International Airport.\nThe sheer idea of soaring across continents in that monstrous floating estate was intoxicating. But that was something to be unveiled after the Family Office was set up.\nAnd if not his jet? He could always charter one. But that meant calling Daniel, and Daniel was already up to his neck handling the recruitment of staff and structuring the Family Office. Asking him to start sorting through private charter companies would only pile more on his plate.\nNo. He would wait. The property and the island could wait.\nOr... could they?\nHalfway through his meal, his fork paused mid-air as a sudden realization struck him.\nWhy am I thinking like a normal person? I don’t even need a plane anymore.\nThe Dimensional Space had something like a teleportation function. With it, all he just need to do was visualise the place in his head and he can teleported himself there from the space. But he wasn’t sure if it would work. Though he has tried it with the penthouse.\nBut that had been different. He had lived in that penthouse for a week. But as for the Manhattan property? He hadn’t even stepped foot inside. He only had pictures.\nWould the function still work?\nCurious and cautious, Liam decided to test it the smart way.\nSystem, can I teleport to a place by just looking at the picture?\n[Yes, Host. As long as the image matches the location in your mind, you can teleport there from the Dimensional Space.]\nLiam’s eyes narrowed, and then a grin spread across his face. That was the answer he wanted, as it pretty much solve the flight issue.\nHe even thought of taking it further. With the function, he can simply travel to anywhere in the world.\nThe possibilities tumbled into his head. He could teleport across countries, even continents, in a blink. Passport checks, visas, customs would be irrelevant.\nAll he needed was for Lucy to get into the proper databases, and the molecular assembler to produce flawless documents. And on paper, he would be as legitimate as any diplomat.\nHe chuckled softly at the thought. It was almost comical. With the system, Lucy, and his own cunning, he had the makings of a criminal mastermind. If he wanted, he could play puppet master behind the world’s systems, moving unseen.\nHe thought about this and couldn’t hold himself back, as he even let out a dramatic villain laugh internally.\nI am the dark knight,\nhe mocked himself.\nLiam continued eating his breakfast and when he finished, he set his utensils down neatly and thanked Evelyn and the girls, with a genuinely warm tone.\nThey curtsied in return, smiles lighting their faces at the acknowledgment.\nLiam smiled back, as he rose and returned upstairs.\nInside his bedroom, he shut the door and exhaled once, steadying himself, then took a single step forward, vanishing instantly into the Dimensional Space.\n***\nStanding in the Dimensional Space, Liam closed his eyes and summoned an image into his mind: the glossy photographs from the property documents. Floor 85, Central Park Tower.\nHe visualized the endless glass walls, the panoramic view of Central Park, the gleam of marble under the sunlight.\nAnd then he willed himself forward.\nThe wasteland dissolved and when his vision cleared, a flood of sunlight blinded him for a moment.\nHe blinked, raising a hand against the brilliance. And when his eyes adjusted, he found himself standing in a palace of glass suspended above Manhattan.\nThe sprawling skyview stretched endlessly before him, with Central Park to the north, the steel forest of the skyline to the south, and the Hudson River glinting like liquid silver in the distance.\n\"I’m here,\" he said, as a satisfied smile spread across his face\nHe turned, taking in the interior with wide, calculating eyes. Everything was exactly as the documents had shown him. But the was that reality was richer and sharper.\nThe hand-carved marble floors gleamed under the light. Sculpted wood paneling lined the walls with subtle elegance. Crystal chandeliers dangled above like constellations, scattering refracted light across the room.\nHe stepped forward, the sound of his shoes echoing faintly across the cavernous space.\nAnd as much as he had already admired it in photographs, nothing could compare to the sensation of standing here. The sheer scale of it. The luxury seeping from every surface.\nThe smile on his face spread even more as he began his tour.\nRoom by room, his awe deepened. The oversized master suite with dual walk-in closets that could have been boutiques in their own right. Dual master baths clad in Italian marble.\nFive additional en-suite bedrooms, each designed with unique touches—gold trimmings in one, soft lavender tones in another. A massive living and dining area wide enough to host entire banquets.\nThe chef’s kitchen that gleamed with stainless steel counters and imported appliances. A private gym stood ready with polished floors and state-of-the-art machines. There was even a study lined with shelves, waiting to be filled, and a luxurious lounge too.\nAnd, tucked away discreetly, was the staff quarters.\nLiam paused in the center of the living room, gazing around with folded arms. He felt that the place, while not as big as Bellemere Mansion, was worth every cent of its $150 million tag.\nBut now came the real question. What to do with it?\nRenting it out was the obvious choice. The whole place was nothing less than a single-floor sprawl of extreme luxury. Any billionaire or hedge fund mogul would pay insane sums to live here, even temporarily. It could be a revenue-generating powerhouse.\nBut as he stood there, watching the Manhattan skyline glow under the sunlight, Liam felt hesitation.\nHe didn’t need the money. Not anymore. And somehow, renting this out to strangers felt... wrong.\nHe had Bellemere Mansion and also the penthouse suite that’s currently collecting dust as it is, yes, but this place wasn’t redundant.\nThis place was something else. It’s a fortress in the clouds.\nI’ll keep it.\nThe thought solidified in his mind. For now, he wouldn’t rent it. He’d hold onto it. Maybe in the future, when he needed it, it would be waiting for him.\nSatisfied, he finished his tour and exhaled, turning back toward the sunlight spilling through the glass.\n\"Now... next stop.\"\nHe thought of the second reward property—the ghost island, San Caerola Key.\nHe instantly left the apartment and returning to the Dimensional Space.",

      "content": "Chapter 119: San Caerola Key\nAfter visualizing the image of the private island in his mind and filling his thoughts with the intent of teleporting there, Liam felt the familiar shift of space and he found himself here.\nA gust of cool salt-kissed air rushed against his skin. He turned slowly, taking in the sight before him, and he could only marvel at nature’s undeniable beauty.\nHe was standing at the beach. And the sand beneath his shoes was pristine, fine, and white as powdered sugar, stretching endlessly on both sides.\nBefore him, the ocean spread like a living jewel, its crystalline turquoise waves lapping gently against the shore. Each crest sparkled in the sunlight, throwing shards of silver-blue light into the air. Coconut palms leaned toward the beach, their green crowns swaying lazily in rhythm with the breeze.\nLiam inhaled deeply. The smell of the ocean, rich and briny, was nothing short of intoxicating. This was clean, pure, raw. The air carried hints of tropical flowers, the earthy undertone of greenery, and the faint resinous scent of palms baking under the sun.\nHe has heard about the Carribeans and beautiful it is, and he has also seen a couple of pictures, and videos of it online. But none of them captured this.\nNo image could replicate the way the breeze cooled his skin. No screen could carry the sound of distant gulls blending with the steady rhythm of the sea. And no video could replace the sight of the horizon glowing under a dome of the cloudless blue sky.\nLiam couldn’t help but smile, as a deeps sense of satisfaction welled up inside him and he thanked himself for making the decision to come here.\nStanding on the beach, he wanted nothing more desperately than to take off his shoes and sink his bare feet into the sand, to feel the grains between his toes and let the ocean wash over them.\nThe temptation was strong, but he held back.\nHe knew himself. If he indulged now, leaving would be difficult. And he wasn’t here for leisure. He was here to inspect the prize, to see for himself what the system had placed into his hands.\nWith a final glance at the waves, Liam turned and walked inland.\nThe trails stretched ahead, surprisingly neat. Leaves crunched softly beneath his steps, but the path itself looked as if it had been taken care of recently. Moss trimmed, undergrowth cut back, even the stones along the sides seemed placed with intention. It puzzled him for a moment.\nHad someone been here?\nHe couldn’t help but ask himself internally, but he doubted it as the documents claimed the island was abandoned.\nThe system probably had people work on the island.\nAs he walked deeper, the island unfolded around him.\nAccording to the files, San Caerola Key sits in the Caribbean Sea, southeast of the Bahamas and north of the Dominican Republic. Roughly twelve square miles, compact enough to feel private yet large enough to support villages, forests, and beaches.\nFrom above, it was shaped like a fat crescent moon, its arms cradling two natural bays like open hands.\nThe first side of the crescent offered calm, postcard-perfect beaches, like the one he had arrived at. But the opposite side faced the open sea. There, the waters slammed against jagged black volcanic cliffs, sending spray dozens of feet into the air.\nIn the center of the island, a rugged spine of hills rose nearly five hundred feet above sea level, their slopes dressed in thick greenery. The ridge stretched the length of the island like a backbone, commanding a view of both bays.\nAs Liam followed the trail upward, he glimpsed the first of many limestone caves dotting the island. He knew from the documents that many opened into underwater caverns—hauntingly beautiful formations sculpted by time, some large enough for boats to slip into.\nHe pressed on, reaching a vantage point where the forest thinned. From here, the view struck him silent.\nThe southern curve of the crescent held a lagoon, brackish and serene, ringed by mangroves that tangled together like a fortress wall of roots, and whhite birds wheeled above it.\nAt the lagoon’s edge, he noticed clusters of banana trees, their broad leaves fanning out, heavy with fruit.\nLiam paused and considered what he could do with that part of the island. The lagoon could support aquaculture, fish farms, shrimp beds, or even a protected water reservoir.\nThe island was not only beautiful, it was alive with potential.\nThe climate was tropical, warm year-round, yet comfortable thanks to the steady trade winds. Rain would come from May to October, drenching the land, but the winds would keep the air fresh.\nThe island has freshwater with excellent water quality, thanks to the natural spring that flows from the central ridge, feeding into the lagoon.\nThe island’s fauna is extremely rich as it has fruit-bearing plants growing wild, medicinal herbs that clings to shaded slopes, Iguanas basking on sun-warmed rocks and exotic birds flitted through the canopy. The sea promised fish, lobsters, and coral reefs. At night, the documents said, fruit bats swooped across the skies in black waves.\nBut the island was not without dangers.\nThe cliffs were home to territorial seabirds. The caves sometimes harbored colonies of venomous snakes and scorpions. Enough to keep careless visitors away.\nFor Liam, however, these posed no threat. It wasn’t that the animals were loyal but his current strength placed him above such dangers.\nHe continued onward, deeper into the island’s heart. The island has a bit of history as Spain had once laid claim to San Caerola, though storms and distance forced them to abandon it. Centuries passed and later, in the 1970s, a wealthy Cuban exile purchased it, but political trouble dragged him away, and the island fell silent again.\nSince then, it had languished in bureaucratic shadows, forgotten, unclaimed, until the system had delivered it into Liam’s hands.\nLiam crested a hill and stopped, and he saw a five-kilometer airstrip stretched across a plateau, fully paved and high quality. It also looks like it was newly built. And behind it was the luxurious villa, and staff quarters.\nThe villa stood tall, a luxurious estate of white stone and red tiles. Wide balconies overlooked the sea. Floor-to-ceiling windows caught the sunlight. Paths wound down to staff quarters tucked discreetly into the hillside.\nAs Liam finished his tour, he couldn’t help but feel that there was a lot more to the island than meets the eye.\nHe was also already thinking of setting it up as a cultivation heaven on earth, but the idea quickly died just as fast as it popped up.\nHe decided to shift his thoughts by thinking of where next to go or what go do, as he doesn’t want to stay inside today.\nStill having no idea what to do or where to go, he looked around one more time, before he vanished from the island and returned fo the space.",

      "content": "Chapter 120: Outing (Bonus Chapter 1/5)\nLiam appeared in his room and collapsed on his bed. He picked up his phone to check the time and he saw that he had spent almost half the day, checking out the property and the island.\nHe smiled to himself at how much enjoyable it was. Exploring the Manhattan property and San Caerola Key had been worth every second.\nAnd now, here he was, back in his room, wondering what to do with the rest of his day.\nA hundred ideas rushed into his head all at once.\nA lot for ideas of what to do filled his head, racing on race track, teleporting to Mount Everest or Antarctica, the Sahara, or other extreme parts in the world. He also has an idea of visiting Japan to see the place for himself. He could also go to Dubai, Monaco, Dubai, Qatar, Paris, London. There were so much ideas that it felt overwhelming.\nBut something about those ideas felt hollow. The truth was simple was that Liam didn’t want to do any of them alone.\nFor a man who could do anything, go anywhere, his old habits still clung stubbornly to him.Follow current novᴇls on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nHe let out a long and heavy sigh, almost frustrated with himself. And he decided not to sink into it this time.\nUnlocking his phone, he tapped into the group chat. His fingers hovered for a second, then typed:\n\"Guys, anyone free? I’m bored to hell right here.\"\nThe message sent.\nIt didn’t take long for a reply and his phone buzzed. It was from Matt.\n\"You’re bored? How’s that even possible?\"\nLiam smiled wryly at the message. He could already picture Matt’s face when he typed that, full of disbelief.\nAfter all, how could someone like Liam, the owner of Bellemere Mansion and more than enough wealth, be bored? Also, Liam has a yacht which he could vanish to at any time, escaping to have fun.\nBut Liam’s reality was different.\n\"It just happens I’ve got nothing exciting to do,\" he replied.\nMatt’s response came instantly, as if he had been waiting for it.\n\"I get that. Actually, I can help.\"\n\"Oh? How?\" Liam raised a brow, amused and curious at the same time.\nAnother message popped up:\n\"I’m meeting some friends tonight. It would be huge for me if you came along. Honestly, I just want to brag to them that I know you.\"\nLiam burst out laughing, the sound echoing in his quiet room. He could see Matt grinning mischievously as he typed that. For a second, Liam thought about saying no. But then he paused.\nWhy not?\nIt wasn’t like he had plans. And the truth was that he didn’t mind. Not at all. He will just treat it as something casual to help him get out of his shell. It will be a chance for him to finally start loosening up.\n\"Fine. When and where?\" he typed.\nOver at Matt’s place, Matt’s face lit up when he read the reply. He was about to reply and say that he will come to Liam’s place, so that they can go together, but he quickly stopped himself. He had a better idea.\n\"Actually, come to my place. We’ll go together.\"\nLiam read it and shrugged. That was fine.\n\"No problem. I’ll bring my car. Pick you up and drop you back when we’re done.\"\n\"Perfect. Thanks, man. I’ll send my address. Early evening, by 4:30,\" Matt replied.\nHe couldn’t stop smiling.\nThe details came through. Liam sent back a thumbs up and said that he will meet him there, before he tossed his phone aside.\nHe rose from the bed and walked to the intercom panel near the door. Pressing the button, he spoke calmly:\n\"Evelyn, please let Mason know we’ll be taking the Rolls Royce out this evening.\"\nEvelyn’s voice came back instantly, \"Understood, sir.\"\nSatisfied, Liam returned to his bed and dropped onto it again. The day stretched ahead, long and idle. He thought about entering the cultivation world for a while, but there wasn’t much for him to do there at the moment. Instead, he decided to play Eternal Realms.\n***\nTime flowed like a stream.\nThe sun shifted across the sky, and before long the golden hue of evening spilled through his windows. Liam stopped the game, stretched, and headed for the shower.\nSteam filled the bathroom as he stood beneath the cascade of hot water, letting it wash away the hours of stillness.\nWhen he stepped out, he felt refreshed and sharper. He dried himself and pulled on a fresh set of clothes. And on his wrist, he clasped the one-off Vacheron Constantin watch he had received from one of his daily sign-ins during his trip to Geneva.\nThe timepiece was beautiful and elegant no matter how many times he’s seen it\nHe checked himself once in the mirror, adjusted his collar, and left the room.\nDownstairs, Mason was already waiting near the front door. Tall, steady, dressed in the crisp uniform of his station.\nHe gave a respectful nod and greeted when he saw Liam.\n\"Evening, sir.\"\n\"Evening, Mason,\" Liam replied, with a warm tone.\nLiam’s warm response surprised Mason for the briefest moment but he didn’t show his surprise.\nHe stepped forward and opened the door. Outside, parked by the steps, was the Rolls Royce Ghost Black Badge.\nJust as Liam was about to step out, he heard Evelyn call from behind.\n\"Sir, should we prepare dinner?\"\nShe asked it carefully because she didn’t know how long he would be gone, or if he’d want food waiting on his return.\nLiam thought for a moment, then turned to her with a small smile. \"No need, Evelyn. I’ll likely be back late.\"\nShe nodded, accepting his answer with a soft bow.\nLiam stepped outside and the evening air was cool, carrying the faint scent of jasmine from the gardens, caressed him. Mason opened the rear door for him, and he slid into the plush leather seat.\nInside, Nick was at the wheel. He turned slightly, greeting, \"Good evening, sir.\"\n\"Good evening, Nick,\" Liam returned with the same enthusiasm he had shown Mason.\nNick raised a brow faintly, though he kept his focus on the road ahead. Like Mason, he noted the shift in Liam’s tone.\nMason settled into the passenger seat, and Nick started the engine. The Rolls Royce purred softly and Nick guided it down the driveway, through the wrought-iron gates of Bellemere Mansion, and out onto the streets of Holmby Hills.\nThe world outside moved past in shades of gold and amber as the sun sank lower and Liam leaned back, watching through the tinted windows.",

      "content": "Chapter 121: Matt’s Mom (Bonus Chapter 2/5)\nThe Rolls Royce slowed to a stop at the curb, its engine purring softly before cutting off. Through the tinted glass, Liam studied the house before him.\nThe house in front of him, though not as huge as Bellemere Mansion or located in Holmby Hills, wasn’t any less magnificent. Elegant stonework climbed its façade, warm light spilled from tall windows, and trimmed hedges flanked a wide driveway.\nSo this is Matt’s family place\n, Liam thought.\nNow I see where Stacy’s friends get their confidence. They’ve grown up in homes like this.\nLiam stopped admiring the house and reached for his phone to let Matt know he had arrived. Before he could type, a notification buzzed in, a message from Matt,\n\"I’m not quite ready yet. Can you come in for a bit while I finish up?\"\nLiam smiled at the message and replied, \"No worries, I’ll wait here.\"\nFrom what he could see, this was very much Matt’s family residence. If he went inside, he’d almost certainly meet Matt’s parents and siblings.\nLiam had promised himself to work on his social skills, to step out of his shell, but... family introductions? That felt a step too far, too soon.\nA second buzz came almost immediately.\nMatt: \"Absolutely not. My mom will kill me if she finds out I left you sitting in the car. Get in here, man.\"\nLiam exhaled slowly and shook his head. He could already picture Matt’s stubborn expression on the other end of that message. He had no doubt his friend meant it. Matt wasn’t going to let this go.\nAnother sigh escaped his lips, but it turned into a low chuckle.\nFine\n, he thought.\nMaybe this is what I need. More interactions, not less. And meeting families is part of knowing people personally. It can’t hurt.\nHe typed a short reply, \"Alright. Coming in.\"\n***\nInside the house, Matt’s face lit up when he saw the message. He had been pacing nervously, already dressed, but stalling.\nTruthfully, he could have been ready twenty minutes ago. He hadn’t delayed because of himself but because of his family.\nHis mother and younger sister had begged him to let Liam come in. They’d read about him in online articles and magazines, talked about him at dinner, and they were endlessly curious about the boy who somehow lived like a phantom billionaire in Los Angeles.\nEvery time Matt was asked, he painted Liam as he truly saw him: mysterious, elusive, larger-than-life. A friend, yes, but one who was still hard to pin down.\nNow, the chance to meet him was literally at their doorstep. His mom had all but insisted. His sister had nearly dragged him by the arm. So, guilty though he felt, Matt had delayed on purpose.\n\"Five minutes,\" he muttered to himself, trying not to imagine Liam walking into chaos.\nMatt sighed heavily, hoping that Liam won’t be offended by this. He felt bad about doing something like this, about lying to someone he consider his friend.\nHe really wish he could come out and just tell Liam directly, but he has no idea how Liam will take it.\n***\nOutside, the car doors clicked open. Mason and Nick both turned back in surprise as Liam stepped out. Instinctively, they reached for their handles to follow, but Liam raised a hand to stop them.\n\"Not this time,\" he said calmly.\nBringing guards into someone’s home wouldn’t seem appropriate and Liam doesn’t want to leave a bad impression\nThe two exchanged a glance, then nodded silently.Thɪs\nLiam adjusted his jacket, smoothed the cuff at his wrist, and walked toward the front door. The evening air carried a faint hint of roses from the garden beds, mixing with the sharper scent of freshly cut grass. He rang the bell once.\nThe door swung open almost immediately. A girl of about sixteen stood there, bright-eyed, her smile lighting up her whole face.\n\"You must be Liam. Please, come in,\" she said quickly, almost too quickly.\nHer excitement was genuine, and it caught Liam slightly off guard. He gave her a polite nod. \"Thank you.\"\nStepping inside, he allowed his senses to stretch out just a little. This was an involuntary action of his and something he does when he’s in an unfamiliar place.\nThe girl led him into the living room. There, on a cream sofa, sat a woman who bore such an uncanny resemblance to her that it was impossible to mistake her identity. Matt’s mother rose halfway before gesturing warmly for Liam to sit.\n\"Please, take a seat.\"\nLiam inclined his head and sat opposite her.\n\"Good evening,\" he greeted, his tone respectful but carrying a hint of warmth.\nShe returned the smile. \"Good evening, Liam. Forgive Matt for keeping you waiting. That boy...\" She shook her head, sighing.\n\"It’s no trouble at all,\" Liam assured her.\nHer eyes studied him for a long moment. Finally she spoke, with a soft voice laced with curiosity. \"It’s good to finally meet you. Matt speaks of you often.\"\nLiam smiled and said,\"It’s good to finally meet his mother as well.\"\nAnd he added immediately, \"I have to say — you look far too young. For a moment, I thought you were Matt’s older sister.\"\nHe didn’t mean it seriously. He’d learned long ago that women enjoyed such compliments, and he gave it freely without ulterior motive. But he hadn’t expected the spark that lit in her eyes.\nMatt’s mom was the playful type. And Liam’s sharp suit, easy manners, and striking looks only made it worse. She leaned back, with a mischievous smile playing on her lips.\nHer daughter noticed immediately and panic crossed her face.\n\"Um, excuse me,\" she blurted, before darting upstairs. She knew her mother’s habits too well. Better to warn Matt than watch her mom tease their guest into awkwardness.\nDownstairs, her mother chuckled softly. \"I’ve read about you, Liam. I’ve seen the headlines. But I still find it hard to believe you’re only eighteen.\"\nLiam met her gaze steadily, with the smile never leaving his face. He knew that a lot of people were curious about this. They always wanted to understand. But the truth was that his system had given him everything and that was not something he could share.\nSo he just said lightly, \"People often react that way. I’m used to it.\"\nMatt’s mom’s eyes softened when she heard that and she said,\"It must be difficult. That much attention, at your age.\"\n\"It comes with its own challenges,\" Liam replied with a small shrug.\n\"Matt’s a good boy. I hope you two continue to be close friends. He admires you more than he’ll admit.\" Matt’s mom said with a warm smile.\n\"He’s been a good friend to me too,\" Liamn said, with a warm expression.\nAt that moment, the hurried footsteps came pounding down the stairs. Matt appeared, his face tight with expectation, bracing himself for whatever absurd thing his mother might have said. But when he reached the living room, he froze.\nLiam was smiling and his mother looked perfectly at ease. The air wasn’t awkward at all. Relief washed over him so strongly that he almost sagged.\n\"Ready,\" Matt said quickly, straightening. \"We should get going.\"\nLiam nodded and rose. \"Of course.\"\nThey walked toward the door. Matt opened it for him, and Liam stepped outside into the cooling evening. Before following, Matt glanced back at his mother and she was grinning, clearly amused.\nHe narrowed his eyes at her, mouthing silently: Behave.\nHer laugh followed him out.\nOnce outside, Matt quickened his pace to catch up with Liam. \"Hey... sorry if my mom said anything weird. She likes to mess around sometimes.\"\nLiam glanced at him and smiled. \"She didn’t. She was gracious. You don’t need to worry.\"\nMatt exhaled, visibly relieved. \"Good. Let’s go.\"\nThey approached the Rolls Royce, where Mason and Nick waited by the doors. The two guards bowed slightly in greeting, then opened the car. Liam slid inside smoothly, Matt following right after.",

      "content": "Chapter 122: The Party (Bonus Chapter 3/5)\nMatt had been talking nonstop since they left his house. He was animated, his voice carrying a mix of excitement and nervous anticipation.\n\"It’s not just any party, Liam,\" he said, leaning slightly forward in his seat as if to emphasize the point. \"It’s a graduation celebration, but the kind you don’t forget. Private house, private guest list. You’ll see everyone there — UCLA grads, a handful from Harvard, kids of CEOs, heirs, socialites. Some you’ll recognize and others, you’ll wish you didn’t.\"\nLiam arched a brow and smirked. \"Sounds like a zoo.\"\nMatt laughed. \"Not far from it. The atmosphere’s casual on the surface, but underneath? Everyone’s sizing everyone else up. Some try too hard to act like they don’t care, others get wild — drinking, making scenes, trying to outshine one another. It’s competitive energy, but fun competitive. Within moderation.\"\n\"Within moderation?\" Liam asked, amused.\n\"Yeah. Nobody wants their family’s name dragged through mud the next morning. So you get people pushing the line, but rarely crossing it. Expensive champagne, loud music, luxury cars stacked up outside. You’ll see what I mean when we get there.\"\n\"You sound like you’ve been to plenty,\" Liam said, studying him.\nMatt shrugged with a crooked grin, as he replied, \"I’ve been dragged into a few. It’s less about wanting to go and more about... survival. These are the circles we’re expected to swim in. Everyone’s just trying to blow off steam before reality slams down. After tonight, most of them will be handed off to internships, firms, or whatever dynasties their families run. For a lot of people, this is the last night they can pretend to be free.\"\nLiam nodded in understanding when he heard this. He was already aware of how constrained kids from wealthy and affluent families are. Especially with the expectations on them and the immense pressure to succeed and surpass their parents. Though he can’t relate to that, but he understands how overwhelming the pressure to succeed is, because he had been facing it until a month ago.\nNow, though, the system had lifted him to a different plane. Still, he couldn’t help but feel a bit of empathy for these kids.\nLiam was actually looking forward to the party. It will be his first actual party and he was curious to see how it will go, though he was aware that he was going to be in for one hell of a ride.\n***\nThe Rolls Royce Ghost Black Badge slowed to a crawl, turning into a wide driveway lit by golden lamps. The rumble of engines and the flash of headlights spilled across the front lawn where cars were lined up in perfect rows.\nNick eased the Ghost to a stop, the car purring before falling into silence.\nLiam glanced through the tinted glass. He could already tell this wasn’t an ordinary \"house party.\"\nLuxury vehicles stretched as far as he could see—Ferraris in crimson, a Bentleys, Bugatti, Maserati, McLaren, Aston Martin, Lamborghinis...\nThe place didn’t look like a driveway anymore but a showroom.\nMason moved to open the door, but Matt was already halfway out, grinning as he turned back. \"Come on, let’s make an entrance.\"\nLiam followed, stepping onto the stone-paved drive. The night air was filled with the bass coming from inside the mansion. The scent of expensive cologne, perfume, and faint traces of cigar smoke hung over the crowd milling about near the entrance.\nMason hovered for a moment, about to get out of the car but Liam raised a hand.\n\"Not this time.\"\nHis voice was firm but not unkind. Bringing guards inside someone else’s home and to a party would look like arrogance, and Liam didn’t want that reputation.\nMason inclined his head, stepping back into the shadows near the car.\nLiam adjusted his jacket and glanced around. Already, he felt eyes on him. Groups of students clustered near the lawn, drinks in hand, with their laughter cutting through the music.\nMore than a few paused mid-sentence, watching him and Matt. Their expressions flickered between curiosity and calculation.\nWho’s he? he could almost hear them whisper. Which family? What’s he driving?\nLiam’s senses stretched further without conscious thought. Even with the music and chatter, he could hear fragments.\n\"...that’s the Ghost, right? Rolls Royce Ghost Black Badge. No way Matt’s driving that.\"\n\"...never seen him before... is he from New York?\"\n\"His family must be extremely wealthy to be able to allow him to bring such a car here.\"\nLiam smiled to himself and said nothing.\n\"Ignore them. They’ll gossip no matter what,\" Matt said, as he patted his shoulder.\nThey started walking toward the entrance. Just as they reached the steps, the door opened and a girl stepped out.\nShe smiled as she passed them, but then her eyes widened. She froze, staring at Liam as if she’d just seen a headline step out of her phone. Before either of them could react, she spun on her heel and planted herself directly in front of them.\nLiam and Matt both stopped, surprised.\nHer gaze fixed on Liam, searching his face. \"Wait—are you him? The Liam everyone’s been talking about lately? Bellemere Mansion Liam? The one with the McLaren P1 LM variant?\"\nMatt choked back a laugh when heard this, with a grin spreading across his face. Liam turned his head and gave him a long, flat look. Matt only shrugged, clearly enjoying himself.\nLiam exhaled quietly and nodded.\nThe girl’s face lit up immediately.\n\"Unbelievable. I’ve always wanted to meet you!\" She thrust out her hand eagerly. \"I’m Sara. I run a digital platform—articles, profiles, opinion pieces. We’ve written about you, actually. If you’d ever consider letting me interview you...\"\nLiam shook his head almost instantly. \"No interviews.\"\nHer enthusiasm faltered, but she caught herself and smiled again. \"Fair enough. Worth a try. Sorry for stopping you—please, enjoy the party.\"\nShe stepped aside, and Liam and Matt continued forward. But the damage was done. Behind them, voices rippled like sparks catching fire.\n\"...that was him? Seriously?\"\n\"No way, that’s Bellemere Mansion guy? At this party?\"\n\"...did you see his watch? That’s seven figures easy.\"\n\"...forget the cars, forget the house—that face alone could fund a brand deal.\"\nInside, Liam could even hear his own name whispered among girls clustered near the hallway, giggling and whispering like schoolchildren.\nMatt leaned closer, smirking. \"Your popularity’s getting out of hand.\"\nLiam shook his head, smiling wryly. \"Don’t start.\"\nThey passed through the entryway and into the mansion proper. The sight that greeted them made Liam pause.\n**\"\nThe living room had been transformed into a glowing arena of youth and wealth.\nChandeliers sparkled overhead, their light refracting against glass and polished marble. A DJ booth in the corner throbbed with bass, electronic beats pulsing across the space.\nExpensive champagne bottles gleamed in ice buckets, their golden labels catching the light. Waitstaff moved between groups with trays of glasses, weaving through the shifting tide of conversation and laughter.\nClusters of students lounged on designer sofas, while others danced near the open patio doors that spilled onto a garden lit with fairy lights. Beyond the glass, Liam could see more cars parked along the private road, their silhouettes sharp against the night.\nThe air was thick with perfume, alcohol, and the raw energy of a hundred young adults celebrating as though tomorrow didn’t exist.\nLiam let his eyes wander, quietly taking it all in. The luxury was familiar, but the energy was new. This was his first real party, and it was every bit the spectacle Matt had promised.\nMatt grinned beside him, clearly in his element. \"Welcome to the jungle.\"\n\"One hell of a jungle,\" Liam said, with the corner of his mouth curving up in amusement.",

      "content": "Chapter 123: The Jungle (Bonus Chapter 4/5)\nMatt and Liam moved steadily through the lively party, the sound of the bass rolling like distant thunder beneath the chatter.\nMatt walked a half step ahead, weaving through clusters of people with ease, calling out names and clasping hands. He introduced Liam casually whenever someone in his inner circle came close enough.\n\"Hey, this is Liam,\" Matt said to a group of three guys standing near the bar, their ties already loose, their faces flushed with drink.\nFor a moment, the guys looked confused — until one of them blinked twice and his mouth fell open.\n\"Wait... the Liam?\"\nLiam gave a polite nod.\n\"You’re kidding me,\" another said, his tone a mix of awe and disbelief. \"The one with the P1 LM variant? And the mansion?\"\nThe third guy swore under his breath, then laughed as though the punchline of some cosmic joke had just landed in front of him. All three scrambled to shake his hand, their smiles tight but genuine.\n\"Welcome, man. Enjoy yourself,\" one said. \"Seriously. Tonight’s about fun.\"\nThey didn’t dare ask questions, though Liam could feel the weight of their curiosity pressing in. It was written all over their eyes. But they held back — even in this jungle, they knew when to keep their mouths shut.\nMatt only grinned, satisfied with the reaction, and tugged Liam along before the conversation could stick too long.\nAs they moved deeper, Liam could feel more stares. Some were subtle, while some were blatant. Recognition spread in hushed voices and sidelong glances.\n\"Wait, that’s him—\"\n\"—guy from Bellemere—\"\nIt rolled across the crowd like a slow-burning fire.\nMatt leaned closer and muttered with a mischievous grin, \"See? Told you. You’re basically a celebrity in these circles.\"\nLiam smirked but said nothing.\nAfter a few more introductions, Matt slowed. \"Alright, let me grab us drinks before someone kidnaps you with a thousand questions.\"\nLiam lifted a brow and said, \"Don’t take too long.\"\n\"Relax. Nobody’s gonna devour you here,\" Matt teased, backing away. \"Try and, you know, look like you’re having fun. Or you’ll grow up to be a grumpy old man.\"\nLiam chuckled despite himself, shaking his head as Matt disappeared into the crowd. He turned slowly, letting his eyes sweep across the sea of bodies. Music, perfume, laughter, flashing lights.\n\"All these fucking people...,\" He muttered under his breath.\nThat was his bad habit talking. The old part of him that disliked crowds was trying to claw its way back. He forced a quiet breath, steadying himself.\nNot in the mood to dance and not being much of a dancer himself, he decided to take a seat and wait for Matt.\nSpotting a couch against the far wall, he approached it, but his steps faltered when he saw the two girls seated on the couch, locked together in a tangle of lips and hands, oblivious to the room around them.\nLiam blinked, caught off guard and a disbelieving scoff left his mouth, \"It really is a jungle.\"\nHe turned away, scanning again until he saw another couch a short distance away. This one faced the opposite direction, half-hidden from the dance floor. Three girls sat there, chatting and laughing.\nGood enough\n.He walked over and when he reached them, he inclined his head and politely asked, \"Mind if I sit?\"\nThe reaction was immediate. All three turned at once, eyes widening. They lit up like he had just dropped out of a movie screen. Without hesitation, they shuffled aside, clearing a space in the middle.\n\"Thanks,\" he said, with a wry smile as he slid into the gap.\nSo much for keeping a low profile\n.\nNo sooner had he sat than the questions started.\n\"Why’re you sitting all alone?\" one asked, her tone playful but laced with curiosity.\nLiam could see right through it. He knew exactly where this was going. Still, he smiled as he glanced at each of them in turn. \"Maybe because I was meant to keep you three company.\"\nThe girls burst into soft laughter. They weren’t used to men meeting them on equal footing. Most guys usually stumbled, as they tried too hard. Liam’s effortless calm was something else entirely.\nOne of them, a brunette with sharp eyes, leaned closer, the edge of her perfume drifting with her. \"And how exactly do you plan to keep us company?\"\nThe other two perked up, watching him expectantly.\nLiam tilted his head, meeting her gaze without flinching. \"That depends. How do you want me to?\"\nHer lips parted in surprise, and she bit down gently, caught off guard by the reversal.\n\"God,\" the first girl teased, elbowing her friend. \"Look at you, about to melt. Careful — she probably just wet herself.\"\nThe target of the jab gasped, her cheeks flushing. The third girl laughed, covering her mouth, eyes darting between Liam and her blushing friend.\nAnd just like that, the energy shifted. One of them leaned in with a look that could devour, while the others egged her on.\nLiam sighed inwardly. This wasn’t his scene. He wasn’t afraid of their forwardness, but meaningless flings weren’t his style. For him, intimacy was tied to emotional connection, not quick indulgence.\nHe leaned back slightly, silently praying Matt would hurry.\nAs if the universe had heard him, Matt’s voice rang out. \"Well, well, look at you, Mr. Smooth.\"\nLiam turned his head with relief as Matt appeared, two glasses in hand. His friend’s grin was broad, his eyes dancing with mischief as he took in the scene.\n\"You sly bastard,\" Matt muttered under his breath.\nLiam rose smoothly, offering the girls a polite nod. \"Excuse me, ladies.\"\nHe stepped to Matt’s side and accepted the drink. Cool condensation ran down the glass into his hand. Before Liam could take a sip, he noticed someone standing behind Matt.\nA tall figure, composed and smiling, eyes fixed on him.\nMatt followed Liam’s gaze and smirked knowingly. \"Right. Almost forgot. Liam, meet tonight’s host.\"\nLiam shifted his glass to his left hand and extended the right. Their handshake was firm, measured.\n\"I’ve heard a lot about you,\" the host said warmly. \"Appreciate you gracing us with your presence tonight. It means a lot.\"\nLiam smiled politely. \"Thanks for having me.\"\n\"If you’d like, I can introduce you to the others,\" the host offered, gesturing toward the crowd.\nLiam shook his head. \"Not necessary. I’m here to enjoy myself.\"\nThe host studied him for a moment, then nodded with an understanding smile. \"Fair enough. Enjoy the party.\" He patted Matt’s shoulder before slipping back into the crowd.\nMatt turned immediately, his grin widening into something wicked. He nudged Liam with his elbow. \"So... which one are you planning to take home tonight? Or are you gonna be greedy and try all three?\"\nLiam leveled him with a flat stare, expression utterly deadpan, before looking away.\nMatt burst out laughing, clutching his side. \"That’s it! That look says it all. You’re not touching any of them. Probably for the best. Hell, you’d drown — and we both know you can’t swim.\"\nLiam involuntarily chuckled quietly, sipping his drink.\nThe music swelled around them, laughter and chatter rising like a tide. The jungle was wild, unpredictable, but not unwelcoming.",

      "content": "Chapter 124: Blood In The Water (Bonus Chapter 5/5)\nThe music throbbed across the mansion, and the bass pulsing through the polished marble floors. Laughter rose and fell in waves as groups mingled and glasses clinked.\nLiam and Matt had drifted toward one of the quieter corners of the main hall, each holding a glass of wine. From here, they could see the dance floor, the glowing garden beyond, and the tide of people flowing between.\nMatt leaned in close, his grin wide. \"So, what’s the plan tomorrow? You’ve got the whole world at your fingertips, man. You can’t tell me you’ll just stay home again.\"\nLiam swirled the wine gently in his glass, the ruby liquid catching the chandelier light. He thought for a moment, then said, \"Track racing. Maybe I’ll rent out a circuit and burn some laps.\"\nMatt choked, staring at him. \"Rent out a track? You’re serious?\"\n\"Why not?\" Liam smiled.\n\"You’re too rich, man,\" Matt said, shaking his head in disbelief. \"Normal people go karting when they’re bored. But you want to rent out Laguna Seca like it’s a basketball court.\"\nLiam chuckled softly, letting the comment pass. He wasn’t showing off. He was just stating it plainly.\nBut Matt wasn’t done. He turned, eyes glinting with curiosity. \"Okay, then tell me—how many cars do you actually own? I know the Maserati GranTurismo, the Lamborghini Temerario, that Ghost Black Badge outside, and of course the McLaren P1 LM variant . That’s already insane. What’s the real number?\"\nLiam raised his brow, enjoying Matt’s incredulous expression. He lifted his glass and said casually, \"Seven.\"\nMatt froze. \"Seven?\"\nLiam nodded. \"Aston Martin Vantage GT3. Ferrari SF90 Stradale. And the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium.\"\nThe last name landed like a thunderclap.\nMatt blinked, processing what he has just heard. He said with a cracked voice, \"Wait, repeat that last one. Slowly.\"\nLiam obliged, repeating the name evenly, a with a small smile.\nMatt stared, eyes widening with each syllable. His mind scrambled through car blogs and concept galleries he had seen online. His jaw tightened.\n\"That’s... that’s a one-off, isn’t it? You’re telling me you own a variant on the Maybach 6 Cabriolet? The one people thought Mercedes would never release?\"\nLiam gave a small nod. \"A custom variant. Imperium edition. One of one.\"\nMatt leaned back, exhaling a low whistle. His mind reeled. Owning a McLaren P1 LM was one thing—monstrous rare. But a one-off Maybach 6 variant? That was...\nHe looked at Liam again, but this time his gaze was different. Amusement was gone. Awe—and maybe envy—took its place. \"You... you’re not real, man.\"\nLiam only smiled, twirling his glass again.\nMatt rubbed the back of his neck and forced a laugh. \"Alright. Question is—which one are you bringing to the track tomorrow?\"\nLiam tilted his head, genuinely thoughtful. \"No idea. Honestly, I haven’t even decided which track to rent. Laguna Seca’s the closest, but that’s a five-hour drive. Doesn’t make sense just to scratch an itch.\"\nMatt perked up, his grin returning. \"You’re overthinking it. Easy fix. Get your driver to haul the car down early. Then you helicopter in later, spend a few hours burning rubber, and head back. Done.\"\nLiam shot him a look. \"Have Nick drive one of my cars across the state while I fly in? No. That’s not happening.\"\nMatt shrugged, unbothered. \"Then rent one. You think tracks like Laguna Seca don’t have their own garages? You can rent just about any supercar. Saves you the logistics.\"\nLiam’s brows rose. For once, he was impressed. \"Not a bad idea.\"\nHe considered it in silence. The idea of renting didn’t bother him—it was practical. But something about the thought of driving a car that wasn’t his sat strangely in his chest. Still, it was better than dragging his staff into errands.\nHe was weighing the thought when he felt some presence behind him. Slowly, he and Matt turned.\nA group stood behind them, six deep. Their expressions carried the sharp edge of trouble. At the center, tall and broad-shouldered, was a face Liam recognized instantly.\nLiam studied them, their stares focused on him, their stance, expression and body language, and he can already guess what they want.\nThis was especially so with the familiar face he saw standing with them, with a smile on his face.\nIt was the guy he had broken his hand at the front of a restaurant.\nHe really wished he hadn’t remembered him but his Perfect Memory skill was unforgiving this time around.\nMatt caught the looks, and his gut tightened. He stepped forward instinctively, planting himself between Liam and the group. His voice was even but firm. \"What do you want?\"\nHe can’t let them do anything to Liam. He was the one that brought him here, and so, he was responsible for him.\nThe leader of the group—Adrian Vale—lifted his glass lazily. \"Relax. We’re just curious. Had to see for ourselves what the most popular kid in town looks like.\"\nMatt frowned, heat creeping into his tone. \"You’ve seen him. Now leave.\"\nAdrian’s smile widened, unbothered. \"In a moment. But first, a question.\"\nHis eyes cut to Liam. \"How’d you do it?\"\nLiam tilted his head. \"Do what?\"\n\"The mansion. The cars. The yacht. The helicopter. How’s someone our age pulling all this off? Trust fund? Offshore accounts? Or just dumb luck?\" Adrian’s tone was playful on the surface, but his eyes burned with sharp curiosity.\nThe noise around them dimmed, geads turned and people leaned in. A circle began to form.\nMatt tensed. \"Adrian—\"\nBut Adrian cut him off, stepping closer. His smile thinned. \"No, seriously. Everyone here’s dying to know. What’s the secret? You can’t just drop into our world with all this and expect no one to ask.\"\nThe tension coiled tighter, thick enough to choke.\nLiam sighed inwardly. He set his glass down on a nearby table, then raised his eyes to Adrian’s. His voice was calm, steady. \"If I told you, it wouldn’t be a secret.\"\nA ripple of chuckles spread through the circle.\nAdrian’s eyes narrowed a fraction. Then, slowly, he smirked. \"You’re not an easy one to corner.\" He raised his glass and clinked it gently against Liam’s, a thin peace offering. \"Fair enough. I’ll let it slide... for now.\"\nThe crowd laughed, the tension bleeding away with nervous relief. Conversations resumed, though side-glances lingered. Adrian’s group peeled back, their leader’s smile still hiding that glint of hunger.\nThe host appeared quickly, slipping between them with an easy laugh. \"Adrian, you’re grilling him like an investment banker. He’s not here for an interview. Ease up, man.\"\nAdrian raised his hand in mock surrender and drifted off into the crowd.\nThe host turned to Liam, his expression apologetic. \"Don’t mind him. Adrian always comes on too strong. Enjoy yourself.\"\nLiam gave a small nod. \"I will. Thank you.\"\nThe host clapped his shoulder lightly before leaving.\nMatt exhaled and muttered, \"Jungle.\"\nLiam smirked faintly, repeating under his breath, \"Jungle.\"\nMatt leaned closer, dropping his voice. \"Adrian Vale. UCLA grad. Son of a Fortune 500 CEO. He’s charismatic, used to being the center of gravity in any room. Tonight, you stole that from him. Don’t take it personal. He wasn’t trying to humiliate you—he’s just... curious. Always too curious.\"\nLiam shook his head slightly. \"He came on very strong.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Matt said with a crooked grin. \"That’s his problem. He pushes too hard. But you saw the way everyone looked at you? You’re blood in the water, Liam. They can’t help themselves. Everyone wants a taste.\"\nLiam gave him a look of mild disgust, and Matt laughed so hard he nearly spilled his wine.\nThe party continued until deep into the night, but Liam decided to leave earlier. Matt also chose to leave. Liam dropped him off before having Nick drive him home.",

      "content": "Chapter 125: Laguna Seca\nLiam woke up late the next morning, sunlight already spilling through the tall windows of his bedroom.\nAfter everything that had happened yesterday — especially the party — he decided to let himself sleep in. His body wasn’t tired, but his mind needed the pause.\nHe sat up slowly, exhaling. His gaze drifted to the window, where the curtains swayed lightly in the morning breeze. The sky outside was clear and bright, the kind of blue that seemed endless.\n\"What a beautiful day,\" Liam muttered, a small smile tugging at his lips.\nHe stayed that way for a while, simply appreciating the calm. Even after weeks of living in Bellemere Mansion, the view, the sunlight, and the quiet comfort of mornings like this still felt surreal.\nThe first thing he usually did each day was sign-in immediately. It had become routine — wake up, sign-in, receive rewards. But today, he decided to take things slow. He wasn’t in a rush. He would sign-in, of course, but not just yet.\nInstead, his thoughts wandered to how he wanted to spend the day.\nTrack racing. The idea had been bouncing around in his head since last night. Renting out a circuit, pushing cars to their limits, feeling raw speed under his control. It was tempting.\nBut another thought surfaced: training his power.\nHe could use the day to sharpen his telekinesis. Maybe fly out to somewhere desolate like Greenland or Siberia. He could push himself without holding back, maybe even attempt the impossible — true flight with the ability. He doubted he could achieve it in one day, but even small progress would matter.\nLiam couldn’t help but smile at the thought. The truth was, he wanted that. He wanted to push his limits, test himself, see what he was capable of.\nBut... it clashed with his plan for structured self-improvement. He has to keep it balanced between training and living, between progress and experience.\nHe sighed, leaning back into the pillows for a moment before sitting upright again. \"Racing it is,\" he said under his breath, decision made.\nHe picked up his Gear Glass from the nightstand and slid it on, and Lucy’s voice greeted him immediately.\n\"Good morning, sir.\"\n\"Good morning, Lucy. Please reserve Laguna Seca for me. I want it ready before I get there in the next two hours. And line up the fastest cars you can get your hands on.\"\n\"Understood. I’ll make the arrangements right away.\"\nLiam nodded, satisfied. He removed the device and set it aside before picking up his phone. A few taps later, he had Captain Harris on the line.\n\"Good morning, Harris. I’ll need you to pick me up and transport me to Laguna Seca in two hours,\" Liam said.\n\"Yes, sir,\" Harris replied without hesitation. \"I’ll be waiting at the helipad of Granworth Executive Tower.\"\n\"Good. See you then.\" Liam ended the call politely and dropped the phone onto the nightstand.\nHe stood up, stretching slightly, and headed to the bathroom.\nHe didn’t need to worry about Lucy not being able to book the track or the get the cars, as those were things that were too easy for her.\n***\nA few minutes later, Liam stepped out of the bathroom, drying himself up and dressing up quickly, pulling on fresh clothes, then made his way downstairs.\nAs he entered the dining room, Evelyn and the girls greeted him with their usual warmth. He returned it with a polite, genuine smile. \"Good morning.\"\nHe took his seat as always at the head of the table. Before he began eating, he glanced at Evelyn. \"Please let Mason know I’ll need the car ready soon.\"\n\"Of course, sir,\" Evelyn said with a small bow before stepping away to relay the order.\nLiam picked up his utensils and began eating at a steady pace. When he finished, he thanked the girls, who beamed at the acknowledgment. Then he rose and returned upstairs.\nWalking into his room, he locked the door as always, before teleporting himself to Great Yan Empire. He appeared in the VIP suite once again and he sat on the bed, before saying the words.\n\"System, sign-in.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, host. You received 10,000 Gold Coins]\n[You received 50 Low Grade Spirit Stones]\n***\nLiam smiled slightly. Though he had been expecting more but there were just two of them. But he was happy with the regards.\nThey weren’t the most extravagant rewards, but they were not bad either. Ten thousand gold coins meant his wealth in this world had grown even further. The fifty low-grade spirit stones added to his resources, marking him as wealthier than the ordinary people here.\nThe truth was that the type of rewards Liam was after were things like talents, physiques and bloodlines. Those were what he wanted, as they were things that would change everything.\nHe can get other things like herbs, pills, talisman, treasure level fruits and the rest from the store. This was the same for the things he wants but they are outrageously expensive.\nEven the cheapest talent, physique and bloodline in the store cost start from 10m system points — the equivalent of a hundred billion dollars, or one trillion gold coins, or a hundred billion of low grade spirit stones. These were numbers that are so absurd they felt untouchable.\nThis was completely different from when he was saving up to buy the molecular assembler. They weren’t things he can save up to buy. These were prizes beyond his current reach.\nBut Liam wasn’t disheartened. Not truly. He believed — no, he knew — the system would eventually give them to him. He felt that the system was taking things slow and just like back on Earth, everything will change after his first weekly sign-in\nSatisfied with that thought, he exhaled and dismissed the lingering doubts.\n\"Back,\" he muttered, and in an instant, he was once again in his bedroom at Bellemere Mansion, and then made his way downstairs.\nMason and Nick were already waiting at the entrance, sharp in their uniforms. The Ghost Black Badge sat gleaming outside, sunlight flashing across its polished surface.\nMason opened the door smoothly. \"Good morning, sir. The car is ready.\"\n\"Good morning, Mason,\" Liam said, as he stepped inside the car, sliding into the plush leather seat.\n\"Destination, sir?\" Nick glanced back from the driver’s seat.\n\"Granworth Executive Tower,\" Liam replied calmly.\nNick nodded, starting the engine. The Rolls Royce purred to life, gliding down the driveway and through the tall wrought-iron gates.",

      "content": "Chapter 126: Racing\nThe rotor blades cut through the morning sky, the deep thrum echoing across the California coastline.\nLiam sat comfortably in the chopper’s cabin, the leather seat cradling him as the landscape passed in blurs of green and gold far below. Mason and Nick sat opposite, silent and composed.\nFor thirty minutes, only the steady rhythm of the engines filled the cabin and Liam’s ears, then Lucy’s voice came gently through the Gear Glass.\n\"Sir, the circuit is cleared. Three cars are prepped for you in the paddock: a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+, a Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut, and the Rimac Nevera.\"\nPerfect. Thank you, Lucy\n, Liam muttered with a satisfied smile.\n\"You’re welcome, sir.\"\nLiam was actually curious on how she was able to rent those three cars, but he decided not to ask. Lucy was capable and has her ways.\nHe leaned back, letting his eyes close for a moment, as he enjoyed the ride.\n***\nAlmost an hour later, the helicopter blades slowed as the chopper descended, wind flattening the grass around Laguna Seca’s private helipad.\nLiam sat forward slightly, eyes narrowing at the ribbon of asphalt that snaked across the hills\nThe pilot guided the chopper toward the small private helipad inside the circuit grounds. The skids touched the tarmac with a controlled bounce, and the blades slowed as the engine wound down.\nThe door opened and Liam stepped out first of the chopper first, Mason and Nick at his back\nA group of track staff stood waiting near a row of garages. Their uniforms bore the Laguna Seca crest, and their posture carried both professionalism and a hint of awe. Very few clients arrived by private helicopter with their own security detail, and those were always people of high status.\n\"Mr. Scott, welcome,\" the man at the front said, extending his hand. \"I’m Darren, head of operations here. It’s an honor to host you.\"\nLiam shook his hand firmly. \"Thank you for accommodating me on such short notice.\"\n\"Of course. The track is yours for as long as you want it. If there’s anything you need—fuel, maintenance, timing systems—it’s already arranged.\"\nDarren gestured toward the garages. \"If you’ll follow me, I’ll show you to your cars.\"\nThey walked across the pit lane, the air already carrying the faint scent of rubber and gasoline. Inside the paddock, three cars gleamed under the white lights, each prepared meticulously.\nEven the staff stole glances, unable to mask awe. Few people on the planet could casually summon such machines\nOne of the technicians stepped forward, holding a black bag. \"Sir, we have helmets and racing suits ready for you. For safety.\"\nLiam shook his head politely, as he said, \"Not necessary. I’ll be fine.\"\nThe man hesitated, then nodded quickly, stepping back.\nLiam walked to the Bugatti first, his fingers brushing the smooth hood. He circled once, then slid into the driver’s seat and pressed the ignition.\nThe engine roared to life, a sharp metallic growl that echoed across the paddock.\nHe eased the car forward, rolling out of the garage and onto the pit lane. A marshal waved him through, and then he was on the track.\n***\nThe first lap was reconnaissance. He guided the Bugatti through the bends, feeling its weight, its balance. The Chiron wasn’t delicate. It was raw muscle, like it was barely tamed.\nBy the second lap, he pressed harder, making sure to trim down unnecessary movements. The engine’s deep howl rose to a scream as the car devoured the straight. The g-forces pressed him against the seat and his vision tunneled slightly at full throttle.\nHe gritted his teeth in exhilaration, as his blood pumped hot, with his heart pounding in rhythm with the car.\n\"This is power,\" he muttered.\nHe dove into the Corkscrew, braked late, and the Bugatti thundered down the drop, tires biting, the chassis vibrating like a beast trying to tear free.\n\"Lap time: 1:24.9,\" Lucy said, as he completed the lap.\nLiam laughed under his breath. He felt bad for holding himself back for a whole month and not enjoying things like this more.\nHe pushed harder, each lap shaving tenths. By the end, his body was buzzing with intense adrenaline. When he finally eased into the pit lane, the car ticked and hissed as if it had fought a war.\nLiam climbed out slowly, chest rising and falling. He looked at the staffs who were looking at him strangely, and he smiled as he walked to the Koenigsegg Jesko.\nHe got and the moment he pressed the ignition, the 5.0L twin-turbo V8 snarled, higher pitched than the Bugatti, sharper, impatient.\nHe launched it out of the pit and immediately felt the difference. The steering was knife-sharp, the downforce gluing it to the asphalt.\nWhen he floored it on the straight, it didn’t just accelerate, rather, it detonated. His head snapped back, his stomach dropped, and his pulse spiked.\nHis knuckles tightened on the wheel, but his grin widened. \"This... this is madness.\"\nThe Corkscrew came and he barely braked, trusting the car’s aerodynamics. The car obeyed, flowing down the slope like liquid steel, biting the track with perfection.\n\"Lap time: 1:22.3,\" Lucy’s voice came again, as he finished the first lap.\nLiam felt the heat in his chest. He pushed again. By the next lap, he had shaved it down to 1:21.8.\nThe staff outside erupted in noise. That was beyond the limit of what they expected to see today.\nBut Liam wasn’t finished. He pushed again, every gearshift timed with flawless instinct, as he carved through the track, each lap shaving fractions.\nBy the time he pulled the car back into the pit, the final time displayed: one minute twenty flat.\nThe pit lane fell silent for a moment. Then the applause came louder this time, mixed with disbelief.\nDarren shook his head, muttering, \"Unreal.\"\nLiam stepped out of the car with a calm expression, but he wasn’t calm on the inside. His hands trembling slightly from the overload of adrenaline.\nFinally, the Rimac Nevera.\nWhen it powered on, there was no roar but when Liam touched the accelerator, the silence shattered into violence.\nThe Nevera launched forward with instant torque, pinning him harder than either the Bugatti or Jesko. The world blurred around him, as the corners came in an instant, and the car’s advanced systems adjusted perfectly.\nThere was no engine scream, only high electric whine and the sound of tires ripping into asphalt.\nLiam’s pulse still hammered as he pushed the car even harder, and the car obeyed flawlessly, never once losing composure.\nLucy’s report: \"Lap time: 1:19.8.\"\nThe fastest yet.\nLiam decided to drive three more laps but at normal speed this time, savoring the feel, before returning to the pit.\nThe staff gathered, clapping, shaking their heads in amazement.\nDarren stepped forward, smiling broadly. \"Mr. Scott... I don’t think anyone’s ever broken times like that on a casual run here. You’ve set a new benchmark today.\"\n\"I had fun,\" Liam smiled.\nThe staff exchanged glances. For them, it had been a display. For Liam, it was just another of his mornings.\nMason and Nick stood quietly nearby, their eyes betraying nothing, though they had felt the same thrill watching their employer dominate a world that wasn’t his.\nLiam looked once more at the three machines, with a small smile on his face.\nThis was worth the day.",

      "content": "Chapter 127: The Busiest Man Alive (Bonus Chapter 1/5)\nBy the time Liam returned home, the sun was already sinking, painting the western sky in broad strokes of orange and gold.\nWalking through the front door of the mansion, he caught the faint clatter of porcelain coming from the dining, the aroma of roasting meat filled his nose, and the low chatter of voices.\nEvelyn and the maids were already preparing dinner. They looked up as soon as he stepped inside, their faces lighting up immediately.\n\"Welcome back, sir,\" Evelyn said with her usual poise, bowing slightly.\n\"Welcome back,\" the girls echoed in unison, with bright and genuine smiles on their faces.\nLiam returned the greeting with a nod and a soft smile. \"Good evening.\"\nWithout lingering, he headed upstairs. He walked into his room and to his bed, and the moment the door shut behind him, he collapsed onto his bed with a satisfied grin stretching across his face.\nThe day’s memories rushed back in vivid detail — the roar of engines, the violent pull of g-forces and the blur of asphalt.\nThe exhilaration coursing through him wasn’t just from driving. It was from pushing himself, from walking into the arms of danger and coming out the other side not only unscathed but triumphant.\nIt reminded him of the battle with the Ironblood Bear. That same adrenaline, that same sharp edge of danger dancing just close enough to sting but not close enough to kill.\nLiam frowned slightly, rolling onto his back, staring at the ornate ceiling.\nHe was starting to recognize a pattern. He was beginning to fall in love with extreme and dangerous things. And that thought unsettled him.\nIt wasn’t like him. In his old life, before the system, he had avoided risk whenever he could. He had lived carefully, never stepping outside the lines, never giving himself the chance to feel this kind of rush.\nWas it that he had never liked extremes? Or was it that he had never had the chance to discover them?\nPerhaps the truth was somewhere in between.\nHe let out a soft sigh. Either way, he couldn’t allow it to spiral. Thrills could be addictive, and addiction was the first step to recklessness. Dangerous was fine. Stupid was not.\nHe wouldn’t throw his life away chasing adrenaline. If he risked himself, it would only be in a battle that demanded everything of him — life or death, with no other option. And even then, he would rely on his wit to see him through.\nHe closed his eyes for a moment, steadying himself, before sitting upright again.\nThe group meet-up was tomorrow. All the preparations he needs to make had already been made. Captain Harris would pick him up in the morning, and from there, the day would unfold. And he can’t deny that he was looking forward to tomorrow.\nStill, he couldn’t ignore the nagging thought that hovered behind it all.\nIt will take a whole month for the Family Office to be set up. Which means a month or more before the Gear Glass or anything significant on Earth can happen. But he couldn’t spend the whole month like this, flitting from party to outing. He still has responsibilities beyond social growth.\nThe cultivation world needed attention. There were still matters he could tend to there, small steps that wouldn’t draw too much notice but would build his foundation. He couldn’t forget that half of his power lay in that world, and neglecting it would be a mistake.\nAnd then there was Earth.\nThe Nevada site construction. Once completed, it would serve as the foundation for the Gear Glasses project, as it would become the secondary storage place for the device, along with the warehouse in Nevada.\nThe raw materials Daniel had acquired for him were waiting. He needed to put them to use, exhaust the supply, and then source more from the Dimensional Space.\nSpeaking of which...\nHis thoughts turned toward the space itself, that vast and infinite reservoir of resources. Rich deposits of minerals and unknown elements lay scattered across its barren expanse, untouched, waiting. It wasn’t enough to know they were there. He needed to build an autonomous mining infrastructure, a system Lucy could control, extracting raw materials without his direct intervention.\nAnd then there were the unknown elements. Exotic substances that didn’t exist on Earth, their properties still a mystery. They could be invaluable. He needed Lucy to study them and catalog them.\nA long sigh slipped past his lips. The list was endless.\nIn becoming the wealthiest person in the world, he had also become the man with the greatest workload.\nHe chuckled bitterly, \"The busiest man alive.\"\nBut he didn’t resent it. He couldn’t. The truth was, he had been given something extraordinary. A gift — or a responsibility. He didn’t know which. What he did know was that he couldn’t waste it.\nThere was a whole new world waiting for him — no, more than one world. Earth, the cultivation world, the Dimensional Space and even the magical world. And he would explore them all.\nIf life had been simple, he might never have received the system in the first place. He might have lived quietly and drowning in his debt, as he slips into the comfort of mediocrity.\nBut simplicity wasn’t his path.\nAnd perhaps, that was why the system had chosen him.\nThe thought made him smile faintly. He knew that he was just bullsh*ting. There was no way that was the reason.\nHe was still lost in that train of thought when he felt Evelyn’s presence approaching the door. Her footsteps were soft, but his heightened senses caught them as clearly as if she were walking on glass. She was about to knock when Liam rose and opened the door first.\nShe blinked, surprised, before giving a graceful bow. \"Sir, dinner is ready.\"\nLiam nodded. \"Thank you, Evelyn.\"\nThey walked together down the stairs to the dining room. The table was already set and the girls stood ready, their eyes lifting when Liam entered.\nHe took his seat at the head of the table, and they served him swiftly. Liam ate steadily, savoring the quiet. He offered thanks when he finished, and the smiles that bloomed on their faces were genuine, pleased.\nReturning upstairs afterward, he allowed himself to rest.\n***\nThe next morning came swiftly. Sunlight broke across Holmby Hills, washing Bellemere Mansion in gold. Liam woke early this time, his body refreshed, his mind sharp.\nWithout hesitation, he got out of bed. And with one thought, he appeared in the VIP suite of the Great Yan Empire.\nHe sat down on the broad bed, inhaled once, and spoke the words.\n\"System, sign-in.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, host. You received 10,000 Gold Coins.]\n[You received 100 Low Grade Spirit Stones.]\n***\nLiam nodded to himself in quiet satisfaction. The rewards weren’t extravagant, but they added weight to his growing stores of wealth and power in this world.\nSatisfied, he returned to Earth and the familiar surroundings of his bedroom appeared around him again. He moved smoothly into his morning routine — a hot shower, clean clothes, and then downstairs for breakfast.\nEvelyn and the girls greeted him warmly as always. He returned their greetings with a smile, ate without hurry, and when he finished, he rose with a calm word of thanks.\nOutside, Mason and Nick were already waiting, as was the Ghost Black Badge in the driveway.\nMason bowed slightly, opening the door.\n\"Good morning, sir. The car is ready.\"\n\"Good morning, Mason,\" Liam said, stepping inside.",

The sea stretched endlessly around them, glittering under the afternoon sun, waves breaking in gentle rhythm against the hull.\nThe moment the engine powered down, Mason was already on his feet. He stepped forward, opened the cabin door smoothly, and stood to the side for Liam to exit first.\nLiam sighed softly and smiled warmly, as he stepped down onto the deck, the wind carrying the faint scent of saltwater and sea spray.\nNick followed silently, his eyes scanning the open deck before falling into step behind his employer.\nLiam’s gaze swept ahead, and his lips curved into a wide smile. There they were — Matt, Kristopher, Harper, Alex, Elise, Kristie, Lana, and Stacy — gathered together at the far end of the helipad, waiting.\nIt had been weeks since Liam had seen most of them, except for Matt of course. Seeing the others again stirred something warm in his chest.\nHe walked forward with unhurried, but confident strides.\nKristopher and the boys were the first to move. They broke away from the group and met Liam halfway, their faces lit with broad smiles, as they embraced him one by one.\n\"It’s been too long,\" Kristopher said, pulling back with a grin.\n\"Way too long,\" Harper agreed, clapping Liam on the shoulder.\nLiam returned each hug and clasp, his own smile genuine. \"I missed you guys.\"\nWhen he turned to the girls, he greeted them with equal warmth. Kristie, as expected, was the most enthusiastic, her smile so wide it looked like it might split her face. She leaned forward as if she might hug him too, but caught herself, settling for an eager wave instead.\n\"Liam, finally!\" she exclaimed, her voice bubbling with energy.\nLiam chuckled softly and nodded to her. \"It’s good to see you too, Kristie.\"\nStacy and the others smiled politely, and greeted him warmly. Elise gave a graceful nod, Lana a soft smile, while Stacy gave a small composed smile.\nWith the greetings complete, Liam gestured toward the lower deck. \"Come on. Let’s head inside.\"\nThe group followed him down into the cabin, their footsteps echoing faintly against the polished floors.\nThe lounge opened wide before them, sunlight pouring through glass windows that framed the sea outside.\nThe space was immaculate yet inviting. And they settled in easily, laughter breaking out as they made themselves comfortable.\nAlex leaned back on one of the sofas, his smile relaxed. \"Man, I’ve missed this yacht. I’ve been looking forward to being here again.\"\nLiam laughed. \"Then why didn’t you ask me? You know I wouldn’t have minded.\"\nAlex shook his head, chuckling. \"I would love to board this yacht every day if I could. But I’ve been busy. College, work... and my dad’s been pushing me harder than ever. Especially after he found out I know you.\"\nLiam’s brow lifted slightly, caught off guard. \"Because of me?\"\nAlex nodded without hesitation. \"Yeah. He thinks I should make the most of the connection. Network harder. Position myself better. You know how it is.\"\nLiam wanted to say something, an apology perhaps, but the words seemed to be stuck in his throat. He had no idea what to say to that.\nNoticing his expression, Alex waved a hand dismissively. \"Don’t apologize. It’s not your fault. It’s just what comes with being born into families like ours. We don’t really get to choose.\"\nLiam fell silent, more speechless than before. He glanced around the lounge and saw the others nodding, their expressions a mix of agreement and resignation.\nEven Matt spoke up, his tone gentler this time. \"Remember what I told you in the car about the party being the last night of freedom for most of us? The monthly meet-up is the same. It’s the only day we can breathe. The only day we’re free. Don’t blame yourself. It’s been like this long before we met you.\"\nLiam nodded slowly, though his chest felt heavy.\nKristopher leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. His voice was quiet but steady. \"You don’t know how much I envy you, Liam. How much I admire you. You have time to be bored. I don’t even remember what that feels like. I’m buried with work almost every day. And when I’m not, I’m dragged into some function I can’t refuse.\"\nHearing this hit Liam harder than he expected. Time had always been his enemy before the system. He barely had time for himself after working hard the whole day. But now, time was his greatest luxury. Especially with the time dilation of the Dimensional Space and the cultivation world.\nStacy sighed softly but the sound was sharp enough to cut the air. \"I get that. The networking functions are the worst. Smiling, shaking hands, pretending to care. I just wish I could sleep instead. But I can’t. My conscience won’t let me. Neither will my dad’s expectations. Even when they say not to feel pressured, it’s impossible not to.\"\nThe girls nodded instantly, their agreement overlapping with one another. Elise added, \"Exactly. The pressure never goes away. It’s always there.\"\nKristie, usually the most cheerful, muttered softly, \"Sometimes I think we’re all just playing roles, and not living our lives. But I can’t really say much because it’s thanks to them that I got to enjoy everything I have. So, the best I can do is repay them by meeting their expectations.\"\nThe lounge grew quiet after that.\nLiam leaned back against the sofa, stunned. He had always thought his friends were free. Maybe not as free as him, but free enough to live, to enjoy themselves. He had assumed that when they weren’t chatting with him, they were out doing something fun, chasing their own pleasures.\nBut listening to them now, he realized how wrong he had been. Their lives weren’t theirs. They were carved out by family expectations, locked in by duty, cemented by wealth.\nHe thought back to what he had said about his own workload, and now he almost felt ashamed. His responsibilities were choices. He chose them. He could walk away at any time. But for his friends, the weight wasn’t optional. They were born into it.\nBefore the silence could settle too heavily, Kristopher clapped his hands together, his tone lighter. \"Alright, enough of that. We’ve carried stress for a month. Let’s not drag it into today. We’re here. We’re together. Let’s enjoy it.\"\nEveryone nodded, their expressions softening. Liam nodded too, grateful for the shift.\nJust then, the kitchen staff arrived, carrying in trays of food and bottles of wine. The aroma of roasted meats, herbs, and fresh bread filled the lounge, instantly lifting the mood. The staff laid everything neatly on the table before bowing and leaving quietly.\nKristopher turned to Liam, smiling. \"Want to do the honors?\"\nLiam shook his head lightly. \"You take the lead.\"\nKristopher’s smile widened. He reached for one of the bottles, pulling the cork free with a soft pop. He poured into his glass first, then moved around the table, filling everyone else’s.\nWhen he returned to his seat, he raised his glass high. His voice carried steady warmth. \"We’re here today to celebrate a brother and a friend, Liam, for his success. For earning his family’s favor and for being showered with the rewards that followed. We’re proud of you, Liam. And we know this is only the beginning. There’s more where that came from. But today, we celebrate what you’ve achieved already.\"\nHe leaned across the table, clinking his glass against Liam’s.\n\"To Liam.\"\nThe others lifted their glasses in unison. \"To Liam.\"\nThe sound of crystal clinking filled the air, followed by laughter and the first sips of wine.

      "content": "Chapter 129: Shocking Details (Bonus Chapter 3/5)\nThe meet-up carried on with laughter and light conversations, the sound of waves outside blending softly with their voices. Though they talked about different things, one theme kept circling back again and again: Liam.\nSince he was the MVP of the occasion, every story, every joke, every side comment somehow tied back to him — directly or indirectly.\nAfter the meal was cleared, Matt leaned back in his chair, mischievous grin on his face. \"Alright, I’ve been holding this in all day. Guys, you have no idea what Liam’s car collection looks like. It’s not just crazy. It’s unbelievable.\"\nThe boys perked up at once. Alex leaned forward, Harper frowned with curiosity and even Kristopher raised a brow, clearly very interested.\n\"What collection?\" Harper asked. \"We’ve only seen the McLaren, Maserati, Lamborghini and the Ghost. Don’t tell me he has more hidden away?\"\nMatt smirked and threw Liam a glance. \"More? That’s putting it lightly. Try a garage that would make most billionaires cry.\"\nThe table erupted with noise as they all pressed for details. Matt, grinning like a devil, rattled off the names one by one — Maserati GranTurismo, Lamborghini Temerario, the Ghost Black Badge, the McLaren P1 LM variant, the Aston Martin Vantage GT3, Ferrari SF90 Stradale, and then...\n\"...the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium.\"\nFor a moment, there was a loud silence. Then Kristopher actually choked on his wine. Harper swore under his breath. Alex’s eyes widened like saucers.\n\"You’re kidding,\" Harper said, staring at Matt first, then Liam. \"That car’s a myth. A concept that never even made production. It was supposed to be impossible.\"\nLiam, caught under their stares, gave a small shrug. \"It exists. I have it.\"\nThe boys almost shouted in disbelief.\n\"Explain,\" Kristopher demanded, half laughing, half stunned. \"Now. Everything. What’s it like? What does it even have?\"\nHe couldn’t help himself.\nThe girls leaned in too, their curiosity no less than the boys’, though they hid it better behind smiles.\nLiam set his glass down and did his best to explain. He wasn’t much of a car enthusiast, but he described what he knew. The length of the car, the smooth lines of its body, the massive engine. He told them about the interior and how it felt more like a private lounge than a vehicle.\nAs he spoke, their eyes grew wider with each detail.\nAlex whistled low. \"You’re telling me it’s basically a rolling palace.\"\nLiam chuckled. \"Something like that.\"\nWhile Liam might not understand how insane those things are because he wasn’t much of a car person, the boys do. They couldn’t help but look at Liam in a more different light.\nWhat Liam had described about the cars are things that shouldn’t be possible with the current level of technology in Earth. They all felt that the only way Mercedes and Maybach could had created a car like that was with the help of experts. Experts connected to Liam’s family.\nAlso, the fact that Liam was able to get a concept car that should had just remained a concept goes a long way to say a ton about his background.\nAt this point, he wasn’t just someone with a hidden dynastic background, he was like someone from those ancient families in fictions\nBefore this, they thought they had started to understand Liam’s background. But now? Now they realized they weren’t even close. The truth was something far beyond their grasp.\nThinking about all these, they all felt shivers running down their spines.\nFor a brief moment, none of them spoke. They simply stared at him, their minds racing.\nThey felt that they might have befriend someone with not just a monster level background but beyond.\nActually if they were curious about Liam’s background before. But now? They weren’t anymore. They dare not.\nBut they were also happy because unlike the kind of attitude they would expect from someone with Liam’s background, he was incredibly friendly and they felt that they can relate with him\nThough they dare not ask about his background, they were curious about other things, things they feel Liam might be able to tell them.\nAs for Liam, he remained calm and gave a small smile, unbothered by their shock. Of course he was acting, but his World-Class Etiquette skill made it look real.\nIt was Kristopher who finally broke the silence. He clapped once and grinned. \"Well, that calls for more celebration.\"\nEveryone jumped at the chance, nodding and raising their glasses.\n\"To the Imperium,\" Harper said jokingly, and they all laughed.\nThe second round of cheering washed the heaviness away, and the atmosphere lightened once more.\nMatt, of course, couldn’t resist. He leaned forward with a sly look. \"Hey, Liam... you got a sister? Legal age? Single? Asking for a friend. Actually—forget that. Asking for myself.\"\nThe table roared with laughter.\nEven Liam couldn’t help but smile, shaking his head at Matt’s antics. \"You’re impossible.\"\nThe girls rolled their eyes, though Kristie almost fell out of her chair laughing.\nIt was Harper who shifted the tone next. He glanced at Liam, his expression earnest. \"I need to say thanks. My uncle told me you made him Managing Director of your Family Office. That’s... huge.\"\nThe laughter died instantly. The others froze, their eyes snapping to Harper, then to Liam.\n\"Wait,\" Alex said slowly. \"Your uncle is Daniel Conley. He works with JP Morgan, right? One of the private bankers for the Platinum Triangle?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Harper said, nodding. \"That’s him.\"\nThe shock deepened. They remembered when Harper mentioned his uncle had been assigned to Liam. Later, he told them his uncle had been promoted to lead a dedicated team of private bankers just for Liam. Those were shocking, yes.\nBut thet were things that were still considered normal. Creating a Family Office and being its Managing Director wasn’t one of those things.\nIt goes beyond simply helping someone to manage their wealth to an extent and providing convenience services to make the company’s client comfortable.\nThis meant that Harper’s uncle was now in direct contact with someone from a dynastic background. And not just that, but he’s now in Liam’s trusted circles.\nTo people like them, they understood what this means. Especially with Liam’s insanely monstrous background, it meant that the Conley family was in their way to the top.\nAlso, the fact that Liam was creating a Family Office meant that he was probably about to start making big moves.\nThinking about this, they all felt that a massive storm was coming and because of their connection to Liam, they were now smack right in the middle of that storm.\nThe realization washed over them all like a wave. The yacht felt quieter for a heartbeat, as if even the sea outside held its breath.\nThey wanted to ask more. They wanted to pry deeper, to know just how vast Liam’s world really was. But after the car revelation and now this, they didn’t dare. Not anymore. Some truths were better left alone.\nStill, the weight of it couldn’t erase their joy. They smiled again, leaned back into the cushions, and carried on with lighter talk.\nAlex broke the silence next, grinning. \"By the way, Liam—my dad asked me to tell you he’ll wire the $1.5 million monthly into your account for the property. The first payment will arrive in three days. He wanted me to tell you directly.\"\nThe girls’ heads whipped around again. Even the boys sat up straighter.\n\"$1.5 million monthly?\" Kristopher repeated, with a big smile on his face.\nIf it was before the revelation of the car and the Family Office set up, they might had been shocked by the amount. But, that doesn’t mean that they are any less impressed about it.\nLiam nodded, unfazed. \"Tell your dad thank you. I really appreciate the work he’s doing.\"\nAlex waved it off with a chuckle. \"It’s nothing. Just part of the REIT. He doesn’t mind at all.\"\nLiam smiled, but inside he felt something stir. His first rent payment. It shouldn’t have meant much, not compared to the fortune he already controlled. But it did. It reminded him of where he had started. Of how far he had come.\nStill, he didn’t let it linger. Today was about this. His friends.\nThe conversation drifted again. They asked about his travels, his plans, even silly things like what brand of watch he preferred. They never touched his background, but everything else was fair game.\nLiam answered what he could, patient and warm. And though the undercurrent of awe never vanished from their eyes, he could also see relief and gratitude on their faces. The knowledge that no matter how far he had risen, he still treated them like equals.\nThat meant more to them than anything else.\nHours passed in that lounge, filled with laughter, teasing, and clinking glasses. The earlier confessions about pressure and duty still lingered at the edges, but for now, they were buried beneath warmth.\nWhen the sun began to sink and the sea outside turned gold, Kristopher raised his glass again for the third time, with a calm voice, yet filled with conviction, \"To Liam. Not just for what he has, but for who he is. A brother, a friend, and someone we’re proud to stand beside.\"\nThe others echoed, glasses lifting high.\n\"To Liam.\"\nThe crystal rang, sharp and clear, as if the sea itself joined in.\nLiam lifted his own glass, his smile small but genuine. \"To us.\"\nAnd with that, the meet-up carried on until late in the evening.",

      "content": "Chapter 130: Myriad Armament Constitution (Bonus Chapter 4/5)\nLiam sighed, as he collapsed onto the bed with a wide satisfied smile on his face. The meet-up had been a blast as he had expected. Even more than he expected actually. And he had really enjoyed it.\nAs he thought of how enjoyable the meet-up was, Liam couldn’t help but think of what they said about their busy lives. He felt that maybe his friends were just like him who wants to stay home all day but are forced by their parents and society to go out and socialise. He felt that it was probably true.\nHe turned the thought over for a while, but it didn’t change the truth pressing on him: he needed to improve himself. He couldn’t just coast on wealth or even the system’s gifts. Strength mattered — real strength.\nTalking about self improvement, Liam was already thinking of using the whole of tomorrow to train his superpower. He will take full advantage of the Dimensional Space’s time dilation and train for the whole of the day or till his body gives out.\nWith that decision made, Liam rose to go shower. When he returned to bed, his mind was clear. He had enjoyed himself today. Now it was time to rest. Tomorrow would be a new day.\n***\nThe next morning, sunlight painted Bellemere Mansion in gold. Liam wasted no time. With a thought, his figure dissolved and reappeared in the VIP suite of the Great Yan Empire.\nHe had taken care of everything that he needs to take care back in Earth, and he could focus on what he has planned for the day. He sat on the broad bed, inhaled once, and gave the familiar command:\n\"System, sign-in.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, host. You received 15,000 Gold Coins.]\n[You received 80 Low Grade Spirit Stones.]\n[You received a talent: Myriad Armament Constitution.]\n[Note: Host can infuse the talent by simply thinking about it.]\n***\nLiam’s eyes widened when he saw the last of the rewards. The first and second he was used to, as he had received them twice already in the past two days. The only thing that changed about them is their quantity. But the last rewards was a game changer.\nA talent. And not just any talent.\nSuppressing the sudden jolt in his chest, Liam focused on the glowing notification, summoning the description.\n[Myriad Armament Constitution: A talent that allows its bearer to master every weapon and its Dao without restriction, eventually merging them into the Supreme Weapon Dao.]\nLiam’s heart skipped a beat and his hands actually trembled, as his eyes widened in even more shock when he read the description.\nEverything he knows about the cultivation world comes from the web novels he has read. While most of the information are wrong as fiction tend to exaggerate things, a whole lot of them were accurate.\nHe knew about weapon talents, sword, saber, spear, staff. They are talents specifically focused on a single weapon. Yes, there’s also the extremely rare dual-wielding talent too. But that’s just two weapons.\nThe talent Liam received is an all encompassing weapon talent!\nYes, Liam had been asking for a talent but he had never expected to receive something like this.\nThe system just loves spoiling me,\nhe muttered to himself, smiling brightly, from ear to ear.\nHis imagination ran wild as always, as he imagined himself wielding multiple weapons and fighting off an army by himself, dominating the battlefield in a storm of steel. The image was so vivid, so impossibly cool, he couldn’t hold back his excitement.\nHe couldn’t hold himself back as he decided to start with the infusion, but before he started, taking caution, he asked the system if there was anything he should know about the infusion process or do before he starts.\n[It’s advisable for Host to find a remote place and prepare yourself for a lot of strange things, and pain.]\nLiam nodded when he heard what the system said. He remembered that talents like this causes a lot of phenomenon and attracts heavenly tribulations. He felt that the pain the system was talking about was related to the heavenly tribulations and it made his body chill but he didn’t allow himself to dwell on the thought.\n\"System, since a remote would be best, then the Dimensional Space would be the perfect place.\n[You’re wrong, Host. The Dimensional Space is the most dangerous place to undergo the infusion process.]\nLiam was beyond shocked to hear this. Who had thought that the Dimensional Space he had thought was the safest place for him, was actually the most dangerous? How was that possible?\n\"How’s that possible?\" He asked unable to hold in his curiosity.\n[The Dimensional Space is located in a special place in the Grand Universe. If you undergo the infusion process there, the difficulty will be increased by a million fold.]\nLiam frowned deeply when he heard this. He has been learning a lot about everything about the universe he lives in, lately, but this was different.\nGrand Universe? What’s the difference between it and the three universes the system told him about?\nHe wanted to ask this question but he knew that it wasn’t the most important thing at the moment.\n\"System, how will the difficulty be increased in the Dimensional Space?\"\nHe was actually very curious about this.\n[If you undergo the infusion process in this world or any other worlds in the cultivation universe, the difficulty will be determined by the Heavenly Dao of that world. And it would, in every cases during the infusion process or birth process, strike down whoever it is that possesses such a talent, even if it has to ask help from the Grand Dao.]\n[But for you Host, it won’t dare strike you down. But it will test you. However if you choose to go through the infusion process in the Dimensional Space, you will be tested by the combined Heavenly Daos of the universe and the Grand Dao. While the Heavenly Daos won’t dare do anything to you, it’s not the same for the Grand Dao.]\n[This is the same if you decide to undergo it on Earth. Not only that, but the combined trials will attract the attention the attention of extremely powerful entities.]\nAt this point, Liam’s eyes was opened wide without restraint, and he felt that the floor had dropped beneath him.\nHe felt like he was suddenly thrust into something he has no idea what it is. Heavenly Daos? Grand Dao? How did he offend such entities?\nBut there was something the system said that stuck to his head: The Heavenly Daos won’t dare do anything to me.\nThis sort of gave him a glimpse into what sort of entity the system or its creator was, for the all powerful Heavenly Daos to not dare touch him.\nLiam sighed heavily and decided not to think about it too much. He knew that with how things are going, he will definitely get there and he will learn everything about everything in his universe, those extremely powerful entities and the Grand Universe.\nBut for now, he has a supreme talent infusion process to undergo. Since the Dimensional Space and Earth were out of the option, he decided to go with the best possible option: the Thousand Mist Forest.\nHe immediately vanished from the suite and appeared at the entrance of the forest.",

      "content": "Chapter 131: Supreme Weapon Talent Infusion (Bonus Chapter 5/5)\nThe Thousand Mist Forest was silent as death. It was nightmare in the cultivation world, so there was no one at the entrance and probably very little chance of meeting anyone.\nLiam sighed and walked into the forest. He walked carefully, every footstep crunching against damp leaves and stone. Hours passed as he searched. His eyes scanned the twisting roots and gnarled trunks for a place that felt both secluded and defensible.\nAt last, he found it: a cavern mouth, jagged and dark, yawning like the maw of some ancient creature. He pulled out his phone, switching on the flashlight, and stepped inside. The beam of light swept over damp walls and long shadows. The deeper he went, the colder the air grew.\nHe observed his surroundings, spreading out his senses and making sure that he was careful. He had walked for a couple of minutes before he started hearing the sound of heavy breathing.\nIt was like a deep rumbling of breath, vibrating against stone.\nLiam froze and his first instinct was to retreat, but his eyes narrowed as the beam of his flashlight touched a hulking silhouette sprawled at the far end of the cave.\nThe Ironblood Bear.\nThe same beast he had fought on his very first night in this world. Its massive body shifted slightly with each breath, chest rising and falling like a living mountain.\nLiam’s lips curved into a strange smile. \"So it’s you.\"\nHe walked closer, cautious but unafraid. The bear stiffened, its breathing faltering for a moment, as though it sensed him even in its slumber.\nLiam frowned slightly, then smiled.\n\"Are you really sleeping or pretending to be asleep?\" He asked the bear.\nHe naturally didn’t get a response and wasn’t expecting to get one in the first place.\nHe smiled, as he lowered himself to the ground beside the massive creature, the cold stone pressing against his legs. Slowly, gently, he reached out and laid a hand against its fur, caressing it gently, but the beast didn’t move.\n\"You can sleep as much as you want,\" Liam murmured, his voice quiet but steady. \"But please... protect me. Just this once.\"\nHe wasn’t sure if it understood. Perhaps it didn’t. But his heart eased at the thought. He would face something terrifying tonight, something even he couldn’t fully comprehend. To have even the illusion of a guardian by his side was a relief.\nHe exhaled deeply, his nerves taut. \"System. Begin the infusion process.\"\n[Initiating infusion of Myriad Armament Constitution...]\nAt once, Liam felt like something broke inside him. It was like a dam shattering and a flood of power surged into his body.\nAnd immediately, the world around him began to change.\nThe bear’s eyes snapped open the next moment and it was filled with fear. It wasn’t just because of Liam’s figure, but the aura radiating from his body.\nIt felt that it was in danger and would die if it doesn’t get as far away from this human as possible, and it immediately made a run for it.\n***\nOutside the cave, across nearby sects and clans, disciples jolted awake in terror as swords unsheathed themselves from their racks.\nSpears rattled violently against walls, bows bent taut without arrows, and shields glowed faintly as if saluting an unseen master.\nIn forges, blacksmiths dropped their hammers as half-finished blades trembled in their fires.\nHigh above the Thousand Mist Forest, constellations blazed with unnatural brilliance. Swords, sabers, spears, bows, axes, and staves shimmered across the night sky, their outlines clearer than the stars themselves, burning like divine proclamations etched into eternity.\nWind screamed through the forest as a storm of metallic qi erupted. The very air turned sharp, filled with invisible blades. Mortals across the land clutched their chests as their blood surged, their minds swept by phantom war cries. For a moment, they felt themselves as soldiers again, marching to war.\nIn the heavens, Tribulation clouds boiled into existence, black and violent, thunder roiling in their depths. Yet they hesitated to strike. Instead, they churned uneasily, as though trying to smother the phenomena, to hide it from the eyes of the wider cosmos.\n***\nInside the cave, in Liam’s mind’s eye, he stood on an endless battlefield. Weapons rained from the heavens — swords plunging into the earth, spears falling like meteors, arrows blotting out the sky. Each weapon pulsed with its own Dao, pressing against him with suffocating force.\n\"This is... insane...\" he gasped, staggering.\nInstinctively, his hand reached for a sword. The instant his fingers closed around the hilt, knowledge flooded him — sword intent, slashing patterns, the Dao of sharpness.\nHe released it in shock, only for his hand to brush against a spear. Instantly the flow shifted — thrusts, momentum, the unstoppable force of piercing heaven and earth.\nAnd like that, every weapon he touched carved its Dao into his soul, their wills colliding, threatening to tear him apart.\nHis mind screamed under the weight. Yet something within him absorbed them, wove them together, began harmonizing the chaos into unity.\n***\nThe phenomena outside escalated, as the air around Liam quaked. Sword qi slashed outward, saber intent cleaved through stone wall of the cave, spear force drilled holes into the cavern walls, bow pressure bent the very air.\nWithin miles, cultivators and mortals alike staggered, feeling as though they stood on an ancient battlefield. Ten Thousand Echoes thundered in the fog, the clash of steel and cries of armies long gone. Phantom soldiers marched, banners snapping in ghostly wind.\nAround Liam, golden glyphs in the shape of weapons spun in orbit around him — Dao Manifestations, inscriptions of supreme weapon paths inscribing themselves into the void.\nThe Heavens could no longer hold back as lightning ripped the sky and crashed into the cave.\nThe first strike slammed into Liam’s chest, agony exploding through him. Flesh charred, bones fractured, and blood boiled. Smoke rose from his skin as his body convulsed violently.\n\"ARRGGHHHHH!\" He let out a raw, primal scream that shook the cavern.\nYet even as his flesh blackened, his regenerative traits did their job, as his body healed rapidly, with his torn muscle re-knitting and closing up.\nThe second bolt fell before he could recover completely. Then the third. Then the fourth.\nEach strike tore him apart and each strike rebuilt him. Death clawed at him again and again, and again he resisted, dragging himself back with sheer will.\nSweat and blood drenched him, his voice long gone and his throat raw from endless screams. His teeth clenched until they cracked.\n\"This... is... NOTHING!\" Liam roared through the storm, his voice thundering through it.\n***\nAn unknown amount of time passed and things started changing. The intensity of the lighting strikes reduced and same was for the phenomenons around the world.\nBut it wasn’t over as across the land, every weapon — from peasant blades to divine artifacts — tilted slightly, bowing toward Liam’s direction: the forest. Cultivators froze in terror as their weapons betrayed them, acknowledging a new master.\nAbove, the constellations themselves rearranged. The Sword Star stretched into a perfect blade. The Spear Star elongated, unbroken. Bow, axe, staff — each constellation shifted, as if declaring to all: a new wielder of every arm had risen.\nBut the intensity of the phantom army increased, as for dozens of miles, mortals and cultivators gasped in horror as soldiers of light and shadow continued to march with banners high, drums booming like war thunder, their weapons clashing in eternal battle.\nFrom Liam’s battered body, a pillar of golden light burst forth, streaked with rainbow hues. It tore into the heavens like a beacon.\n***\nBack in the cave, Liam’s body collapsed forward, steam rising from his skin. His chest heaved as the final bolt of lightning dissipated.\nThe golden runes slowly faded, the phantom armies vanished into mist, and the constellations dimmed to their normal state. The forest fell eerily silent once again.\nLiam opened his eyes and they gleamed with sharpness, as though countless blades lived within them.\nImmediately, he took the best possible action, as he vanished from the cave and appeared in his room back on Earth.",

      "content": "Chapter 132: The Aftermath\nGreat Yan Empire.\nThe night was anything but ordinary. It should have been quiet, with the moon casting its pale glow over mountains and rivers. But tonight, the heavens themselves had been torn open, and every corner of the empire quaked with dread and awe.\nThe sky over the Thousand Mist Forest had burned with divine light, constellations twisting and realigning as though rewriting fate itself. Across the land, from bustling capitals to remote villages, billions of eyes had lifted to watch. Now, chaos reigned.\nThe streets of every major city were flooded with people, their faces pale under the torchlight. Some trembled in fear, others whispered in excitement, but all of them looked toward the forest. The phenomenon was too vast to ignore.\nAbove them, streaks of light cut across the night sky. Hundreds—no, thousands—of cultivators flew in formation, each one like a falling star. From sect elders to wandering sword masters, from clan prodigies to rogue cultivators chasing luck, every person with even a spark of ambition surged toward the forest.\nThe air itself seemed to be filled with desperation.\nMortals, powerless to join the rush, clutched their families and muttered prayers. They had seen things no mortal should see: phantom soldiers marching through their streets, banners snapping in spectral wind, weapons trembling in their hands as if saluting an unseen master.\n\"Divine weapon...\" the word hissed from every mouth. \"The heavens have birthed a divine weapon.\"\nGreed drowned out fear. Though the Thousand Mist Forest was a nightmare few dared approach, tonight it became a beacon. They were willing to throw their lives into its jaws for even the chance of seizing what had been born within.\nAnd they weren’t alone. Orders had already been issued. Elders, masters, and patriarchs demanded results: Do not come back empty-handed.\n***\nInside the main hall of the Heavenly Sword Sect, one of the largest sect in the empire, dozens of elders sat in solemn silence. Their robes rustled faintly, being the only sound in the chamber apart from the crackle of incense fires.\nAt the head of the hall, the sect master sat unmoving, his expression unreadable. His presence was like a blade sheathed but sharper than any steel.\nFinally, one elder broke the silence. \"Sect Master... what do you make of it? Was this truly the birth of a divine weapon? Or... could it be something else?\"\nMurmurs rippled through the hall. None dared voice their thoughts, but the question hung heavily in the m air.\nThe sect master’s eyes narrowed, their depths reflecting the image of countless swords rising into the heavens. He exhaled slowly. \"It was not a weapon. It was a talent. A supreme weapon talent, birthed into this world.\"\nA chill swept through the elders. Supreme weapon talents were things of myth, passed down in tales but never seen in reality. To master one weapon was extraordinary. To master tow was sheer monstrosity. To master all weapons, to merge their Daos into one—such a thing had never been witnessed.\nHe continued, voice calm yet heavy with finality. \"Everyone rushing to the forest now will find nothing. Whoever bore that talent... they are no fool. If they had the courage to enter that forest, then they also have the wisdom to vanish from it before the world arrives.\"\nThe elders nodded, though unease lingered in their hearts. The same question echoed silently in every mind: Who was it? And what will they become?\n***\nFar across the empire, in the hall of one of the great clans, the atmosphere was very different. Where the sect was cautious, the clan was electric with ambition.\n\"They say the heavens have blessed us!\" one elder shouted, pounding the table. \"At last, we will secure the chosen one. The clan’s centuries-long plan will finally bear fruit!\"\nThe patriarch, seated at the head, smiled slowly as his fingers tapped lightly against the armrest, hi eyes gleaming with greed and ambition. Before he could speak, the air within the hall shifted violently.\nA vast pressure descended, heavy as a mountain. Then, from nothing, an old man materialized in their midst. His hair was silver, his back slightly bent, yet his mere presence made the hall tremble.\n\"Ancestor...\" dozens of voices gasped, falling to their knees.\nThe old man’s eyes swept the hall, crinkling into a smile. \"Do not waste this chance. Find the bearer of the supreme weapon talent. Spare no effort, no cost. Bring him into our clan. And if he refuses...\"\nHis voice sharpened, cutting like frost. \"...eliminate him. Quickly. The future of our clan depends on it.\"\nThe hall’s atmosphere grew solemn, all levity stripped away. Every elder bowed deeply, acknowledging the gravity of his command.\n***\nWithin the royal chambers of the Great Yan Emperor, silence reigned. The emperor himself sat at the highest window, his features handsome and sharp, though his eyes carried centuries of weight. He looked no older than thirty, but in truth, he had reigned far longer.\nHe stared into the night, gaze fixed on the distant glow of the forest.\nBehind him, a woman’s voice broke the silence. \"Your Majesty, one of the commanders has already dispatched troops. He prepares to enter personally. We cannot allow the clans to seize the one who bears this talent. If they succeed, their confidence will swell, and their schemes will accelerate.\"\nThe emperor’s lips curved faintly, though not in amusement. He shook his head. \"It is useless. The one responsible is gone. I cannot feel his presence at all.\"\nThe woman’s brow furrowed. \"Then... was he killed by the tribulation?\"\n\"No.\" The emperor’s voice was firm. \"Not killed. He has hidden himself. And soon... he will reveal himself again.\"\n***\nMeanwhile, on Earth.\nThe world was calm, ignorant of the storm raging in another universe. In Bellemere Mansion, Liam lay on his bed, chest rising and falling in slow rhythm.\nMore than thirty minutes had passed since he had returned, but his mind was still reeling from everything that has happened.\nHis muscles still twitched with phantom pain and his eyes still flashed with the memory of weapons falling from the sky, of phantom soldiers marching through mist.\n\"Myriad Armament Constitution...\" he whispered, flexing his fingers.\nEven now, when he closed his eyes, he felt the weight of countless weapons tugging at his soul.\nHe exhaled sharply, forcing calm.\nA knock at the door drew him back and Evelyn’s soft voice floated through. \"Sir, Daniel is waiting for you downstairs.\"\nLiam sat up at once. \"I’ll be there shortly.\"\n\"Yes, sir. I’ll inform him.\" Her footsteps retreated, leaving the silence intact.\nLiam pushed himself to his feet. His body still ached, but he moved quickly. He showered, letting hot water wash away the lingering scent blood, then dressed in a fresh set of clothes.\nBefore leaving his room, he paused. His gaze fell on the Gear Glass resting on his desk. The device was scorched, tiny cracks spidering across its surface — scars left by the heavenly lightning that had struck him.\n\"Not good,\" he muttered. With a thought, he stepped into the Dimensional Space.\nThere, under Lucy’s control, it was fixed in a second inside the molecular assembler.\n\"Good as new,\" Liam said softly, sliding it back into place, as he returned to his room and left his room, going downstairs to meet Daniel.",

      "content": "Chapter 133: JP Morgan’s Offer\nThe study was quiet, the soft glow of the chandelier casting a warm light across polished wood.\nLiam sat in his seat behind the desk, leaning back slightly, his expression calm but curious. Across from him, Daniel sat with his usual poise, the faintest trace of a smile on his lips.\nThey had already exchanged greetings. Liam had even joked that it was a surprise to see Daniel this early in the day. That joke, however, had carried a question hidden beneath it. A question he voiced directly a moment later.\n\"Is there a problem?\" Liam asked, his tone polite but sharp.\nDaniel shook his head immediately. \"No, sir. Nothing wrong. But... something came up. Something I thought I should bring directly to you before I make a decision on it.\"\nThat caught Liam’s attention. Daniel was not the type to come to him for every detail. He had already proven capable of managing dozens of things on Liam’s behalf without breaking stride. For him to come forward like this meant the matter wasn’t trivial.\nLiam’s interest deepened, and he leaned forward slightly, resting his elbow on the desk. \"Alright,\" he said with a small smile. \"Tell me.\"\nFor a moment, Daniel was quiet. He exhaled softly, then began.\n\"JP Morgan,\" he said. \"And UBS. And a few others like them. These banks prepare ready-made Family Office platforms for their UHNW and VVIP clients. It’s not widely advertised, but the infrastructure is always ready. They keep it in reserve for clients they fear losing to competitors. Especially clients they want tied closer to them.\"\nLiam tilted his head, already guessing where this was going.\nDaniel continued, his voice steady but carrying the weight of the matter. \"After your visit to the Rothschild’s private vault in Geneva, JP Morgan realized something; that they realized they might lose you. That was enough to set them in motion. They began building a Family Office for you right away. They leveraged every pipeline, every piece of infrastructure they had. And within a week, they had it set up.\"\nHe paused, letting the weight of those words sink in.\nLiam stayed silent. He knew how fast massive banks could move when they had to. Still, hearing it said plainly was something else.\nDaniel went on. \"They never told you about it. Their plan was to wait and to introduce the Family Office when they felt you were ready, or when you needed it. But here’s the twist; even after I resigned from JP Morgan, even after you stopped using their services, they didn’t dismantle what they built. They kept it waiting.\"\nLiam’s eyes narrowed slightly. \"And?\"\n\"Yesterday evening,\" Daniel said slowly, \"they contacted me. They said they are aware that I am building a Family Office for you. And that I should know... theirs is already finished.\"\nThe study was silent, as the faint tick of the clock on the far wall marked the only sound between them.\nDaniel leaned back slightly, as he continued, \"They told me this Family Office already has everything in place; corporate entities, trust vehicles, investment accounts, reporting systems, a skeleton team structure. They said it can be activated in one day.\"\nFor a moment, Liam said nothing. He leaned back in his chair and let out a slow breath. His eyes flickered with thought.\nHe wasn’t surprised. Not entirely. This was how huge institutions moved. This was how they protected clients they valued, clients they couldn’t afford to lose. Especially one as unusual as him.\nBut Liam had lived long enough even with his young age, and seen enough, to know the truth of society. Nothing came for free.\nEven when a gift was laid neatly on your table, there was always something hidden underneath. A string. A chain. Sometimes thick and obvious, sometimes thin as silk. But it’s always there.\nHe was cautious for a reason.\nJP Morgan didn’t set up a Family Office just to be generous. They wanted him tied closer. They wanted him dependent on their systems, their infrastructure, their staffs. That way, even if indirectly, they would always have a piece of influence over him.\nAnd Liam valued one thing above all: independence.\nHis plans for the future were vast. He couldn’t afford to be anyone’s pawn, or even give the illusion that he could be influenced. The government, the banks, the world itself — no one could be allowed to hold strings over him.\nThat was his concern.\nBut another truth pressed on him at the same time: using their scaffolding didn’t mean giving up control.\nHe thought of it like this: if someone else built a scaffold, he could still climb it to build his own fortress. He could use what was there. And then, when his fortress was complete, he could tear the scaffold away.\nHe will accept JP Morgan’s generous offer but he won’t accept the staffs that will come with the Family Office. They aren’t loyal to him or Daniel, but still ultimately employees of the company.\nNow, the key was in who he trusted to manage the scaffolding.\nHis gaze settled on Daniel, who was his shield and his filter.\nFinally, Liam spoken with a calm and almost casual tone, \"Accept it. Hut not their staffs.\"\n\"That’s exactly what I was going to recommend,\" Daniel said. \"I’m your filter. Nothing comes through unless I clear it. Which means we can take what’s useful, discard what isn’t, and stay in full control.\"\nLiam smiled and nodded slightly in approval.\n\"Sir, they’re doing this because they want to tie you closer. But what they don’t realize is they’re only helping you achieve what you want faster,\" Daniel said with a smile.\nHearing this, Liam couldn’t help but chuckled softly. He applauded himself inwardly for choosing Daniel. A man who not only understood, but articulated it plainly.\nEven though, like everyone else, Daniel still completely misunderstood his true background, he understood Liam’s intent.\n\"Good,\" Liam said finally. \"I will trust you to handle it.\"\nDaniel inclined his head. \"I’ll contact them tonight. By tomorrow, the Family Office will be ready. Staffed by my team, not theirs.\"\nLiam nodded. \"Perfect. I’ll be waiting.\"\nThere was a pause, then Daniel added: \"There’s one more thing. The Nevada site construction is finished. Everything is in place. You can begin whenever you want.\"\nLiam’s eyes brightened faintly. \"Perfect,\" he echoed.\nDaniel smiled, then stood. \"Then I’ll take my leave. I’ll bring you updates by tomorrow.\"\nLiam rose too, offering him a firm nod. \"Good work, Daniel.\"\nDaniel bowed lightly, then left the study.\nWhen the door closed behind him, Liam leaned back in his chair, silent for a long moment. His mind turned over everything that had just happened.\nJP Morgan’s move hadn’t surprised him, but still, it was impressive. He had expected his Family Office to take a month at least, to be built brick by brick. Instead, it would be functional tomorrow.\nIt was proof of something he was only just starting to grasp. The world of the ultra-wealthy moved at a speed most people couldn’t imagine. What took ordinary men years, took days for them.\nAlso, the Nevada site was ready. His industrial base complete. Which meant he could finally begin building the commercial version of the Gear Glass.\nAnd with the Family Office ready tomorrow, he could launch whenever he chose.\nHe leaned back further in his chair, a wide smile spreading slowly across his face, at the satisfaction at how everything was working out faster than expected.\nHe stood, leaving the study and walking toward his room. His steps were unhurried, but his mind was burning with momentum.\nThere were still a lot of things for him to do. He couldn’t just sit around all day.",

      "content": "Chapter 134: Putting Plans Into Action\nThe door clicked shut behind him with a soft finality. Liam turned the key in the lock, then exhaled and let his shoulders relax. He stood there for a moment in silence, then let his body vanish into the Dimensional Space with a thought.\nThe shift was instantaneous, the weight of Earth’s atmosphere replaced with the vast emptiness of the barren realm.\nLiam reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone. His face hardened as he saw the damage again.\nThe device was scorched beyond recognition, its casing cracked and blackened as if it had survived a fire. Smoke damage marked its edges, and faint lines of burn traced across the screen like lightning scars.\nHe pressed the power button out of habit, though he knew the result; nothing happened as the heavenly tribulation lightning had fried it completely.\nLiam sighed.\nReplacing it would be the easiest thing in the world for him. Money was no issue anymore, as he could buy ten thousand new phones if he wanted. But this wasn’t about money.\nThis phone carried pieces of his life — his new life. His contacts. His friends’ numbers. Daniel’s. Every message, every log, every trace of communication. He couldn’t just throw that away like broken glass.\n\"I have to fix it,\" His said, as his gaze softened.\nHe already knew it would be simple. The molecular assembler could replicate anything given raw materials. Also, Lucy had backups of every bit of information in his phone.\nShe had told him long ago that she was automatically copying his phone’s memory into her database — \"just in case something ever happened.\"\nAt the time, he thought it was unnecessary. But now, staring at the ruined device, he realized her foresight had been flawless.\nYes, the phone itself had its own cloud backups. But Liam had never once considered using them.\nWhy? No reasons exactly.\nStill, as he turned the device in his hands, another idea sparked in his mind; why even bother keeping this as my main device?\nHis endgame for the Gear Glass was that it was going to replace phones, laptops, and every other personal device. A single interface, one ecosystem, seamless, independent and untraceable. The tribulation destroying his phone only gave him more reason to accelerate that plan.\nHe would repair the phone, yes. He would need it as a backup. But from now on, the Gear Glass would become his primary device.\nDecision made, he walked across the barren expanse of the Dimensional Space until the sleek outline of the molecular assembler loomed before him.\nLiam placed the ruined phone into its intake slot. He didn’t need to give Lucy instructions.\n\"Already on it,\" her calm voice echoed softly in his head, through the Gear Glass.\nLight flared inside the machine as it worked. Within seconds, the assembler chimed and the compartment opened with a hiss.\nLiam reached in and pulled out a brand-new phone, identical to the old one, except it looked pristine with no scorch marks or cracks.\nHe pressed the power button, and the screen lit up instantly, coming to life as though it had never been touched by heavenly fire.\n\"Perfect. Just like new,\" he smiled, turning it over in his hands.\nAdmiring Lucy’s work, he made a mental note: Never to keep the Gear Glass on me during a tribulation again. If even his phone could be fried, then carrying the Glass during one would be catastrophic.\nThat thought sparked another decision and he immediately have instruction to Lucy.\n\"Lucy, create the next phase of the communication layer.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Lucy responded immediately. \"I’ll update the ecosystem.\"\nThe next phase of the communication layer will enable the Gear Glass to make calls — video and voice. This also includes VR/AR meeting or conference call.\nThis was something he intends to launch after some time. Maybe a few years after the release of the Gear Glass. It was part of the broader quantum ecosystem. But why wait? As developer, he could use it now.\nWhile Lucy went to work, Liam turned his attention to his next task. He picked up his restored phone and sent Daniel a message.\n\"Send me interior pictures and video of the Nevada industrial base and the warehouse. Also exact location.\"\nThe reply came almost instantly.\n\"Sending now. Do you plan to visit?’\nLiam typed back quickly, \"Yes. But don’t accompany me. Focus on the Family Office.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nPhotos and videos streamed in a moment later. Liam flipped through them, studying the cavernous warehouse where his raw materials were stored, and the gleaming industrial base that had just finished construction. The scale was impressive.\nHe memorized the coordinates and closed his eyes.\nIn an instant, his figure vanished from the Dimensional Space. Andhen he opened his eyes again, he stood inside the warehouse.\nThe air was cool, tinged with the metallic scent of steel beams and freshly delivered crates. Rows of raw materials stretched before him — super sacks stacked on pallets, metal drums or fiber drums,.wooden crates with shrink wrap for bars and ingots. All waiting for him.\nThis was why he hadn’t wanted Daniel to come. Because what he intended to do now was something no one could witness.\nLiam raised his hand and used his telekinesis. The raw materials trembled, then rose from the ground, levitating in neat stacks, as though held by invisible cranes. With a thought, he disappeared again — the materials vanishing with him.\nBack in the Dimensional Space, Liam placed the stacks of raw materials down into the open compartments of the molecular assembler.\nHe turned next to the obsidian table where bars of gold, palladium, platinum, and lutetium where neatly stacked, and he extended his hand.\nOne by one, the bars lifted into the air and glided toward the assembler like offerings to a hungry god. He directed them into the compartments, where they slotted neatly alongside the other raw materials.\nAs the final bar was placed in the compartment, he smiled. \"Lucy. Are you done with the communication layer?\"\n\"Yes,\" Lucy replied. \"System updated.\"\nSatisfied, Liam gave the next command. \"Good. Then use everything I just loaded to produce as many Gear Glass units as possible.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nWhile Lucy worked, Liam tested the new Gear Glass functions. After Lucy’s update, in the user lobby, besides the game apps, he could see several new apps.\nWith the new function, Liam can now browse the internet — going on any social media platform — make calls and send SMS.\nThis was completely unlike before when the device was just a gaming gear. Now, it was even better than a phone. But the device’s new function wasn’t what was important right now\nThere were still things left undone. Two, specifically.\nFirst, like he planned yesterday, he needed to train his telekinesis — push it to its absolute limit. He had been using it lightly until now, but today, with the Space’s time dilation, he could devote himself entirely.\nSecond, he had to test the new talent; the Myriad Armament Constitution.\nJust thinking about it made his pulse quicken. To wield every weapon, to master every Dao, to merge them into a supreme path — it was a gift few in any universe could imagine.\nLet’s get started, Liam said as he picked up Silverleaf from obsidian table.",

      "content": "Chapter 135: Telekinesis Limit\nSince awakening his ability, Liam hadn’t truly explored it. Yes, he had used it for minor conveniences — levitating objects, moving things without effort — and of course during his desperate battle against the Ironblood Bear.\nBut aside from that, he had never once unleashed his telekinesis without restraint, never tested the limits of what his body, mind, and talent could handle.\nBut that was going to change.\nHolding Silverleaf loosely in his hand, Liam tightened his grip once before letting go. The blade floated upward, held aloft by the invisible grip of his will. It hovered steady, the faint edge catching what little light the Dimensional Space had to offer.\n\"Let’s begin,\" Liam smiled.\nHe turned away from his workstation — the area where his three most valuable pieces of equipment were neatly arranged: the molecular assembler, the molecular analyzer, and the national data center–grade laptop. These weren’t ordinary tools; they were the foundation stones of his empire.\nHe couldn’t afford to risk them.\nYes, he has more than enough money now to replace even the three equipment. But recklessness wasn’t his style. If he was going to go all out, he needed distance.\nThe barren expanse of the Dimensional Space stretched endlessly in all directions\nSilverleaf floated beside him as he moved, the sword gliding smoothly through the empty air like a faithful companion.\nAfter a few minutes, impatience stirred in him. He still had far to go, and walking felt too slow. Liam grabbed Silverleaf out of the air, held it for a moment, he lowered himself into the runner’s stance, every muscle coiled like a spring.\nHe counted silently. Three. Two. One.\nAnd then he exploded forward. The sound cracked through the Dimensional Space like a cannon blast.\nThe sound was thunderous, a booming crack that rippled through the dry plain. The ground fractured under the pressure of his first stride, dust exploding behind him in violent plumes.\nEven with the Dimensional Space’s thin atmosphere, his acceleration tore through the air, leaving shockwaves in his wake. The thin air tore against his skin in sheets, howling past his ears.\nThis was the second time Liam had truly tested his raw speed. His Gear Glass display blinked with data, courtesy of Lucy’s tracking.\n174 mph.\nA grin split his face. He leaned forward, pumping harder, and the numbers climbed.\nIt climbed way past 200mph and was still increasing. Liam didn’t slow down as he continued pushing himself, curious to find out the limit of his speed.\nThe plains blurred into indistinct streaks of gray and black. The sound became a constant roar, shockwaves rippling in his wake with each thunderous footfall. Loose stones shattered beneath his steps, exploding outward like shrapnel.\nHe continued to push himself even further. His muscles surging but his breath remained steady and calm.\nHe started feeling the strain when his speed reached 300mph, as it started becoming increasingly difficult for him to increase it. He could feel the resistance, with his body screaming that he was nearing the edge.\nBut Liam didn’t give up, ignoring the warning as he pushed, harder and harder, every muscle fiber burning, every nerve firing like lightning, forcing his speed to continue increasing until it finally settled at 320mph.\nHe knew that this was his current limit as no matter how much he pushed, strained, no matter how he poured his will into his body, it didn’t climb higher.\nEven then, he didn’t stop. He maintained the blistering pace for over an hour, tearing across the wasteland like a storm.\nBy Lucy’s calculations, he had been running for more than a hour and had already covered the equivalent of the entire sprawl of Los Angeles and back, yet when he finally stopped, he wasn’t even winded. No ragged breath or even the faint feeling of exhaustion.\nAll he was feeling was just raw exhilaration.\n\"What are my limits, really?\" He laughed softly to himself, stretching his shoulders. The thought thrilled him.\nSatisfied with the distance from his workstation, Liam turned his attention to the next phase.\nSilverleaf floated before him once more, its edge gleaming faintly as it spun lazily in the air.\nBut Liam wasn’t satisfied with simple levitation. He needed destruction. He needed to push his telekinesis into chaos.\nHe raised his leg high, then slammed it into the ground with everything he had.\nBoom!\nThe impact thundered across the barren valley. The stone beneath his foot cracked, splintering into jagged fractures that raced outward. Shards and dust burst into the air as rocks tumbled from the force.\nAgain he stomped.\nBoom!\nThe cracks deepened, spreading wide, until the ground gave way into a shallow crater. Dust plumed upward, hanging thick in the still air.\nLiam exhaled, feeling quite pleased.\nNow for something bigger.\nHe extended his hand. At once, dozens of stones ripped free from the ground around him, hovering in a wide circle. Pebbles to small boulders rose like puppets on invisible strings, spinning slowly at first, then faster.\nThe rocks orbited him like planets, grinding against one another with sharp, grating sounds. The pressure mounted in his mind, with a heaviness behind his eyes. His jaw clenched as he fought to stabilize them.\nBut he wanted more, as he pushed himself even harder. He intends to see the limits of his superpower and he wasn’t going to allow this slight discomfort to stop him.\nThe ground shuddered as several enormous slabs of stone tore free, each the size of a small car. They hovered unsteadily, trembling in the grip of his will. Sweat trickled down his temple as the strain escalated. His temples throbbed and his vision blurred for a moment.\nHis mind screamed at him to release them, but Liam refused. His teeth bared as he forced his will outward, balancing the colossal boulders against the hundreds of smaller stones already spinning.\nSlowly, painstakingly, the formation stabilized into a storm of stone circling him like blades around a god of war.\nThe sight alone would have driven ordinary men to their knees.\nAfter a few minutes he reached his absolute limit as blood started trickling down his nose. With a final exhale, he clenched his fist.\nBOOM!\nThe storm erupted, as stones of all sizes shot outward in every direction, detonating into the wasteland like artillery fire.\nExplosions tore the ground apart, geysers of dust and debris rising high. Craters pockmarked the plain as shockwaves rattled through the air.\nThe storm was gone in seconds and silence returned, broken only by the very faint patter of settling dust.\nLiam’s chest rose and fell. His body was fine — strong, stable, unshaken. But his mind trembled violently, his thoughts quivering at the edge of collapse. His temples throbbed as though someone had driven nails into them.\nStill, he was smiling brightly because he had done it. He had discovered his limits. For now, at least.\nLiam lowered his hand, exhaling slowly. He has already accessed his telekinesis and its limit. He could now control multiple objects at once, their combined weight surpassing ten tons.\nNot only that but he seems to have something called a telekinetic sense, which allows him to \"feel\" the outlines of objects around him, giving him a 360° awareness of his surroundings.\nHis current limit with this ability was currently a perception radius of 20m. This means that actually \"see\" 20m around him even with his eyes closed.\nAnother ability Liam noticed he has, was being able to create a telekinetic field or shield made of compressed force around him.\nThe field can be focused just around him or spread as wide as the range of his telekinetic sense.\nLiam currently has no idea how strong the field is but with the force he’s feeling in it, he feels that it should be strong enough to block a bullet. He feels that next time, he should test the field ability to see its limit.\nThough the major thing he feels he’s still lacking is lacking is more finer control of his telekineses when controlling multiple large objects.\nBut that would be for another time as he has strained his head too much for that today. He decided to rest for a while to allow his brain recover.\nHe clean his bleeding nose and sat for a few minutes, letting the storm inside his mind quiet. His breathing slowed, the tremors fading.\nThen, at last, he turned back to Silverleaf. The sword floated before him once more.\nLiam extended his hand, pulling it gently into his grasp.\n\"Now, let’s see what one can do with an all-ecompassing weapons talent,\" he muttered to himself.",

      "content": "Chapter 136: A Monster Was Born\nLiam was still standing in the middle of the crater he had created by stomping the ground with all his strength.\nDust lingered in the air, clinging to his skin and hair, though his body hardly seemed to register the mess.\nSilverleaf glinted faintly in his hand, its edge alive with anticipation, almost as if it, too, were waiting for what came next.\nHe tightened his grip around the hilt. His chest rose and fell, calm but steady, while his mind whirred with expectation.\nHe could already achieve so much with telekinesis alone. The storm of stones earlier had proved that. The potential was vast, and he knew he had only scratched the surface.\nBut the Myriad Armament Constitution was something else entirely.\nIt was no ordinary gift. It was a supreme-grade talent, with infinite potential, one that legends would be built upon. A talent capable of turning him into the embodiment of all weapons, the master of every Dao of combat.\nHe exhaled slowly, clearing his head of stray thoughts. There was no need for distractions now.\nHis eyes snapped shut and he focused entirely on the sword in his hand, as if the whole barren realm had collapsed down into a single line of steel.\nThe air shifted.\nAt first, it was subtle. It was a tingling in the atmosphere at first, but in the next heartbeat, it sharpened. The stillness of the Dimensional Space transformed into something biting and dangerous.\nIt was sword intent. It was extremely faint but it was undeniable.\nIf any cultivator had been present, they would have collapsed to their knees in terror. Sword intent was the fourth stage of sword mastery, the threshold where one stepped beyond technique and touched the Dao itself.\nTo wield sword intent was to embody the will of the blade — inevitability, sharpness, the principle of severing. A cultivator could spend decades in pursuit of that enlightenment and still fail.\nAnd Liam had manifested it, faint though it was, he did it without cultivation, without training and ever having walked the path.\nHe opened his eyes and the sharpness intensified. The air around him prickled as if invisible edges were brushing against exposed skin.\nSilverleaf vibrated faintly in his hand, resonating, as though it had finally found a wielder worthy of its name.\nLiam raised the sword slightly and he let instinct guide him, and a slash came down.\nUnlike what one would think, it was not random slash. It was impossibly smooth, refined, efficient — a motion no beginner should be capable of, yet carried out with the ease of breathing. Silverleaf seemed to sing as it cut downward.\nDust and loose stones in the arc of the swing didn’t scatter. They were sheared cleanly in half. On the ground, the mark was unnatural in its perfection: a single, flawless line etched into the barren stone, as though carved by a master artisan with divine tools.\nLiam’s lips curved into a smile. He hadn’t expected much from that first strike. He had never touched a real sword before, outside of Eternal Realms.\nThere was something Liam seemed to have realised; it wasn’t just the talent. His Formless Combat Doctrine was moving alongside it.\nThe stance he had taken before swinging, hadn’t been deliberate. It had been instinctive, unconscious, but strangely perfect. Too perfect if he’s to say.\nPerhaps it was because his main weapon in Eternal Realms had always been the sword. The experience, the habits, the countless hours of virtual combat — all of it carried through into this body, fused with his Perfect Memory and amplified by the Myriad Armament Constitution.\nAnd the result? A monster was created.\nLiam let out a quiet laugh. He wasn’t being arrogant, neither was he flattering himself. It was simply the truth.\nPerfect Memory meant he could replicate any technique he saw, no matter how complex, down to the smallest detail. The Formless Combat Doctrine gave him adaptability, the ability to flow like water through combat styles, never rigid, never predictable. And now, the Myriad Armament Constitution meant every weapon, every Dao of steel, would come to him as if it were his birthright.\nTogether, they formed a triad of perfection.\nUnstoppable\n, Liam thought, his grin widening.\nBut he wasn’t finished. He wanted to see more.\nClosing his eyes again, he gathered his telekinesis, shaping it carefully. He wrapped it around Silverleaf like a sheath, compressing the invisible force until it matched the blade’s every curve and edge. Then, with a sharp exhale, he slashed downward once more.\nThis time, the result was staggering.\nThe cut on the ground was deep — deeper than before — perfectly smooth, as if the earth itself had submitted willingly to the strike. The combination of raw telekinetic force and sword intent magnified one another, creating a resonance that felt... limitless.\nLiam stared at the mark and nodded, satisfaction warming his chest.\n\"This is only the beginning,\" he murmured.\nHe looked at Silverleaf again, the sword floating up slightly from his hand, as if eager for the next command. For a moment, he let it hover there, spinning lazily in the air, before dismissing it with a thought.\nHis gaze drifted across the wasteland until it landed on one of the massive craters left behind by the earlier storm of stones. He walked toward it, his legs crunching against loose rubble.\nAt the crater’s edge, a jagged boulder sat half-buried, easily weighing several kilograms. He extended his hand.\nThe boulder trembled, then ripped free from the earth with a crack, dust and debris scattering as it floated into the air. Slowly and steadily, it drifted toward him.\nWhen it was close enough, Liam reached up and caught it casually with one hand, hoisting it onto his shoulder as if it weighed nothing.\nLiam couldn’t help but laugh to himself, as he knew this was only the start.\nThere were still countless weapons to test, countless Daos to touch. Sword intent was just the beginning. Spears, sabers, bows, axes, staves — all of them waited within the Myriad Armament Constitution, each ready to unfold in time.\nHe didn’t know how long it would take, or what trials he would face, but one truth had already rooted itself firmly in his heart.\nHe would never again be ordinary and he would never again be bound by the limits that chained others. The future — his future — was his to carve.\nShifting the massive rock on his shoulder, Liam turned and broke into a sprint across the barren plains. The workstation waited far in the distance.",

      "content": "Chapter 137: LUCID\nLiam gently lowered the massive rock onto the floor of the Dimensional Space, setting it down a safe distance from the towering molecular analyzer. The weight shook the ground with a muted thud, scattering dust across the barren surface.\nHe broke off a small piece from it, opened a compartment of the molecular analyser and placed it inside.\nLucy already understood what he wanted, as she started scanning piece of rock.\nLiam walked to the molecular assembler and opened the finished products’ compartment. Inside it, dozens, hundreds, no — a sea of polished devices filled the compartment, stacked with perfect symmetry.\nWith just a glance, he already counted a lot. Lucy had already given him the specific numbers, which was 1,054,845 Gear Glasses. Some of them were of different colour but all of the same design.\nA bright smile coloured his face, as he stared at the Gear Glasses, then the molecular assembler. It just keeps telling him that his $100m was more than well spent.\nHe reached into the compartment and took one Gear Glass out of the compartment and observed it.\nThe device looks perfect. Flawless. A piece of technology that looked like no different from a piece of accessory back on Earth.\nThe device was ready for use as it is, as Lucy had already flashed the OS onto it. Liam can give or sell it to whoever he wants as it is, without a problem. But he can’t do that. The device needs packaging. He’s not going to launch the product without a packaging.\n\"Lucy, do we have enough stock to fabricate biodegradable packages for these?\" he asked.\nHer reply was immediate. \"Yes. The fragment you placed in the analyzer is sufficient. With a bit of transmutation, the raw elements can be reshaped. I can produce more than enough for both the devices and their packaging.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam said, then turned back to the massive rock, and he suddenly thought of something.\nHe walked to it and with a single fluid motion he cleaved a chunk from the stone, with Silverleaf. The sword sliced through the rock like a hot knife through butter.\nLiam crouched, picked up the chunk with both hands, and carried it back to the assembler. He let Silverleaf float beside him, suspended by telekinesis, before raising the rock high and crushing it between his palms, as he held it just a bit over the open compartment.\nDust, bits and pieces of the chunk of rock fell into the compartment. Liam saw this and nodded to himself in satisfaction. He closed the compartment and Lucy immediately got to work, fabricating the biodegradable packages.\nHe didn’t need to tell her the color he wants the packages to be, and designs he wants on it, as she already knew.\nBlack, with a radiant Quasar in the middle. As for the official name of the device, Liam decided to call it LUCID and the company it will be released under will be NOVA.\nYeah, he’s awfully aware of how horrible his naming sense is.\nWhile Lucy was working on that, Liam decided to share his thought with her.\n\"Lucy,\" he said slowly, \"I think we should create an assembly line here. A permanent one. You could mine the resources directly, feed them into the assembler, and mass-produce whatever we need without me manually carrying rocks around.\"\nLucy replied, her voice thoughtful. \"It is a solid idea. But, Master, it is an inconvenience for you. You’re already stretched between two worlds. Your time should not be wasted on things I can manage.\"\nLiam nodded when he heard this. What Lucy said was true. He will be launching the Gear Glass within the week or in a week, and there will be quite a bit of things has to take care of, even with Daniel and the Family Office help.\nAlso, there’s the cultivation world. Even though he wasn’t currently focused on it, there are still little things he can do there.\n\"So what do you suggest?\" he asked. He knew that she already has a better idea, with the way she saw the flaw in his plan.\n\"I will build the assembly line, just as you planned. But until it is complete, I will be the one to manage the workload. To do that...\" She hesitated, then continued with conviction. \"I will need to create a body for myself.\"\nLiam frowned slightly when he heard this. It wasn’t that he didn’t like the idea. He love it. He would actually love to have Lucy as a physical companion in the cultivation world and also in future, when he goes to the magical universe.\nThe reason why he frowned was because he was wondering why he didn’t think about it in the first place. As for if he trusts Lucy enough for her to have a physical body? Yes, he completely do.\nIt would be weird if he doesn’t. Lucy has handled a lot of things for him over the past two weeks since she was created. She has proven her usefulness and loyalty time, and time again. And Liam can’t forget how genuinely worried she was when he disappeared from the space on his first world traveling.\n\"You can go ahead with the idea, Lucy. Start working on it after you’re done with the packaging,\" he said, as he gave his permission.\n\"Thank you, Master,\" Lucy said, with a genuinely warm tone.\nLiam chuckled, shaking his head. He never got used to her calling him that.\n\"Will you have enough elements stock to build it?\" He asked.\n\"I will need to transmutate a lot of the available elements to get but I will definitely get enough. More than enough,\"\n\"What kind of body will you build?\" he asked curiously.\n\"Human,\" Lucy answered without hesitation. \"It will look, feel, and behave like one. But with enhancements. With your permission, I will access your knowledge through the Gear Glass and use it to integrate features.\"\nLiam raised a brow. \"Such as?\"\n\"Anti-gravity systems,\" she said simply. \"So I can fly. Reinforced musculature. Energy cores for endurance. I want it to be extremely powerful. I am taking inspiration... from a villainous character in a certain movie.\"\nLiam nodded in agreement. He agreed with the features Lucy wants to give her body. He can’t exactly have her weak, especially when he intends to take her to a dangerous world.\nAs for accessing his knowledge, she can do that through the Gear Glass and he has already given her limited permission to use whatever knowledge she wants.\nBesides the fact that the Gear Glass is a highly advanced gaming gear and more than a phone, there are hidden benefits it has, especially to someone who has Lucy.\nThey are:\nShared learning: if Liam learned something once, Lucy learned it instantly.\nSkill mirroring: she could simulate his combat instincts, his strategies, his techniques.\nParallel processing: she could study one thing while he focused on another, doubling their efficiency.\nError correction: she could refine his approaches, optimizing them beyond human limits.\nOut of the four, Liam’s currently has been making use of the first two. The last two are of no use to him.\n\"Finish the packaging and seal the devices inside. Let me know when it’s done.\" he said, as grabbed Silverleaf by the hilt, and placed it on the obsidian table.\n\"Yes, Master,\" Lucy replied.\nLiam nodded and left the Dimensional Space.",

      "content": "Chapter 138: Fated?\nAfter taking his bath, Liam decided to go back to the cultivation world. It was barely noon here on Earth, yet with the time dilation and difference between the worlds, he guessed that far more had passed on the other side.\nBy his own rough estimate, perhaps a full day — maybe even more. And after what he had caused with the infusion of the Myriad Armament Constitution, he wasn’t sure if the storm had passed completely yet.\nStill, there was nothing pressing for him here. The Family Office would still take the whole day before it’s activated; Daniel had that under control. His friends were probably occupied with one responsibility or another, buried under family obligations or expectations.\nWith that thought, Liam vanished from his bedroom and appeared in the VIP suite in Great Yan Empire.\nHe walked across the room to the open balcony, pushing aside the heavy drape. The view below stretched wide: streets lined with lanterns, tiled roofs stacked like waves, banners fluttering in the faint wind.\nThough the sky was dark, the streets were alive. Dozens — no, hundreds — of figures moved below.\nSo it’s night here... yet the city is awake.\nHe turned back inside, closing the drape. He couldn’t help but be curious about how time felt slippery between these two worlds.\nHe left the suite and descended the wide staircase into the lodge. The place was lively. Busier than the first day he had come. The main hall was filled with the clatter of chopsticks, the smell of roasted meats, and the low murmur of conversations.\nAn attendant, the same one who had served him on his first day, noticed him at once. His eyes brightened and he hurried forward, bowing with far more enthusiasm than before.\n\"Honored guest!\" the man greeted, voice full of respect. \"Congratulations on your breakthrough!\"\nLiam tilted his head slightly, offering a smile. \"Thank you.\"\nThe words were polite, but in his mind, a question burned.\nBreakthrough? Can he sense the aura from the faint aura surrounding me?\nAfter his training, Liam noticed that he was unconsciously releasing a faint aura that’s sharp and domineering at the same time.\nHe had done his best to conceal it afterward, drawing it inward until it was fain until it was barely perceptible. Yet the man’s greeting made him wonder if traces still leaked out. Or perhaps the attendant was simply parroting rumors.\nNot that he had any intention of hiding his power. He despised that. He would use his strength whenever necessary and would never allow himself to be walked over or treated as a pushover because of some random nonsense.\nHe wasn’t here to seek anyone’s favor. But at the same time, he couldn’t go around flaunting himself in a way that would invite a mob. After all, they say the tallest tree is the one that gets hit hardest by the wind.\nEither way, Liam didn’t dwell on it. The attendant’s words, though, did confirm something.\nIt’s morning here\n, Liam thought to himself curiously. He had thought that it was night but it was morning. Probably midnight or predawn, as the sky was still dark.\n\"How many days remain on my lodging?\" he asked.\nThe man smiled. \"Five full days remain.\"\nLiam frowned faintly. That meant almost a month had already passed here. \"How many days has it been since I booked the room?\"\nThe attendant blinked, surprised at the question. But he quickly smoothed his expression and replied, \"Honored guest, you arrived at little more than twenty-five days ago.\"\nLiam nodded slowly, absorbing this.\nTwenty-five days here... yet only four days have passed on Earth. That means the ratio is at least six to one, maybe more.\nThe thought made him thoughtful.\nIf I stay here two full days and compare, I’ll have a clearer picture.\nHe thanked the attendant and turned toward the door.\n\"Honored guest, please be careful,\" the man said suddenly.\nLiam paused, glancing back. The concern in the man’s eyes was real. He didn’t need to ask why because he already knew. It was because of the storm he had caused with his talent infusion.\nStill, He was kind of curious to know what the people of this world thought happened.\n\"Tell me. What do people say happened that night?\" He asked the attendant.\nThe attendant hesitated, then leaned closer, lowering his voice. \"They say... a supreme treasure was birthed in the Thousand Mist Forest.\" His eyes shone faintly with awe as he continued, \"The heavens themselves announced it. Phenomena spread across the empire — phantom armies, blazing constellations and the lightning tribulation. The world believes... it was an Immortal-grade weapon. Perhaps the first seen in generations.\"\nLiam listened in silence.\nThe man pressed on, clearly caught up in his own words. \"Naturally, the great sects and clans all moved. They sent people into the forest, flooding Blackstone and other border cities. But when they arrived...\" His expression shifted. \"The treasure was gone. Someone claimed it before they even reached the place.\"\nHis voice dropped to a whisper. \"No one knows who.\"\nLiam’s lips twitched faintly. An Immortal treasure, huh? Well, not entirely wrong. He had read enough cultivation novels to know this was a reasonable assumption. The phenomena had to be explained somehow, and what else but a supreme weapon could stir such a storm?\nBut Liam also knew better. The world wasn’t full of fools. There were surely old monsters in seclusion, ancient cultivators whose senses pierced deeper than most. Those ones, at least, would guess the truth.\nHe inclined his head to the attendant. \"Thank you.\"\nThe man bowed deeply. \"It is my honor.\"\nLiam pushed open the lodge doors and stepped into the night air.\nDespite the predawn hour, Blackstone City bustled like a great market in full swing. The tension in the air was unmistakable.\nSo I shook them this much.\nHe took a long breath, savoring the crisp bite of the air, then chose a direction at random and began walking, and the streets swallowed him quickly.\nHis steps slowed when he heard a voice. It was a familiar and iritating one. His brows furrowed, as his eyes narrowed toward the sound.\nAhead, under the light of a tall lantern, a group stood gathered. At their center, dressed in fine robes far too gaudy for the early morning, was a youth Liam recognized immediately — the Xuan family young master.\nLiam exhaled slowly, his patience thinning.\nOf course. But why is it always me?\nThe boy stood with his nose tilted high, attendants clustering at his side. But what drew Liam’s attention most was the man standing a step behind him. He looked older, broader and his aura far heavier. His gaze was sharp and his stance was poised.\nHe was clearly not a servant, but a protector. A senior of the family, or at least a hired expert tasked with keeping the young master safe amidst the chaos in the empire.\nLiam smiled wryly internally in the faintest exasperated smile.\nAm I cursed to attract every troublemaker I brush against? Is this fate? Am I fated?\nThe young master turned at that moment, his eyes locking on Liam. His expression twisted instantly in recognition of the person standing from of him.\n\"You!\" he spat, voice sharp enough to cut the night air.",

      "content": "Chapter 140: A Surprise Encounter\nAfter the little squabble with the Xuan family young master, Liam continued walking deeper into Blackstone city.\nThe streets of Blackstone City breathed with an energy that felt paradoxical at this hour. Predawn should have meant stillness, the quiet lull before the first vendors roused their voices, but instead the city pulsed with life.\nLanterns burned along the main avenue, their golden glow staining tiled roofs in amber. Thin mist clung to the stone roads, curling low like restless serpents as feet and hooves stirred it.\nThe air smelled of spice and smoke. Roasted chestnuts popped over open braziers; skewers of meat sizzled on iron grills.\nMerchants in plain hemp robes shouted prices, hawking steamed buns, healing salves, talismans inked in fresh cinnabar.\nPredawn in Blackstone wasn’t a lull at all — it was more like an opening act.\nLiam walked through it with steady steps, his gaze roaming from stall to stall.\nHe lingered for a moment at a herbalist’s booth, his eyes narrowing at bundles of dried leaves hanging like inverted fans. Their scents mingled — bitter, sharp, pungent.\n\"So many unfamiliar plants,\" he muttered under his breath. His mind ticked immediately to his plan: buy herbs, acquire ores, bring them into the Dimensional Space, let Lucy tear them apart molecule by molecule.\nEspecially the ores.\nIf their elemental structures mirrored those on Earth, good. He could cross-reference, replicate, maybe even mass-produce new alloys. But if they didn’t? If they contained compounds unknown to Earth? Then he’d be holding keys to a treasure chest that no one else in his world could open.\nHe wants to see if he can replicate them with the molecular assembler. It would be an interesting situation, if the molecular assembler can break down and build things of the cultivation world. It would make it a broken piece of tech. And the truth was that, Liam was really looking forward to it.\nOf course, he knew one boundary even Lucy might not cross: Qi. Spiritual energy wasn’t something the molecular assembler could replicate. It wasn’t bound by chemical formulas or periodic tables. But everything else — herbs, ores, fibers — those were fair game.\nThe thought made his blood stir with excitement.\nBut herbs and ores weren’t the only reasons he’d returned.\nLiam’s mind drifted to another plan: the sects.\nHe had read enough to understand their structures, though he knew books rarely captured truth. Hierarchies, inner and outer disciples, trials of merit, sect missions — obligations that tied one’s life to another’s command.\nFor someone like him, the thought was uncomfortable. He valued independence. He valued the ability to act on his own terms. Sect obligations would tangle his freedom with chains of duty, chains he couldn’t always cut.\nAnd yet... he couldn’t deny the benefits; backing, resources — not he would be needing their resources, legitimacy.\nA sect would shield him, at least publicly, and open doors that would otherwise remain closed. Especially for someone like him — an outsider, a \"nobody\" in this world with no cultivation to prove his worth.\nJoining one of the major sects would be ideal, he thought, pausing before a blacksmith’s shop where iron bars glimmered in the dim light.\nBut can I even get in? Without cultivation?\nThat thought gnawed at him. The system had given him the Myriad Armament Constitution, but not yet the ability to cultivate. Would it, eventually? Or was he destined to walk a different path altogether?\nThe questions spiraled, but Liam’s attention snapped sharply elsewhere; someone was following him.\nIt wasn’t paranoia. His telekinetic sense stretched in every direction, painting a perfect awareness of the twenty meters around him. Every lantern post, every barrel, every shifting cloak of a passerby appeared in his mind’s eye like outlines in the dark. And amidst it all, one presence had always lingered — steady, careful, too careful.\nHe stopped walking. Turned his head slightly. \"How long do you plan on following me?\" His voice was calm, but the words cracked like a whip.\nSilence followed but the presence didn’t move.\nLiam’s jaw tightened. He pivoted smoothly and strode toward the corner where he knew the figure stood cloaked in shadow. His steps echoed sharply against the stone, scattering the mist as he closed the gap.\nHe stopped a pace away and glared directly into the gloom. \"I asked you a question. What do you want with me?\"\nA faint ripple shimmered in the air, like a veil disturbed. And then — she appeared.\nA girl, no older than sixteen or seventeen by appearance, stood frozen in disbelief. Her hair shimmered silver-blue under the lantern’s light, cascading down her back like moonlight spun into silk. Her eyes — wide, luminous, faintly violet — locked onto his face with stunned disbelief.\n\"You... how?\" she whispered. Her voice trembled, not with fear, but with shock.\nLiam frowned. \"How what?\"\n\"You shouldn’t have been able to see me,\" she breathed. \"My concealment is flawless. No mortal, no ordinary man without cultivation should...\"\nHer words cut short as realization struck her.\nIllusion\n, Liam thought, the word hitting his ears with weight. He hadn’t seen her. His telekinetic sense had simply outlined her shape, her breathing, her presence within his radius. He had no idea she was cloaked in an illusion at all.\nBut her reaction told him plenty.\nCuriosity prickled through him. He tilted his head, studying her features, the aura of her movements. He’d read of such things before, in those cultivation novels. A particular race famed for their illusion arts, for their beauty, for their mysterious ties to the Immortal Realm.\nHe let a slow smile curve his lips. \"You’re Moonlight Fox, aren’t you?\"\nThe girl’s eyes widened like saucers. Her hand twitched as though she meant to retreat, but she stayed rooted, staring at him as though he had just ripped open her secrets.\nLiam chuckled softly. \"Looks like I hit the mark.\"\nThe Moonlight Fox race. Demons of legend. Illusionists said to be bound to the Immortal Realm itself, rarely walking the mortal plane.\nHe had read that some of the lower demon race occupys the core areas of Thousand Mist Forest, far from places like Blackstone City.\nBut the Moonlight Fox race isn’t a lower demon race. So why was one standing here, trying to shadow him?\nThe question burned in his mind, but Liam didn’t voice it. He had no time for this. He had herbs to buy, ores to test, factions to investigate. His path was his own, not tangled in demon races or their mysteries.\nHe exhaled and turned, dismissing her with a wave of his hand. \"Stay out of my shadow. I won’t warn you twice.\"\nHe had taken three steps before her voice called out, sharp and desperate.\n\"Wait!\"\nLiam stopped, his back still to her.\n\"How did you break it?\" she demanded, her voice carrying raw urgency now. \"No one without cultivation has ever seen through my illusion. Ever. Not even Qi Refining cultivators. How did you do it?\"\nHer words caught him off guard. He turned slowly, eyes narrowing. She truly believed it was impossible.\nIllusion?\nhe thought again. His telekinetic sense had simply mapped her, nothing more. He hadn’t broken anything — he had bypassed it unknowingly.\nBut for her to react like this meant her skill was genuine, and rare. And that meant she wasn’t just some wandering demon girl.\nThe air grew heavy with silence between them, until Liam finally asked, his tone flat but probing: \"What are you trying to pull?\"\nBefore she could answer, a ripple ran through Liam’s instincts. It was sharp, immediate, a deadly premonition. His muscles coiled and his body moved instantly.\nHe vanished.\nThe girl gasped as the space before her shimmered. A heartbeat later, cold fingers wrapped around her throat from behind.\nLiam’s grip was like iron, unyielding as he pinned her with his presence.\nHer violet eyes flared in panic as she choked out, \"W-what are you—?\"\nLiam leaned closer, his voice low, dangerous, vibrating against her ear. \"I asked you once already. What do you want with me?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 141: A Surprise Encounter (2)\nThe girl’s breath hitched as Liam’s grip tightened against her throat. Her hands rose instinctively, fingers clawing at his wrist, but she couldn’t pry him off. His strength was immovable — like steel clamped against her flesh.\nHer violet eyes glowed faintly in the gloom, wide with disbelief. No one had ever caught her like this before. Not even cultivators years ahead of her realm. And yet this man — this mortal — had pinned her as though she were a child.\n\"Answer me,\" Liam said coldly, his voice even but sharp. \"Why are you following me?\"\nShe trembled but forced her lips to move. \"I... I wasn’t—\"\nLiam squeezed just slightly, cutting her words into a choked gasp. He leaned close, his eyes like blades. \"Don’t lie. Not to me.\"\nHer pulse thundered in her neck, against his fingers. For a moment, silence stretched between them, broken only by her struggling breath and the distant cries of merchants down the street.\nThen she gave in, her voice cracking with urgency. \"I... I was curious,\" she said, still struggling to draw breath due to Liam’s hold on her neck.\n\"Curious?\" Liam asked, with a slight frown on his face. He wonder what she was curious about, but he can already guess that she’s not hostile to him, from how she’s acting.\nHe slowly released his grip on her neck and stepped back a bit, still making sure to put his guard up.\n\"So, what were you so curious about that made you trail me like a criminal, instead of straight up walking up to me and ask?\" Liam asked, with all of his attention on her, watching for any sudden suspicious movement.\n\"Since you know how my race, then you must know why I can’t be seen in public,\" the girl replied, massaging her neck to ease the pain she was feeling.\nLiam’s brow raised slightly when he heard this. His knowledge on demon races like the Fox race, or the Moonlight Fox, was from web novels. And those things were people pure imagination, laced with some existing lores back on Earth.\nAnd this person in front of him isn’t fiction, neither is she of the monster race in Eternal Realms, she’s a living, breathing being.\nBut Liam do remember some lores about them being hunted by humans for things that makes up their very existence. He felt this might be what she was talking about.\n\"You mean they will hunt you down?\" He asked.\n\"Yes. It’s worst with the fact that I’m a half-blood. Someone neither race wants,\" she said with a wry smile.\nLiam nodded slowly, as he had gotten something from her.\nSo, she’s a half-blood. I guess that would explain why she’s in the lower world. But if she’s under so much danger from humans, what is she doing here? And why was she following me?\n\"You still haven’t answered my question. Why were you following me? What do you want? What were you curious about?\"\n\"Like I said before, you broke my concealment illusion which I’ve always prided myself with; though I’m not full-blooded,\" she replied.\nLiam didn’t say anything, but gave her a stare that said, \"continue.\"\n\"I saw how you easily took down a late stage Qi Refining realm cultivator, even though you have no shred of cultivation and I didn’t sense you use any technique. You didn’t even make use of the aura surrounding you. I got curious and followed you secretly. Then you broke my illusion, which is impossible for someone that has no cultivation. And again, you look unique. Besides the faint, sharp aura surrounding you, there’s something else.\"\n\"Something else like what? Please be straightforward. I’m not much of a fan of mysteries,\" Liam said.\n\"There’s something strange about you. It’s like you’re not of this world,\" she said.\nLiam frowned slightly when he heard this. The fact that she can sense the faint aura from his talent wasn’t surprising. Even though she’s half-blooded, the Moonlight Fox race is very perceptive. But what he didn’t expect was her sensing that he wasn’t from her.\nHe would had just easily dismissed the last part if it was said by someone else. But not from someone with that bloodline. Though, of course, that didn’t mean that he was going to admit it.\n\"Is that so? Ok then, you can be now be on your way since you have satisfied your curiosity. You don’t want someone finding out your identity, do you? As for me, I’m quite busy and can’t entertain distraction,\" Liam said, turned and started walking in the direction of one of the stores selling herbs, and pills.\nThe girl saw Liam walking away and immediately chased after him. She caught up to him and walked beside him, smiling.\n\"You aren’t leaving without even introducing yourself or allowing me to do so? That’s rude and not a way to treat a lady,\" she said with a sulking face.\n\"Says the person who was stalking me,\" Liam said, not slowing his steps.\nThe girl paused and looked at Liam’s back for a while, with a bit of surprise on her face, before chasing after him again.\n\"Interesting. Illusions don’t work on you. Charms too. You’re quite unique.\"\nLiam paused his steps, as he frowned deeply at the girl.\n\"You tried to charm me?\" He asked with a cold voice.\n\"I didn’t mean anything bad by it. I was just—\"\n\"Don’t even dare say that you were curious. Don’t even dare. I let you off easy the other time, doesn’t mean I will do the same again. Stay away from me,\" Liam said, with a strong tone of finality, before walking away.\nHe doesn’t wants to get entangled with things like the feud between the human race and the demon race so early. He hasn’t even done or achieved anything. Throwing himself into a troubling situation isn’t his thing. And so, he wants nothing to do with the Moonlight Fox girl.\n\"I’m sorry for trailing you like that. I was wrong. The truth is that I thought that since you’re different like me, I would be able to get closer to you, even though you’re a human. I guess we aren’t different. I won’t disturb you any longer,\" she said, and started walking in the opposite direction, cloaking herself in her illusion.\nLiam paused his step and turned. He saw that she was no longer there, though he could still \"see\" her with his telekinetic sense. He sighed internally and walked into the store.\nHe has no idea if he will meet her in the future but if they do, he hoped it’s under better condition.\n***\nInside the store, Liam was greeted by a man at the desk.\n\"Welcome, esteemed customer. What would you like? Herbs? Pills?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 142: Charges\nThe scent of dried herbs still clung faintly to Liam’s clothes as he stepped out of the apothecary.\nThe wooden door closed behind him with a muted creak, muffling the cheerful voice of the shop attendant who had just bowed him out with more respect than he’d shown when Liam entered.\nInside, the man had been surprised — almost shocked — by Liam’s casual wealth. A single customer walking in and asking for \"a bit of everything\" was unheard of.\nEven rich young masters from cultivation families came with attendants, argued prices, and sniffed at quality before buying a handful of pills or rare roots.\nLiam, however, had swept through the aisles with calmness, lifting jars of pills and bundles of herbs without hesitation, stacking them like someone picking groceries rather than treasures.\nThe sales attendant had nearly lost his composure when the total tallied to six hundred and forty-three gold coins.\nLiam had simply withdrawn the exact sum from his storage, set it down without comment, and tucked the purchases away into his space. There was no bargaining, flinching or need to count twice.\nNow, as he walked into the predawn air, Liam’s expression was composed, but his mind was filled with satisfaction. These herbs and pills were not for immediate use.\nThey were samples to be usef to collect data. Lucy would analyze them in the molecular analyzer, breaking down their structures to the last atom, comparing them to Earth’s plants and compounds. He wanted to know: would the assembler be able to replicate them?\nIf yes, then the cultivation world had just handed him a limitless edge.\nIf not, then perhaps Qi-infused flora truly lay outside the reach of molecular science. Either way, the results would be invaluable.\nHe adjusted his pace, hands clasped lightly behind his back, letting himself blend into the flow of people along the main street, as he continued walking deeper into the city.\nLiam was just beginning to consider which district to explore next when a voice barked sharply.\n\"You there. Stop.\"\nHis brows furrowed.\nA squad of city guards blocked the road ahead. Their armor gleamed faintly under the lantern light, steel plates lacquered black with the insignia of Blackstone — a roaring lion clutching a spear.\nThey were ten in number, halberds leveled casually yet menacingly across the street to halt the flow of pedestrians.\nTheir leader, a man with a hooked nose and narrow eyes, stepped forward. His bearing was stiff, his voice loud and commanding.\n\"Present your identification token.\"\nLiam stopped, gaze flicking once across the squad, as his expression remained calm.\n\"Identification token?\" He asked.\n\"Yes,\" the leader sneered. \"All recognized citizens, sect disciples, or registered merchants carry them. Blackstone City does not tolerate vagrants or suspicious characters wandering its streets. Present your token, or leave.\"\nIdentification token?\nLiam frowned slightly. He wondered why they were asking for something like that, but he guess it was most probably related to the commotion he caused last night.\nAs for the identification token, he remembered Zhou paying for that along with his entry fee. He immediately took it out of the Dimensional Space and presented it to the guard.\nThe captain sneered and scoffed when he saw the wooden piece in Liam’s hand.\n\"That scrap? That’s nothing more than a visitor’s toll. It proves you paid to enter, nothing else. I asked for a true identification seal. Sect, clan, or merchant registry. Do you have one?\"\nLiam’s frown deepened. So Zhou’s token was just an entry pass, not the kind of proof they were demanding. He had nothing more to show them. And from the sneer on the captain’s face, it was clear that even if he had, they would find another excuse.\nHe understood now. This wasn’t about tokens. This was probably related to that Xuan family young master. He remembered that the Xuan family is close to the City Lord’s.\nPoliteness cost nothing\n, he reminded himself.\nBetter to test their intentions first\n.\nLiam was aware that even if this was orchestrated by the Xuan family young master, he still have to play an act at being civil with the guards, unless they give him a reason not to\nHe inclined his head and spoke evenly, \"I have no token. I do not belong to any sect. I am a wandering merchant, traveling between cities, seeking opportunities to trade. Nothing more.\"\nMurmurs rippled among the crowd that had begun to gather, and the guards exchanged glances.\nThe leader’s lips curved into a mocking smile. \"Suspicious indeed. A so-called ’merchant’ with no goods, no stall, no registry? Lies. For all we know, you’re a demonic cultivator in disguise.\" His voice rose deliberately, loud enough for the crowd to hear. \"Blackstone City will not harbor such filth. Since you cannot prove your identity, you will leave immediately. We will escort you to the gates.\"\nLiam’s eyes narrowed. Escort me? His instincts prickled sharply, warning him. If he stepped outside the city walls under their watch, ambush was inevitable.\nHis patience thinned but he held himself back as he chuckled internally,\nSo this is how they want to play it.\nIt doesn’t need to be spelt out for him, for him to know that the two people who he had spared and had warned never to cross paths with him again, were now seeking retaliation.\nIt made him greatly regret sparing their lives. He had wanted to take care of them thoroughly but he found it extremely difficult to do. Killing someone was something he has never done and has no idea if he will ever be able to do it. It was also the same reason he had spared the Ironblood Bear.\nHe lifted his gaze back to the leader, his tone polite and sharp, \"I won’t be going anywhere.\"\nThe leader’s smile widened into a sinister one, as if he had been waiting for this refusal all along.\n\"Very well,\" the man said mockingly, his voice ringing out. \"You cannot blame me for what comes next.\" He spun to his men, barking loud enough for half the avenue to hear:\n\"By order of the City Lord, this man is under arrest! He refuses lawful inspection, fails to provide sect affiliation, and dares defy Blackstone’s guard. For all we know, he is a demonic cultivator hiding among us. Bind him!\"\nGasps erupted from the bystanders. Demonic cultivator; those in cahoots with the demon race. The accusation alone was enough to blacken one’s reputation permanently. To mortals, it was a death sentence. And to cultivators, it was justification to kill without trial.\nLiam’s expression darkened, though his voice stayed calm. \"If the City Lord wishes to see me, he can come himself. I do not answer to lapdogs. If you press this further, don’t blame me for what follows.\"\nThe leader’s eyes gleamed with cruel delight. He had his opening he had wanted from the very beginning.\n\"What insolence!\" he bellowed, his tone dripping with fake outrage. \"You dare slander our noble City Lord — the very pillar of Blackstone — by calling his loyal guards lapdogs? Treasonous words!\"\nHe turned dramatically to the crowd, stabbing a finger toward Liam. \"By the authority of the City Lord, I declare this man guilty of sedition! He is an enemy of the Empire itself!\"\nThe crowd erupted into whispers, panic and fascination mingling. Some faces turned pale; others lit with greed at the thought of rewards for helping apprehend a ’criminal’, especially after the bust of the supreme treasure hunt.\nThe guards moved as one, halberds leveled, boots striking the cobblestones as they advanced.\nLiam sighed inwardly, shaking his head slightly. So this is what it comes to? Manufactured charges public humiliation and force disguised as law.\nHis instincts sharpened to a razor edge. He could feel both paths laid bare: outside the city waited an ambush that reeked of blood. Inside the city, false charges and chains of ’law’ awaited. There was danger no matter where he stood.\nBut he was not about to bow. Not even to the City Lord himself.\nHe let his hands fall loosely at his sides, posture deceptively relaxed. His gaze swept over the guards, then over the gathered crowd, before settling coldly on the leader.\n\"Come, then,\" Liam murmured, his soft voice audible to everyone around. \"Let’s see if you can bind me.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 143: Act Like The Romans When In Rome\nThe street was silent, save for the scrape of steel against stone as ten halberds lowered in unison. Their polished blades gleamed in the lamplight, a jagged wall closing in on one man.\nLiam stood at the center of the avenue, hands loose at his sides, expression calm as a quiet sea. His gaze swept across the guards, then to the gathering crowd, then back to the narrow-eyed captain who glared at him like a wolf about to pounce.\n\"Bind him!\" the captain barked. His voice carried over the rooftops, sharp as a hammer strike.\nThe squad made their move, as they rushed at him.\nOne guard lunged first, halberd thrust straight for Liam’s chest, aiming to kill and not to subdue. The steel tip should have punched through flesh and bone, but it didn’t.\nThe weapon froze mid-thrust, suspended inches from Liam’s sternum as if the air itself had turned solid. The guard’s arms trembled, veins bulging, his entire body straining to force it forward.\nLiam didn’t move, as he glared at the guard. He could clearly see the intention to kill in his eyes and from his actions. He really wanted to retaliate accordingly and also kill him, but he knew that he would only be escalating the issue by doing so.\nAlso, he understood that if he really go ahead and kill the guard, then there will be no coming back from it. He would be a killer forever. He has no idea if he was willing to handle something like that on his conscience yet. Besides, there was a saying back on Earth, killing a killer doesn’t reduce the number of killers in the world. It remains the same.\nBut while he won’t kill them, doesn’t mean that he would let them off lightly. He immediately took action and with a flick of his wrist, the halberd ripped free from its wielder’s grip. The weapon spun across the street, embedding into a stone wall with a deafening crack.\nLiam moved, concentrating the field around his hand, he took a step forward and slapped the guard hard on the chest, causing his breastplate to crumpled and he was sent flying back.\nThe guard crashed into the stone wall, right next to his halberd. He coughed up a mouthful of blood, as he stared at Liam with a face with a face drained of colour.\nThe captain frowned, a little taken aback when he saw this. He was actually the personal guard of the City Lord’s son, before the young master left to join one of the major sects in the empire.\nHe had sparred with him after he came back. Though he was utterly defeated, which was natural, he still remembered that fight vividly. The difference between himself — a seasoned cultivator in the 8th stage of Qi Refining — and the young master, who had only been an outer sect disciple for a year and achieved the 3rd stage of Foundation Establishment, was like heaven and earth.\nThat was the power of the great sects. They molded even their lowest disciples into monsters. The young master’s aura alone had been enough to crush him, and his techniques were refined beyond anything a city guard could hope to touch.\nAnd yet... The way this stranger — this so-called \"wandering merchant\" standing before him — moved, the invisible force that had stopped the weapon and the force of that slammed one of his men to the wall, leaving him in a near death state, the calm sharpness in his eyes... it stirred the same instinctual dread the captain had felt that day sparring the young master.\nHe ground his teeth, trying to smother the unease tightening his chest. No... impossible.\nThis boy has no cultivation. I can’t even sense Qi within him. There’s no way he could rival a sect disciple.\nBut still, his gut whispered danger to him.\n\"Together!\" the captain roared, treating the feeling as an illusion.\nThe rest of the squad closed in, boots hammering the cobblestones. Steel arcs swept in from every direction, a cage of death meant to shred him.\nLiam exhaled slowly, then he raised his hand.\nImmediately, an invisible force exploded outward. The cobblestones cracked in spiderweb patterns. Dust and lantern-light twisted in a cyclone.\nFive guards were hurled back instantly, slammed against nearby walls so hard their armor screeched. Their halberds clattered uselessly across the street.\nThe remaining four staggered but stayed on their feet, teeth bared. Two slashed downward in tandem, their weapons slicing through the haze of dust.\nLiam stepped forward. His hand rose lazily — and the halberds wrenched from their hands, twisted midair, shattered like brittle sticks and fragments rained down like hail.\nThe guards froze, stunned, their palms shaking in pain and bleeding where splinters had cut deep in them.\nLiam took a step and brushed past them without a glance.\nThe captain knew that he had made a mistake offending who he shouldn’t have, when he saw how Liam easily took down nine of his remaining men. But the arrow had been shot from the now, and could no longer be retrieved. He has to see this through to the end. Even if he loses, he trusts the young master to step in personally.\n\"Enough!\" He roared.\nHis aura surged like a tidal wave, oppressive and heavy, forcing weak among the bystanders to stumble back. Cultivation energy rippled outward, thick as oil, smothering the air. He revealed his level — late Qi Refining, 8th stage.\nHe leapt, halberd raised high, it and his body glowing faintly with Qi. His strike descended like thunder, aimed to split Liam in half.\nBut Liam didn’t flinch.\nHis telekinetic field was already in place. The halberd slammed into it with a booming crack — and stopped dead. The captain’s arms shook violently, veins bulging as he poured strength into the strike. But the weapon might as well have struck a mountain.\nLiam’s eyes narrowed faintly. With one hand, he reached up, caught the haft barehanded and snapped it in two.\nThe captain’s face drained of blood when he saw this.\nBefore he could retreat, Liam reached out his hand, gripped the air in front of him and an invisible force gripped the captain like a giant’s hand, and slammed him into the ground.\nThe cobblestones cratered under the impact. The captain coughed blood, his body trembling as he struggled to rise — only for Liam’s invisible grip to press him down harder. His knees buckled until he was forced to kneel, armor screeching against the stone.\nThe crowd had gone silent. Not a breath stirred. Even the guards who still stood dared not move.\nLiam stepped closer, his presence radiating like an unseen blade pressed to every throat. His eyes, cold and sharp, locked onto the broken captain.\n\"This,\" Liam said quietly, his voice carrying to every corner of the street, \"is your warning.\"\nThe captain’s teeth ground together, but he couldn’t lift his head. The invisible weight kept him kneeling.\n\"If the Xuan family,\" Liam continued, voice like iron, \"or the City Lord, or any lapdog in this city dares accuse me falsely again... I will not stop at mercy. Only death.\"\nThe words slashed through the silence sharper than any blade. The crowd shuddered as if struck by winter wind.\nThen Liam released the pressure. The captain collapsed forward, gasping. His halberd lay in broken pieces beside him, useless.\nLiam turned away and was about to walk away, but a voice stopped him in place.\n\"To openly challenge both the City Lord and the Xuan, you must either be courageous or stupid. Well, all that doesn’t matter as I will make sure to take you in and make you pay for insulting my family’s name, the City Lord’s. I wonder if you consider me his son a lapdog,\" the voice said, releasing his aura, showing his cultivation that was at the 3rd stage Foundation Establishment.\nLiam sighed internally when he heard this. He has really had enough of the tomfoolery. Enough of this crap.\nI guess I will have act like the Romans when in Rome. If this world only understands force, then force it will get.\nWithout even waiting for whoever it is to attack, he turned towards him disappeared from his spot, appearing instantly in front of him.",

      "content": "Chapter 144: Choices\nFang Xiu’s breath caught in his throat as Liam appeared in front of him like a phantom. One heartbeat he was yards away, the next his face filled Fang Xiu’s vision. The movement was too sharp, too fast and he wasn’t even able to follow it with his senses.\nImpossible\n, Fang Xiu thought, his pupils narrowing to pinpricks. He’s just a mortal...\nBut there was no time to dwell. Liam’s fist blurred toward his face. Fang Xiu reacted on instinct, raising his forearm to block.\nThe impact cracked like thunder. Pain shot up his arm, rattling bone and muscle, and his feet scraped backward against the cobblestones. His boots gouged deep lines before he forced himself to a stop.\nThe crowd gasped in unison. A Foundation Establishment cultivator had been driven back — by a single punch.\nFang Xiu’s jaw clenched. His pride, his family name, his entire aura of superiority bristled under the humiliation. He roared, the sound shaking lanterns on their poles, and drew his longsword. The blade sang as it left the scabbard, gleaming with threads of Qi that shimmered like fireflies along the edge.\n\"You dare raise your hand against me?\" Fang Xiu’s voice was sharp as the blade itself. \"I’ll carve you into pieces!\"\nHe lunged, sword thrusting like lightning. The tip aimed straight for Liam’s heart.\nBut Liam wasn’t there anymore. He tilted his body a fraction, the sword sliding past so close it tore the hem of his sleeve. In the same motion, Liam’s fist slammed into Fang Xiu’s stomach.\nBoom!\nFang Xiu’s breath exploded from his lungs in a spray of spit. His body folded around the blow and staggered backward, the sword nearly slipping from his grip. He gagged, sucking air into burning lungs, eyes watering from the pain.\nBut Liam didn’t give him time to recover. He stepped forward, expression flat, eyes cold, and struck again.\nFang Xiu blocked desperately, his sword flashing in frantic arcs. Sparks showered the air as steel collided with telekinetic pressure fields. His blade howled through the night as he poured Qi into every swing, each strike heavy enough to split a boulder.\nAnd yet... every blow slid off Liam as though he were striking the ocean itself. Each cut missed its mark, deflected by invisible force, or simply dodged with effortless movements.\nWhat is he?!\nFang Xiu’s mind screamed.\nI can’t even touch him!\nLiam, by contrast, never wasted a movement. His fists, elbows, and knees slammed into Fang Xiu’s body one after another, each blow landing precisely as he wanted them and with sickening sounds.\nCrack! Thud! Boom!\nFang Xiu’s rib snapped under a hammering punch andhis jaw whipped sideways as Liam’s elbow smashed into his cheek. His knee buckled when Liam drove a kick into his thigh, the force rippling up his spine.\nBlood spattered across the stones. Fang Xiu staggered like a puppet on broken strings, his fine silk robes shredded, his sword arm trembling violently. His aura still flared, but it was frayed, unstable, bleeding away under the onslaught.\nThe crowd erupted into chaos. Some cheered in disbelief, others shrank back in terror, while cultivators in the audience stared with wide eyes in disbelief, and some with looks of interest.\n\"That’s Fang Xiu! The City Lord’s son!\"\n\"He’s being... beaten!\"\n\"By a mortal?!\"\nFang Xiu’s pride howled louder than his pain.\n\"Enough!\" he bellowed, summoning everything he had left.\nHis sword blazed, Qi pouring into the steel until it glowed white-hot. He spun, unleashing his strongest technique — a sweeping arc meant to cleave Liam in two.\nThe cobblestones cracked from the force. The crowd flinched, shielding their eyes from the glare.\nBut Liam simply raised his hand. His telekinetic field tightened like a vice, and the blade stopped dead. It hung frozen mid-swing, no matter how Fang Xiu strained.\n\"You...\" Fang Xiu gasped, veins bulging as he poured more Qi into the strike. \"You can’t... stop me!\"\nThe sword shivered, groaned, then snapped. The sound echoed like a gunshot. Half the blade clattered uselessly to the street. Fang Xiu stumbled back, staring at the broken hilt in horror.\nBefore he could react, Liam’s fist plowed into his face. Bone crunched. Blood burst from his nose. Fang Xiu reeled, and another punch crashed into his ribs, another into his stomach, another across his jaw.\nBoom. Boom. Boom.\nEach strike landed like a drumbeat, relentless and merciless. Fang Xiu’s screams turned to wet gurgles as blood filled his mouth and his aura sputtered.\nBy the time Liam grabbed him by the collar and hurled him across the street, Fang Xiu was barely recognizable. His silk robes were torn to rags, his face swollen and bloodied, his limbs limp. He crashed into a wall with a bone-jarring thud and slid down in a heap.\nThe crowd fell silent, stunned into breathless awe.\nFang Xiu groaned, forcing his body to rise. His pride wouldn’t let him stay down. He spat blood, staggered forward, and raised his broken sword like a child brandishing a stick. His body trembled, but he still glared at Liam with defiance.\n\"You... can’t... defeat... me...\"\nLiam’s eyes narrowed. He stepped forward, his body blurring, and in a blink he was before Fang Xiu again. His hand shot out, wrapping around the young master’s throat like an iron band.\nFang Xiu’s eyes bulged as his feet left the ground. He kicked wildly, arms flailing, broken sword clattering uselessly to the stones. Blood dribbled down his chin as he clawed at Liam’s wrist, but the grip was unyielding.\nThe crowd gasped, some covering their mouths, others shrinking back. A few cultivators whispered urgently, wondering if Liam would truly dare kill the City Lord’s son in the middle of Blackstone City.\nLiam’s gaze was ice. His arm held steady, lifting Fang Xiu like a rag doll. His mind was calm — too calm.\nShould I end it here?\nhe thought. One squeeze, and it’s over. But would it really be? The truth was that he was pissed and this was the first time he’s been pissed in a month.\nHe tightened his grip slightly, enough to make Fang Xiu’s face purple. The young master’s eyes rolled, his nails scraping helplessly at Liam’s arm.\nBut if I kill him...\nLiam’s thoughts sharpened.\nThere will be no going back. The Fang family, the City Lord, the sect backing him — they’ll all come for me. Blood will drown this city, and my name will be branded with murder.\nHe stared into Fang Xiu’s terrified eyes, watching the last threads of arrogance unravel into pure, unfiltered fear.\nThe silence was suffocating. Even the crowd held their breath, waiting.\nLiam’s grip stayed firm, but his thoughts wavered like a blade on the edge of a choice.\nKill him. Or let him live.",

      "content": "Chapter 145: Choices Made\nLiam’s fingers tightened slowly around Fang Xiu’s throat. The young master’s body writhed like a fish dragged from water, his arms flailing uselessly against the unyielding grip.\nHis bulging eyes reflected pure terror, but Liam’s own face remained calm — unnervingly calm, as if carved from stone.\nThe crowd stood frozen, breaths caught, their hearts pounding so loudly it seemed to echo across the cobbled street. Everyone, including even the cultivators hidden among them felt their stomachs sink. No one moved and no one spoke.\nAll they could think was that same one question: \"Is this nameless stranger truly going to kill the City Lord’s son in broad daylight?\"\nInside, Liam’s mind was in turmoil. His thoughts spun like knives, weighing every pro and con.\nKilling him means burning bridges, painting myself as an enemy of authority. Every sect, every clan with ties to Blackstone will put their eyes on him. And yet... letting him live means repeating this farce tomorrow.\nI’ve given them chances. Too many.\nHe wondered if he was ready to shoulder what would come after either decision.\nIt was then that the familiar voice slipped into his head, the same voice that had spoken to him back in the restaurant.\n\"Do not kill him.\"\nLiam stiffened, though only slightly. His eyes narrowed, but his grip did not slacken.\nThe voice continued, \"Killing the City Lord’s son here will paint a target on your back far larger than you realize. I can see that you are not afraid of their anger, but I can also see that you have too much to do, to be bogged down by petty vendettas. Since you have spent so much time contemplating it already, you might as well let him go. Mercy, for now, is the sharper blade.\"\nLiam’s jaw tightened, the cords in his neck straining. His inner conflict showed only in the faint tremor of his fingers against Fang Xiu’s skin.\n\"Mercy?\" he murmured in his thoughts, almost amused.\nI gave them mercy. I gave them warnings. I let them walk away when they should have died. And yet, here they are again, yapping at my heels like dogs too stupid to recognize the wolf in front of them.\nHe closed his eyes for a brief moment, sighing inwardly. Then, instead of loosening, his grip grew firmer.\nThe captain’s eyes widened. He had been watching silently, frozen by the oppressive weight of Liam’s presence, but now, realization stabbed into him like cold iron. This stranger was not going to let Fang Xiu live.\n\"Stop!\" the captain roared, his voice cracking under the strain. His aura flared like a torch, his veins bulging as he staggered forward. \"If you kill him, you’ll doom yourself! Do you understand? That is the City Lord’s son you hold in your hand! Kill him, and you will suffer a fate worse than death! The Fang family will never let you rest! The City Lord himself will flay your soul and scatter your ashes! Put him down now!\"\nThe crowd gasped, their fear climbing another notch. To invoke the City Lord’s name directly was no light matter.\nBut Liam only smiled — a cold, humorless curve of his lips that made every onlooker’s stomach turn. His eyes glinted like sharpened steel as he stared at the captain.\n\"Then bring it on,\" Liam said softly. His tone was calm, yet it rang like thunder across the silent street. \"Let the City Lord come himself. I’ll be waiting.\"\nAnd with a sharp twist of his wrist, the street echoed with a sickening crack.\nFang Xiu’s body convulsed once, then went slack. His bulging eyes glazed over as life fled from them, the final spark of arrogance and defiance snuffed out in silence.\nThe crowd recoiled in horror. Some screamed. Others stumbled back. Mothers shielded their children’s eyes, while hardened cultivators sucked in sharp breaths. The air was filled with the metallic tang of fear.\nThe captain froze for only a second, then rage consumed him. His face twisted into something monstrous, veins crawling up his temples.\n\"Bastard!\" he bellowed, his voice breaking with fury. \"Kill him! Avenge Young Master Fang!\"\nThe surviving guards, their eyes bloodshot with grief and fury, let out a chorus of shouts. Halberds were raised and boots thundered against stone, as they charged as one.\nBut Liam didn’t wait this time and he didn’t restrain himself either. He had already crossed the line. There was no going back.\nWith a flick of his hand, invisible force erupted outward like a tidal wave. The first two guards were ripped from their feet, their chests caved in as though struck by boulders. They hit the wall with wet crunches and slid down lifeless.\nAnother swung his halberd, screaming, aiming to split Liam in two. The blade froze mid-swing, trapped in the unseen grip. Liam twisted his fingers.\nThe guard’s own weapon reversed in his hands, driving clean through his chest. His scream was cut short, replaced by a gurgle as blood poured from his lips.\nThe rest faltered, fear flashing in their eyes, but rage drove them onward. They closed in, four at once, their halberds stabbing from every angle.\nLiam’s hand rose lazily. The weapons shattered before reaching him, splintering into shards that whistled through the air like arrows.\nThe shards tore into their wielders, ripping armor and flesh alike. The guards staggered, blood pouring from a dozen wounds, before crumpling to the cobblestones.\nThe captain was the last. His aura flared and he let out a roar and hurled himself forward, pouring everything he had into one final strike.\nBut Liam had no interest in toying with him, as an invisible force slammed into the captain mid-leap, crushing him to the ground with bone-snapping force.\nHis body spasmed as Liam’s telekinesis twisted, snapping bones one after another until his armor crumpled like paper.\nThe man let out a final, strangled scream before his skull cracked against the cobblestones, silencing him forever.\nSilence followed. A heavy, suffocating silence that swallowed the street whole.\nThe silence was suffocating. Even the mist that curled over Blackstone’s streets seemed to retreat from the carnage. Every gaze, every trembling breath of the crowd was locked on Liam.\nAt the center of it all, he turned slowly, his expression unreadable, his eyes like two pits of cold iron.\nHis gaze fell on Xuan Yu and his brother who were now conscious. They had been watching everything from the start, as they were the one that sent Fang Xiu after Liam.\nThe brothers had frozen in place, pale as corpses, their earlier arrogance drained away entirely.\nXuan Yu’s lips quivered soundlessly and his brother’s hand twitched at his side, reaching instinctively for his sword, though fear kept him from drawing it.\nLiam’s jaw clenched, and a silent thought crossed his mind like a blade scraping against bone.\nThis is the cause. The rot at the root. And my own indecision fed it\n.\nLiam’s eyes hardened and without a word, he raised his hand. Two shards of broken halberd — jagged, dripping with fresh blood — lifted from the stones. The fragments floated upward like vultures circling carrion, glinting faintly in the lamplight.\nXuan Yu’s eyes widened in horror as he finally found his voice. \"W-wait—!\"\nThe shards shot forward, moving faster than the eye could follow, two streaks of steel that carved the air apart.\nShhhk!\nThe blades punched clean through the brothers’ throats.\nTheir eyes bulged, hands clutching desperately at spurting wounds. Choked gurgles filled the street as blood cascaded down their robes, staining the gaudy silks darker than shadow.\nXuan Yu collapsed to his knees, eyes fixed on Liam in disbelief, hatred and despair twisting his last expression into something grotesque. His brother twitched beside him, body convulsing once before both slumped into stillness.\nBlood painted the stones. Corpses sprawled in broken heaps and the smell of blood filled the air, thick and choking.\nLiam stood at the center, his hands loose at his sides, his breathing calm and steady. His expression remained detached, cold, untouched by the carnage.\nThe crowd stared, eyes wide and hearts trembling. None dared move or speak. All they could do was watch as Liam turned, dusted his hands lightly — as if brushing away dirt — and walked off without a single glance back.\nEvery step of his echoed, steady and unhurried. And not once did he falter, or even look over his shoulder.\nTo Liam, it was finished. The decision had been made, the blade had fallen, and there was no need to dwell further. He had no time to waste on petty vendettas, no matter how bloody the outcome.",

      "content": "Chapter 146: Retaliation\n[A/N: Changes were made to the previous Chapter]\nThe streets of Blackstone were still stained with last night’s blood when the first squad of city guards arrived at dawn.\nTheir boots pounded down the cobblestones as they rushed toward the scene, led by a captain whose face was pale with fury.\nThe sight that greeted them made their jaws clench. Broken halberds lay shattered in pieces. Stone walls were cracked where bodies had slammed into them.\nAnd on the street itself, corpses sprawled in grotesque heaps — Fang Xiu, the City Lord’s son, his silken robes soaked in crimson; the Xuan heirs, their throats pierced through by jagged steel shards; and nearly a dozen guards, their armor dented and torn apart like toys.\nFor a long moment, there was a stifling silence between them. The new guards stood frozen, the hairs on their neck rising at the sheer brutality of the scene in front of them.\nThen the captain let out a guttural roar, his face twisted with rage.\n\"Take the bodies back to the estate! Immediately!\" he barked an order.\nThe men scrambled to obey, as they started placing the bodies in the carriage the wagon they brought. Their movements stiff with a mix of anger and dread. Blood trailed across the cobbles as they lifted Fang Xiu’s body, his face swollen and unrecognizable, the air thick with the coppery stench of death.\nBut the captain himself turned on his heel, his eyes glinting with grim purpose. He stormed into the Crimson Pavilion, Blackstone’s most infamous information house. And within a few short moments, the man emerged with a rolled-up parchment in hand.\nThe portrait was exact, so clear it seemed almost alive. The face of the killer — sharp eyes, calm features, expressionless yet chilling. Liam’s.\nThe captain’s boots hammered against the ground as he carried the image straight to the City Lord’s estate.\n***\nInside the estate, the air itself seemed to tremble with suppressed violence.\nFeng Chen, Blackstone’s City Lord, stood in his chambers, his handsome face twisted with fury. The faint morning sunlight streaming through the carved windows did nothing to soften the storm in his eyes.\nSomeone had dared. Someone had actually dared.\nHis son — his only blood heir — slaughtered in broad daylight on the streets of Blackstone. His guards butchered. The Xuan heirs, allies of his house, slain without hesitation.\nIt wasn’t just a personal insult. It was humiliation. And it had happened inside his city, under his reign, in front of his citizens.\nThat made it unforgivable.\nFeng Chen’s chest heaved as his voice lashed out like thunder at the guards kneeling before him.\n\"I will flay him alive. Strip him of his skin, inch by inch, until he begs for death. That bastard dares to humiliate me, to shame my house in front of Blackstone itself? I will tear his soul to shreds!\"\nThe guards bowed even lower, trembling beneath the waves of killing intent rolling off him.\nOne man stood calmly at his side — tall, broad, his presence steady but sharp as a drawn blade. This was Fang Cheng, Feng Chen’s right hand and most loyal guard.\nThe captain rushed into the room and knelt, holding up the portrait with both hands. \"My Lord, the culprit has been identified.\"\nFeng Chen seized the parchment and unrolled it in one motion. His eyes burned as they studied the face and read the information next to it.\nOrdinary features, no sign of cultivation, no clan insignia. A mortal.\nThe fury in Feng Chen’s expression only deepened when he saw this.\n\"A mortal,\" he spat, his voice dripped venom. \"My son, slaughtered by a mere mortal.\"\n\"Fang Cheng.\"\n\"Yes, My Lord.\"\n\"Find him. Drag him here alive. I don’t care how many guards you take. I want him breathing when he kneels before me.\"\nFang Cheng bowed deeply, then turned with military precision. \"As you command.\"\nA dozen elite guards armed with spears and halberds fell in behind him as he strode out of the chamber. Their footsteps thundered as they left the estate, the air charged with murderous intent.\nBehind them, Feng Chen clenched his fists so tightly his nails dug blood into his palms. He whispered to himself like a vow: \"You dared kill my son in my city. I’ll show this world what happens when a dog bares its fangs at a tiger.\"\n***\nBy mid-morning, the sun burned high above the tiled rooftops of Blackstone. But instead of warmth, the city was gripped by cold tension.\nWord had already spread like wildfire.\nThe City Lord’s son was dead. The heirs of the Xuan family were dead. And the killer was not a sect disciple, nor a rogue cultivator, nor even a hidden elder in disguise. No — he was a mortal. A nameless outsider with no cultivation base.\nThe absurdity of it was on everyone’s lips.\n\"Impossible! How could a mortal kill Fang Xiu?\"\n\"I heard he shattered weapons just by raising his hand.\"\n\"No, no, the rumors are already growing wild. But it’s true he killed them. Their bodies were carried through the streets this morning...\"\n\"What will the City Lord do?\"\n\"What can he do? If this stranger defies him openly, won’t it shake the entire balance of Blackstone?\"\nEvery force, major and minor, watched with bated breath. All of them sharpened their ears, waiting for the thunderclap that was bound to follow.\nAnd the culprit?\nHe was strolling casually through the markets of Blackstone.\nLiam walked between bustling stalls, his hands in his pockets, face calm as though the blood of nobles wasn’t still drying on the streets.\nHe was currently enjoying the view of the market and now alive it was with sound.\nOne would had expected him to return back to Earth after what he did but he didn’t. He knew that no matter how much he ran, they will still come after him. And so, it was better to just take care of business here, instead of running.\nAs for what he was doing in the market, he was getting ores and more herbs, and pills. He still needs more research materials.\nHe stopped at a stall piled high with rough ores. He reached out, lifted a piece, and studied it thoughtfully.\nLiam decided not to bother himself with the unnecessary thoughts, as he handed the vendor several gold coins, and tucked the ore into his space.\nOne by one, he moved through the stalls, purchasing bundles of herbs, jars of pills, sacks of unrefined minerals, and he paid without haggling.\nAfter almost half an hour, he was done with his purchases. He stepped out of the last store with a smile of satisfaction on his face.\nThese would keep Lucy busy for a bit.\nHe was still thinking to himself, when he saw dozens of armored guards standing in formation outside, halberds gleaming in the sun. Behind them stood a single man, towering, his aura rolling out like a storm tide.\nHe had already noticed them when they got into the range of his telekinetic sense, and he smiled internally to himself.\nThe crowd had already begun to retreat in waves, sensing the collision to come. Merchants shuttered their stalls, dragging their goods away.\nOnlookers whispered furiously from a safe distance, eyes darting between the \"mortal\" and the City Lord’s right hand.\nLiam’s eyes flicked over the scene once, then narrowed slightly. He didn’t need to think to guess why they were here.\nFang Cheng stepped forward, studying him. His brow furrowed faintly. He could see no trace of cultivation in this man. No Qi fluctuations, no any aura of power. Just a mortal’s body standing tall.\nThe captain’s reports weren’t lies, then. This was truly the man.\nHe scoffed loudly, his voice dripping with disdain. \"So the rumors were true. You’re nothing but a mortal. I thought I’d be facing some hidden elder, a sect cultivator disguised to mock us. But no... my Lord’s son was killed by this?\"\nHis lip curled up into a sneer, \"Pathetic.\"\nHe turned his head to his men, waving lazily. \"Break his arms and his legs, and drag him back to the estate. The City Lord wants him alive.\"\nThe guards roared in unison and charged at Liam.\nBut Liam didn’t flinch. His thoughts reached into the Dimensional Space, and with a thought, Silverleaf materialized in his grip.\nThe blade sang. A clear, resonant ring that echoed across the street. And in that instant, Liam let his aura surge free.\nThis was the supreme resonance of the Myriad Armament Constitution.\nThe air thickened. The guards’ halberds trembled violently, their blades vibrating as if bowing in submission. The crowd gasped as weapons across the market stalls shivered — swords, spears, even kitchen knives — all started quivering.\nFang Cheng’s eyes widened slightly, looking very surprised. His aura met resistance, an invisible tide that pressed back against him.\nLiam raised Silverleaf, its edge glinting, and his calm voice carried across the stunned market:\n\"You want to drag me in chains?\"\nHe grinned, \"Then come try.\"\nAnd without waiting for them to make the first move, Liam’s figured blurred as he made his move.",

      "content": "Chapter 147: Let There Be Carnage!\nThe air in Blackstone’s market grew thick, charged with a tension that pressed against every chest.\nLiam stood in the center of the street, Silverleaf loosely in hand, its edge faintly shimmering in the sunlight.\nHe looked as if he had simply strolled into the square by accident. But around him, the crowd had already scattered, retreating into alleys and behind shuttered stalls.\nAnd in front of him stood Fang Cheng, the one called Blackstone’s Iron Spear, commander of the City Lord’s elite guard. The armored men flanking him were no ordinary guards and their presence alone had turned the marketplace into a suffocating cage.\nBut before Fang Cheng gave the order, another presence cut through the air.\nFrom the far side of the street, a new squad arrived, moving in tight formation. Their attire was markedly different — darker robes reinforced with fine mail, embroidered with the mark of a roaring serpent. At their head walked a man with eyes filled with raging hatred.\nHis steps were unhurried, yet each one rang in the ears of the onlookers like a tolling bell. His expression was cold and unreadable, but his low voice sounded like thunder when he spoke:\n\"You... are the one who killed my sons?\"\nThis was Xuan Zhi, patriarch of the Xuan family, one of the strongest clans in Blackstone. And the corpses of his sons still lay in his estate, throats pierced by steel.\nLiam’s expression remained calm. His eyes were sharp, but his voice was almost casual as he replied, \"Yes.\"\nThe single word fell like a blade into silence.\nXuan Zhi’s face contorted, veins standing out on his temple as his aura burst outward. The sheer force of it sent dust and pebbles skittering across the street.\nThe pressure was suffocating, like a mountain descending upon all in range. Even his own men staggered back, their knees buckling under the invisible weight.\nThe elite guards Fang Cheng had brought with him grunted, armor groaning under the pressure.\nBut Liam stood as if nothing had changed, his shirt barely fluttering under the storm.\nFang Cheng stepped forward, his voice steady as he cut through the oppressive aura. \"Patriarch, enough. Do not crush your own men before the fight even begins.\"\nWith a flick of his hand, Fang Cheng extended his own aura outward, a firm wall that pressed against Xuan Zhi’s. The pressure lifted slightly from the elites and guards, enough for them to breathe again.\nXuan Zhi’s chest heaved with fury, but after a long moment he exhaled harshly, retracting part of his pressure. He turned to Fang Cheng, who clasped a hand on his shoulder.\n\"Calm yourself,\" Fang Cheng said in a low voice. \"He will pay. Not just with his body, but with the truth of his existence and origin. We will tear him apart until we find out how he was able to kill the young masters as a mortal. And if he’s a demonic cultivator as he already presume, a fate worse than death awaits him.\"\nXuan Zhi’s jaw clenched, but he nodded. But the coldness in his eyes didn’t fade.\nHe turned to his men and gestured with two fingers. \"Surround him. Break every bone in his body, but keep him alive. I will see him scream before the day ends.\"\nThe order was clear. His men, hardened warriors, surged forward, spreading in a half-circle to encircle Liam.\nFrom the alleys, whispers grew frantic.\n\"Twenty against one!\"\n\"He’s finished. If it was me, I would had found a way to escape from the city instead of casually walking around.\"\n\"Shh! Don’t let them hear you!\"\nBut Liam heard what they were saying clearly. He even smiled faintly, a humorless smile. He glanced at the encirclement forming around him and chuckled softly under his breath.\n\"So much honor,\" he said, his voice filled with ease. \"To treat a mortal like me with such seriousness. Surrounded on all sides... I’m honored.\"\nHis words stung, as some of the elites sneered and others grit their teeth. Fang Cheng’s eyes narrowed, reading the mockery in Liam’s calmness.\n\"Enough,\" Fang Cheng barked, with a sharp voice, as he raised his hand. \"Attack!\"\nThe order cracked like a whip. More than twenty men roared as one and charged at Liam, their weapons flashing like a storm of steel and their coordinated movements forming a cage of blades converging from all sides.\nBut Liam didn’t move. His eyes sharpened, and his telekinetic field expanded outward like a net cast across the battlefield. Every detail flooded his mind — the scrape of boots, the arc of blades. He could also sense the rhythm of heartbeats. It was all mapped perfectly within twenty meters around him.\nHe waited and just as the first spear thrust in, Liam moved. Silverleaf whistled down, cutting clean through the shaft and into its wielder. Blood sprayed as the man collapsed, his scream cut short.\nAnd then chaos erupted.\nLiam spun, using his telekinesis to snap three swords off course mid-swing. His blade arced through the gap, slicing into the shoulder of one man and cleaving down to the ribs of another. Both collapsed, their blood staining the stones.\nA halberd whistled for his head. Liam ducked low, his free hand lashing out. Invisible force surged, wrenching the weapon from its owner’s grip and driving it backward into the man’s chest. The body fell with a wet thud.\nThe formation collapsed almost instantly.\nTo the crowd, it was like watching a storm rip through wheat. Steel clashed, screams split the air, and blood sprayed in violent arcs. But Liam moved with terrifying calmness, as he flowed through them like water through cracks.\nAnother spear lunged at him and he sidestepped, slashed upward, and the man’s arm fell, severed at the elbow.\nTwo sabers came in from both sides. His telekinesis yanked one attacker forward into the other, their blades sinking into each other’s flesh before they could even scream.\nWithin seconds, the street was a cacophony of steel, screams, and the sickening sound of metal tearing through flesh.\n\"Impossible!\" one guard shouted, terror creeping into his voice as he swung wildly.\nLiam caught his wrist mid-swing with invisible force. The man froze, his body trembling violently as Liam slowly rotated his arm until bones snapped like dry twigs. The man shrieked before Silverleaf ended him.\nBodies piled up the street and the cobblestones had turned slick with blood. And through out all these, Liam didn’t sustain a scratch.\nHe stood in the center of the carnage, with calm breath, his sharp eyes staring at the last man standing, as blood dripped down his blade.\nThe last man standing looked around in horror at the carnage of his comrades. His knees buckled, and his sword clattered from his trembling hand. But before he could beg for mercy, a shard of broken steel — guided by invisible force — drove clean through his throat, and he dropped to the ground.\nSilence filled the marketplace as the entire squad lay dead, their corpses sprawled in mangled heaps around him.\nThe crowd stared in frozen awe, unable to comprehend what they had just witnessed.\nXuan Zhi’s face had turned ashen, his lips trembling with rage and disbelief. His sons’ killer had just slaughtered more than two dozen elite men as if they were nothing.\nEven Fang Cheng’s composure cracked. His brow furrowed, as he clenched his jaw. He couldn’t believe it. This person in front of him really took down more than twenty men that were at least in the late stage Qi Refining to early stage Foundation Establishment.\nJust how did he do it? And he still doesn’t look tired. It was even more bizarre that the person in front of him has no shred of cultivation. Even if he was a hidden expert, it was impossible for him to not reveal even a hint of his cultivation, no matter how perfect his control over it was.\nLiam had no idea what was going through their minds, but he could guess. He looked at the two men calmly and his voice cut through the silence like a knife, as he spoke, \"Is that all?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 148: Telekinesis Evolution\nThe marketplace of Blackstone still reeked of blood. The corpses of Xuan Zhi’s and Fang Cheng’s men lay cooling in the morning sun, their bodies sprawled like discarded rags across the cobblestones.\nAnd Liam stood in the center of it, looking calm and composed, with Silverleaf in hand, while two titans of Blackstone glared at him with venom burning in their eyes.\nXuan Zhi’s face twisted, disbelief etched across every line. His lips curled as he jabbed a trembling finger at Liam, his voice hoarse with rage, \"You... what are you? No mortal could have done this! Tell me, boy — what sort of monster hides behind that face?\"\nLiam said nothing. His gaze slid coldly over the Xuan patriarch, unmoved by his fury.\nFang Cheng’s eyes narrowed, his heavy brows drawn low. His voice cut sharply into the tense silence, \"Tell me the truth. Are you of the demon race? Is that why you came to Blackstone? To toy with us?\"\nLiam met his eyes without flinching, but still he didn’t answer. Words were useless here. No matter what truth he offered, they had already written their own stories in their minds. He was a demon, a hidden elder, a threat that had to be extinguished.\nAnd so be it.\nAs he stood in the midst of their glares, Liam’s thoughts sharpened like blades. He had been thinking about something while walking around the market and purchasing research materials, and he felt that the mentality he approached this world with, was flawed from the very beginning. He had treated it cautiously, like a guest tiptoeing in another man’s house. But this was no place for caution.\nIn this world, only names carved in blood carried weight. Only those who made others tremble with fear were granted space to grow.\nIf he wanted to stand here, unbound and unbroken, then he would have to forge a name that shook the foundations of this empire. A name whispered in dread.\nAnd that path began with anyone who dared stand against him.\nHe shifted Silverleaf in his grip and began to walk forward, his steps slow but deliberate. Each one rang across the stone like a drumbeat. His calm face betrayed nothing, but inside, fire burned.\nFang Cheng and Xuan Zhi exchanged a glance. Their frowns deepened. They could see it clearly: this mortal intended to fight them both head-on.\nArrogant. Insane. But also... dangerous.\n\"Very well,\" Fang Cheng muttered, drawing the halberd strapped to his back. Its spear-tip gleamed with condensed Qi, vibrating faintly in his grip. \"Let’s see what tricks you truly have.\"\nXuan Zhi’s face twisted into a snarl. His aura exploded outward once again, his robes whipping in the surge of power. He raised both hands, runes flickering faintly along his forearms.\n\"You killed my sons. For that, even death will be too kind.\"\nThe air thickened, the cobblestones trembling under the weight of two cultivation giants preparing to strike.\nLiam exhaled, steadying his grip on Silverleaf. His telekinetic field pulsed outward like an unseen tide, mapping every detail of the battlefield.\nThe storm broke, as both men attacked as one.\nFang Cheng surged forward, his halberd thrusting in a blur. The strike carried the weight of a collapsing mountain, its edge filled with enough power to cleave a boulder in two.\nAt the same instant, Xuan Zhi raised his palms and unleashed a barrage of glowing talismans that burst into chains of energy, each whip-like strike lashing toward Liam’s body.\nThe street shook under the combined assault.\nLiam reacted instantly. His telekinesis wrapped around Silverleaf, accelerating its slash as he parried the halberd head-on. Sparks erupted as steel met invisible force, the shockwave rattling windows. At the same time, his free hand clenched and the lashing chains slowed, tangled in the crushing grip of his will.\nBut it wasn’t enough.\nFang Cheng’s brute force pushed him backward, his boots grinding against stone, while Xuan Zhi’s chains snapped free one after another, cutting into his telekinetic barrier like serrated blades.\nLiam gritted his teeth, the pressure hammering his skull. He forced himself forward, retaliating with a telekinetic blast that shoved both men back for a heartbeat. He lunged, Silverleaf carving a lethal arc.\nFang Cheng spun his halberd, catching the strike with the shaft, his arms shaking from the impact. Xuan Zhi darted to the side, his fingers forming rapid seals before sending a volley of glowing blades of energy streaking through the air.\nThe fight spiraled into chaos.\nSilverleaf sang as Liam deflected, dodged, and struck in rapid sequence, his movements guided by his telekinetic sense. Yet for every strike he made, Fang Cheng’s halberd met him with relentless, crushing power, while Xuan Zhi’s spells peppered him from afar, forcing him to split his focus.\nHis telekinetic field strained, the weight of two experienced cultivators pressing in from both sides. His mind throbbed under the pressure. Sweat streaked down his temple.\nBut his eyes never wavered.\nHe ducked a halberd swing, countered with a knee to Fang Cheng’s chest, then spun and deflected a barrage of talisman-blades, sending them scattering into nearby stalls in bursts of fire and splinters.\nThe marketplace had become a battlefield. Stalls collapsed, flames licked at wooden beams, and the air rang with the sound of steel and shattering stone.\nStill, the two men pressed him, driving him into the defensive. Fang Cheng’s relentless close-quarters pressure forced him to constantly parry, while Xuan Zhi’s long-range spells battered at his barriers.\nMinutes dragged like hours. Liam’s chest heaved, his focus beginning to fray. Every clash rattled his bones. He could feel it clearly now: if the fight continued like this, he would lose.\nNo... worse than lose. He would be broken, captured and paraded as prey before the very people he had sworn to make tremble.\nThat thought burned hotter than fire.\nI can’t let that happen.\nHis jaw clenched. His eyes narrowed, blazing with resolve. If brute force wasn’t enough, then he would gamble everything.\nHe exhaled sharply, his telekinesis shifting. Instead of lashing outward at his enemies, he turned it inward — wrapping it around himself.\nThe shift was immediate. His body lightened, the crushing weight of gravity peeling away. His boots lifted from the bloodstained cobblestones. Slowly, steadily, Liam rose into the air.\nGasps erupted from every throat in the marketplace. The crowd, hidden in alleys and behind ruined stalls, stared with wide, disbelieving eyes.\nFang Cheng froze mid-strike, his halberd trembling in his grip. Xuan Zhi’s spell fizzled in his palm, his jaw dropping open in shock.\nThe mortal — the man they thought to corner and break — was floating above them, suspended in midair like an untouchable god.\nSilverleaf gleamed in his hand, its edge catching the sun as he looked down at them both, his expression cold and imperious.\nFor the first time since the battle started, Liam allowed his presence to spread fully. His aura — the resonance of the Myriad Armament Constitution — poured outward. It was time to go all out and use everything he has to his advantage.\nEvery weapon in the square trembled again and they started floating into the air, beside Liam.\n\"You wanted a monster?\" Liam said, as his eyes burned like steel. \"Then look up.\"\nThe entire market held its breath as Liam hovered above the two strongest men of Blackstone, looking down upon them like judgment itself.\nFang Cheng and Xuan Zhi looked at the figure in the sky, and for the first time, they felt doubt. They both had the same question in their head.\nHow?\nLiam’s gaze was ice cold. Slowly, he raised his hand... then brought it down like a judge passing sentence. The weapons around him shrieked as they blitzed through the air like falling stars — and he shot forward with them, leading the storm.",

      "content": "Chapter 149: Losing Control\nThe air split as Liam’s hand came down.\nDozens of weapons — sabers, swords, spears, even broken halberds — screamed through the air, each one propelled by invisible force.\nThey tore across the marketplace like a storm of falling stars, their edges trailing streaks of light.\nAt the same instant, Liam shot forward, Silverleaf blazing in his grip.\nFang Cheng’s eyes widened. His instincts screamed as his halberd whirled in desperate arcs, smashing aside half a dozen flying blades. Sparks burst like fireworks, metal shrieking against metal.\nXuan Zhi threw up his palms, runes flaring along his skin. A dome of shimmering energy erupted around him, deflecting another dozen weapons with ear-splitting clangs.\nBut neither man could block them all. A spearhead slashed across Fang Cheng’s arm, slicing through his armor and flesh alike. Blood spattered across the cobblestones. Xuan Zhi’s shield cracked as three swords hammered it in unison, and one shard of steel sliced across his cheek, painting a crimson line down his face.\nAnd then Liam was upon them.\nHe crashed into Fang Cheng first, Silverleaf carving down in a brutal arc. Fang Cheng braced with both hands, halberd shaft catching the blow.\nThe impact detonated between them like thunder, cobblestones cracking under their feet.\nFang Cheng grunted, his arms trembling violently, muscles straining to contain the force.\nBut before he could push back, Liam slammed his head forward.\nCRACK!\nTheir foreheads collided with bone-shattering force. Blood streamed instantly from Liam’s brow — but also from Fang Cheng’s nose, his skull ringing.\n\"You lunatic!\" Fang Cheng roared, stumbling back.\nBut Liam only grinned through the blood, his eyes gleaming like a savage animal had been unleashed.\nXuan Zhi struck from behind, unleashing a chain of talisman-blades that whistled through the air. They slashed into Liam’s back with sizzling force, carving bloody gouges across his flesh. The smell of scorched blood filled the air.\nThe hidden crowd gasped. The strike would have left any ordinary man writhing on the ground. But Liam only staggered a step, his teeth clenched, before spinning in place.\nAlready, his double regenerative traits kicked in and the flesh across his back was knitting itself shut. The cuts bubbled, then sealed in seconds, leaving behind only faint streaks of red — his dried up blood.\n\"What—?!\" Xuan Zhi’s eyes widened in disbelief.\nHe had seen many strange techniques in his lifetime, but never had he witnessed such monstrous regeneration.\nLiam didn’t give him time to think. With a gesture, half a dozen floating swords twisted through the air and speared toward him.\nXuan Zhi cursed, drawing talismans from his sleeve and igniting them. Walls of flame erupted in front of him, trying to burn the weapons to ash.\nBut Liam’s will was relentless. The swords screamed through the flames, edges glowing red-hot, and pierced into Xuan Zhi’s barrier. One sank deep into his shoulder and he screamed, staggering back as blood poured down his robes.\nMeanwhile, Fang Cheng roared and charged again. His halberd blazed with condensed Qi, each swing heavy enough to split a wagon in half. He struck again and again, the weapon slamming against Liam’s blade with earthshaking force.\nBut Liam didn’t fight defensively, as he didn’t dodge and let the strikes land.\nThe halberd’s blade cut into his shoulder, carving a deep wound that nearly severed the arm. Liam roared, his voice raw, and used that same arm to slash Silverleaf upward, cleaving into Fang Cheng’s chest. Blood exploded across the cobblestones as Fang Cheng stumbled back, clutching his armor.\nAnd then, before their horrified eyes, Liam’s shoulder wound began to close, as torn muscle knitted and bone aligned. Within seconds, only a faint scar remained and it disappeared the next second.\n\"You’re... insane...\" Fang Cheng gasped, his face pale.\nLiam spat blood and grinned, eyes gleaming with manic light. \"Insane? No. I’m the monster you created.\"\nWith a surge of telekinesis, the broken halberd shards on the ground lifted, spinning around him like a crown of steel. He hurled them outward in a storm, forcing both men to scatter.\nXuan Zhi snarled, his hands flashing through seals. He unleashed a wave of energy that twisted into hundreds of glowing chains, each whipping toward Liam. They coiled around his body, binding his arms, his legs, his chest.\nThe chains burned against his flesh, searing black marks into his skin. The crowd gasped — perhaps this was it.\nBut Liam only threw his head back and roared. His telekinesis surged outward like a tidal wave, shattering the chains one by one. He tore through them with sheer force of will, even as his skin blistered and cracked from their power. Blood streamed down his chest, but already the wounds were closing as he broke free.\n\"You call that binding?\" Liam spat. His voice was ragged, but his grin was wide. \"Let me show you what it means to be chained!\"\nWith a gesture, the weapons around him shot toward Xuan Zhi, wrapping like serpents. A spear shaft coiled around his arms, pinning them. A sword clamped across his throat, pressing him back against the wall.\nXuan Zhi roared, his aura flaring, but the steel only tightened under Liam’s control, cutting into his skin until blood dripped down his robes.\n\"Bastard! You think this is enough to hold me?!\" Xuan Zhi roared, but his voice cracked with fear.\nMeanwhile, Fang Cheng charged again, rage fueling him. His halberd swept low, aiming to take Liam’s legs.\nLiam didn’t step back. He jumped, soaring into the air. His telekinesis wrapped around his body, propelling him higher until he hovered above the square.\nFrom the ground, the people stared, wide-eyed. He floated like a war god, weapons orbiting around him, his wounds sealing as fast as they appeared.\n\"Fly... he can really fly?\" Fang Cheng muttered in disbelief.\nThen Liam dove.\nHe streaked down like a meteor, Silverleaf leading the way. His blade carved into Fang Cheng’s halberd, snapping the shaft in two. The broken edge slammed into Fang Cheng’s chest, cracking ribs, driving him to his knees.\nLiam landed hard, grabbed the man by the throat, and slammed his skull into the cobblestones. The ground shattered, blood spraying.\nFang Cheng coughed, his eyes rolling, but Liam didn’t stop. He hammered his fist into his face, again and again, bone crunching with every blow and blood splattered across his knuckles.\n\"Stop... stop!\" Fang Cheng gurgled, but Liam’s fist came down one final time, caving his skull into the stones.\nThe commander of Blackstone’s elites twitched once, then lay still. Dead.\nLiam rose slowly, blood dripping from his hands, and turned to Xuan Zhi.\nThe patriarch was struggling against the weapons pinning him, his face twisted with hatred and fear.\n\"You killed my sons... I’ll curse you even in death—!\"\nThe words ended in a scream as Liam tightened his grip. The sword across his throat sliced deeper, cutting into flesh. The spear tightened around his arms until bones snapped.\n\"Mercy...\" Xuan Zhi gasped, blood bubbling from his lips. \"Mercy!\"\nLiam’s face was calm, his eyes cold. He stepped closer, lifted Silverleaf, and drove it straight through Xuan Zhi’s chest.\nThe man convulsed, his scream choking off as blood poured from his mouth. His body sagged against the weapons pinning him.\nLiam wrenched the blade free, letting him collapse to the stones in a spreading pool of crimson.\nThe square fell silent, as Fang Cheng and Xuan Zhi were dead.\nDead They were dead!\nTwo of Blackstone’s titans lay in ruins, slain by the hands of a man they had once called mortal.\nLiam exhaled slowly, wiping the blood from his blade. His body was slick with crimson, cuts still healing across his chest, but his eyes were sharp and cold.\nHe turned, scanning the crowd that still hid in the shadows. Their faces were pale, their eyes wide with disbelief and fear.\nLiam lifted his head to the heaven and laughed mockingly. He slowly lifted up from the ground and flew higher, and higher into the sky, before disappearing from everyone’s view.\nThat day, the streets of Blackstone ran red, and whispers carried on the wind. A nameless mortal had slain the titans of the city, risen into the sky, and vanished like a phantom. By dusk, one name echoed across taverns, sect halls, and courts alike — a name born in blood. The Demon God",

      "content": "Chapter 150: Progress On LUCID\nLiam walked out of the penthouse bathroom with steam trailing faintly behind him. Droplets still clung to his shoulders, sliding across skin that only hours ago had been split open and bloodied.\nHe had looked himself in the mirror and b.he saw no scars or marks. It was as though the brutal clash with Fang Cheng and Xuan Zhi had been nothing more than a fever dream.\nHe opened the wardrobe and ran his hand briefly across the neat row of Armani shirts and trousers. These were the clothes he had bought during his first day he got the system and he had left them here when he moved into Bellemere Mansion.\nHis last set of clothes had been ruined beyond saving. They were torn in different places and soaked with blood, unrecognizable by the end of the battle. Even his sneakers had been bloodied and could no longer be worn. He had disposed of them without a second thought.\nAfter dressing, Liam crossed the room and dropped onto the bed. He lay flat on his back, staring up at the ceiling, and a slow smile spread across his face.\nThe battle replayed in his head, every clash and strike etched perfectly into memory. Fang Cheng’s halberd bearing down on him like a mountain. Xuan Zhi’s talisman chains slicing through the air, hissing like vipers. And himself, standing between them.\nThe battle was epic for him. It was his first actual life or death battle and he came out on top. Though it had nearly pushed him.\nHis body was fine. More than fine, actually. The wounds that should have killed him outright had sealed themselves shut in moments. The broken bones had healed at a terrifying pace and his muscles felt loose, powerful, filled with a coiled energy that begged to be tested again. This battle gave Liam an idea of how insane his double regenerative traits are.\nBut while his body was in perfect condition, his mind was another story.\nEven now, he could feel the faint ringing in his skull and the dull ache behind his eyes. This was the price of forcing his telekinesis and his mental capacity past its limits.\nBut Liam knew that this wasn’t his weakness. Rather it was a reminder that while his body could leap forward in great strides — strength, speed, endurance, regeneration — all boosted to monstrous levels by the molecular enhancements and by adding stats. His mind, his psychic wellspring, grew differently. For it, it was more of a steady climb instead of a leap. But the rate of the climb might actually be a leap for others.\nAnd yet even at this level, it was still beyond the reach of anyone else. That was his advantage.\nLiam sat up slightly, resting his elbows on his knees. He had learned much from this fight, and not just about his enemies.\nThe first truth was simple: he was strong. Terrifyingly so. He had no clear way to measure himself against the wider world, but Fang Cheng and Xuan Zhi had not been weaklings.\nTheir attacks had been the kind that could had turn lesser cultivators into ash. And yet he had killed them both.\nThe second truth was that his gifts worked seamlessly together. His Formless Combat Doctrine flowed in battle like water, adapting to every shift. His Myriad Armament Constitution had turned Silverleaf and every weapons around him into an extension of his very soul. And Perfect Memory had given him flawless recall of every game and movie combat scenario he had ever seen or practiced. Together, these formed a triad of mastery.\nAnd threaded through it all was telekinesis. The invisible hand, the power to dominate a battlefield, to wield flight itself.\nThe thought made his chest stir with excitement. Flight. He smiled again, wider this time. To rise above the world, to look down on enemies and allies alike from the sky — there was no symbol of power greater than that.\nThough his flight was still somewhat raw and unrefined, and he still needs to perfect it. But that won’t be a problem, as the Dimensional Space, with its time dilation, would give him endless hours to do so. He would master it until it was second nature, until flying was as effortless as breathing.\nYet beneath the triumph of the battle, was the weight of what he had done.\nHe had killed. Truly killed. With his own hands.\nThe memory of Fang Cheng’s skull breaking under his fist. The sound of Xuan Zhi’s last, ragged gasp as Silverleaf pierced his chest. The Xuan heirs choking on their blood in the dirt. Fang Xiu neck breaking when he snapped it.\nLiam lay back again, staring at the ceiling, with a very slight heaviness in his chest. He had crossed the line. And once crossed, there was no return.\nBut he would not let it bind him. He had made the choice in that world, and in that world, the rules were clear. Kill or be killed. Mercy was weakness.\nOn Earth, it would be different. Here, he would grow using tools that no one else could rival. He would be ruthless, yes — but not lethal, unless his own life was on the line. For those who came for him, he would return the favor personally. For everyone else, he had more elegant ways to deal with opposition.\nThat was the balance he had decided.\nWith a long sigh, Liam swung his legs off the bed and stood up. He sighed and closed his eyes briefly, and the next instant, he was in the Dimensional Space.\nHe walked straight to the assembler and pulled open the finished products’ compartment. He smiled to himself when he saw the compartment’s contents.\nInside, stacked and arranged perfectly, were countless black boxes. He reached in and took one out.\nThe package felt very light in his hand. The surface was matte black, the radiant quasar logo gleaming faintly in silver across the center. Inside, he knew, sat the Gear Glass — no, the Lucid, as it would be called publicly.\nLucy had done her work flawlessly. Each device had been sealed within its packaging, ready to go. Ready to flood the market.\nHe turned the box over in his hand, smiling in satisfaction to himself. All that remained was marketing and distribution. Daniel would see to those.\nFor the marketing, what Liam wants is a few carefully placed units in the hands of tech reviewers and gaming streamers. It’s a tech product and gaming device, so those two groups of people are more than enough.\nBut all that would start tomorrow.\n\"Lucy, how goes the progress on your body?\" he asked in curiosity.\n\"It’s going perfectly, Master. The framework is complete. Integration is underway. It will not be long now.\"\n\"Good,\" he said, with a wider smile.\nHe ran his hand over the smooth packaging box, then he set it back into the compartment and turned away.\nIt was already past noon on Earth and there was nothing for him to do. He decided to test the sky.\nHe stepped forward and his body lifted gently from the ground, and he left the Dimensional Space.",

      "content": "Chapter 151: True Flight\nLiam appeared, hovering above the runway of his private island, his figure steady in the warm afternoon sun.\nBeneath him, the strip of asphalt stretched for five kilometers in a perfect line, its edges framed by swaying palms and the faint shimmer of heat rising from the surface. Beyond that, the blue vastness of the ocean glittered in all directions, calm and endless.\nHe rose higher into the sky, slowly at first, just enough to take it all in. From this vantage, the entire island unfolded beneath him like a green jewel cast into the ocean — beaches curving like ivory crescents, the forested interior whispering with wind, the runway cutting a sharp, deliberate line across it all.\nLiam allowed himself a small smile. The view alone was intoxicating, but today wasn’t about sightseeing.\nToday was about pushing the limits.\nHe dropped back down and landed at the far end of the runway, his sneakers clicking faintly against the asphalt. His chest rose and fell in a deliberate breath as he steadied his mind.\nHere on his own island with no one to see, he would finally find out just how far, how fast, and how high he could go.\nHe stretched his neck, rolled his shoulders, then spoke softly:\n\"Lucy, track everything — speed, altitude, g-forces and my bioinfo. I want every scrap of data.\"\n\"Understood, All metrics will be monitored in real time.\"\nHe nodded, exhaling again. Then once more, for good measure. His heart thrummed with anticipation, excitement tangled with a hint of anxiety. This was the unknown.\nLiam closed his eyes briefly, drew one final breath, and then —\nHe shot forward like a bullet.\nThe ground blurred beneath him as the world roared alive. Wind lashed at his face instantly, flattening his hair, tearing at his clothes like invisible claws.\nThe force pressed hard against his body, but he embraced it, leaned into it. His pulse surged as exhilaration flooded through him.\nThis wasn’t like running, nor driving, nor even teleporting. This was raw, unfiltered freedom — the kind of freedom only birds and dreams had known before.\nThe runway vanished behind him in streaks of gray and black. His speedometer in the Glass flickered upward:\n100 mph. 200. 300.\nThe sensation built with every second. The air became a solid wall he had to punch through, rattling his bones. His blood surged with adrenaline, and yet he laughed — actually laughed — at the sheer insanity of it.\n400. 500. 600.\nThe edges of sound barrier screamed around him. The world narrowed to a tunnel of rushing blue and silver. His body was filled with power and every cell alive with motion. He realized then that flight wasn’t just movement. It was communion with the elements — the air, the speed, the pressure.\nAnd then — BOOM.\nThe sound barrier shattered. A thunderous crack exploded in his wake, rolling out across the ocean like a storm. Waves rippled violently below from the concussive shockwave.\n760 mph. Mach 1. He had broken the sound barrier. He has gone supersonic.\nLiam grinned wildly, eyes burning from the wind, as he pressed harder.\n800 mph. That’s when the strain began.\nA migraine bloomed behind his eyes, it was sharp, and searing. It felt as though his skull were vibrating from the inside and his brain being rattled by invisible hammers.\nHis nose ran wet and when he touched his lip, he blood smear across his fingers, whipped instantly away by the wind.\nHis breath came out ragged, not from lack of oxygen, but from the sheer pressure on his body, the mental burden of maintaining control at such velocity.\nStill, he continued pushing himself.\n850. 880. 900.\nAnd then it stopped. No matter how much willpower he poured into his telekinetic thrust, the number refused to climb. His head was spinning and his vision has tunneled to a point that he could barely see. He could feel his consciousness teetering on the edge of blackout.\n\"Enough—!\" he growled through clenched teeth, cutting off the push.\nThe world blurred past as he decelerated, streaking across the end of the runway in a controlled descent. His sneakers hit asphalt hard, skidding, until he let himself collapse backward onto the ground. He lay flat, staring at the endless blue sky above, blood still trickling faintly from his nose.\nThe ringing in his ears was unbearable, his skull pounding like war drums. Yet even through the haze of pain, he smiled.\n\"Max speed... nine hundred miles per hour,\" he muttered hoarsely. \"Mach one-point-one. Not bad for a first flight.\"\n\"Confirmed, Lucy reported. \"However, mental strain reached critical thresholds. Any attempt to sustain Mach speeds risks permanent neural damage, though it will be immediately healed by the axotol and the starfish regenerative genes. Recommend limiting cruising velocity.\"\nLiam chuckled weakly. \"Noted.\"\nHe lay there for several long minutes, breathing, letting the ache ebb away. Slowly, his head cleared, and his nose stopped bleeding. He sat up, wiping away the last crimson streak with the back of his hand.\n\"I will limit my cruising speed to five to six hundred,\" he decided. \"That’s more than enough. I will go faster only when I need it.\"\nAlready, he was imagining it — streaking across countries in hours, continents in a single afternoon. One day, his flight might just be teleportation.\nThe thought made him smile again.\nHe rose, hovering gently from his seated position, then turned toward the sea. Without hesitation, he shot forward again.\nThe island fell away behind him. Ocean stretched infinite ahead, shimmering like liquid glass under the sun. Liam lowered himself until he skimmed mere feet above the waves.\nAt 500 mph, the effect was breathtaking. The sea erupted in his wake, a massive spray shooting outward in twin walls behind him. The pressure carved a trail across the water’s surface, a roaring corridor that followed his flight.\nLiam laughed again, exhilarated, lowering one hand to the waves. The impact stung like slapping stone at that speed, but he relished the sensation — water spraying wildly, dragged upward in glittering arcs. The ocean hissed beneath his touch, his fingers tearing furrows across its surface.\nTo anyone watching from afar, it would have looked like a god racing across the sea, the ocean itself bowing in his path.\nMinutes passed in a blur. Wind screamed, waves exploded, and Liam felt more alive than he ever had.\nFinally, he tilted upward and shot into the sky. The sea dropped away beneath him as he climbed higher and higher.\nAt 7,000 feet, wisps of cloud brushed against his shoulders, it cool and damp like mist. He stretched out a hand and laughed softly as it passed right through, leaving moisture across his skin.\nHe rose further, punching through thicker banks of cloud until the world beneath disappeared into rolling white. At 15,000 feet, the sun burned hotter, brighter and unobstructed. He leveled off and started gliding smoothly.\nBut his curiosity stirredz as he wanted more. He tilted his gaze upward, toward the deep blue bleeding slowly into black.\nHe climbed again. 20,000 feet. 25,000.\nThe air thinned and he hs lungs strained for breath. The sky darkened around him, the world below shrinking into miniature. For a fleeting moment, he thought he might actually break free, might touch the edges of space itself.\nBut at 27,000 feet, the warning signs came. His breath caught, his head swam. The migraine threatened again, sharper, heavier. His limbs felt heavy, sluggish, as if the atmosphere itself were chains dragging him down.\n\"No,\" he hissed, shaking his head.\nHe angled downward, descending rapidly, until the air thickened again around him. At 15,000 feet, he leveled off, steady, breathing easier.\nBelow, the clouds parted to reveal endless ocean once again, stretching toward the faint outline of distant coasts. Liam hovered there for a moment, chest heaving, a grin tugging at his lips.\nHe had done it. He has achieved true flight, breaking sound, skimming the ocean, touching the clouds, rising into the thin air where only eagles and dreams dared soar.\nHe hovered in silence for a few seconds, then turned toward a random direction, his smile widening. With a thought, his body blurred forward, streaking across the sky, leaving only a faint ripple of disturbed air in his wake.",

      "content": "Chapter 152: Daniel’s Shock\nLater that evening, right before he was about to go to sleep, Liam received a call from Daniel. He was lying across his bed, enjoying the night breeze drifting through the half-open windows of his bedroom.\nThe day had been long for him and it felt like he used more than twenty four hours, which he actually did.\n\"Sir, the Family Office has been activated. Everything is ready, live and operational,\" Daniel’s voice came through the line, calm but carrying that undertone of suppressed excitement.\nLiam smiled in satisfaction when he heard this. It was the news he has been anticipating the whole day.\n\"Good. That’s perfect. Come to the mansion tomorrow, there’s something else we need to discuss,\" he said.\n\"Yes, sir. I’ll be there,\" Daniel replied with a clear tone, though Liam could almost hear the curiosity behind it.\n\"Get some sleep tonight,\" Liam added, softer. \"You’ll need it.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Daniel said again before the call ended.\nLiam set his phone aside and let his head sink back into the pillow and his gaze traced the patterns on the ceiling.\nHis thoughts couldn’t help but drift to the consequences of his action in the cultivation world. He knew that the entire Blackstone region would become a storm of suspicion, rage, and pursuit. He wasn’t naïve.\n\"I’ve made too much noise,\" he whispered to himself.\nThe City Lord’s son dead. The Xuan family heirs dead. A city’s worth of guards annihilated. Even if he had reason, even if it was survival, the cultivation world wouldn’t see it that way. He would be hunted relentlessly.\nIt didn’t scare him. What bothered him was the distraction. Blackstone was too small a city to be worth his time. The real centers of power, wealth, and cultivation resources lay elsewhere. Why waste days or weeks dancing with petty revenge when he had bigger things to prepare for?\nHe considered the options: minor and major sect cities, where influence was concentrated but not overwhelming. Perhaps safer ground to blend into while expanding his foothold.\nOr... the Imperial City itself which is the heart of the empire. A tempting thought, though dangerously ambitious. The Imperial City was a nest of dragons. One wrong move, and he’d be ripped apart before he could even draw breath.\n\"No,\" he muttered, shaking his head against the pillow. \"Not yet. Too much too soon.\"\nWith a sigh, he dismissed the thoughts. Whether it was a sect city or another frontier, he would decide later. Earth demanded his focus now. Starting tomorrow, things would accelerate.\nExhaling softly, Liam closed his eyes and drifted into sleep.\n***\nThe next morning, sunlight streamed across the polished floors of Bellemere Mansion. Liam had already finished breakfast, already anticipating Daniel’s arrival.\nRight on cue, the sound of tires reached his ears. Moments later, Evelyn appeared at the doorway, her voice polite but carrying a hint of awareness. \"Sir, Mr. Conley has arrived.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam said, standing. He nodded his thanks to the girls, then left the dining hall.\nDaniel was already waiting in the study by the time Liam entered. The man rose to greet him, his posture straight, expression composed as always — though Liam’s trained eyes caught the faintest tension in the way he carried himself. Daniel was a professional, but he was also human. And Liam had a sense Daniel was beginning to realize just how unusual his employer truly was.\nThey took their seats, the morning light spilling across the wide desk between them.\n\"The Family Office is live. All that remains is for you to decide the degree of external visibility. We can remain a ghost in the system, or—\",\" Daniel began with a small smile.\n\"Later,\" Liam interrupted gently. His tone wasn’t dismissive, but his eyes held Daniel’s firmly. \"There’s something else you need to see first.\"\nDaniel paused, surprised. He leaned back slightly. \"Sir?\"\n\"The company’s product,\" Liam said, a faint smile tugging at his lips. \"It’s ready.\"\nDaniel blinked, his composure almost breaking for the first time.\nReady? But the Nevada base was completed only yesterday. Even with extreme efficiency, even with rapid prototyping, it’s impossible to have a physical product already prepared\n, he thought to himself.\nHe hesitated, then his mind leapt to another conclusion. Perhaps it wasn’t hardware. Perhaps it was software. A platform, a program, something intangible. That would explain the timing.\nBut Liam’s calm smile gave nothing away. He reached down, pulled open the drawer, and placed a black box onto the desk, and he slid it across to Daniel.\n\"Open it,\" Liam said.\nDaniel’s eyes flicked between the box and Liam’s expression. \"Are you sure?\"\n\"Go ahead,\" Liam said simply.\nDaniel exhaled once, then picked up the box. It was lighter than he expected. His fingers traced the faint silver emblem at the center — a radiant quasar, sharp and luminous even under the soft study light.\nHe turned it, reading the single word printed along the side.\nLUCID.\nThe name alone prickled at his curiosity. What sort of product bore such a name?\nCarefully, he lifted the cover.\nInside rested an object that, at first glance, seemed deceptively ordinary. A slim, elegant pair of glasses.\nDaniel blinked. For a long moment, he said nothing. Then he looked up, searching Liam’s face for answers. But Liam only smiled, silent, letting the weight of revelation build.\n\"Take it out,\" Liam said at last. \"Put it on.\"\nDaniel hesitated — not out of fear, but out of disbelief. This... this was it? A pair of glasses? But something deep in his gut told him appearances were lying.\nWith careful fingers, he lifted the device from its cradle. It felt impossibly light, almost too light.\nHe slid the LUCID over his ears and it instantly, it came alive.\nA ripple of light burst across his vision, bright yet smooth, an opening animation unlike anything he had ever seen. It began as a radiant quasar, pulsing with energy, expanding outward. Then the image zoomed, pulling him through galaxies, stars stretching into streaks, worlds unfolding and vanishing as he was carried across the cosmos itself.\nDaniel found his breath caught, as he watched the animation in extreme shock.\nThe animation faded, replaced by a calm voice.\n\"Welcome. Please grant permission for neural and retinal scan.\"\nDaniel froze and his pulse hammered in his throat. Neural scan? Retinal scan?\nHe tore the device off in one swift motion, his chest heaving, his eyes wide as he stared at it.\nFor several seconds, he said nothing, his mind a storm of shock, disbelief, and a thousand questions clawing at once. He looked from the glasses to Liam, then back again, struggling for words.\nFinally, his voice cracked out, hoarse with wonder and fear.\n\"...How?\"\nHis question hung heavy in the air, a single syllable that carried all the weight of his disbelief. How could this exist? How could this man, his client, produce something so far beyond anything the world had yet conceived?\nLiam leaned back in his chair, his smile faint but edged with quiet power.\n\"Now,\" Liam said softly, \"let’s talk about Lucid.\"",

And yet, Daniel still hadn’t managed to form a proper sentence.\nThe usually composed banker looked utterly shaken. His breath came shallow, his lips moved without sound, and his eyes darted between the black box on the desk and the calm young man sitting opposite him.\nIt wasn’t possible. It simply wasn’t, was what he had been telling himself for the past ten minutes.\n\"Sir...\" Daniel finally managed, though his voice cracked. He stopped, closed his mouth, and exhaled sharply, trying to steady his racing thoughts.\nHe had spent nearly two decades in the uppermost circles of global finance. As one of JP Morgan’s private client managers, he had seen everything directly and indirectly — billionaires quietly restructuring sovereign debt, industrialists reshaping entire markets, tech giants pouring tens of billions into moonshot projects that may never pay off.\nAnd yet here, in front of him, sat an eighteen-year-old boy holding what should have been the holy grail of consumer technology.\nA fully functional smart glass. It wasn’t the half-baked prototypes tech companies had paraded at expos for a decade. Neither was it the clunky headsets gamers tolerated because there was nothing better.\nThis was sleek, feather-light, elegant. A device so polished it could pass as a luxury accessory.\nMore than that: it was also a gaming device. A true gaming device. A VR console distilled into something no larger than a pair of glasses.\nDaniel’s throat tightened as the realization pressed down on him. This wasn’t supposed to be possible. Apple, Meta, Samsung, Sony — they had all burned through unimaginable sums trying to achieve this. And they all have entire divisions dedicated, entire ecosystems waiting, but they were still years away from something viable.\nYet Liam had it here, in a box on his desk.\nAnd worse — no, more terrifying — he wasn’t unveiling it at a keynote, or holding a press conference. He wasn’t standing on a stage in front of flashing cameras. He was simply... sliding it across his desk with a small smile on his face, as if it were nothing more than a clever gadget he picked up over the weekend.\nDaniel’s mind screamed, How?\nBut when he tried to speak, the word caught in his throat.\nLiam simply leaned back in his chair, watching, patient, almost amused. He had seen that look before — the look of a man whose worldview had just been torn apart.\nAnd he was sort of enjoying it. Daniel had always worn a composed expression on his face, so it was kind of fun seeing him like this.\nFinally, Daniel inhaled deeply and forced his emotions to settle. He raised his eyes and asked, his voice quieter now, \"What... is your plan?\"\nLiam smiled faintly, as though expecting that question all along. \"Test it first. See it for yourself before we talk business.\"\nDaniel nodded, though his pulse hammered faster with every second. He picked up the LUCID back, put it back on.\nImmediately, the device bloomed to life. The quasar again. The surge of light across his vision. Stars flaring into streaks, galaxies rushing past, the sense of being carried across a living universe.\nImmediately, the calm female voice filled his mind.\n\"Welcome. Please grant permission for neural and retinal scan.\"\nDaniel froze. The words alone made his skin prickle. Neural scan? Retinal scan? That wasn’t consumer tech. That was something in the area of classified researches buried in government labs and only whispered about at private dinners between billionaires.\n\"Go ahead,\" Liam already aware that the device was already asking for permission, said gently. \"It’s painless and non-invasive. And it’s the only way to secure the device. Without those two scans, Lucid is nothing more than an accessory. This ensures no one but you can ever use it. It’s also a configuration process for using the device.\"\nDaniel hesitated, then swallowed. \"...Yes.\"\nThe scan completed in less than two seconds. He felt nothing, yet when his vision cleared, he was standing in what could only be described as a digital lobby — a seamless, hyperreal environment that felt more immersive than anything he had ever experienced in VR.\nGrayed out floating icons shimmered ahead of him, though most were grayed out. A calm voice spoke again:\n\"Please create your profile and avatar.\"\nHe obeyed automatically, inputting his details. The process was startlingly fast, intuitive, like filling out a form that completed itself as he thought.\nThen he saw it: his avatar. A perfect replica of himself, down to the exact clothes he was wearing in the study. He blinked, stunned. The system had captured everything from the neural scan.\nBut before he could process it further, a soft glow appeared beside him. A woman materialized — tall, graceful, silver-eyed, with a presence that felt simultaneously warm and unsettling.\n\"Hello, Daniel,\" she said in a smooth, almost melodic voice. \"I am your personal assistant. Would you like to give me a name?\"\nDaniel’s lips twitched. He was barely breathing but he slowly managed to reply, \"Elena.\"\nShe smiled. \"Thank you. From now on, I am Elena. Shall I show you what LUCID can do?\"\nHe could only nod.\nFor the next half hour, Daniel was carried through a whirlwind. Games that blurred the line between reality and fiction. Seamless streaming that felt effortless. And everywhere, Elena guiding him, patient, responsive, adaptive.\nBy the time he removed the device, his face was pale and his hands trembling from shock, and disbelief.\n\"This...\" he whispered, his voice raw. \"This is beyond anything I’ve ever...\" He trailed off, shaking his head.\nHe looked up at Liam, his composure broken. \"Are you sure you want to release this? Do you understand what will happen? The world isn’t ready. It’ll cause chaos.\"\nLiam’s smile didn’t waver. \"That’s the point. The more noise it makes, the faster it sells.\"\nDaniel exhaled slowly, pressing a hand to his temple. His mind was still reeling from everything. He forced himself back into the mindset of a banker, the Manager of a Family Officenow sitting on the greatest product in modern history.\n\"How many units do you have ready?\" he asked hoarsely.\nLiam raised one finger.\nDaniel frowned. \"One hundred thousand?\"\nLiam chuckled softly. \"One million. Plus change.\"\nThe words hit Daniel like a hammer. His pulse spiked and his hands curled against the desk.\nOne. Million.\nDaniel nearly laughed, though it came out as a disbelieving choke. A hundred thousand would have been remarkable. Beyond amazing. Even ten thousand would have been enough to start a frenzy. But over a million?\n\"And the price?\" Daniel asked, almost afraid of the answer.\n\"Seven hundred dollars a unit.\"\nDaniel closed his eyes for a moment, struggling to absorb it. Then he leaned forward, his professional instincts finally taking over.\n\"One million units at seven hundred apiece... Sir, that isn’t a launch. That’s a financial earthquake. Do you realize? If even a whisper of this leaks, the entire consumer electronics industry will convulse. Apple, Samsung, Meta — they’ve all failed to get here, and you’re about to wipe them off the board overnight.\"\nHe continued, his eyes blazing, as he calculated and analysed. \"But you won’t release them all at once, will you? No... of course not. You’ll drip-feed them. Limited supply. High demand. The resale value will skyrocket. Owning one will be like owning a Rolls Royce. It’ll become a status symbol, something people fight tooth and nail for.\"\nLiam’s eyes glinted with amusement. \"Except there’s no resale market. The device locks to the original user, because of the neural and retinal scans. In someone else’s hands, it’s nothing more than an accessory.\"\nFor a moment, Daniel just stared. Then, slowly, a grin spread across his face. A wide, incredulous, manic grin.\n\"You’re going to break the world,\" he whispered, exhaling hard.\nLiam leaned forward, sliding a list across the desk. \"Not yet. First, we market. Forty names — the top tech reviewers and gaming streamers. Contact them. We will ship the product to them discreetly.\"\nDaniel picked up the list, scanning it, and nodded. His grin hadn’t faded. If anything, it had grown sharper.\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said.\n\"But...,\" he continued, \"While the device is groundbreaking, there are still a few issues. The neural scan... sounds scary. Same as the retina scan but not as much as the neural scan. People won’t accept that wording. You’ll get massacred by regulators, the media, and parents’ groups. We’ll need to package it differently.\"\nLiam nodded in agreement when he heard this. He hasn’t really thought about this because he was focused on other things.\n\"I will change the wording. That’s easy. But you will have to explain to the reviewers and we will also put out an official statement that Lucid never reads your mind. It simply calibrates to your neural brainwave patterns for seamless input.\"\n\"Everything’s perfect then,\" Daniel smiled, rising from his seat. He slid the Lucid back onto his face, as though he couldn’t bear to part with it, and bowed his head once. \"I’ll get to work immediately.\"\nLiam smiled as he watched him leave, then leaned back in his chair with a soft sigh. All he has to do now was to wait a bit, as the first stone had been cast and the ripples would follow.\nMoving on from LUCID, it was time to sign-in for the day.",

      "content": "Chapter 154: Lucy’s Body\nThe Great Yan Empire.\nLiam appeared back inside his VIP suite. The room was dark as always, the heavy curtains drawn tight against the outside world, but the shadows didn’t bother him. He moved with steady steps toward the door, with his thoughts already set on the next task.\nThe corridor outside was quiet, the silence broken only by the faint flicker of lanterns burning in glass casings. He descended toward the lounge, his presence drawing immediate attention.\nEyes followed him and whispered voices immediately rippled through the chamber. Everyone knew who he was — or rather, what he had done. Blackstone had become a storm, and rumors traveled faster than arrows. Some gazes held fear, others awe, a few even hostility. But Liam ignored them all. He didn’t need the validation or the scorn of strangers.\nHis attention fixed only on the attendant by the counter.\n\"How many days have I overspent on my reservation?\" Liam asked calmly, his voice even, betraying no hint of emotion.\nThe attendant, who only a week ago would have spoken with the formal politeness of duty, now bowed with excessive respect. \"Honored guest... you have exceeded your original reservation by two days.\"\nLiam nodded once, then reached into his storage. A gleam of gold spilled into his palm. He slid eight coins across the counter with casual ease.\n\"Extend my reservation,\" he said.\nThe attendant’s eyes widened, as he accepted the coins.\n\"Yes, of course, honored guest. Your suite will remain yours for as long as you wish. Please... keep your card.\"\nLiam inclined his head and turned away, unconcerned by the shocked expressions that trailed behind him as he returned to his suite.\nThey had thought that Liam would leave the city immediately but it seems like they were wrong. Liam paid eight gold coins, which means he’s reserving his room for five months. He would only do that if he has no plans of leaving.\nLiam indeed still plans to leave the city but things with Lucid are already underway, and he doesn’t want to be away for too long.\nOnce inside his suite, Liam sat on the bed and spoke the words, \"System, sign-in.\"\n[Congratulations, Host, you received 20,000 Gold Coins.]\n[You received 100 Spirit Stones.]\nA small smile touched his lips. He hadn’t been expecting another supreme reward after last time, so the gain was a pleasant one.\nWith that, his gold coins had risen to nearly sixty-five thousand, while his collection of spirit stones now stood at three hundred and fifty.\nWith the sign-in completed, Liam vanished from the suite in an instant, reappearing in the quiet comfort of his bedroom.\nHe collapsed backward onto the bed, staring at the ceiling, his mind racing with thoughts of what was to come.\nHe could already see the tidal wave that would follow once the Lucid touched the hands of reviewers and they release a video of it. Governments and corporations would investigate, and scramble to find out everything about the device, and the company behind it.\nBut it would take time for the hunters to trace ownership. The company itself was slotted under a trust, hidden beneath a Family Office structure, with JP Morgan’s resources serving as cover. Months would pass before they could dig deep enough to even suspect him.\nAnd by then, it would be far too late.\nHe thought again of the marketing plan. Forty names. Fifteen tech reviewers — the loudest, most trusted voices in technology. Twenty-five gaming streamers — the ones with audiences in the millions, whose words sparked trends overnight.\nThe tech reviewers would receive Lucid first and two weeks later, just before the official release, the streamers would follow, igniting the wildfire of demand.\nHe closed his eyes, smiling to himself . Of course they would all say yes. No reviewer in their right mind would turn down exclusive access to something so revolutionary.\nAs the thought settled, Lucy’s voice flowed into his mind, breaking the calm.\n\"Master. My body is ready.\"\nLiam’s eyes snapped open, excited to see Lucy’s body. He vanished from his room in the next instant, stepping into the endless expanse of the Dimensional Space and what he saw made him pause.\nStanding before him was a woman. She was breathtakingly beautiful, her form looks like it was sculpted by a divine hand . Her skin was flawless, glowing faintly as though kissed by moonlight. She wore a sharp, sensual office-lady attire — a fitted blouse tucked into a pencil skirt, a black thigh high socks, and heels. Her long black hair shimmered like black silk, cascading over her shoulders in smooth waves. Her eyes — silver-gray, intelligent, piercing — met his with warmth.\nLiam couldn’t help but smile. \"You look beautiful.\"\nHe meant that as a compliment and not in any other way. He has seen beautiful women. Lana, Stacy, Elise, Kristy — they are all beautiful.\nLucy inclined her head and smiled sweetly. She spoke, her voice coming from her mouth, smooth and natural, as if she were truly human. \"Thank you, Master.\"\nLiam reached out, brushing his fingers against her hand. The texture stunned him. It was warm and soft. She looked and felt no different from a living woman. His satisfaction was evident in his expression.\n\"Show me the things you can do,\" he said to her.\nLucy nodded, then she shot into the air with a burst of speed. She soared high into the sky, looping around for a few seconds, before descending with a sharp landing that cracked the ground.\nShards of stone leapt upward from the impact. Lucy raised her hand, and the fragments hovered, suspended by antigravity fields. With a flick of her wrist, she hurled them towards the direction of the valley, where they shattered against distant cliffs in thunderous bursts.\nThrough Lucid, her voice explained: \"This body is human in appearance and sensation. It possesses flight, regenerative capacity, and adaptive attire — any outfit, at will. My antigravity field allows me to manipulate objects, though not as finely as your telekinesis. I cannot transform my body, but damage repairs instantly thanks to the nanites.\"\nLiam nodded slowly, impressed. Her speed, her strength, she was everything he envisioned and more.\n\"Good,\" he said firmly. \"Start on the tasks we discussed. It’s time to build the autonomous infrastructure.\"\nLucy’s eyes gleamed. \"I’ll begin immediately.\"\nLiam gave one last approving nod, then vanished back to Earth.\nHe saw that his phone was ringing. He picked it up, seeing Daniel’s name. He answered.\n\"Sir,\" Daniel’s voice came, brimming with suppressed excitement. \"I’ve received replies from some of the reviewers and streamers. They’re asking when the device will be delivered.\"\nLiam chuckled.\nIt’s only been minutes, and they’re already eager. This is the power of a Family Office and having someone like Daniel working for you.\nHe leaned back against the bedframe, smiling. \"Tell the tech reviewers they’ll receive their units in three days. Have them drop their addresses. As for the streamers, in two weeks and four days.\"\n\"Understood, sir,\" Daniel replied smoothly.\n\"One more thing,\" Liam added. \"Send me your Lucid account’s user ID. I’ll add you. With your specialized version, we’ll be able to communicate directly.\"\n\"Yes, sir. I’ll send it right away.\"\nThe call ended and Liam set the phone down, with a wide smile on his face.",

Just now and they said that they will deliver the product in three days,\" the manager replied.\n\"Three days? That long?\" Brian asked with a frown.\n\"Yeah. Disappointing. I know,\" the manager sighed.\n\"Well, I just hope the product is really up to the hype they are heaping on it. I will hate to be disappointed,\" Brian said, relaxing back into the sofa.\n\"Since the email came from a very reliable source and they used the normal encrypted channel, they will won’t disappoint,\" the manager said.\n\"I hope so. Because it’s coming from those people doesn’t mean that it will be real. I mean if that was so, why didn’t he release news about the product in an expo or in a keynote?\" Brian asked.\n\"Who knows? Maybe they don’t want to publicise it like that. Their e-mail said that it’s a product that Applē, Metā and Gōōgle have been trying so hard to perfect,\" his manager said.\n\"That was another reason why I accepted to review the product. I really want to know what sort of product it was.\"\n\"I guess we have to no choice but to wait for three days then,\" his manager sighed, relaxing back into the sofa.\n\"Three days it is then,\" Brian sighed, picking up his phone.\n\"But what sort of product do you think it is?\" His manager asked.\n\"My best guess? It’s just baseless hype. I would had said that it’s a smart glass but such is impossible to come from an unknown company,\" Brian replied.\nHis manager made a face that said, \"oh well\", and sighed.\n***\nMeanwhile, Liam was on the call with Daniel.\n\"Daniel, meet me at Hangar 14, Imperial Terminal, South Side of Los Angeles International Airport.\"\n\"Ok, sir. I will be there,\" Daniel replied.\nLiam nodded and ended the call. He stood up from the bed and left his room, slowly walking down the stairs.\nToday was the day was the day he finally takes a ride in the Cabriolet Imperium and fly in his fully customised Airbus A380.\nSaying it like that feels like he’s bragging but who cares? It was finally time for him to take those beasts out, after collecting dust in the garage, and hangar for so long.\nActually, it has only been a few days. Barely five days since he received them but it felt like an eternity for him.\nLiam had already called the flight captain Ave informed him that he will arriving soon. And he also asked Mason, and Nick to get the car ready, and they were waiting for him. There was something Liam noticed when he gave them the instructions. He has no idea if he has sensed wrong but it seems like they had no idea of the car until he told them about it.\nHe has no idea how that was possible. Nick and Mason should had gone in and out of the garage more than a couple of times over the last few days. Also, they drove him to the party and other places he went to.\nThen how was it possible that they have no idea of the car? Was the system involved? Liam was curious but he didn’t read too much into it.\n\"Sir, the car’s waiting outside,\" Mason said, when he reached the end of the staircase.\n\"Thank you, Mason,\" Liam said, catching the mixed look of shock, confusion and disbelief in Mason’s eyes.\nThough he tried to hide it but not so much from Liam.\nSeems like he really had no idea. I wonder how the system did it,\nLiam smiled, as they both walked to the front door.\nMason opened the door and what came into Liam’s view was a masterpiece work of art that should be called beautiful in every language.\nThe car waited at the steps like a jewel carved from metal and light. The body stretched long and impossibly sleek, painted in a deep obsidian onyx black and platinum microflakes that seemed to drink in the sunlight.\nThe hood extended endlessly forward, a prow of elegance and power, while the narrow headlights glowed like molten slits of crystal. The Imperium badge shimmered on the grille — a radiant crown above the classic Maybach emblem.\nThe car looked like something between a luxury yacht and a futuristic grand tourer, impossibly long and sleek, with an elegance that made even the biggest luxury car brand seem ordinary.\nWow! So, this is the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium? It looks even more beautiful than in the picture. Thank you so much, system.\nLiam took a deep breath, then walked to the car. Mason opened the backseat and he took his seat.\nThe first thing he noticed was that the interior was... otherworldly.\nLiam let his palm run slowly along the edge of the seat. The leather wasn’t like the ordinary hides used in luxury sedans; this was something else entirely.\nThe surface was impossibly smooth, supple, like warm skin under his fingertips. It yielded slightly to pressure, then bounced back, exuding both comfort and resilience.\nMason slid into the passenger seat up front, though Liam noticed the way his eyes had roamed earlier — disbelief, curiosity, awe.\nHe still hadn’t processed the existence of this car, and the way his jaw tightened told Liam he was restraining the urge to ask a dozen questions.\nNick glanced back and asked, \"Destination, sir?\"\n\"Hangar Fourteen, Imperial Terminal, South side of LAX,\" Liam said casually.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nNick’s hands settled on the steering wheel, which glowed faintly at his touch. The car stirred awake with a very low sound, like it was almost never there.\nThe Imperium glided forward, leaving Bellemere’s gates behind.\nThey rolled down the tree-lined nearly empty roads of Holmby Hills, the sunlight cutting between the branches overhead.\nAt the stop sign near the boulevard, a jogger reduced her pace, with her eyes widening as the car slid into view. She nearly tripped over her own feet, staring, before fumbling for her phone.\nLiam gave a small smile when he saw this. He knew that he would also have the same reaction as the woman or even worse.\nShe wasn’t the only one looking, as everyone that sighted the car, already had their eyes pinned on it.",

      "content": "Chapter 156: Grabbing Attention\n\"What the hell am I looking at?\" a pedestrian muttered, slack-jawed, as the car rolled past him.\nThe Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium wasn’t just a car. For him, it was more like a vision that didn’t belong to the world he knew.\nThe onyx-black body shimmered with platinum microflakes that seemed to drink in the sun, its elongated form gliding silently over the road like a predator.\nHeads turned instantly, conversations were cut short and coffee cups froze halfway to lips. A delivery cyclist nearly toppled over when his handlebars veered at the sight. Phones flew into hands as if by instinct, their cameras struggling to capture the impossible angles and surreal sheen of the car.\n\"Is that... a Maybach?\" another man whispered, staring as though naming it aloud would summon disbelief. \"No... that’s not anything Maybach has ever released.\"\nThe car drive down the street with grace, its presence parting traffic like a ghost ship on the ocean. Even the roar of engines around it seemed muted, insignificant, swallowed by its aura.\nInside, Liam leaned back in the seat, perfectly calm. Mason sat tense in the passenger seat, stealing glances every few seconds, while Nick gripped the wheel with a professionalism that was only skin-deep.\nLiam noticed the way his knuckles whitened, the faint tremor he fought to hide. Even for someone who might had chauffeured luxury cars his whole career, this was beyond comprehension.\nThey turned onto Wilshire Boulevard, and chaos followed.\nPedestrians crowded the sidewalks, with phones raised. Some sprinted across intersections just to catch another glimpse. A\n\"Yo, what is that?\" a teenager shouted, chasing after the car with his friends. \"That’s not even out yet, bro! That’s like— that’s like 2050 level!\"\n\"Shut up and record!\" one of his friends barked, already live-streaming. Within seconds, the comments on his feed exploded.\nLive steam chat:\n\"FAKE! CGI!\"\n\"Bro that’s real, I live in LA I’m here right now wtf.\"\n\"Future tech?? Elon??\n\"Nah, that’s gotta be concept car... but how’s it on the street??\"\nTraffic began to ripple outward like concentric waves in a pond. Most drivers slowed, craning their necks out of their cars to get a better view at what was in front of them.\nSome even forgot to accelerate when lights turned green, earning them horns from behind. A Texsla driver pulled up alongside, eyes wide, and simply matched speed, recording every angle he could before nearly drifting into another lane.\nSoon, they were moving through a clogged artery of downtown, and the car itself became the cause. Vehicles slowed deliberately, boxing themselves around the car just to gawk.\nA delivery truck stopped dead in its lane as the driver leaned out the window, phone extended. The honking behind him grew into a cacophony, but no one cared — their eyes were glued to the rolling phantom.\nIf one saw the scene, they would be curious to know how an accident didn’t happen.\nNick kept his composure, weaving the car forward with a precision that belied the chaos outside. But even he couldn’t stop the inevitable: gridlock.\nLiam glanced through the tinted windows and he saw that a crowd had formed, spilling from sidewalks onto the road, pressing dangerously close.\nDozens of phones hovered in the air, recording from every angle. Some people waved; others simply stared in reverence, as though in the presence of a legendary or mythic artifact.\n\"This is madness. They’re going to block us in at this rate,\" Mason muttered under his breath, as his eyes darted from one side to the other.\n\"They won’t,\" Liam said simply.\nSure enough, the crowd parted as Nick edged the Imperium forward, the car’s aura doing what no horn or siren could have accomplished.\nThe sea of people gave way, reluctantly but irresistibly, recording every inch as the car slid through.\nAbove, the buzz of rotors drew Mason’s gaze and he cursed softly, \"Drones.\"\nCivilian drones, a few of them, hovered like vultures, their lenses trained downward. Footage streamed instantly to every corner of the internet. Within minutes, hashtags lit up across platforms:\n#UnknownCar\n#WhatIsThis\n#FutureMaybach\n#GodOnWheels\nSpeculation went wild. Some insisted it was a secret Applē car, while thers swore it had to be Elon Musk’s next project. A few conspiracy theorists were convinced it was military tech disguised as a luxury vehicle.\nBut no one guessed the truth.\nFor more than an hour, the Imperium crept toward LAX, leaving a trail of chaos in its wake. Traffic bated his fangs for blocks and police dispatch radios crackled with reports of \"an unidentified luxury vehicle causing gridlock.\"\nAnd through it all, Liam sat in perfect calm, one hand resting lightly on the armrest. He saw the drones above, but his expression never changed.\nFor him, the world could watch. They can speculate all they want, as none of it mattered.\nFinally, the sprawl of LAX appeared on the horizon. Glass terminals gleamed in the afternoon sun, planes roared overhead, and the chaos of travelers filled the air.\nBut even here, even among the steady stream of luxury cars like Bentleys and Rolls Royces gliding toward private hangars, the Imperium drew every eye.\nSecurity guards at the terminal gates froze as the car approached. Their radios crackled urgently. One guard raised his phone before his superior barked at him to put it away.\nThankfully he didn’t get fired that day.\nNick guided the car smoothly to Imperial Terminal’s south side. Hangar 14 loomed ahead, a massive structure of steel and glass.\nThe gates parted silently, and the Imperium glided forward, slipping away from the chaos outside and into the cool shadow of the hangar.\nToo bad for the drones still hovering a few kilometres from the airport. They couldn’t help but wish that the no-fly zone didn’t exist, but they also knew when to stop. Besides, the drones that flew into the airport’s airspace were scrambled, jammed or even forcibly landed by the airport’s drone defense system.\nAs the doors shut behind them, the noise of the city dulled, replaced by silence. Mason opened the rear door, stepping aside as Liam emerged.\nThe moment Liam’s shoes touched the hangar floor, his eyes lifted — and he froze.\nBefore him stood a monster.\nIt dwarfed even the cavernous space of the hangar, gleaming beneath the industrial lights like a sleeping titan. Wings stretched wide, their span swallowing shadows.\nAnd beside it were a group of people in professional attires. One of them, a man in a pilot uniform, walked towards Liam and greeted him.\n\"Good morning, Mr Scott. I’m Captain Adler,\" the man said, as he shook Liam’s hand.",

      "content": "Chapter 157: Taking A Look Around The Flying Palace\nLiam and Captain Adler exchanged firm handshakes, the older man’s grip respectful and very steady, testament to the number of years he has flown.\nBehind him stood his co-pilot, a broad-shouldered man in his forties with a neatly trimmed beard, and three hostesses, each dressed immaculately in tailored uniforms.\nThey greeted Liam one after another, voices polite, postures professional. Yet beneath the polished manners, Liam could see the faint tremor in their eyes. Shock. Disbelief. Even a touch of fear.\nThey couldn’t help it. Their minds were trying to reconcile two truths: that this was no ordinary private jet, and that its owner, the man they were now addressing as sir, was not a seasoned tycoon or retired magnate — but a young man barely out of boyhood.\nIf this had been a Gulfstream G700 or a Bombardier Global 8000, they might have nodded in silent acceptance. Ultra-wealthy people buying private jets was nothing new. But this... this was different.\nThe Airbus A380 — the double-decked giant, the behemoth of the skies. An aircraft so massive and complex that only the richest airlines and national carriers had ever operated it.\nIts private version had been dubbed \"The Flying Palace,\" whispered about in aviation circles as a fantasy project for oil sheikhs and royalty, and even then, it was considered impossible to bring to life.\nAnd now... here it was. Real. Finished. Gleaming like a black titan under the hangar lights. And it belonged to a kid.\nHow? That was the question buried in each of their hearts. How was this possible? How was this fair?\nLiam caught those silent thoughts reflected in their expressions, but he said nothing. There was nothing to be said. Explanations wouldn’t lessen the shock. Time wouldn’t either. All he could do was let reality itself do the talking.\n\"Follow me, sir,\" Captain Adler said with a professional smile, gesturing toward the lift.\nLiam inclined his head, and the group moved. One of the hostesses hurried ahead, heels clicking against the polished concrete, joining them as the lift descended.\nThe platform touched down with a soft thud. Liam stepped onto it and Adler followed, the hostess at their side. The platform groaned faintly as the hydraulics pushed it upward, carrying them toward the open door of the aircraft.\nThe moment the doorway loomed before him, Captain Adler extended his arm with a faint smile. \"Welcome aboard, sir.\"\nLiam crossed the threshold and stopped.\nEven though he had seen pictures and read through the document of A380 \"Flying Palace,\" nothing could have prepared him for this. The scale alone was overwhelming.\nThe entry hall stretched before him like the lobby of a luxury hotel. Marble-inspired flooring gleamed under golden ambient lighting.\nA curved staircase, its railing polished steel wrapped with soft leather, led upward to the second deck. Off to one side, a lounge spread out with velvet sofas and a wide screen that blended seamlessly into the wall.\nLiam had no words for several seconds.\nCaptain Adler’s lips curved knowingly. \"It’s something else in person, isn’t it?\"\n\"It’s...\" Liam exhaled slowly, eyes drinking in every detail. \"Perfect.\"\nAdler began the familiarization tour. They moved first through the main deck, past a dining area that looked more like a Michelin-starred restaurant, complete with crystal decanters and hand-stitched chairs.\nNext came the private suites, each designed like five-star hotel rooms, soundproofed, with beds framed in polished wood and mood lighting programmed to simulate sunrise or starlight.\nThe master suite at the nose of the aircraft nearly stunned Liam into silence. A king-sized bed sat beneath an arched ceiling where an artificial sky projected shifting constellations. A walk-in wardrobe stretched along one wall. The bathroom boasted marble tiling, a rainfall shower, even a compact spa.\nEverywhere, technology and luxury blended seamlessly. Augmented reality displays disguised as windows offered any view Liam desired — an alpine sunrise, a Tokyo skyline, or the real world outside.\nAdler led him through entertainment zones, a private cinema with reclined leather seating and a gym with polished chrome equipment.\nFinally, they reached the cockpit. Adler gestured proudly to the twin seats, the vast array of avionics, the panoramic windows that overlooked the expanse of the hangar.\n\"This,\" Adler said, his hand brushing affectionately over the controls, \"is the heart of the beast. And she is ready whenever you are.\"\nMore than thirty minutes later, the tour was complete. Liam returned to the main lounge, still absorbing what he had seen. He lowered himself onto one of the sofas, running his hand absentmindedly along the leather.\nIt’s everything I imagined... and more.\nAnd yet, despite his calm exterior, a small fire of impatience burned inside him. He was itching to take it out. To feel the giant wheels lift off the ground, to see this impossible machine climb into the sky under his command.\nBut he waited as Daniel still hadn’t arrived.\n***\nDaniel slowly drove into the hangar, his expression unreadable but his mind racing.\nHe had spent his life around wealth. He had walked the mansions of millionaires and billionaires, but as his sedan rolled into the shadow of Hangar 14, nothing in his career prepared him for what came into view.\nAt first, he thought it was a trick of the light — a black shape too massive, too surreal. But as he pulled closer, the lines resolved, and his breath caught.\nIt wasn’t a trick. It was a monster.\nThe aircraft loomed over him, dwarfing even the cavernous hangar, its wings stretching outward like the arms of a slumbering giant. Its body gleamed black, polished to a mirror sheen, with subtle platinum lines tracing along its length. The engines — four of them, each big enough to swallow a car — hung like silver crowns beneath the wings.\nAnd standing near the lift were Mason and Nick, their figures tiny against the titan.\nDaniel stopped the car and stepped out slowly. He wanted to speak, to ask what this was, but before words could leave his lips, Elena, his personal AI assistant, informed him that he has a message from Liam.\nHe opened the message and it read, \"Come on up.\"\nHe turned, and saw the lift platform lowering.\nDaniel walked toward it with his pulse hammering. He waited as the platform touched the ground, then stepped aboard, followed by Mason and Nick. As it rose, the impossibility of the situation sank deeper into his bones.\nWhen the lift aligned with the open door, his eyes widened. The interior stretched before him like something from another world. The marble floors, the staircases, the lounge that looked like it belonged in a palace — it confirmed what his instincts already screamed.\nLiam had acquired an Airbus A380 private jet.\nDaniel stepped inside, followed closely by Mason and Nick. Both bodyguards were slack-jawed, their usual stoic professionalism crumbling as they took in the sight. Their eyes roamed every surface, every glowing light, their footsteps hesitant, almost reverent.\n\"Take a seat,\" Liam said smoothly. \"Mason, Nick — make yourselves comfortable.\"\nThey obeyed silently, still dazed.\nWhen Daniel finally sat, Liam leaned forward slightly. \"Well?\" he asked, a faint smile tugging at his lips. \"What do you think?\"\nDaniel exhaled, shaking his head faintly. \"Amazing,\" he admitted at last. His voice was hoarse, stripped of the usual composure he wore like armor.\nLiam’s smile deepened slightly. He gestured between him and Adler. \"Daniel, this is Captain Adler. From now on, he’ll coordinate with you. You already have someone assigned to manage my logistics. That person will coordinate with Nick, Captain Adler, the helicopter crew, and the captain of the yacht.\"\nDaniel blinked, his banker’s instincts snapping awake. He understood immediately. This wasn’t just a show of wealth. Liam wasn’t parading his private jet for bragging rights. He was weaving together a network — land, sea, air — an autonomous infrastructure built entirely around himself.\nThe message was clear: this wasn’t about luxury. It was about power.\nLiam leaned back against the sofa and turned his head toward Captain Adler. \"We’re ready. Take us into the air.\"\nAdler bowed his head once. \"Yes, sir. I’ll have them tow us out immediately.\"\nAs the captain left to issue the order, Daniel turned back to Liam, wanting to start making arrangements.\n\"Where are we flying?\" He asked, his voice edged with disbelief.\nLiam smiled faintly, \"My private island.\"\nDaniel sat back slowly, words failing him. For the first time in years, the seasoned banker — who had seen everything, calculated everything — was left utterly speechless.",

      "content": "Chapter 158: The Black Titan’s Takeoff (Bonus Chapter)\nCaptain Adler slipped his headset down and keyed into the ops frequency, his voice calm, professional,\"Ground Ops, this is Hangar Fourteen, requesting tow clearance for Airbus A380, registry N914LX, from Imperial Terminal to taxiway Bravo.\"\nThere was a pause. Then another. On the other end, someone cleared their throat and asked carefully, \"...Did you say A380? From Hangar Fourteen?\"\n\"Affirmative,\" Adler replied with a steady voice.\nMore silence, then the sound of papers rustling, voices murmured and finally, a different voice came on, sharper, incredulous, \"This is Ground Ops. Confirm aircraft type again.\"\nAdler’s lips curved faintly. \"Airbus A380-800. Private configuration. Fully registered, cleared, and flight-ready.\"\nThe line went dead for a second, as if even the radios had to absorb it, then the voices came again, \"...Tow request acknowledged. Stand by for movement crew.\"\nAdler closed the line without another word and turned to his co-pilot who shares the same faint smirk on his face. It did feel good hearing the shock in their voices.\n***\nHangar Floor\nThe thunder of machinery grew louder. From the far end of the hangar apron, a massive tow tug rolled into view — one of the hulking beasts usually reserved for Emirates and Singapore Airlines.\nIts diesel heart growled as it lumbered closer, flanked by wing-walkers, marshallers, and ground engineers. At least ten men and women marched in its wake, reflective vests catching the afternoon sun.\nThey slowed as hey approached the already opened hangar and then they saw it.\nA A380 that wasn’t painted in airline colors, not wearing the livery of nations or corporations.\nInstead, it gleamed like obsidian under the lights, platinum streaks tracing along its body, the nose pointed downward like a predator preparing to strike.\nThe ground crew froze.\n\"Holy...\" the tug driver whispered, voice caught in his throat. \"That’s not Emirates’.\"\n\"It doesn’t look like it,\" another muttered. His eyes swept over the black sheen, the mirror-like finish, the impossible perfection. \"It’s private ...has to be some oil prince. Or... hell, military?\"\n\"Military doesn’t paint their birds like that,\" one of the wing-walkers murmured, awe softening his professional mask.\nPhones twitched in pockets, fingers itched toward them. But supervisors barked sharp orders, snapping the crew back to motion. Cameras would mean instant dismissal. Still, disbelief clung to their faces like sweat.\nThe tug groaned into place beneath the titan’s nose. Hydraulic clamps locked onto the landing gear, and with a low rumble, the A380 rolled forward.\nSunlight spilled across its body as the nose breached the open hangar doors. Shadows bent and broke under its wingspan, swallowing vehicles, people, even the tug itself beneath their sheer reach. The ground trembled faintly as hundreds of tons of steel and engineering crept toward the taxiway.\nFrom the position where he was seated, Liam watched silently. Daniel sat slightly back, but he looked a bit uneasy.\n\"Is anything the problem, Daniel?\" Liam asked.\nDaniel exhaled softly and his gaze focused on Liam, as he said, \"Sir... you realize what happens now, don’t you?\"\nLiam glanced at him. Of course he knew but he still asked, \"Enlighten me.\"\nDaniel’s throat bobbed. \"An A380 hasn’t flown privately in... well, ever. The few rumored projects were fantasies for oil kings that never reached completion. For you to roll one out of LAX — the busiest hub on the West Coast — every aviation enthusiast, every airline executive, every regulator, and every government agency with a satellite feed is going to notice. There will be chatter in Washington within the hour. London, Dubai, Singapore — they’ll all be asking the same question: Who owns the black A380?\"\nHe continued as his voice hardened, \"This isn’t like the car that caused a gridlock on the way. This is global aviation politics and an entire industries will pivot to investigate.\"\n\"Car? You mean that Maybach concept car? It’s mine. As for investigations? I don’t really mind. It’s not like I did anything wrong. Besides, I have you,\" Liam smiled and relaxed back.\nDaniel stared at him blankly for a moment.\nYou own the car???\nHe looked towards Mason and Nick, and they pointed at the Cabriolet parked a some distance from the hangar entrance.\nDaniel’s eyes widened in shock, then he glanced at Liam, then back to the car. He couldn’t help but feel that he signed up for something so far beyond him.\n***\nTaxiway Bravo\nThe tow tug crawled forward, guiding the Imperium out into the afternoon light. The sight drew eyes instantly. Pilots in cockpits craned their necks, airline crews pressed themselves against terminal glass and passengers at boarding gates froze mid-conversation, their chatter breaking into startled questions.\n\"Is that... an A380?\"\n\"It can’t be, they retired those!\"\n\"No, look — it’s black. I’ve never seen an airline livery like that. Is it... private?\"\n\"Private? What the hell are you talking about? That’s a real A380, not a drone version. Who the hell has enough to get themself a private one? The maintenance costs along will be insane.\"\n\"We all know that, Sherlock. Just how do you explain this then?\"\nPhones rose against the glass. Photos snapped and videos rolled. Social feeds flared alive. Hashtags began spreading like wildfire:\n#BlackTitan\n#LAXMysteryJet\n#PrivateA380\nAirline dispatchers muttered furiously into headsets. Flight crews swapped theories in hushed voices. Even baggage handlers stopped mid-load to stare, jaws slack.\nIn the tower, controllers leaned forward, pressing their headsets tighter. \"Ground, confirm — we’ve got an A380 taxiing out of Imperial Terminal?\"\n\"Confirmed,\" Ground Ops replied, voices strained. \"Registry N914LX. Private config.\"\nThe tower went silent for a moment, then came the incredulous response: \"Private? ...Copy that. Clear taxi route to Runway 25R. Alert traffic. This will cause wake delays.\"\n***\nDaniel remained at the desk, already thumbing out messages to his team to set up cover stories and redirect attention. But he knew that this was going to do very little, because the world governments and the whole world will tear everything apart in less than a day.\nCaptain Adler’s voice came over the internal comms. \"Sir, we’ve been cleared to taxi. Expect departure from 25R.\"\n\"Take us up, captain\" Liam replied smoothly.\nThe engines rumbled awake — a low, thunderous growl that vibrated through the decks. Even throttled low, the sound shook the hangar glass as the A380 inched forward under its own power.\nThe black titan rolled into position at 25R.\nOnlookers crowded every available window, pressed against fences, phones raised high. Pilots in cockpits radioed each other, disbelieving chatter bouncing between frequencies.\n\"Tower, confirm that’s private traffic?\"\n\"Affirmative. Private registry.\"\n\"...Who the hell owns it?\"\n\"Not in our clearance notes. Fly your plane, Captain.\"\nThe engines deepened into a roar. Concrete trembled beneath the beast’s weight. Lights along the runway shimmered against its obsidian skin.\nAdler’s voice, calm, unshaken: \"Imperium Heavy, cleared for takeoff, Runway 25R.\"\n\"Copy, cleared 25R.\"\nThrottle forward.\nThe four Rolls-Royce Trent engines bellowed. The sound hit like a physical force, rattling windows across the terminal, sending vibrations through the bones of everyone watching.\nThe aircraft surged forward, wheels thundering against the asphalt, acceleration building with terrifying inevitability.\nPassengers at nearby gates screamed with excitement, phones shaking as they recorded. The sound streamed instantly onto TikTok, Instagram, Twitter. Comments exploded.\n\"PRIVATE A380 TAKING OFF FROM LAX WTF\"\n\"Elon? Apple? Secret project??\"\n\"Bro I’m AT THE GATE watching this LIVE!!!\"\n\"I just saw this on the page of plane spotter.\"\n***\nAt 150 knots, the aircraft’s nose lifted, as the giant bird rose, improbably graceful, its shadow sliding across the tarmac like a drifting continent.\nFor a heartbeat, the world seemed to hold its breath. Then the wheels left the earth, and the impossible became real.\nThe black titan climbed, engines roaring like gods at war. Its wings cut through the sky, banking westward. Sunlight glinted off obsidian and platinum, dazzling the crowd below.\nOn the ground, chaos reigned. Radios buzzed, controllers muttered, passengers screamed into phones and aviation forums caught fire with disbelief.\nAnd in the lounge of the Imperium, Liam reclined in perfect calm, watching the blue horizon open before him.\n\"Sir...\" Daniel called out softly.\nLiam turned to him but Daniel kept quiet, and he chuckled, \"Don’t worry about it too much. Let’s just enjoy the ride.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Daniel sighed, collapsing back helplessly.\nYep, my days are going to be hellish.",

      "content": "Chapter 159: Causing Commotion (Bonus Chapter)\nThe roar of the black A380 still echoed across Los Angeles long after it had vanished into the afternoon sky.\nAt LAX, silence lingered for a moment inside the terminals, then chaos erupted.\nPassengers crowded every available window, their phones pressed to glass, voices rising in a storm of disbelief. Some sprinted from gate to gate just to keep the jet in sight as it banked westward, its wings flashing platinum in the sun.\nIn the control tower, controllers leaned out of their panoramic windows, still gaping.\nOne muttered into his headset, \"That’s not real. I mean—it can’t be real.\"\nAnother shook his head, eyes fixed on the receding titan. \"It just took off. That was no drone, no model. That was an actual A380.\"\nOn the ground, baggage crews stopped working. Handlers, drivers, and maintenance staff stood frozen, their jobs forgotten as they craned their necks skyward. Even the usually stoic security officers near the perimeter fence lifted their phones, capturing shaky footage of the beast climbing into the sky.\nOutside the airport, the crowd of plane spotters was already in full frenzy.\nThe little hill near Sepulveda Boulevard had always been a haven for enthusiasts with long lenses and tripods. Most days, they came for the stream of widebodies — 777s, Dreamliners, the occasional freighter. But today, their lenses trembled as they tracked the black aircraft lifting into the sky.\n\"Jesus Christ,\" one spotter gasped, his camera rattling in his hands. \"That’s a 380! A 380 in private livery!\"\n\"It can’t be private. No way. They never built one,\" another argued, even as his own shutter clicked furiously.\nA third man, livestreaming to his channel, was nearly incoherent. \"Chat, you’re seeing this, right? You’re SEEING this? That’s an A380 — all black, platinum streaks. Holy hell, my hands are shaking.\"\nThe livestream exploded instantly. Thousands of viewers swarmed in, spamming the chat.\n\"FAKE. 100% CGI.\"\n\"Dumbass upstairs, is CGI possible on live st4eam? I’m at LAX, I’m seeing it too!\"\n\"What airline is that??\"\n\"Not airline. PRIVATE. Someone’s flying a private 380.\"\n\"Impossible. That’s oil-sheikh fantasy level.\"\nWithin minutes, the video was clipped, reposted, and re-shared across every platform imaginable.\n#BlackTitan trended first in Los Angeles. Then across the U.S. Then worldwide.\nBy the time the A380 leveled at cruising altitude, the internet was ablaze.\nClips of the takeoff dominated TikTok’s \"For You\" pages. On Twitter, theories multiplied by the second. Reddit’s r/aviation was on fire with new threads, each more frantic than the last.\n\"Private A380 confirmed??\" one post screamed, already with 12,000 upvotes.\nAnother user wrote: \"I was at Gate 152. I swear, the ground literally shook. That thing is all black, no airline markings. Who the hell OWNS that?\"\nSpeculation spiraled wildly. Some swore it had to be Apple, secretly unveiling a flying tech campus. Others insisted it was Elon Musk, testing some experimental luxury program.\nA few pointed toward Saudi princes or Emirati royalty. Conspiracy theorists went even further, claiming it was CIA black-budget technology disguised as a private aircraft.\nAnd beneath it all, awe. Pure awe.\nNewsrooms were no slower.\nBy the top of the hour, every major channel in Los Angeles had cut into programming with \"Breaking News\" banners.\nCNN went live with footage from plane spotters. Fox News played shaky cellphone videos from the terminal, anchors nearly shouting over each other. BBC ran the story across its ticker with the blunt headline:\n\"Unmarked A380 Departs Los Angeles — Ownership Unknown.\"\nAt CNBC, anchors spoke in rushed tones: \"Viewers, what you’re seeing right now is not a scheduled commercial flight. That is a privately outfitted Airbus A380 — the first of its kind to ever fly. This aircraft type has only ever been operated by airlines due to its size and cost. To see one flying privately, with this livery... frankly, it’s unprecedented.\"\nRequests for comment flooded LAX immediately.\nAirport spokespeople were bombarded with calls. Reporters swarmed the terminals, shoving microphones at bewildered passengers. \"Did you see it?\" they demanded. \"What did it look like?\"\nFinally, an official statement was released.\n\"Los Angeles International Airport can confirm that an Airbus A380-800, privately registered as N914LX, departed earlier today from Imperial Terminal. The aircraft possesses all required certifications, registry, and flight plans. We are not authorized to disclose ownership at this time.\"\nThe words only fanned the flames.\n\"Registered where? Who owns it? Why private?\" Reporters demanded answers, but the airport refused to elaborate.\nBy evening, the FAA had released a sparing statement of its own: \"The A380-800 that departed Los Angeles today is a fully registered, compliant aircraft. There is no cause for alarm. Further details regarding ownership are not public record at this time.\"\nIt was the vaguest reassurance possible and if course, it satisfied no one.\nIn online forums, aviation experts tried to dox the registry instantly. Some cross-checked with leaked databases, pointing out that the tail number \"N914LX\" had no previous record. That led to even deeper theories: the registry was brand new, filed within the last week, hidden under shell corporations.\nOne user, a known airline mechanic, wrote: \"You don’t just build a private 380 overnight. This project would’ve taken years. Facilities, crews, modifications — someone kept it completely secret. That’s the real story here.\"\nAnother comment cut sharper: \"Whoever owns this didn’t just buy a plane. They bought a statement. They wanted the world to look up and see something impossible.\"\nAnd the world was indeed looking up.\nBy the time the sun dipped low over Los Angeles, major networks were dedicating entire segments to the event.\nAnderson Cooper stared at the footage, shaking his head. \"I’ve been covering news for decades. I’ve seen wars, elections and a couple of disasters. But I have never seen this — a fully private A380 just casually leaving LAX. We are living in strange times.\"\nFox’s panel grew heated. One anchor insisted it was \"globalist elites flexing their power and some big name politicians wasting taxpayers dollars.\"\nWhat a thing to say, right?\nAnother swore it was \"a tech giant’s secret launch stunt.\"\nBBC invited aviation historians, who stressed the impossibility of privately maintaining such a craft. \"The cost alone is astronomical. Fuel, crew, maintenance — this is a project for governments, not individuals.\"\nBut still, the footage rolled again and again: the black giant lifting from the runway, its platinum streaks glinting as the wheels left earth.\n***\nMeanwhile, the A380 itself cruised silently across the Pacific, cutting through clouds with serene inevitability.\nInside the lounge, Liam sat reclined, a faint smile on his lips as the storm raged unseen below.\nDaniel sat opposite him, his expression locked between awe and dread. He was currently using going through every post related to the aircraft, as Elena was bringing them up immediately for him, as they were being uploaded.\n\"Sir,\" Daniel muttered, lowering his phone, \"the world is tearing itself apart trying to guess who owns this aircraft.\"\nLiam’s smile only deepened, without saying anything. There was nothing to be said.\nFar below, on the islands of the Caribbean, a separate storm was brewing.\nFishermen looked up from their boats as a distant roar rippled across the sky. Tourists pointed from beaches, shielding their eyes.\nAt the horizon, a shadow grew larger — wings stretched impossibly wide, engines glinting silver in the sun.\nSan Caerola Key in the distance, lay bathed in golden evening light, the waves lapping gently against its crescent shores. The palm forests swayed, the runway gleamed faintly in the distance.",

      "content": "Chapter 160: Briefings (Bonus Chapter)\nThe FAA’s registry office in Oklahoma City was rarely exciting. Rows of cubicles stretched under buzzing lights, the monotony broken only by the hum of servers. Most days, the biggest stir was when an old tail number lapsed into deregistration.\nBut today was not most days.\nAt 1:16 p.m., an analyst leaned forward at her monitor, eyes narrowing.\n\"Uh... Supervisor? You need to see this.\"\nHer boss, a graying man with coffee-stained shirt cuffs, shuffled over reluctantly. The analyst pointed at her screen, where the registration entry for N914LX glowed in black and white.\n\"Aircraft Type: Airbus A380-800. Configuration: Private.\"\nThe supervisor blinked in slight disbelief, \"That’s not possible.\"\n\"It’s in the system. Valid registry, all documentation were cleared last week.\"\n\"Owner?\"\nThe analyst hesitated before answering. \"One individual. Liam Scott. Date of birth: September 2007.\"\nThe supervisor froze. Then he muttered the only thing that came to mind: \"Jesus Christ.\"\n***\nFAA Headquarters – Washington, D.C.\nThe phone on the deputy director’s desk rang with the shrill urgency of a fire alarm. She snatched it up, already bracing herself.\n\"Tell me it’s not true.\"\nA voice on the other end sadly confirmed, \"It’s true. An Airbus A380 registered to an eighteen-year-old American citizen. He departed LAX less than five minutes ago.\"\nThe director pinched the bridge of her nose. \"Get me Homeland. Now.\"\n***\nHomeland Security – Office of Intelligence and Analysis\nWithin minutes, a conference call formed. Screens flickered to life in a secure operations center. Representatives from FAA, TSA, FBI, CIA, and Treasury filled the grid, with tensed looks on their faces.\nThe FAA deputy spoke first, with a firm voic, doing her best not to show how rattled she was.\n\"The tail number N914LX has been verified. The aircraft is an Airbus A380-800, private configuration. It is airworthy, cleared, and currently airborne, destination filed as a private island located in the Caribbean. The owner of record is Liam Scott, U.S. citizen, age eighteen. Repeat: eighteen.\"\nThe room erupted with chatters.\n\"That’s impossible—\"\n\"An A380? Privately? No way—\"\n\"Where did he get the money?\"\n\"Silence,\" barked the chair from Homeland, and the voices died instantly. \"Continue.\"\nThe FAA deputy cleared her throat. \"The paperwork is legitimate. Registry processed last week, fees paid in full, all documents verified. The application came through a Delaware-based holding company but the ultimate beneficial owner is listed directly as Liam Scott.\"\nThe Homeland chair turned sharply. \"FBI?\"\nAn agent with close-cropped hair leaned forward. \"We ran the name. Liam Scott, born in California, currently residing in Los Angeles. Eighteen years old. No criminal record, no red flags in standard databases. Parents are alive but they are separated from him, and each are remarried.. not to each other. Seems like he was abandoned at a young age. His personal tax records show no significant income. But—\" The agent paused. \"—there’s more.\"\nAll eyes fixed on him, as he clicked a file open, revealing a cascade of photos, bank ledgers, and property deeds.\n\"A month and four days ago, Scott purchased a penthouse apartment for $1.5m, paying in cash. He bought a apartment complex a few days later for $20m and he bought Bellemere Mansion in Holmby Hills outright for $73m. All purchases were paid in cash.\"\nGasps echoed across the line.\n\"Just last night, his Family Office structure tied to JP Morgan Private Banking was activated. And under he Family Office, he also established multiple trusts across the Cayman Islands, Singapore, and Luxembourg. The complexity of the structures is beyond anything we’d expect from a private individual, let alone an eighteen-year-old.\"\nAnother click was heard and there was more documents.\n\"There’s a security camera feed collected from the private hangar the aircraft was in and he was seen stepping down from a Maybach 6 Cabriolet concept vehicle — previously thought to exist only as prototypes — registered under his name in California. That’s the same car spotted causing traffic chaos en route to LAX. Viral footage already has over 200 million views online. We have to confirm anything from Mercedes but considering that it’s a one-off car, just like the one he drove last two weeks, we are made believe that the car belongs to him\"\nMurmurs erupted again.\n\"Also, he owns a luxury super yacht that’s supposed to cost at least $300 million and a Sikorsky S-92 Executive that cost $20m. And now,\" the agent finished grimly, \"he has revealed possession of the only private Airbus A380 in existence. Estimated cost: over five hundred million dollars. Again, purchased outright.\"\nThe Homeland chair’s face hardened. He can’t believe that someone like this was able to make such insane financial transactions in the country without detection.\nNot that he wasn’t detected. He was, as everything went through their systems but he did everything legitimately, which was impossible for an billionaire and even more impossible for someone his age.\nBut he didn’t let that get to him, as he continued the meeting.\n\"Treasury?\"\nA woman with sharp glasses and sharper eyes adjusted her headset, as she spoke, \"We’ve been digging since the registration hit our system. His accounts ballooned with cash deposits beginning about a month ago. Transfers routed through layers of offshore entities, trusts, and special purpose vehicles linked to an inheritance record. But there’s something strange about it. The inheritance record, I mean.\"\n\"What’s that?\" the Homeland chair repeated, his tone sharp.\n\"The inheritance record goes back to decades before Liam Scott was born but he was clearly stated there as the beneficiary. And the total assets value is undisclosed. It’s like someone’s shielding it. We’ve checked for any discrepancies or tampering, but nothing. Clean as a whistle. That leads me to believe he’s not a random teenager — he’s likely tied to an ultra-old family or a sovereign fund. Rockefeller-level.\"\nThe room fell silent.\nThe silence was broken by the CIA officer who spoke next, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a teenager playing rich. This is either someone fronting for a sovereign entity... or someone who has resources we cannot yet explain.\"\n\"Could it be foreign-backed?\" one voice asked.\n\"China? UAE? Saudis?\" another suggested.\n\"Why would they hide behind an American teenager?\"\nThe Homeland chair raised a hand, silencing the speculation. \"Enough. The key question: is Liam Scott a threat?\"\nThe FBI agent replied carefully. \"No hostile activity so far. No weapons purchases, no extremist affiliations. What we’ve found is... strange, but not overtly dangerous.\"\n\"Strange?\"\nThe agent hesitated, then pulled up more files. \"His digital footprint is inconsistent. He has two social media accounts but he’s a ghost. He does have contacts — a group of friends and the Manager of his Family Office. Also, over the past month, he has received calls from the Investor Relations department of JP Morgan and all the big tech companies in the world, which are all American companies. He also got calls from Disnēy and Eli Līlly.\"\n\"I think he has shares in these companies and judging by the scale of his toys, we can safely assume that he has an asset portfolio value of at least $10-50B. That’s based on his apparent liquidity and capital expenditures. He could be worth more, or it could be leveraged\"\nThe CIA officer leaned back. \"So, a ghost in the system, with toys that someone his age shouldn’t have.\"\n***\nThe Homeland chair exhaled slowly. \"Lock down the registry, effective immediately. FAA, scrub his ownership from public records and replace with ’Private Holder – Confidential.’ Treasury, continue tracing funds. FBI, full background investigation. CIA, monitor international chatter. I want a task force standing up within the hour. Treasury, see if you can dig up more on him and also get the IRS to dig too.\"\nHe looked around the room, voice firm. \"Until further notice, the existence of Liam Scott’s ownership is classified. Public will get nothing. Not his name, not his age, not his origin. If asked, we state only that the aircraft is legally registered to a private entity.\"\nThe FAA deputy nodded grimly, \"Understood.\"\nThe CIA officer added, \"He’s already in the wind, en route to the Caribbean. We’ll have satellites watching every mile.\"\n***\nMeanwhile, Liam and his team just got down from the aircraft, are currently making their way to the villa.\nDaniel still have that shocked expression on his face, as he had just been given a fresh dose of it.\nHe really has a private island. What else does he have?",

      "content": "Chapter 161: Watching The World’s Reactions (Bonus Chapter)\nLiam led the way toward the villa, his pace casual, hands sliding into his pockets as the tropical breeze washed over them.\nThe evening sun dipped low, painting the Caribbean horizon in deep hues of orange and violet.\nBehind him, Daniel, Mason, and Nick followed in silence, their shoes crunching against the stone path.\nThe villa rose before them like something out of a billionaire’s fantasy — glass walls catching the sunset, wide terraces overlooking the crescent shoreline, and palm trees swaying like sentries in the salt air.\nLiam pushed the door open and ushered them inside. The interior was immaculate, designed with understated luxury: marble floors polished to a mirror sheen, wide leather lounges angled toward the panoramic ocean view, and subtle lighting that gave the villa a warm, golden glow.\nFor several minutes, he walked them through the property. Bedrooms with ocean-facing balconies, a private library stacked with rare books, a gym stocked with equipment, even a wine cellar with rows of vintages worth millions.\nDaniel asked all the right questions — about security systems, logistics of supplies, and how the staff rotation would work once the infrastructure was in place. Liam answered, as he smiled and told him to task care of it.\nWhen the tour ended, Liam waved them off with a faint smile. \"Go explore. See the island for yourselves. I’ll be here.\"\nThey nodded, understanding that Liam wants to be alone and they drifted off, leaving him alone in the quiet expanse of the villa.\nLiam sank onto the wide sofa in the main lounge, stretching his legs across the glass coffee table. He turned his attention to the multiple social media posts being displayed in his retina.\nHe had actually been keeping up with what was going on online but the most interesting thing was the interagency briefing that ended a few minutes ago\nListening in on the meeting, he heard the voices of Washington’s most powerful men and women talking, their tones sharp with disbelief and urgency.\nThey had laid bare what they knew of him, or thought they knew — the cash purchases, the trusts, the Family Office, the impossible scale of his acquisitions.\nBut what intrigued him most wasn’t their fear. It was the way the system had woven itself into reality.\nHe had always assumed the system rewrites the rewards into the world outright, like flipping a page in a story. Yet the Treasury’s discovery about the inheritance record unsettled him. A legal document dating back decades, specifying him as beneficiary? Impossible.\nSo how could there be an inheritance stretching across time itself, waiting for him?\nHis brow furrowed, fingers tapping idly against his knee. Was the system rewriting the past? Or bending records so seamlessly that even government agencies couldn’t distinguish the false from the true?\nBecause it was simply impossible. How will the person that wrote the Will have any idea that a Liam Scott will be born?\nIt wasn’t like there was a rule in his family that at least one male child must have the name, Liam, Liam. Also, he had already had Lucy go through his family record and he’s actually the only Liam in a very long line of Scotts. And his family was never rich in that long line. Not even close.\nHeck, if they was an inkling of riches in his family, he doubt his parents would had abandoned him.\nBut the briefing actually opened Liam’s eyes to something he was already aware of; how powerful the system was.\nThe thought was dizzying.\nLiam shook it off, unwilling to spiral down that rabbit hole today. Whether it was rewriting reality or fabricating a flawless illusion, the end result was the same: the system made him untouchable.\nLiam smiled, as he turned his attention back to the social media feeds, and hashtags blazed across every platform.\nClips of the Maybach had gone viral first, but now the black A380 dominated the conversation. Grainy phone footage, long-lens spotter videos, news anchors gasping on live television — the storm was everywhere.\nUnfortunately for Homeland Security, bits and pieces of his identity had already started appearing on the internet before they could classify his information.\nLiam chuckled softly, as he wasn’t worried.\nLucy’s voice chimed in again. \"Do you want me to lock down your information? I can bury your records so deep not even Washington would find them.\"\n\"No.\" Liam’s voice was calm, decisive. \"Leave it open.\"\n\"That will accelerate exposure,\" she warned.\n\"Exactly,\" he replied. His gaze sharpened as he scrolled through a thread speculating about the A380’s cost. \"If I hide, they’ll tear themselves apart trying to dig deeper. If I stay visible, it becomes leverage for me. Besides, I’ve done nothing illegal.\"\nLucy was silent for a moment, then her voice softened. \"As you wish, Master.\"\nLiam’s reasoning for not hiding himself was simple; the US agencies are already having more than enough trouble trying to solve a legal, yet impossible situation, which was him.\nIf they investigate him and finds out that there’s no information about him, or it was classified, questions will be raised.\nWho classified it?\nLiam was sure that Lucy had a way to solve that, as she told him that she had dirty information on almost everyone in government. From the first person to even an janitor. She has everything. It was scary.\nBut even after hearing all that, Liam still didn’t want to be hidden. He wants to face the world. Why should he hide his wealth?\nAgain, it’s not like he committed a crime. And he intends to use it as leverage over the US and the world in the future, if they try to stifle Lucid, which he was fully aware that they will.\nA small smile touched Liam’s lips. He leaned back, enjoying the absurdity of the whole situation. He knew that he hadn’t just made noise; he had lit the fuse to a global storm.\nMinutes passed. Outside, the waves crashed softly against the shore. The villa was quiet, save for the faint chirp of tropical birds.\nWhen Daniel, Mason, and Nick returned, Liam was still reclining on the sofa, scrolling through the chaos of posts with an almost childlike amusement.\n\"See enough?\" he asked without looking up.\nDaniel exhaled. \"More than enough.\"\n\"Good. Get ready,\" Liam said, rising from his seat. \"We fly back to LAX tonight.\"\n***\nMeanwhile, the international scene erupted.\nLondon – MI6 / GCHQ Joint Briefing\nAt Vauxhall Cross, the deputy chief of MI6 sat in a dim briefing room, the glow of a projector casting shadows across the wall. The GCHQ liaison finished his presentation, the last slide showing a grainy image of the black A380 lifting off from LAX.\n\"Registry N914LX,\" the liaison said. \"Verified by the FAA. Private configuration. Not leased. Not chartered. Owned outright.\"\nThe deputy chief’s hand tightened around his pen. For a moment, the room was so quiet that the only sound that could be heard was the faint hum of the projector.\n\"Private?\" he repeated. His tone was quiet, but disbelief laced every syllable. \"That scale of wealth and engineering isn’t private. Even the Saudis failed to pull it off. Whoever owns it isn’t a mere individual. Run a full trace on the registry. If the Americans don’t share...\" His eyes narrowed. \"...we’ll find out ourselves.\"\n***\nBeijing – Ministry of State Security\nIn a heavily guarded compound, a senior MSS director leaned forward, his palms pressing against the polished wood of the operations table.\n\"An A380?\" he asked, his voice sharp in Mandarin. \"Privately owned? Out of Los Angeles?\"\n\"Yes, Director,\" his aide confirmed. \"American registry. Tail number filed just last week. Ownership listed as Liam Scott.\"\nThe director’s eyes darkened, as he tapped the table once.\n\"If this is true,\" he said slowly, \"it shifts balance. Private citizens should not field aircraft larger than our state carriers. This is not indulgence; this is power projection. Find out everything. Who is this boy? Who funds him? Report directly to the State Council.\"\n***\nMoscow – FSB Headquarters\nDeep within the Kremlin’s secure wing, cigarette smoke curled into the air above a table stacked with documents. Officers leaned over printouts, faces grim.\n\"Eighteen years old,\" one muttered, disbelief thick in his tone. \"An A380 registered in his name.\"\nThe general in charge tapped ash into a tray, his face expressionless. He exhaled slowly and said, \"If the Americans allow this, it is no accident. Either they cover for him... or he is theirs.\"\nHe stubbed the cigarette out with deliberate pressure. \"Run surveillance. Every satellite, every wire, every asset in America. I want his name, his habits, his blood type in my hand before morning.\"\n***\nRiyadh – General Intelligence Presidency\nIn a gilded chamber, the intelligence chief stood before a Saudi prince, his head bowed slightly.\n\"The rumors are confirmed, Highness. A private A380 has flown from Los Angeles. Owned, not leased.\"\nThe prince’s brows drew together, as he spoke with a voice filled with amusement and curiosity. \"Even our families never secured such a craft. Who is this... Liam Scott?\"\nThe chief lowered his gaze. \"We will know soon, Highness. But whoever he is, he has sent a message to the entire world.\"\nThe prince said nothing. His eyes drifted toward the horizon beyond the window, his silence heavier than words.",

      "content": "Chapter 162: Watching The World’s Reactions (2)\nThe Airbus A380, The Flying Palace cruised high above the endless Pacific, its four Rolls-Royce engines humming with quiet power.\nAt this altitude, the world stretched in all directions like an endless canvas of blue and white. The ocean glittered far below, flecked with scattered waves, while banks of cloud drifted lazily, their shadows sprawling across the water.\nFrom the outside, the aircraft looked like something out of a dream — obsidian skin swallowing sunlight, platinum streaks glinting along the fuselage, its sheer size dwarfing the empty sky around it.\nMost aircraft crossing this route were widebodies, but compared to The Flying Palace, they were ants beside a whale.\nInside, however, serenity reigned.\nThe main lounge glowed with warm ambient lighting. Liam sat reclined on one of the long leather sofas, a glass of water in hand, his posture calm. He might as well be on a casual evening flight aboard a friend’s jet rather than aboard a half-billion-dollar marvel that had turned the entire world upside down.\nDaniel sat opposite him, though his composure was long gone, as he was going through post after post, news bulletin after news bulletin into his vision.\n\"Sir,\" Daniel said at last, his voice dry. \"It’s everywhere. Every platform, every network. The footage of the takeoff hasn’t stopped looping for hours. CNN’s calling it The Flying Palace. BBC went with The Black Titan. Half of Reddit thinks it’s a DARPA project. Twitter...\" He trailed off, exhaling. \"Twitter’s eating itself alive.\"\n\"Good. Let them choke on their own noise,\" Liam smiled faintly, sipping his water.\nDaniel’s eyes darted toward him, disbelief flickering across his face. \"You don’t understand, sir. They’re not just curious. They’re digging deep. Governments, corporations, intelligence agencies — they’re all pulling every string they can find.\"\n\"Let them dig,\" Liam said calmly.\nLucy’s voice echoed in his head, as she informed him of what was going on.\n\"Confirmed. Satellite assets are actively shadowing us. They couldn’t see us when we got into the island’s airspace because of and unknown and yet-to-be identified interference around it, but now they can,\" she said and continued. \"U.S. reconnaissance platforms KH-11 Crystal and Lacrosse-6 have shifted their orbits to track this aircraft. Chinese Yaogan satellites are observing from synchronous orbit. Russian Persona satellites have also begun shadow sweeps.\n\"Additionally, electronic listening arrays from Guam, Hawaii, and Japan are monitoring comms from this flight. At this moment, Master, you are the most observed civilian on Earth.\"\n\"So basically, every power in the world’s got their eyes glued on us right now?\" Liam asked, though he already knew the answer to that.\n\"Correct,\" Lucy replied.\n\"Wow. Not bad, I would say,\" Liam said, leaning back into the sofa, completely unfazed.\nLucy spoke again, \"Additionally, NORAD has scrambled interceptors. Two F-22 Raptors from Elmendorf have taken off. Another pair from Edwards AFB is on standby to meet us as we enter the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone.\"\n\"We’re getting company, then,\" Liam said with a smile of amusement. \"Well, they’re just escorts, not executioners. They’ll circle, make their reports, and let us through. No one is suicidal enough to shoot down a U.S.-registered A380. Not yet and not ever.\"\nLiam looked outside the window, watching as the clouds roll away to reveal the boundless ocean beneath. He could feel the tension pulling taut across the globe. The world’s great powers had noticed him and they were circling, calculating, scheming. And everything’s all in an attempt to control him. But they won’t succeed. They won’t even come close.\n***\nElmendorf AFB, Alaska – Alert Hangar\nA red strobe spun silently over the alert hangar as klaxons sounded, echoing off the steel walls. Inside, two F-22 Raptors sat on standby, their stealth-gray skins glinting faintly under fluorescent lights. Pilots jogged toward them, already tugging on helmets and gloves.\nA voice crackled over the PA: \"Scramble, scramble, scramble. Target track 9-1-4-L-X. Unknown profile. Confirmed private registry. Visual intercept and escort only. Repeat, escort only.\"\nCaptain Morales, the flight lead, swung up the ladder into the cockpit of Raptor 108.\n\"Private A380?\" he muttered to himself, strapping in. \"What billionaire’s fever dream is this?\"\nHis wingman, Lieutenant Green, keyed his radio. \"We’ve got a tail number?\"\nMorales flipped his HUD live as ground crews disconnected hoses. \"N914LX. They’re calling it ’The Flying Palace.’\"\nGreen laughed in disbelief. \"What, like an oil sheikh? That’s gotta be a typo.\"\n\"Focus,\" Morales said, though his own voice held a note of incredulity. \"Our job is to form up, take photos, and report. No aggressive moves. Let’s see what the hell we’re dealing with.\"\nWithin minutes, the two Raptors roared down the runway, afterburners lighting the gray sky orange, claws of fire beneath their tails. They banked hard southward, climbing toward their intercept point over the Pacific.\n***\nNORAD Command – Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado\nIn the cavernous operations center, giant digital maps glowed across wall-length screens. A bright track — a massive heat signature — cut westward across the Pacific. Four smaller blips vectored toward it from Elmendorf.\n\"Target is confirmed Airbus A380,\" a controller said. \"No transponder anomalies. Filed flight plan matches what LAX received. Still... it’s big.\"\nThe shift supervisor rubbed his temples. \"A private A380? We’re scrambling Raptors to escort a teenager’s flying hotel. This is absurd.\"\nAnother officer leaned over. \"Sir, it’s not just absurd. FAA called — they’re locking down the registry. Washington’s in full panic mode. Everyone wants eyes on this bird.\"\nThe supervisor exhaled, \"Then let’s give them eyes. Tag the F-22 HUD feeds for live relay.\"\nOn-screen, the two Raptors closed the distance, their altitude climbing to match the black titan cutting across the blue.\n***\nThe Flying Palace – Cockpit\nCaptain Adler’s headset crackled as the voice of Oakland Center came through, clipped and professional:\n\"Imperium Heavy, this is Oakland Center. Be advised, two NORAD assets are intercepting for visual escort. Do not deviate from filed flight plan. Repeat: maintain heading and altitude. Raptors will form on your wings in approximately five minutes.\"\nAdler’s brows lifted slightly. He thumbed the comms switch to the main cabin PA, his voice calm but carrying the weight of what was just said.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We’ve just been informed that NORAD has scrambled two F-22 Raptors to intercept and escort us. This is standard procedure when an aircraft of unusual profile is in U.S. airspace. Please remain calm; there is no danger. They’ll simply fly alongside until we approach LAX.\"\nThe words rippled through the cabin like a chill.\nMason straightened immediately, hand drifting toward the concealed holster at his waist before he caught himself. His jaw tightened.\nNick muttered, \"They scrambled Raptors? For us?\" disbelief heavy in his tone.\nDaniel froze for a heartbeat, then exhaled sharply, fingers steepled in front of his mouth.\nLiam, meanwhile, barely reacted. He sat with one leg crossed casually over the other, eyes half-lidded, as if Adler had just announced mild turbulence.\nBut Daniel leaned forward, his voice low, edged with an experienced private banker’s cold logic. \"This isn’t random. NORAD doesn’t scramble Raptors for sightseeing. They’re escorting us because your aircraft—\" he gestured faintly upward, toward the massive decks surrounding them— \"isn’t just unusual. It’s unprecedented. No one on earth has a private A380. That alone makes you a national security anomaly.\"\nMason frowned. \"So they think he’s a threat?\"\nDaniel shook his head. \"Not exactly. Think of it like this— the U.S. government just saw something impossible roll out of LAX. They can’t classify it yet, they don’t know who you really are, so they send fighters to keep an eye on you. Half deterrence, half reconnaissance. Their cameras will be feeding everything back to NORAD HQ right now. Paint scheme, registry, even trying to glimpse inside through the windows. They’re treating you like a moving question mark.\"\nNick muttered, \"And if he’d was a threat?\"\nDaniel’s eyes were grim. \"Then those Raptors wouldn’t just escort. They’d be loaded and locked. But clearly, Command told them to observe only. That means Washington still thinks you’re legitimate.\"\nTo buttress Daniel’s point, Lucy added, \"Master, Daniel’s assessment is correct. NORAD has orders for escort and observation only. Rules of engagement: weapons hold unless provoked. The Raptors’ HUDs are streaming live to Cheyenne Mountain.\"\nLiam simply smiled at this. It just keeps getting even more fun with each passing second.\nBut it wasn’t fun for everyone else, as the cabin fell into uneasy silence. Mason and Nick shifted in their seats, every muscle coiled. Daniel pressed his palms together, trying to keep his breathing steady.\n\"Relax,\" Liam said finally, glancing at them with that faint, amused smile. \"They just want a closer look. Nothing more.\"\nMoments later, the first distant contrails cut across the horizon. The Raptors were coming.",

At fifteen miles out, their HUDs began feeding high-resolution images back to Cheyenne Mountain.\n\"Visual contact,\" Morales radioed. \"Confirming—holy hell.\"\nThe black A380 filled his canopy view like a continent suspended in the sky. Its obsidian body glinted platinum as sunlight struck it. No airline livery. No markings.\nGreen’s voice cracked. \"That’s real? That’s not CGI? Damn!\"\nMorales keyed his mic. \"Command, this is Lead. Visual confirms Airbus A380, all-black. No visible weapons or anomalies. It’s... gorgeous.\"\n\"Copy, Lead,\" NORAD replied. \"Maintain escort at two o’clock low. Photograph everything.\"\nThe Raptors eased closer, forming a wide V-shape on either side of the black titan. Cameras embedded in their fuselages captured every detail: the massive Rolls-Royce engines, the subtle platinum streaks, the way the wings dwarfed even the Raptors themselves.\nInside the A380, Liam looked through the window and saw the gray fighters slotting neatly alongside him.\nHe sipped his water, amused. To the men in those cockpits, he was probably an urban legend made flesh.\nThe fighters held position for another minute, cameras clicking invisibly. Then Morales keyed his radio, \"Lead to Command. Subject appears unbothered. Proceeding with escort until U.S. ADIZ handoff.\"\n\"Copy, Lead. Maintain visual until LAX approach control assumes.\"\n***\nWashington, D.C. – Homeland Operations Center\nThe secure briefing room looked like the inside of a warship: wall-to-wall monitors glowing with satellite feeds, registry logs, and real-time ATC radar. The image of the black A380 filled the central screen — its tail number, N914LX, circled in red.\nThe Homeland chair slammed his palm against the table.\n\"Alright, everyone, this is no longer observation. I want full mobilization. FBI, Treasury, CIA, DHS — this is priority one.\"\nThe room erupted into motion.\n***\nFBI – Counterintelligence Division\nA senior agent barked orders to his team:\n\"Every financial trail, every document. If this Liam Scott sneezed in kindergarten, I want the tissue analyzed. Pull every surveillance camera around Holmby Hills, LAX, the hangar — cross-match facial rec. Put his friends, neighbors, associates under quiet watch. This kid is a ghost, and I want him pinned to the map. We will find his leverage point and we will squeeze.\"\nDozens of analysts began hammering keyboards. Bank ledgers, social media posts, and satellite imagery cascaded across their screens.\n***\nTreasury – Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\n\"Trace the holding companies again,\" snapped the Treasury lead. \"Caymans, Luxembourg, Singapore — I don’t care how many shells he has stacked. If he’s hiding sovereign money, we’ll find the choke point. Pull in the IRS, have them comb his filings line by line.\"\nA junior analyst muttered nervously, \"Sir, what if it’s clean?\"\nThe lead gave him a cold look and replied, \"Then that’s the most terrifying part.\"\n***\nCIA – Directorate of Operations\nIn Langley, phones were already ringing. A handler leaned over a comms console.\n\"Activate sleepers in LA. Anyone with eyes near Holmby Hills, Bel-Air, and LAX — I want visual confirmation of every asset this kid has on the ground. We need HUMINT. His neighbors, his pilots, his drivers — all of them.\"\nAcross the world, CIA stations received encrypted pings. Liaison officers in London, Riyadh, and Tokyo were ordered to quietly feed back whatever chatter their local partners were hearing.\n***\nNSA – Fort Meade\nAt Fort Meade, an entire bank of analysts hunched over glowing screens as lines of code scrolled by.\n\"Packet sweep on all his known IPs,\" the division chief ordered. \"Flag encrypted traffic. Anything routed through JP Morgan servers, mirror it. Don’t trip alarms — I want passive collection only. If his systems are real, we won’t even scratch the surface, but we’ll try.\"\nWithin minutes, servers began hoovering up terabytes of data. The name \"Liam Scott\" became a keyword burned into every active filter.\n***\nHomeland Chair – Command Directive\nThe Homeland chair leaned forward, and spoke with a low yet firm voice, \"Ladies and gentlemen, I don’t care how impossible it looks — the fact is, an eighteen-year-old American citizen just rolled out the largest private aircraft in history, bought cash, and flew it out of LAX under a black paint job. This isn’t a toy. This is projection of power. Whether it’s his, or someone’s behind him, we will find out.\"\nHe looked directly into the camera feed connected to NORAD’s Cheyenne Mountain.\n\"Keep him on escort until he lands at LAX. Once he’s on the ground, I want federal assets waiting. If necessary, we’ll pull him into questioning under the guise of aviation compliance. FBI will take lead, supported by DHS. Until then — eyes on everything.\"\nThe room moved with the tension of a nation atDEFCON 21\n. Every agent, every analyst, every operative knew: this wasn’t just about a plane. It was about what it meant.***\nOn the 44th floor of 270 Park Avenue, the usually serene hush of the Private Banking division had dissolved into a low-grade panic.\nGlass walls vibrated with raised voices, assistants darted back and forth carrying printouts, and the smell of burnt espresso hung in the air like static.\nOn the main conference table, a muted CNBC segment replayed the viral footage of the black Airbus A380 lifting off from LAX. The anchor’s voice rolled beneath the images: \"...no airline markings, registered as N914LX... the first private A380 ever to fly...\"\nEvery time the camera cut to the jet’s gleaming wings, someone in the room shifted uncomfortably.\nA managing director for ultra-high-net-worth clients pinched the bridge of his nose. \"Is this a joke?\" he muttered. \"That at least is a half-billion-dollar plane. In his own name. And it’s trending worldwide.\"\nBeside him, a compliance officer tapped through a frozen copy of the FAA registry on her iPad. \"It’s not a joke. Registry is real. Owner of record: Liam Scott. Date of birth: 2007. All filings signed off last week. An unknown holding company in Delaware filed the structure.\"\n\"Who the hell buys something like that with their actual name? What’s wrong with buying under a company name?\" Another senior banker asked, but no one had any answer.\nFinally, Marianne stepped into the glass-walled room, with a tight expression on their face. Liam was once their client and will always be, even though he now manage his own things.\nAnd as JP Morgan, they must protect their clients.\nShe set her tablet down and spoke flatly, \"Stop speculating. Yes, it’s our client. Yes, it’s his aircraft. No, we are not authorized to disclose anything about him, not even to government agencies without proper legal process. Do you all understand?\"\nMurmurs rippled around the table and someone whispered, \"Homeland’s going to subpoena us...\"\nMarianne’s eyes flicked up sharply. \"They can try. Every document is clean. Every wire was legal. Every trust is sealed under international confidentiality statutes. We structured it to withstand sovereign audits for a reason. If regulators call, we refer them to Legal. If journalists call, we give a no-comment. Nothing more.\"\nA younger analyst raised a hand hesitantly. \"Ma’am... why didn’t he at least let us drip this out? Stage a media rollout? The secrecy is—\"\n\"—exactly what he wanted,\" Marianne cut him off. \"You don’t understand. This client doesn’t think like a hedge-fund billionaire. He doesn’t think like any of you.\"\nOn the muted TV, the anchor asked: \"Who owns the Black Titan?\" and the chyron scrolled #BlackTitan – Ownership Unknown.\nMarianne’s gaze lingered on the footage for a moment, before giving more instructions, speaking loudly this time, \"Double the compartmentalization. Rotate logins. Lock down all internal memos about the Family Office. If someone leaks even a detail, we’ll lose him, and this bank will lose the largest client of the decade.\"\nA senior VP frowned. \"You’re saying he’s that big?\"\nMarianne met his eyes. \"Bigger.\"\nSilence spread through the room.

      "content": "Chapter 164: Watching The World’s Reactions (4)\nLondon – Vauxhall Cross, MI6\nA storm had descended on the normally composed seventh floor of MI6’s riverside headquarters. The Thames shimmered in the late evening light outside, but inside the ops suite the glow came from a dozen large displays showing real-time flight data and social media chatter.\nOn one screen: the black A380, call sign Imperium Heavy, inching back toward U.S. airspace.\nOn another: feeds from Heathrow and Farnborough spotter networks, still playing the viral takeoff videos.\n\"Sir, FAA’s registry has gone dark. Public records now say ’Private Holder – Confidential.’ Americans scrubbed the name,\" A senior analyst reported to the deputy chief\n\"It doesn’t matter. We already knew who it was before the scrub. Eighteen years old. Liam Scott. What we need is background information on him,\" the deputy chief said, as he tapped a finger against the desk and glanced up at the map, where the jet’s transponder pulsed a steady green.\n\"He’s headed back to LAX now. If the Americans think they can keep this contained, they’re mistaken.\"\n\"Shall we task GCHQ?\"\n\"Already done. SIGINT is pulling every packet that leaves Imperial Terminal. If they won’t tell us what he’s carrying, we’ll find out ourselves.\" He said, as he rose from his seat, his eyes narrowing at the screen.\n\"And pull Interpol’s red cell analysts in. If this boy is what he appears to be, every sovereign wealth fund and defense contractor will want a slice of him before the week ends.\"\n***\nBeijing – Ministry of State Security (MSS)\nThe great mahogany table in the secure war room of the MSS was covered in maps of flight routes and dossiers. A projector beamed the live ADS-B feed of the A380 over the Pacific, its black fuselage glowing in high-resolution satellite photos snapped by a Yaogan reconnaissance satellite an hour earlier.\n\"It’s returning to Los Angeles. That means it’s not an abduction or a covert exfiltration. This is a show of power,\" he said with a hardened expression on his face.\nHis deputy nodded, tapping a laser pointer against the satellite image, as he added, \"The real question is how an eighteen-year-old built a structure to conceal this?\"\nThe director’s expression became solemn when he thought about the answer to that question. He closed his eyes briefly and gave more orders.\n\"Order our liaison office in San Francisco to begin soft approach. Cyber will continue to harvest every mention of ’Liam Scott’ across Western platforms. Begin discreet financial forensics on JP Morgan Private Bank. They will surely have a tie to him.\"\nHe glanced at the big screen where the A380’s contrail curved over the Pacific like a brushstroke, and muttered to himself, \"If this child is real, he will become a strategic asset. If he is a front, then we will unmask who is behind him.\"\n***\nMoscow – FSB Headquarters\nCigarette smoke still hung heavy in the vault-like ops room beneath Lubyanka Square. Four colonels leaned over printouts of Liam’s known assets, while a large plasma screen showed the black A380’s altitude and speed.\n\"Back to the States?\" one of them scoffed. \"Americans keep their ghosts close.\"\nThe general in charge, ground his cigarette out and spoke without looking up. \"Continue satellite tail. Tap Aeroflot’s LAX staff for eyes. If this ’Flying Palace’ lands at Los Angeles, we want photographs of every crate that leaves it.\"\nHe turned to his cyber chief. \"And penetrate his Family Office, however deeply buried it is. If the Americans are fronting a new kind of private power projection, we cannot be left blind. If he is theirs, he’ll be weaponized. If he is not, we will weaponize him.\"\n***\nRiyadh – General Intelligence Presidency\nIn a marble-lined chamber scented with oud, the Saudi intelligence chief stood beside a young prince as a wall screen replayed footage of the A380’s departure, then showed its return track creeping across the Pacific.\nThe prince’s eyes glimmered with curiosity when he saw this.\n\"He’s going back. Interesting,\" he murmured, with a small amused and curious smile.\nThe Chief nodded in agreement and said, \"We have already tasked our people in Miami and New York. He didn’t hide his financial traces, so it will be ready soon. But our best asset inside Airbus hadn’t been able to get anything from anyone at Toulouse no matter how hard they probed.\"\nThe prince nodded slightly when he heard this.\n\"As expected. They are all under NDAs. It won’t be easy to get anything out of them. And if we try to wringle it out, they will call on Berlin,\" he said, and the Chief nodded in agreement.\n\"Then he’s not only wealthy. He’s also hidden. Keep watching. Perhaps he will need partners when the world turns against him,\" he said with a sly smile.\n***\nTel Aviv – Mossad SIGINT Floor\nRows of operators stared at a mosaic of feeds: FAA radar, ADS-B Exchange, satellite stills, Reddit’s r/aviation threads, and financial chatter about a mysterious \"Liam Scott.\"\n\"We’ve got an eighteen-year-old ghost flying a Flying Palace across the Pacific. Hollywood couldn’t write this,\" One of the operators smirked and said, as he continued reading the feed,\nBut his section chief didn’t share the same sentiment as him. With a solemn face, he gave out instructions.\n\"Flag every vendor in our database who’s ever touched an A380 cabin refit. Somebody built that monster. Somebody got paid. Follow the invoices.\"\n***\nAcross the globe, lights burned late in government offices as Liam’s name — or the absence of it — scrolled across secure channels. Satellite operators shifted tasking priorities, SIGINT filters recalibrated, and analysts whispered into encrypted phones.\nWhat none of them realized was that Liam, reclining in the lounge of the aircraft, listening to snippets of their chatter that Lucy was feeding him in real time.\n***\nWhile the great powers plotted in shadow, the world’s eyes turned toward Los Angeles.\nBy the time Imperium Heavy checked in with SoCal Approach, Los Angeles was braced for impact — not from a storm, but from a flood of cameras.\nAt the perimeter of LAX, every legal spot along the fence was clogged. The usual scattering of plane spotters with tripods and telephoto lenses had been joined by other people.\nLivestreamers could be seen holding selfie sticks, shouting into their phones: \"We’re live at LAX, chat! Any second now the #BlackTitan is coming in hot!\"\nNews vans from every local station had arrived, their telescoping antennas pointed skyward and their satellite dishes rotating to lock on.\nNational networks had parked satellite trucks in the cargo lot, anchors rehearsing their lines as producers shoved earpieces into their hands.\nTraffic had snarled for miles. Police cruisers lined the access roads, lights spinning red and blue, with officers trying to herd the crowds back from the fence. But the crowd only grew. People climbed onto car hoods, rooftops, even trees for a better view.\nThe fence itself rattled under the weight of bodies pressed against it. Hundreds of phones with their cameras all pointed upward.\nFrom the skies, the A380’s shadow stretched long as it descended through a bank of high clouds. The platinum streaks along its fuselage caught the evening sun, dazzling against the obsidian skin.\nThe crowd erupted with shouts, cheers, and screams of disbelief before the wheels even touched the ground.\n\"THERE IT IS!\"\n\"OH MY GOD, IT’S REAL!\"\n\"LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT THING!\"\nLivestream chats exploded with comments:\n\"I’m watching from Brazil and I can’t believe this is real.\"\n\"This kid just broke aviation.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 165: Watching The World’s Reactions (5)\nAs the Flying Palace’s transponder showed it descending over the Pacific, the noise at the airport rose like a physical thing. Anchors yelled updates to their cameras; spotters screamed at each other to adjust their lenses.\nATC chatter leaked online via scanner apps, and thousands listened as controllers coordinated the special arrival:\n\"Imperium Heavy, cleared visual approach Runway 25R. Traffic has been rerouted for you.\"\n\"That’s affirm, LAX Tower. Imperium Heavy on visual for 25R.\"\nHearing that call sign — \"Imperium Heavy\" — live on air sent chills down the feeds.\nWhen the black A380 finally broke through the haze, its wings glinting in the late sunlight, the crowd roared like it was a rock concert. Phones tilted skyward, drones tracked every angle, and even the news anchors nearly lost their composure.\nIt descended slowly and majestically. The sheer size of it dwarfed every other plane on the field. Even a taxiing 777 nearby looked like a toy beside it.\nIt touched down with a hiss of tires and a puff of smoke. The entire terminal vibrated as its wheels kissed asphalt. Cheers erupted and someone in the crowd yelled, \"It’s real!\"\nPassengers at the gates pressed so hard against the glass that security feared it might crack.\nTwitter exploded with conversations:\n\"THE FLYING PALACE JUST LANDED\"\n\"WHO IS ONBOARD??\"\n\"THIS IS HISTORY\"\n***\nAs the A380 taxied toward the Imperial Terminal, the convoy of news vans and private cars shifted like a migrating herd, trying to follow it along the perimeter roads. Helicopter news crews hovered just outside the airport’s restricted airspace, cameras zoomed in tight.\nThe Flying Palace disappeared into the private hangar, swallowed by steel and shadow. The massive doors sealed shut, muting the roar of engines, cutting off the sea of cameras and drones still swarming the perimeter.\nOutside, chaos reigned. Reporters shoved microphones into the faces of bewildered ground crew. Security officers struggled to keep crowds back. Live helicopter shots circled the hangar like vultures.\n\"Viewers, what you’re seeing here is unprecedented,\" one anchor declared breathlessly. \"The aircraft has now taxied into the Imperial Terminal. No word yet on who — or what — disembarked.\"\nBut inside the hangar, it was calm. Too calm. The aircraft’s hydraulic stairway folded out of the fuselage and Liam walked down with hands in his pockets, and an unbothered expression on his face.\nDaniel followed a step behind, still reeling from everything, his mind already calculating the tidal waves about to break over them. Mason and Nick were not far behind, and they were not any better than his.\nThey all walked back to the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium. Nick got into driver seat, while Mason opened the backseat door for Liam, who also got in, then he got into the passenger seat. Daniel got into the backseat.\n***\nHomeland Security – National Operations Center, Washington D.C.\nThe chair of Homeland Security stood at the head of the operations table, his jaw set tight. Wall-length monitors glowed with radar tracks and satellite feeds.\nHe snapped her fingers at a technician and ordered, \"Get me live visuals inside Hangar 14, Imperial Terminal, LAX.\"\nThe technician froze, then spoke in a solemn voice, \"Sir... Hangar 14’s cameras are leased to private operators. They aren’t integrated into our feeds.\"\n\"Then integrate them. Now,\" the Chief snapped, his voice crackling like a whip.\nA murmur spread across the room.\n\"With respect, Sir, that’s a private security system. It requires a subpoena—\" the FAA deputy said, shifting uneasily.\nThe chair’s eyes burned into him. \"We don’t have the luxury of subpoenas. We have a half-billion-dollar black aircraft that just taxied out of Los Angeles under a teenager’s name and just taxied back in. I don’t care if I have to violate every privacy statute on the books. Get me those cameras. Now.\"\nImmediately, the technician’s hands flew across his keyboard, with beads of sweat forming on his brow. It took multiple lines of codes, systems probing and bypassing permissions, but a minute later, the wall monitors flickered — static, then black-and-white images resolved.\nThe inside of Hangar 14.\nThe jet dominated the frame, its fuselage a mirror of obsidian swallowing the light. Ground crew moved like ants beneath it. And then the camera zoomed in on Liam, who looked calm, with hands in his pockets, as he descended the lift.\nThe room went silent.\nThe chair leaned forward, knuckles pressed against the table. \"Freeze frame. Zoom on him.\"\nThe image sharpened, revealing the face of a young man, who looked barely eighteen, dressed in a simple fashion and\n\"That’s him?\" one of the Treasury analysts whispered, almost to himself.\nThe chair’s voice dropped to a low growl. \"That’s him. And he’s not alone. I want facial recognition on everyone that gets out of the aircraft with him. I also want a file with every single bit of information on each of them. Even the crew.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" everyone said and got to work.\n\"Freeze frame and zoom in on that car,\" the Chief said.\n\"Sir, that’s the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet. It was the car that caused the momentary gridlock today with it’s appearance. It’s a concept car but he has a roadworthy version,\" one of the technician replied, also pulling up available information on the car.\n\"That car is his?\" The Homeland chair asked flatly, as he leaned forward, his knuckles pressing into the table\n\"Yes, sir. California registration confirms it. Vision Mercedes-Maybach Cabriolet concept. One of one,\" replied the FAA deputy.\nAn NSA analyst muttered, \"That car was supposed to be one-off. Stuttgart kept it locked down. If he bought it outright... then the paperwork probably never passed through customs.\"\nThe CIA officer leaned back, his lips pressed thin. \"He’s not just flaunting wealth. He’s sending a message. He wants us to see this. He wants the world to see this.\"\nThe FBI chief slammed his fist down, his expression hardening, as he spoke in a low voice, \"We should impound it. Arrest him for questioning at the perimeter. You can’t just let a teenager roll out of LAX in a concept Maybach after flying a private A380. It makes us look powerless.\"\nImmediately, the chair’s voice cut through like steel. \"You lay a hand on him without cause, and you’ll hand him martyrdom on a silver plate. Every camera in Los Angeles is on that car right now. He’s bulletproof unless we have lawful grounds.\"\nSilence followed. On the big screen, Liam and his group walked to the car.\nThe Homeland chair exhaled as spoke softly, \"Track him. Record everything. Feed me live updates. Until we have something concrete, we do not touch him.\"\n\"Now, the problem is the circus outside. If he leaves that hangar unescorted, he’ll be swarmed. Last thing we need is a riot at LAX.\"\nHe turned sharply to the DHS liaison officer standing at the edge of the room. \"Get him a shadow escort. Two SUVs and an airport patrol unit, immediately.\"\nThe officer blinked. \"Sir, you want us to protect him?\"\n\"Not protect,\" the chair snapped. \"Observe. Stay close enough to keep the crowd off his car, but I want eyes on him the whole way. That vehicle leaves LAX, it doesn’t do it alone. I don’t care if he’s headed to Beverly Hills or Timbuktu — we track him in real time. Quietly.\"\nThe liaison nodded, already speaking into his comms. \"Copy. Two Suburbans from DHS motor pool on standby near Imperial Terminal. I’ll have airport police provide the lead unit for cover.\"\n\"Good. Because whatever this kid is... he’s not just another passenger. And until we know what game he’s playing, he doesn’t take a step in this country without us watching,\" the Chief said.",

      "content": "Chapter 166: The Escorts\nThe Maybach Imperium glided forward, its silent engine carrying them out of the cool shadow of Hangar 14 and back into the glare of late evening.\nThe hydraulic doors of the hangar rolled upward again, and sunlight poured across the polished bodywork.\nWaiting just outside were three vehicles, idled in formation: a white-and-blue LAX Airport Police patrol car at the front, its rooftop lights already flashing in muted warning, and behind it, two black Chevrolet Suburbans with government plates.\nNick’s hands tightened slightly on the wheel when he saw them, and he reported to Liam.\n\"Sir,\" he said carefully, nodding toward the formation. \"We’ve got company. Patrol in front... but those are federal tags on the Suburbans.\"\nFrom the backseat, Liam didn’t even shift his posture. He looked at the scene with mild amusement, then. responded, \"Don’t worry about it. Just drive. They’re here to escort us.\"\nThe words slipped out as casually as if he were talking about a hotel valet.\nNick obeyed without further question, though the tension in his shoulders remained.\nDaniel, on the other hand, felt his stomach tighten. His eyes narrowed on the black SUVs. The airport patrol vehicle, he understood immediately, as that was standard procedure.\nWhenever a high-profile aircraft — be it Air Force One, a foreign head-of-state jet, or even a commercial widebody under special clearance — entered or left Imperial Terminal, airport police provided lead escort through the service roads.\nThe patrol car’s flashing lights weren’t just for show; they cleared intersections, kept unauthorized vehicles back, and made sure the taxiing corridors between hangars and road exits stayed sterile. It was routine, logical and necessary.\nBut the two Suburbans? That was something else entirely.\nGovernment plates. Matte black finish. Windows tinted darker than regulations allowed. He didn’t even need to think too deep to know what it meant. Those weren’t there to clear traffic. They were there to observe and to shadow Liam.\nTo remind Liam — and anyone watching — that the United States government was paying attention.\nDaniel’s jaw clenched, his banker’s mind running through the implications. This wasn’t just spectacle anymore. This was surveillance and this was the government flexing its quiet authority.\nHis hand curled into a fist against his thigh. He turned, almost against his better judgment, to look at Liam and he saw his employer sat reclined in the backseat, one hand resting lightly against the door, his gaze drifting lazily out the tinted window, looking calm, collected and entirely unbothered.\nDaniel studied him for several long seconds, then forced his eyes forward again.\nHow? he wondered.\nHow could an eighteen-year-old face the scrutiny of Homeland Security itself and look like he was heading to brunch in Malibu?\nLiam hadn’t told him — couldn’t tell him — but in truth, he had listened in on every word of the Homeland Chief’s orders. He knew precisely why those Suburbans were there. They weren’t attack dogs. They were shepherds, doing their best to keep him boxed in. At least that’s what they want to believe.\nAlso, it was as just the Homeland chief said, they couldn’t arrest him without cause. He hadn’t broken a single law. Unless, as Liam thought with faint amusement, being wealthy was suddenly illegal.\nNick guided the Imperium forward and immediately, the airport patrol car pulled into motion, with its red-and-blue bar casting rotating flashes across the tarmac.\nThe first Suburban accelerated smoothly, sliding into position at the front left quarter panel of the Maybach. The second dropped back, nestling into the rear right flank. Together, the three vehicles formed a protective triangle around Liam’s car.\nThe convoy rolled out, leaving the shadow of Hangar 14 behind.\n***\nOutside the terminal, chaos reigned.\nSpotters and livestreamers who had been camped all day surged toward the perimeter fences, their cameras struggling to keep up as the obsidian Maybach appeared. The crowd roared again, almost louder than when the jet had landed.\n\"THAT’S THE CAR! The Maybach! The concept car!\" someone screamed.\n\"Wait a minute... Isn’t that the car that caused the gridlock today and currently trending with the Black Titan?\" Someone asked.\n\"You’re right. It’s the same car. I remember that it drove into the airport and disappeared into southside of it. It must had drove into the same hangar that Black Titan was in,\" one of the car spotters replied.\n\"Damn! Bro has a McLaren P1 LM-X, a roadworthy version Maybach concept car and a private A380? Bro’s built different!\" One of the plane spotters laughed.\n\"More than built different. Bro is living in a world completely different from ours. I think there’s rumour about him also having a luxury super yacht.\"\n\"Really? When did he purchase that? Where is it docked?\" One of the streamers asked.\n\"I haven’t confirmed. You should ask those yacht spotters. They will probably have more information. But I do hear that it’s docked at Marina del Rey.\"\n\"If that’s true, then bro’s a monster. How did he get so rich? I want to be adopted by his family, fr.\"\nWhile that conversation was going on, phones rose in unison, capturing shaky video as the convoy crept into view. But soon the cheers gave way to confusion when they noticed the patrol vehicle and the two Suburbans flanking the car. And then, the confusion gave way to speculations.\n\"What’s with the patrol car?\"\n\"Standard, bro, that’s normal. Airport cops always lead.\"\n\"Then what about the Suburbans?\"\n\"They’re... wait. That’s government. Look at the plates.\"\nThe words spread like wildfire. Within seconds, Twitter threads and TikTok clips began exploding:\n\"He’s got gov escort???\"\n\"DHS is literally flanking him. Confirmed.\"\n\"So he’s CIA? DARPA? Some Pentagon project?\"\n\"No way this is just a rich kid anymore. No way.\"\nAt the fence line, one man shouted to no one in particular, \"That’s federal shadowing, not protection! They’re watching him!\"\nAnother countered, \"Don’t be dumb. If it was hostile, they wouldn’t be showing it. That’s security. He’s important!\"\nThe debate rippled outward, caught and amplified by livestream chats already surging into the millions.\nOn a popular Twitch aviation channel, the chat scrolled too fast to read:\n\"bro gov escort LMFAO\"\n\"this is AREA 51 energy rn\"\n\"look at the SUV spacing, that’s textbook surveillance box\"\n\"he’s gotta be some kind of black budget project\"\n\"OR HE’S BATMAN\"\n***\nInside the Car\nThe blue-red light of the patrol car danced across the Imperium’s polished hood, reflections shifting like liquid flame.\nDaniel’s throat was dry. He leaned closer to Liam and whispered, \"Sir... this is surveillance. They’re not here for traffic controlbor just a simple escort. They’re here for you.\"\nLiam’s response was a soft chuckle. \"I know that, Daniel.\"\nDaniel blinked, incredulous. \"You’re not... concerned?\"\n\"Why would I be?\" Liam tilted his head slightly, eyes glinting. \"They can’t touch me. Not unless they find a crime. And the only crime I’ve committed today is probably giving them something to talk about.\"\nDaniel exhaled slowly, sinking back into the seat. He didn’t know if he should feel reassured or terrified.\nNick kept his eyes on the road, knuckles whitening against the wheel as pedestrians clustered near the service exit, phones raised. Mason, in the passenger seat, scanned the sidewalks with vigilantly.\nThe convoy reached the perimeter road. Traffic had snarled hopelessly, but the patrol car’s flashing lights cut a clean lane through the chaos.\nDrivers leaned out of their windows, shouting, craning for a better look. Some pointed at the Suburbans and whispered about government protection, and others muttered about conspiracy.\nFrom the backseat, Liam simply watched the world blur by, utterly calm.\nAt last, the convoy reached the airport’s main exit. The sun had dropped lower, painting the glass terminals in molten orange. Crowds had gathered even here, police struggling to keep them back as the Imperium approached.\nThe patrol car slowed, its lights still spinning. Then, at the outer edge of the airport perimeter, it signaled and peeled off to the right. Standard procedure complete. Its duty was only within the airport grounds.\nBut the two Suburbans did not leave.\nInstead, they shifted smoothly, re-forming tighter around the Maybach as Nick steered toward the highway.\nThe message was clear. The police escort was gone but the government remained.\nDaniel clenched his jaw again, when he saw this.\n\"They’re not letting us out of their sight,\" he murmured, more to himself than anyone else.\nLiam just smiled faintly, as if amused by the entire performance.\nThe convoy rolled on, out of the airport and into the gathering night.",

The aircraft descending into Los Angeles International Airport is not a military transport, not Air Force One, not an airline superjumbo. That... is a privately registered Airbus A380. The world’s first.\"\nThe anchor’s voice shook with disbelief as live helicopter footage filled the screen. The obsidian-black giant sliced through the evening haze, platinum streaks shimmering across its fuselage. Gasps rippled through the studio.\n\"Look at the size of it,\" the co-anchor whispered. \"That’s... that’s the Black Titan.\"\n***\n[KTLA Local Coverage – At the Fence Line]\nThe camera jolted as the field reporter was jostled by the surging crowd. Behind him, hundreds, if not thousands pressed against chain-link fencing, shouting and pointing skyward.\n\"Folks, the noise here is unbelievable. People are screaming, climbing on cars, holding up phones — look, look! There it is, breaking through the clouds now!\"\nThe lens zoomed tight. The giant touched down with a puff of white smoke as its wheels bit the runway. The sound of reverse thrust thundered across the tarmac, windows in the terminal visibly shuddering.\nThe crowd erupted as though at a rock concert.\n\"It’s real!\" someone screamed. \"It’s actually real!\"\n***\n[BBC World News]\n\"...to repeat, that is no scheduled flight. Heathrow spotters confirmed the registry earlier today: N914LX. An Airbus A380 in full private livery, which aviation experts said was impossible. And yet, here it is, rolling down Runway 25R in Los Angeles.\"\nThe camera cut to studio, where the aviation analyst shook his head. \"Even Saudi princes never managed this. The costs are staggering. And now, an eighteen-year-old American, Liam Scott, is named in the registry. Frankly, the numbers don’t add up.\"\n***\n[CNN – Live Helicopter Feed]\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, the aircraft is taxiing now. You can see it moving toward the Imperial Terminal. That hangar ahead, number 14, is where it’s headed. Imperial is reserved for private heads of state, foreign royalty, ultra-high-net-worth individuals. But even then, it has nothing on this scale.\"\nThe camera panned as the A380 dwarfed everything around it. A 777 paused on a taxiway, looking like a toy in comparison.\n\"Look at the wingspan. Look at how much space it’s taking. It really deserves the name, The Flying Palace.\"\n***\n[Fox News – Breaking Banner: BLACK TITAN AT LAX]\n\"Viewers, if you’re just joining us, this is live footage from Los Angeles. What you’re seeing is the largest private aircraft in the world — a black Airbus A380. It has just disappeared into Hangar 14. FAA confirms it is registered legally, though the name has now been sealed and they are refusing to give comment as to the reason why.\"\n\"We’ve seen billionaires with Gulfstreams. But this? This is power projection. This isn’t just wealth. This is influence,\" the anchor said with low voice, leaning forward.\n***\n[KTLA – Fence Line Reporter]\n\"Hold on — the hangar doors are opening again. Something’s coming out. Stand by—\"\nThe roar of the crowd surged and the camera jolted as people screamed, and lifted phones higher.\n\"It’s not the jet this time. It’s... oh my god, it’s a car. Zoom in, zoom in!\"\nThe lens focused on a long, impossibly sleek shape slid out into the light. Obsidian black, platinum flecks catching the sun.\n\"That is the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet — but folks, that car never made it past prototype stage. And yet, there it is, roadworthy, rolling out of Hangar 14. This is insane.\"\nBut then the cheers faltered, as onfusion rippled through the crowd.\nBehind the Maybach came a white-and-blue LAX Airport Police patrol car, lights flashing. And flanking the car — two matte-black Chevrolet Suburbans, windows tinted black, plates unmistakably federal.\nThe convoy formed instantly: patrol in front, Maybach in center, Suburbans at the flanks.\n***\n[MSNBC Anchor Panel]\n\"Are we looking at government escort?\" one anchor asked, her voice rising.\n\"Those are DHS plates,\" the correspondent replied grimly. \"That spacing is textbook surveillance box formation. Not for protection but observation.\"\n\"So the government knows exactly who he is?\"\n\"They’re not letting him roll out of LAX without eyes on him, that much is certain.\"\n***\nPress Conference: FAA / LAX\nHours later, the scene shifted to a cramped press hall inside LAX. Reporters shouted over each other, cameras flashing like a storm.\nAt the podium, an FAA spokesperson clutched notes like a lifeline. His face was pale, his tie crooked.\n\"The Airbus A380-800 that took off this afternoon and landed this evening is fully registered, compliant with FAA standards, and legally authorized for private operation,\" he began.\nInstantly, questions tore through the room.\n\"Who owns it?\"\n\"Why did the registry vanish from public record?\"\n\"Why are DHS vehicles flanking the car?\"\n\"Is this a security threat?\"\n\"Was the flight plan filed under a false entity?\"\nThe spokesperson repeated woodenly, \"The aircraft is compliant. The registry has been sealed for privacy reasons. We have no further comment.\"\nThe room erupted again.\n\"Why seal it after it went viral?\" shouted a Reuters journalist.\n\"Is it true the owner is a U.S. citizen under twenty?\" pressed Bloomberg.\n\"Does Homeland Security have operational control over him?\" asked the BBC correspondent.\n\"No further comment,\" the spokesperson said, his voice cracking.\n***\nGlobal Broadcast Reactions.\n[BBC – Studio Debate]\nThe aviation historian looked pale. \"Private A380s were supposed to be fantasy. Even oil sheikhs never made it happen. And yet one has just flown, under American registry. Whoever Liam Scott is, he has upended the entire balance of wealth and aviation in one stroke.\"\n[CNN Newsroom]\n\"I have never seen this: an eighteen-year-old American operating a half-billion-dollar aircraft, under federal escort, with regulators refusing to explain. Viewers, this is history in real time.\"\n[Fox News – Heated Panel]\nOne commentator leaned forward angrily: \"This is government cover-up. If DHS SUVs are shadowing him, then this isn’t just private wealth. This is state-backed.\"\nAnother shook his head. \"No — this is worse. If it’s private, it means a teenager is richer than sovereign wealth funds. That’s destabilizing.\"\n***\nInternational Coverage\n[CCTV – Beijing]\nThe anchor’s Mandarin voiceover rolled as satellite images filled the screen, \"American teenager, name Liam Scott, said to own aircraft of unprecedented scale. Ministry of State Security reviewing. Officials say: this represents not indulgence, but power projection.

If this is a front, then America hides a deeper hand.\"\n***\n[RT – Moscow]\n\"Eighteen years old, they say. An Airbus A380, the Flying Palace, in private hands. Do you believe this? We do not. Either the CIA built a myth, or this boy is theirs. Our sources say FSB already watching his every step,\" the anchor said.\nThe ticker read: PRIVATE A380 — AMERICAN WEAPON OR INDIVIDUAL POWER?\n***\n[Al Jazeera – Doha]\n\"Good evening. Tonight, the world asks: who is Liam Scott? This teenager now owns what even Saudi royalty could not purchase — a private Airbus A380. A symbol not just of wealth, but of dominance.

What does this mean for balance of global power?\"\nThe guest analyst smiled faintly. \"It means a new player has entered the board. And nobody knows his game.\"\n***\n[NHK – Tokyo]\nOn screen: drone footage of the A380’s landing, replayed in slow motion.\nThe anchor’s voice was calm, almost reverent: \"A symbol of impossible luxury has become reality. A teenager in America, name Liam Scott, is now the world’s most mysterious magnate.\"\n***\nThe final montage played across every major news outlet:\nThe A380 landing, wheels smoking on asphalt.\nThe Maybach Imperium gliding from the hangar.\nFederal Suburbans boxing it in as the convoy rolled toward the highway.\nReporters shouting, FAA spokespeople stonewalling.\nCrowds screaming at the fence line, hashtags blazing across the screen.\nOn every network around the world, the same unanswered question lingered in bold banners:\nWHO IS LIAM SCOTT?",

      "content": "Chapter 168: Back Home\nThe Maybach Imperium slid silently out of LAX’s private roadways and onto the freeway.\nThe two matte-black Suburbans fell into place instantly, one tailing, the other hovering in the next lane with, their tinted windows revealed nothing.\nLos Angeles traffic, already a constant tide, rippled outward as drivers noticed the formation. Horns faltered, brakes tapped, and then came the phones.\n\"Yo, that’s the car! The Maybach!\" a teenager shouted from the backseat of a Prius, already shoving his phone against the glass.\n\"No way... and look at the SUVs. That’s feds, bro. He’s got feds with him!\" another voice yelled as cars swerved slightly to keep pace.\nA Dodge Charger tried to inch closer, its driver leaning out with his phone, but the trailing Suburban slid sideways, smooth and deliberate, boxing the lane. The Charger fell back, the driver cursing.\nOn the sidewalks, pedestrians stopped mid-step, staring. Some screamed, pointing, others livestreamed. Within minutes, hashtags from the airport were joined by new ones:\n#MaybachConvoy\n#FedEscortLA\n#BlackTitanDrive\nDaniel sat in the backseat, jaw tight, eyes flicking from the tinted SUVs to the endless rows of phones recording them. Mason was scanning their mirrors like a hawk, while Nick continued driving and holding in his nerves.\nThrough it all, Liam leaned back in the seat, utterly calm, watching LA blur past. Neon lights flickered on across Wilshire, casting shifting glows across the hood. To him, the Suburbans weren’t intimidation.\nThe convoy rolled northward, cutting toward Beverly Hills, then deeper into Holmby Hills. Here, the chaos of the city dimmed, the wide boulevards lined with old trees and iron gates.\nAt last, the Maybach slowed, turning onto a private street. The Suburbans followed — but as the Imperium glided up the long drive toward Bellemere Mansion’s gates, the SUVs stopped.\nEngines idled as black silhouettes behind tinted glass watched silently as the gates swung open at Liam’s arrival. The Maybach purred through, the wrought-iron closing behind them with a faint clang.\nThe Suburbans waited for a few minutes, their presence lingering like shadows at the edge of the street, before at last they rolled off into the night.\nInside, the Cabriolet pulled smoothly up to the front steps. The sprawling mansion glowed warmly against the dark, light spilling from tall windows onto manicured lawns.\nMason got out of the car first, circling to open the rear door. Liam stepped out, straightening his shirt. Daniel followed, his composure still frayed from the day’s events.\n\"Come in. Let’s have dinner,\" Liam said casually, turning toward his Family Office Manager, Daniel.\nDaniel looked at Liam for a moment, as he pondered the offer. After a brief moment, he nodded, accepting the offer. He was famished. He didn’t eat both on their way to the island and back home.\nLiam smiled and walked into the mansion.\n\"Welcome home, sir,\" Evelyn said softly as the door opened.\nClara and Mira were standing behind her, their faces poised in polite smiles. But beneath that poise Liam noticed the subtle details: the stiffness in their shoulders and the slight tremor in their voices.\nHe knew that they’d seen that they had watched the news and seen how the internet was blowing up because of him. They had watched as the black A380 tore into the sky, and the world had seen it land. They had watched the Maybach glide out of Hangar 14 under federal escort.\nThe girls had tried to act like it was just another evening for them, a regular Tuesday, but their eyes betrayed them.\nThey were shocked, nervous and a little afraid.\nThey couldn’t help it, as their phones has been blowing up with messages and calls from people that are aware that they are working for Liam. They didn’t dare pick the calls or reply the messages, as they are aware that they will be bombarded with questions that they have no answer for.\nBut while the girls were riled up by everything, they didn’t let that stop them from doing their job.\n\"Dinner?\" Evelyn asked after the greetings were exchanged.\n\"Yes. Dinner first,\" Liam nodded and his gaze flicked toward Daniel. \"Mr. Conley will be joining me.\"\nThe girls inclined their heads in unison and turned smoothly toward the dining hall. As they moved, one by one, each spared a brief glance at Daniel, their eyes curious but polite. Daniel gave a small nod of acknowledgment, as he could also see the question in their eyes.\nLiam and Daniel ushered themselves into the dining hall, where the table has already being laid out with china and crystal. The scent of roasted lamb and herbs floated from the kitchen.\nWithin minutes, Liam and Daniel were seated across from one another. Mason and Nick positioned themselves just outside the doors, watchful and silent.\nDinner began quietly. Plates were set before them, wine were poured, and the girls retreated just enough to give them privacy, though their presence lingered at the edge of the room.\nDaniel cut into his food immediately, but he barely tasted it. His eyes kept drifting upward, as though every carved detail in the mansion’s ceilings was an attempt to distract him from the avalanche of questions clawing at his throat.\nLiam, for his part, ate slowly, savoring each bite. He noticed Daniel’s hesitation. He could almost feel the questions pressing forward, demanding release — Where did you get it? How did you pay for it? Who really funds you? Why flaunt it?\nBut Daniel said nothing. He was too disciplined for that. Too trained to ask reckless questions at the wrong time.\nAnd Liam let him be.\nHe knew Daniel was tired, mentally and emotionally wrung out by the chaos of the day. Even the girls, moving quietly around the periphery, had that same tightness in their movements.\nThey had done their jobs flawlessly, but he could tell they were carrying questions as well. The same questions echoing on every news broadcast and on the internet.\nWho is he, really?\nWhat kind of eighteen-year-old commands toys like this?\nAnd what happens now that the whole world is watching?\nLiam knew none of the answers he could give would satisfy them. Because the truth wasn’t simple. And the truth was that he has no intention of giving them any answer.\nAnd so dinner was quiet. When the meal ended, Liam pushed back his chair and wiped his hands with a linen napkin. Daniel followed suit, setting his utensils down with a small sigh.\nThe girls moved forward again, clearing the plates.\n\"Thank you,\" Liam said as he rose. His voice was warm and genuine. Despite everything, he treated his staff not as tools, but as extensions of his world. They mattered to him.\nDaniel also stood up, adjusting his jacket. He looked like he wanted to speak, to finally ask at least one of the burning questions, but then he hesitated.\nHe saw Liam’s calm expression, saw the way the young man seemed utterly untouched by the storm raging outside these walls, and the words died on his lips.\nInstead, Daniel gave a professional nod. \"It was an excellent meal. Thank you.\"\nThe girls curtsied politely.\n\"You’ll be needing rest,\" Liam said lightly. \"Nick will drive you back. Take the Rolls. Your car is still at the airport, yes?\"\nDaniel opened his mouth to object — it was instinct. He was used to handling things himself, but Liam’s next words left no room for argument.\n\"You won’t take public transport tonight. Let Nick drive you.\"\nDaniel sighed softly, lowering his eyes for a beat before nodding. \"As you wish, sir.\"\nLiam smiled faintly. \"Good man.\"\nHe gestured toward the doors. Nick stepped forward immediately, already prepared.\nDaniel gave Liam one final glance — a look of resignation — then he followed Nick out into the night.\nThe front doors closed with a heavy thud, leaving Liam alone with the girls in the golden-lit dining hall.\nLiam exhaled softly, turned, and ascended the sweeping staircase. He reached the master suite, pushed open the door, walked in and let himself fall onto the bed with a long sigh.\nThe day had been long, exhausting in its spectacle, but it was over. For him, at least.\nBut not for the rest of the world.\nBecause while he stretched across silk sheets and closed his eyes, the storm of questions still outside raged on, but the most asked was:\nWho is Liam Scott?",

      "content": "Chapter 169: Panic, The Audit\nMeanwhile, while the world was still trying to find answers to their questions, two groups besides the world’s governments were not only asking questions but also panicking.\nThe first group was the companies that on the news.\n***\nToulouse – Airbus HQ\nThe finance floor at Airbus felt suddenly too small. Airbus was experiencing the same dilemma that McLaren had experienced last week when Liam drove the P1 LM-X around LA.\nScreens that had been quietly scrolling manufacturing dashboards and supplier KPIs now pulsed with the same viral footage everyone else had seen — the black A380 lifting off from LAX, the registry bannered across every news tickers. A dozen phones rang at once and analysts stopped typing.\n\"Is — is that one of ours?\" a junior accountant whispered, voice trembling as he dragged the live feed onto the monitor beside his SAP session.\nThe room went very still. Within seconds the CFO, who has his hair mussed and tie loosened, had moved from his office, boots striking the tile as he crossed the open-plan floor. He keyed his way into the ERP, fingers jittering.\n\"Project code? Contract number? Procurement — pull anything with ’special project’ or ’private config’ in the last 7 years,\" he barked into his headset. \"Trace journal entries. Now.\"\nPeople obeyed like troops and search boxes filled with wild queries. The procurement team dove into purchase orders. Program managers scanned engineering change orders. Someone in vendor relations pinged Rolls-Royce and Safran’s liaison for confirmation.\nTen minutes passed like an hour.\n\"Found something,\" a procurement lead said. He threw the screen to the front: an internal project file, buried under layers of NDAs — Project: FLYING_PALACE. Contract attached. Signed — last year. Value: €482,000,000. Status: Closed. Final invoice: PAID.\nThe CFO’s face emptied when he saw this. He couldn’t believe it.\n\"Show bank remittance. Show the clearing.\"\nAnother analyst had already pivoted to the treasury portal. He pulled up the SWIFT confirmations and the corporate bank ledger: the exact tranche amounts hit Airbus’s designated account on precisely the dates the invoices specified. The reference fields matched the contract numbers down to the last digit.\n\"Wire confirmations,\" he said, as if reading a lifeline. \"BNP Paribas. Funds cleared. Beneficiary reference matches FLYING_PALACE invoice series.\"\nPhones erupted again, with procurement calling cabin-fit teams, who in turn were in contact with Lufthansa Technik and Zodiac.\nOne by one the subcontractors logged in to confirm. Each ERP echoing the same truth: invoices issued, invoices settled. Rolls-Royce’s engine-supply invoice shows a credit entry; Safran’s avionics invoice shows payment; the upholsterer’s small PO for handcrafted leather panels is stamped PAID.\nAn internal compliance analyst swallowed and said the word that made half the room go quiet: \"AML checks — I’ve got the KYC files. Trust vehicles listed as payors. Offshore entity names. But the documents are in order. All due diligence workflows were completed and archived.\"\n\"Audit,\" the CFO said, voice hoarse, and the word had the force of command.\nAn auditor from the external firm — someone flown in on an emergency call immediately the video of the video of the plane taking off hit the internet — skimmed the trail and spoke slowly. \"You asked me if the project exists in your records. It does. Contracts, POs, change orders, certificates of completion, delivery receipts for interior modules... all logged. Payments cleared. Bank confirmations. Our spot tests reconcile. If we load a sample into the general ledger, it balances.\"\n\"But how?\" murmured the treasury head. \"We were never briefed. No board memo. No RFP on Procurement. How did this bypass executive oversight?\"\n\"Look for signatories,\" someone said, pulling up the contract metadata. The signatory blocks — names and digital certificates — were signed by a Delaware trust entity. The digital signatures verified. The NDA clause was ironclad: punitive penalty clauses, confidentiality, breach fines in the billions, arbitration in Amsterdam. The legal stamp was immaculate.\nLegal counsel, summoned and pale, leaned in. \"They paid exactly what was due. The contracts were structured under a Special Projects Cover. All subcontractor agreements include the same confidentiality appendices and liquidated-damages clauses. Breach the NDA and you don’t just pay damages — you forfeit global contracts. The penalties are structured to keep mouths shut.\"\nSomeone in cyber ops, suddenly present at the table, raised his head. \"We checked the origination of the wires. The trail runs through an elaborate chain of nominee accounts and trust vehicles — Cayman, Singapore, Luxembourg — all the usual jurisdictions. But every intermediary’s paperwork reconciles. SWIFT messages, beneficiary confirmations, correspondent bank logs — they all show green.\"\nThe CFO sat back hard, causing the chair to squeak in protest. For the first time since the footage hit the feeds, a different understanding settled over the room: this was not a paper illusion someone had dreamed up. The money was on the ledgers, and the ledgers matched the banks. The auditors had signed off — at least on what existed inside the system.\nA senior VP whispered slowly and thoughtfully, \"If someone sank billions into this and hid the source, they took the trouble to make it untouchable. Whoever’s behind the pay-out covered every legal and accounting box.\"\n\"Then what do we tell the board?\" the CFO asked, though the question was rhetorical. He looked at the chain of paid invoices again, the archived delivery receipts, the stamped acceptance that closed the procurement cycle.\n\"We present the facts. Contracts exist. Work completed. Payments reconciled. And we enforce the NDAs.\"\nSomeone in procurement added, \"And if a regulator comes knocking?\"\nLegal’s response was measured, practiced. \"We produce the documentation. We show the compliance checks. We assert confidentiality where contractually permitted. Any attempt to publicly break the NDAs triggers the liquidated damages clauses. It’s a financial deterrent so steep that any vendor will think twice before speaking.\"\nOutside the room, the news ticker scrolled new allegations, theories, speculation. Inside, Airbus’s finance and legal teams continued their forensic calm: reconciling entries, preserving chain-of-custody for internal records, copying SWIFT confirmations to secure servers, and preparing an executive summary for the board that would say, plainly and unavoidably:\nThe project exists in our books. The work was performed. The invoices were paid. The payments cleared. All external auditors and banks report reconciled accounts. All contractual safeguards and NDAs are in force.\nIn the silence that followed, the hard reality settled like a physical weight — not an absence of proof, but an embarrassment of it. The company had been paid and the receipts were clean.\nThe only mystery left was the beneficiary name on the other end of the trust chain: a teenager whose name, when searched in registries, fit awkwardly beside the magnitude of the transfers.\n\"Track those trust beneficiaries,\" the CFO ordered finally. \"Full trace to beneficial owners. Compliance, Treasury — find who took delivery of the funds. And Legal — prepare the NDA enforcement package. If anyone so much as whispers, we sue.\"\nOutside, the world shouted. Inside, Airbus had only numbers and signatures — and the dawning, uncomfortable knowledge that some mechanism — legal, financial, or otherwise — had made a half-billion look exactly as tidy as any other corporate transaction.\n***\nThis was also the same for Mercedes-Maybach.\nAt Mercedes-Benz HQ in Stuttgart, the design studio floor was chaos. Engineers and executives crowded around a monitor showing live footage of the Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet rolling out of LAX, roadworthy and flawless.\n\"That’s impossible,\" one of the lead designers muttered. \"The prototypes never left our vault.\"\nLegal and finance were already digging. Within minutes, procurement pulled up an archived file: Special Commission – One-Off Roadworthy Variant.\nThe digital signatures were authentic, stamped with ironclad NDAs. Payment records matched down to the euro — tranches routed through Daimler’s accounts, cleared and confirmed.\n\"It’s in the books,\" the CFO said grimly, sliding the ledger across the table. \"Paid in full. Delivered under sealed contract. Every subcontractor signed. Breach penalties in the billions.\"\nThe room fell silent as realization settled. This wasn’t theft, nor reverse-engineering. The car had been theirs to build. It was quietly authorized, perfectly paid for, and legally bound in secrecy.\n\"Then,\" one executive whispered, staring at the screen, \"someone just drove our future fantasy onto the streets of Los Angeles... and we can’t say a word.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 170: Panic (2), Caught Between A Rock And A Hard Place\nToulouse – Airbus HQ\nThe Airbus executive board sat in the top-floor war room, blinds drawn and their phones muted. On the main screen, the black A380 lifting out of LAX glowed like a phantom.\nA hush fell over everyone in that room, as they all knew the truth: the aircraft wasn’t a retrofit or a scavenged hull. It was a one-off, hand-built under a bespoke contract and an NDA that’s incredibly complex, confusing, and difficult to understand or navigate, much like a maze.\nIt was a project they have no idea about but their records says otherwise. Not only did they build it, they and their subcontractors got paid in full for it. Their bank records and accounts balance also confirms this.\nIt was a very bizarre situation they found themselves in. But they can’t do anything about it. NDAs, this NDA especially isn’t something they dare to break.\nBut their problems wasn’t over. In fact, it was just beginning.\n\"Washington has already called,\" said the head of government relations, with a low voice. \"London, Riyadh, and Beijing are pinging us as well. Everyone’s demanding to know who owns it, who paid for it, and why we built it. They’re hinting at subpoenas.\"\nThe CEO leaned back, steepling his fingers. \"We say what the NDA allows: nothing. We confirm only that Airbus complies with all export controls, all certifications, and that the aircraft is fully airworthy. Ownership is confidential. Period.\"\nLegal counsel, pale but steady, nodded. \"The NDA binds us as tightly as it binds him. Breach it and we’re open to ruinous penalties. Even governments can’t pry without a court order. We’ll stall, and if compelled, we’ll give only sanitized documentation.\"\nSomeone else muttered, \"They’re going to think we’re hiding a state project. This is going to look like a black-budget program.\"\nThe CEO gave a small smile. \"Let them think. We delivered a product to a client under contract. We did nothing illegal. The panic is not our problem.\"\nCommunications glanced nervously at the CEO. \"And if the press keeps calling?\"\n\"We give the same line: Airbus has no official private A380 program. We cannot comment on confidential customer projects. That’s all. Not one word more.\"\nThe CEO’s gaze swept the room. \"Everyone understand? We built it. We delivered it. Now we let the world tear itself apart guessing.\"\nNods all around, as phones stayed muted.\n***\nStuttgart – Daimler AG Headquarters (Mercedes-Maybach Division)\nThe boardroom was silent, save for the muted video looping on the big screen: shaky cellphone footage of an onyx-black Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium gliding through Los Angeles traffic.\nThe head of Maybach Design broke the silence, as he spoke with a low voice, \"...That’s it. That’s the Imperium.\"\nA marketing director pinched the bridge of her nose. \"We’re dead. Every journalist in Europe and America has been calling since dawn. They’re demanding to know how a concept car — one we swore was never road-legal — is driving down Wilshire Boulevard.\"\nLegal counsel spoke evenly. \"We remind everyone: the Vision 6 was always presented as a design concept. Any appearance of a road-worthy version is outside our public program. Ownership and contractual obligations are covered under confidentiality agreements. That is our line. Nothing more.\"\nThe head of Special Projects shifted uncomfortably, as he spoke helplessly. \"But you all know the truth. On paper, our team built the one-off under Project Imperium, delivered on schedule. The NDA’s airtight, but now...\"\nThe Daimler CEO’s expression hardened. \"Well, we did what we were contracted to do. Nothing illegal. No breach of export law. This is a bespoke commission, like the one-off cars Bugatti or Rolls build for their best clients. Only difference is scale... and visibility.\"\n\"Visibility is the problem,\" muttered PR. \"They’re saying it’s military. They’re saying it’s Applē. Elon Musk. Christ, someone on CNBC called it ’alien technology.’ If they dig too deep—\"\n\"—they’ll hit the NDA wall,\" Legal interrupted sharply. \"Let them. We cannot confirm. We cannot deny. We simply... don’t comment. Any breach costs billions. No one here will say a word.\"\nThe CEO’s gaze swept the table. \"Good. Then we hold our line. If pressed, remind them: Vision 6 was a concept. Concepts do not go into production. End of discussion.\"\nPR hesitated. \"...And if Washington calls?\"\nThe CEO gave a thin smile. \"Then we remind them Mercedes-Benz is a German company. They’ll have to go through Berlin first.\"\nThe room fell silent again. The world wanted answers but Mercedes-Maybach would give none.\n***\nWoking, UK — McLaren Technology Centre\nThe curved glass walls of the boardroom reflected the muted glow of several screens. On them, two videos looped side by side:\n— The Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium gliding through Los Angeles traffic like a UFO on wheels.\n— The black Airbus A380 \"Flying Palace\" lifting off from LAX in slow motion.\nFor a long moment, no one spoke. The only sound was the faint whir of the HVAC and the occasional clink of coffee cups.\nFinally, the Director of Special Projects spoke first, his voice measured but tight: \"That’s the same client.\"\nAcross the table, McLaren’s marketing head nodded grimly. \"It has to be. The same boy who commissioned the P1 LM-X. Now he’s got a one-off Maybach and a private A380.\"\nAnother executive, a younger engineer from MSO (McLaren Special Operations), swiveled his laptop to show a graph. \"Well, the good news is that we now have people to share our misery with. And the bad news?.searches for ’McLaren P1 LM-X’ have spiked 400% in the last two hours. We are probably going to be under the spotlight again. And it will be intense this time.’\"\nThe PR director exhaled sharply and nodded in agreement. \"It was already fading. We had almost buried the chatter about the LM-X after the Beverly Hills sighting. Now this circus with the Maybach and the A380 has dragged it back into the headlines. Every journalist who missed it the first time will start digging again.\"\nThe Special Projects head rubbed his forehead. \"To be clear: the LM-X was delivered under NDA. We fulfilled our end. He paid, the car was legal and we made no public statements.\"\n\"They’re speculating that McLaren built him a hypercar we’ve never even teased,\" said the marketing head. \"Some are calling it ’the successor to the Speedtail.’ Others think it’s a secret military collab. It’s absurd — but it’s going viral again.\"\nThe PR director glanced at the footage of the A380, jaw tightening. \"This kid isn’t just collecting toys. He’s creating a myth. Everything he touches goes viral. That LM-X was supposed to be a ghost project — now people think it’s a prototype we’re hiding from the market.\"\n\"What’s our line?\" asked the younger engineer quietly.\nLegal counsel spoke without hesitation. \"Same as Mercedes and Airbus; we stonewall. We don’t confirm and we don’t deny. We say nothing. LM-X was an MSO commission under confidentiality. If asked, we remind the press the P1 LM series ended years ago, and that anything on the road today is a private modification.\"\nMarketing chewed his lip. \"That’ll work for now. But mark my words — as long as he’s out there parading impossible machines, the LM-X will resurface again and again. And every time, we’ll have to push it back under.\"\nThe Special Projects head stared at the looping footage — the Maybach gleaming, the A380 rising like a black titan — and said quietly, \"We may not be able to push it back under forever.\"\nSilence fell again. They have no idea why and how something like this was possible, but unfortunately, they can’t do anything about it.\nIf Airbus, Mercedes-Maybach or McLaren dares to deny, saying that they have no idea how the cars or the aircraft came to be, and about the and the truth came out — which of course it will, as their records proves that they built them and the videos going viral are concrete evidences, they will face multi-billion lawsuits from Liam for breach of NDA.\nThey have be hit by massive fines from regulators for false disclosure and compliance breaches. They will experience collapse in shareholder trust and stock price will crash. And there’s the risk of executives being fired or even prosecuted for corporate deception.\nIn short, the three of them are trapped — unable to deny, unable to explain and the moment they slip, Liam will have all the justification — and the legal firepower — to obliterate them.",

      "content": "Chapter 171: Panic (3), The Financial World\nThe second group that was panicking was the financial world.\nAcross boardrooms from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, the reaction was the same: shock, unease, and a scramble for answers.\nExecutives who normally moved in calm, measured tones now found themselves speaking in hushed voices, tapping pens, and scrolling through news feeds in disbelief.\nThe news of Liam’s A380 and Maybach spectacle had hit like a thunderclap, but it was the registry data that followed which truly rattled the halls of corporate power.\nCompliance desks, investor relations teams, and legal departments quietly started digging — combing through registries, custodian records, and cross-border filings.\nAt first, nothing obvious appeared. His name wasn’t on any 13D* or 13G* filing, and he wasn’t flagged on Bloomberg terminals. He also wasn’t in the usual \"whale lists\" of activist shareholders.\nAnd yet, the deeper they pulled, the stranger it got. Beneath layers of nominee accounts and trust vehicles, the same name kept surfacing — Liam Scott. A teenager. An eighteen-year-old who somehow appeared in the investor rolls of not one, but several of the largest companies in the world.\nThe stakes weren’t above the 5% disclosure threshold, which only made the situation more unsettling. It meant he could be everywhere at once, stitched invisibly into the fabric of multiple Fortune 500 companies, exerting quiet weight without triggering alarms. That uncertainty was more unnerving than if he’d simply declared a massive stake outright.\nInside these companies, unease spread. Executives muttered in private corridors, board members texted each other late into the night, and compliance officers quietly assembled dossiers under the heading:\nScott, Liam – Potential Emerging Investor.\nThey didn’t yet know whether to treat him as a curiosity, a threat, or a future partner. What unsettled them most was that he seemed to have chosen invisibility, but the world was staring intently at him.\n***\nWall Street – JP Morgan Tower, 270 Park Avenue\nBut nowhere was the tension greater than at JP Morgan’s 270 Park Avenue tower, and the mood in the Private Banking floor was bitter.\nLiam Scott had walked away from their carefully tailored private-banking arm, refusing to be managed like any other wealthy heir. For JP Morgan, losing a client with that kind of profile — sovereign-level wealth, global visibility — was a humiliation. At the time, they barely knew who he really was, but suspicion sharpened when they learned he had moved through the Rothschild private vault. By then it was late — too late to win him back as a banking client — but not too late to remain connected through the Family Office they had built for him.\nBut the sting dulled when the partners reminded themselves: he wasn’t entirely lost. The Family Office remained, established through their structures, anchored by their legal frameworks, and still tied to their global networks.\nYes, They don’t control it, nor did they manage its daily affairs, but its foundations had their fingerprints. Through it, they still had a line of connection to Liam Scott.\n\"No,\" one director murmured, watching footage of the Black Titan on a muted screen. \"He’s not our client anymore. But he’s still our ecosystem. And that makes all the difference.\"\nLiam wasn’t just a name on their watchlist. He was their client — they still consider him to be their client. Every competing bank on Wall Street was now watching them, wondering what they knew that no one else did.\nIn a glass conference room, a managing director leaned across the table and whispered what everyone was already thinking.\n\"He’s not just an investor. He’s leverage. And now the whole world knows his name.\"\nThe room was silent for a long moment. Then Marianne, head of ultra-high-net-worth relations, spoke firmly:\n\"Action points. First — reinforce the firewall around his Family Office. Every approach, every inquiry, runs through Legal, no exceptions. Second — scenario planning. If regulators press, we cooperate on the surface but reveal nothing beyond what compliance requires. Third — maintain services quietly. We don’t manage his Family Office, but we built it. That keeps us tied in. And if we don’t protect that link, Goldman, UBS, or Morgan Stanley will find a way to slip in. And that is something we can’t allow.\"\nAnother executive frowned. \"What if governments pressure us? Homeland, Treasury, the SEC—\"\n\"Then,\" Marianne cut him off, \"we remind them: this is a client under U.S. law, and every structure we built for him is compliant. If they want more than that, they’ll have to come with a court order — and even then, we’ll push back. Liam Scott is too valuable to risk.\"\nThe CEO’s directive came sharp and final: \"This isn’t a billionaire anymore. This is a sovereign-level client. Treat him accordingly.\"\n***\nGoldman Sachs – Broad Street\nTwo miles downtown, another war room was alight. Partners at Goldman Sachs stared at the same viral footage, their Bloomberg terminals flashing with chatter.\n\"We missed him,\" one partner muttered bitterly. \"He went to JP Morgan. They built the structure and they’re going to own him now.\"\nThe head of investment banking tapped his pen. \"Not necessarily. If he’s holding cross-stakes in tech, pharma, and aviation, he’ll need syndicate access. IPO allocations. Debt issuance. We can still wedge in.\"\n\"What’s the play?\" someone asked.\nThe partner gave a thin smile. \"We invite him in. Silicon Valley will want inroads. If he’s putting capital into hardware and software, we structure deals around him. Venture, late-stage, whatever he wants. If we can’t be his private bank, we’ll be his investment bank.\"\nThe room nodded grimly. Goldman never stayed locked out for long.\n***\nSilicon Valley – Cupertino\nAt a sleek glass campus in Cupertino, Apple’s executive team huddled.\nA product VP scrolled through his iPad, shaking his head. \"His name’s in our registry. Though not big enough to be public, but he’s in.\"\nThe CFO spoke softly. \"He’s not just an investor. He’s positioning himself as a shadow stakeholder across the Valley. If he can put our glass into his toys — or worse, build his own competing platform — we’ll be chasing him instead of leading.\"\nIf there was one thing Applē and other industry giants fear, it was losing their role as industry leaders. Which means, instead of dictating market trends, they’d end up reacting to Liam’s moves, playing catch-up in a game they used to dominate. But all these is based on the scenario that Liam intends to go into tech industry.\nThe CEO’s decision was swift: \"Reach out discreetly. Through backchannels. Not official. Just... dinner invitations, soft feelers. If he’s building something, we want to be at the table.\n[A/N: Whenever you see an asterisk \"*\" after word, please check the Author’s Thought for the footnote.]",

      "content": "Chapter 172: The World Is Watching\nBy the end of the night, strategies were already in motion across the financial world.\nAt JP Morgan, the mandate was simple: secure every record, harden the walls around his Family Office, and quietly broaden the services tethered to him. Liam Scott was no longer just another private client. He was to be regarded — and protected — as if he were a sovereign power in his own right.\nAt Goldman Sachs, frustration quickly turned to opportunity. If they couldn’t win him in private banking, they would wedge themselves into his deals. Syndicates, IPO allocations, late-stage venture funding — wherever Liam put his capital, Goldman would circle, ready to insert itself.\nIn Silicon Valley, the big names moved faster than their reputations suggested. Applē, Gōōgle, Amazōn — all of them began their quiet outreach. Not through formal letters or public overtures, but through board members, venture capital backchannels, and discreet invitations to dinners and think-tank roundtables. If Liam was building something, they wanted a seat at his table.\nAcross the Atlantic, UBS, Credit Suisse, HSBC convened late-night calls of their own. The first order of business: identify if Liam was already hidden in their books. If he was, he would be shielded. If not, he would be hunted — courted aggressively before their rivals claimed him.\nEven the giants of passive capital — BlackRock, Vanguard, Bridgewater — were stirred. Compliance teams began drafting dossiers, while quant desks quietly combed market data for his fingerprints, searching for subtle patterns of his buying and selling across billions in daily flows.\nEverywhere, the conclusion was the same.\nLiam Scott was no longer just a client. No longer just a boy with impossible toys. He was a market force — unpredictable, rising, and powerful.\nAnd market forces were never ignored. They were courted, shielded, or fought... but never, ever ignored.\nThe panic wasn’t because Liam Scott existed. It wasn’t even because he was only eighteen. It was because of what he had just done in plain sight.\nMost billionaires moved carefully when it came to large capital expenditures. A $500 million acquisition would normally take months of structuring, approvals, committees, and press strategy.\nBut Liam had just dropped half a billion dollars on a private Airbus A380 — a purchase so outrageous that even oil monarchs had failed to pull it off — and he had done it as casually as if he’d bought a sports car. That single act sent shockwaves through the industry.\nIf someone could lavish half a billion on an aircraft that wasn’t even supposed to exist in private hands, what else could he do? If he treated that kind of money as pocket change, how deep did his capital actually run?\nAcross Wall Street and Silicon Valley, one fact settled like gravity: this wasn’t just a rich teenager. This was a new center of capital — and everyone wanted to orbit him. And they will do whatever it takes to achieve that.\n***\nMeanwhile, there was a third group but they weren’t panicking. Instead, their eyes were shining because they had just been handed the juiciest story in years.\nForbes, Bloomberg, Financial Times and Wall Street Journal — the titans of financial journalism wasted no time.\nAt Forbes, the Billionaires List desk went into overdrive. Editors pointed at the screens showing Liam’s jet and his car.\n\"Find him,\" the editor-in-chief ordered. \"If the FAA registry says Liam Scott, then I want his tax records, property purchases, and trust filings. We’ll confirm if he’s a billionaire, and if he is, he goes straight onto our radar. Youngest in history.\"\nResearchers immediately began combing through state filings, real estate deeds, and SEC disclosures, their mandate clear: put Liam on the map.\nAt Bloomberg, the newsroom shifted like a machine.\n\"Terminal first,\" their senior editor barked. \"Trace his name across custodian banks, nominee accounts, and offshore trusts. If he shows up in daily trading flows, I want to know it. Call your compliance contacts. Hit London, Singapore, and Zurich desks. He doesn’t exist at this scale without leaving fingerprints.\"\nReporters scattered, pulling favors with bankers, compliance officers, and hedge fund managers. Bloomberg’s goal wasn’t just a profile — it was to map his financial footprint across the world.\nIn London, at the Financial Times, the mood was sharper. \"Get me people at Airbus, Mercedes, McLaren. Someone built those toys, and someone took those payments,\" the investigations editor said flatly.\n\"We’ll shake suppliers, subcontractors, even upholsterers. If this kid paid half a billion for a jet, the trail is there.\"\nCorrespondents picked up their phones, reaching out to aerospace consultants, legal firms, and government insiders. The FT wanted to know not just who Liam was — but how the machinery of global industry bent itself to build for him.\nAnd at the Wall Street Journal, the directive was blunt. \"We want the dirt. Everyone else will write him as a wunderkind. We don’t. We go harder. Find out if he’s fronting for someone. Sovereign money? Black budget? Get on the ground in Los Angeles, dig into Holmby Hills, talk to neighbors, call every lawyer and banker he’s touched. I want him on A1 within a week.\"\nThe Journal’s investigative team, veterans of exposing corporate frauds, leaned in with hungry eyes. They didn’t care if Liam was legitimate or not. They cared about the angle — and they would turn over every rock to get it.\nWhere governments scrambled and corporations froze, the press mobilized. To them, Liam Scott wasn’t a problem. He was the story of a generation.\nAnd like all great stories, they knew the truth was buried somewhere beneath the noise.\nPiece by piece, they would stitch together the outline of a figure who shouldn’t exist — an eighteen-year-old operating on a scale that belonged to sovereign wealth funds and royal dynasties.\nAnd when they finally connected those threads in the coming days — when the world saw the numbers, the assets, the scale — the realization would rattle global finance itself.\nBecause Liam Scott wasn’t just wealthy. He wasn’t just a wunderkind with toys.\nHe was a force whose existence would challenge the very definition of power. He was the richest person in the world and the world wasn’t ready for that.\n***\nMeanwhile, Liam’s friends were stunned silence, watching the news footage over and over again.\nTheir phones were blowing up with calls and messages, but the truth was that they had exactly no idea what to say.\nTheir parents were also looking at them, waiting for answers but they have none. They could only sigh helplessly and hope that things will fade.\nBut unfortunately for them, things were just about to kick up. Their lives ahead was going to be nothing short of a rollercoaster ride.",

      "content": "Chapter 173: Past Ghosts\nBerkeley, California.\nEvening sunlight slanted through the tall windows of a quiet suburban home, painting amber streaks across polished hardwood floors. The soft sound of a jazz record filled the living room, blending with the gentle laughter of a family.\nBenjamin Scott sat on the couch, his arm wrapped around his wife, Sofia. Her long dark hair brushed against his shoulder as their three-year-old son wriggled happily in her lap, squealing whenever Ben tickled his tiny ribs. The boy’s laughter was the kind that could melt the coldest heart. It was pure, infectious and untouched by the world’s noise.\nBen smiled warmly, eyes creasing at the corners, enjoying the simple and peaceful life he now has.\nSofia brushed a stray lock from her son’s forehead and looked up at her husband. \"You’re smiling again. That’s a good sign.\"\n\"Am I not allowed to?\" Ben chuckled, kissing her temple. \"I’m a happy man, Sofie. You and this little rascal are all I need.\"\nThe boy giggled and reached for Ben’s face, small fingers pressing against his stubble. Ben laughed and caught his hand. \"Hey, easy there, soldier.\"\nThe moment was perfect — until the television stole their attention.\nThe news anchor’s voice cut into the room like a sharp edge. \"Breaking news tonight from Los Angeles International Airport. The privately owned Airbus A380 has just landed, following what is now being called the most extraordinary civilian flight in recent history.\"\nBen sighed, ready to tune it out.\nBillionaires and their toys, he muttered.\nIt wasn’t his concern though. But when the anchor’s tone changed, he suddenly found himself curious.\n\"Sources confirm the aircraft is fully registered under a single individual. Details remain sealed, but social media reports claim the owner is... just eighteen years old.\"\nSofia raised an eyebrow in shock. \"Eighteen? That can’t be right.\"\nBen chuckled, shaking his head. \"People on the internet will say anything for clicks.\"\nThe broadcast switched to live footage — the black giant of an aircraft gliding across the runway, sunlight shimmering off its platinum streaks.\nThe anchor’s voice trembled with awe, as she spoke, \"Viewers, what you’re seeing right now is not a movie. That aircraft belongs to a young man named Liam Scott.\"\nThe picture of familiar young man was displayed, causing Ben to freeze.\nThe name hit him like a bullet through glass. He blinked once, twice — but the image didn’t go away. The camera zoomed in, showing the hangar doors sliding open and the sleek Maybach rolling out.\nSofia’s voice was soft, distant. \"Ben? You okay?\"\nHe didn’t answer. His hand, resting on the armrest, trembled slightly. His throat tightened as he leaned closer to the screen.\n\"Son?\" he whispered, voice breaking. \"That’s... my son?\"\nSofia looked at him, startled. \"What did you say?\"\nHe barely heard her. His gaze was locked on the screen, the image at the top left corner and the name echoing again, and again in his mind. Liam Scott.\n\"After all these years...\" a laugh escaped him. The laugh was brittle and half-choked.\nBen sank back against the couch, eyes distant. The weight of memory pressed down like a physical thing. For the first time in a long time, the ghosts of his past had finally clawed their way to the surface.\nCharlotte — the woman he once loved and the woman who shattered him.\nHe had met her when she was young, reckless, full of dreams. She was radiant then — wild hair, fiery laughter, eyes that could make a man forget himself.\nThey’d married in haste, out of passion more than reason. But it didn’t last. The first affair had crushed him and he second had broke something deeper in him. His faith, his pride and his capacity to forgive.\nHe remembered that night as if it were yesterday. The rain hammering against the windows. Charlotte’s trembling confession. And the child she was carrying then — the one she swore he could still love, could still raise as his own.\nHe had tried. God help him, he had tried. After Liam was born, he’d looked into that his face and told himself he could love him, no matter the blood. But when the betrayal came again, something inside him died.\nHe had left that night. Walked out with nothing but his coat, his wallet, and the cold certainty that his love for her had turned to ash.\nThat was four years ago.\nNow, that boy — the one he had once carried in his arms — was on every screen in the world. An eighteen years old who is the owner of a private jet that nations couldn’t afford.\nBen exhaled, a shuddering breath that carried years of guilt and disbelief.\n\"Liam... Forgive me, son,\" he whispered inwardly. \"I hope you’re happy. I hope you made it.\"\nSofia placed a hand over his. \"Ben... is it really him?\"\n\"Yeah,\" He nodded faintly.\nThere was silence for a long moment. The television droned on, reporters shouting over crowds, helicopters circling above LAX. Ben’s gaze never left the screen.\nHe whispered under his breath, \"You’ve done well, son. Better than I ever could have imagined.\"\nSofia studied him quietly, then asked softly, \"Will you reach out?\"\nHe shook his head. \"No. I forfeited that right the day I left. I walked away. He doesn’t owe me anything.\"\nSofia smiled and squeezed his hand gently.\nBen smiled to himself. It was faint wistful, proud and aching smile. Then he exhaled, long and heavy, and shook his head, as he decided not to focus on the past anymore.\nCharlotte and Liam are old ghosts. The mistakes he’d buried. He had no right to walk back into that world. Not after so many years.\nHe turned the volume down, lifted his son onto his lap, and kissed the boy’s hair.\n***\nBeverly Grove.\nElsewhere in Los Angeles, in the cramped servant quarters of a Beverly Grove mansion, Charlotte sat hunched on her narrow bed, her nails digging into her palms as she scrolled through her phone.\nHer son’s name — her son’s name — was everywhere. On every posts, videos and headlines.\n\"Private A380 owned by 18-year-old Liam Scott.\"\nHer breath hitched, as she scrolled again, watching the footage in disbelief. The jet, the crowd and the government escort.\n\"That’s my boy,\" she whispered, trembling. \"That’s my son.\"\nShe laughed — a high, nervous sound — but there was bitterness behind it, too. Years of resentment, regret, and greed tangled together. \"You see, Charlotte? He made it. You raised a genius.\"\nBut her laughter faded as quickly as it came. Her hands clenched tighter around the phone, as she muttered, \"And he forgot me.\"\nShe bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. \"He forgot his mother.\"\nHer thoughts spiraled fast — too fast. She remembered the years of struggle, the late nights and the bills piling up. The men she’d served, the humiliation she’d endured just to keep a roof over her head. She had done all of it for survival... and, at least in her mind, for him.\nShe had given him life, carrying him for nine long months. She had sacrificed everything.\nAnd now that he was rich beyond imagination, she deserved her share.\nHer face hardened. \"He wouldn’t have all this without me. He owes me.\"\nA voice interrupted her thoughts.\n\"Charlotte!\" A heavy thump sounded at the door before it swung open, revealing a half-naked man — gray hair slicked back, a towel slung around his waist, and a drunken smirk curling his lips.\n\"What are you doing? You’re supposed to be—\"\nThe slap came before he could finish.\nIt cracked through the room, loud and clean. He staggered back, hand flying to his cheek.\n\"Don’t touch me,\" Charlotte spat, eyes blazing. \"Don’t you ever touch me again, you disgusting pig.\"\nThe man blinked, stunned, then laughed. \"Ah, so the kitten has claws now? What’s gotten into you?\"\n\"What’s gotten into me?\" she hissed, snatching up her torn uniform from the chair. \"I don’t need this anymore. I don’t need you, or this house, or this life.\"\n\"Don’t tell me you found another rich fool to—\"\n\"Shut up!\" she screamed. \"My son is rich! You hear me? My son! The whole world is talking about him — Liam Scott! He’s my blood, my child!\"\nFor a moment, the man only stared. Then, slowly, his expression shifted from disbelief melting into something darker — greed.\n\"Your son, huh? Well, isn’t that something...\"\nCharlotte’s lip curled in disgust. \"You stay out of this.\"\nHe reached for her, but she jerked away, snatching a clean dress from the clothesline. \"Don’t you dare touch me.\"\n\"Charlotte—\"\nShe didn’t listen. She was already out the door, the torn uniform crumpled in her hand. She raced down the hallway, barefoot, ignoring the man’s curses echoing behind her.\nOutside, the night air hit her. It was cool and refreshing. She didn’t stop, as she threw on the dress, slipped her feet into worn sandals, and ran.\nDown the street, under the glare of neon signs, past curious onlookers and the bustling sounds of traffic. Her heart pounded with adrenaline, fury, and something dangerously close to delusion. If not delusion outrightly.\nBellemere Mansion. Her son’s mansion — that’s where she was going.\nHe might not recognize her but she would make him remember. After all, she was his mother.\nAnd mothers, she thought bitterly, always deserved their due.",

      "content": "Chapter 174: Past Ghosts (2), The Woman At The Gate\nMorning sunlight spilled through the tall windows of Bellemere Mansion, painting soft gold over the marble floors.\nLiam stirred awake in his bed. For a moment, he simply lay there, eyes on the ceiling, listening to the silence. Then, as the weight of the morning settled in, a calm smile spread across his face.\nAnother day. Another sign-in.\nHe sat up, stretched lazily, and rolled his shoulders. His body felt light, rested, and his mind clear. He swung his legs off the bed and stood, heading straight for the bathroom.\nThe water was warm, cascading over his skin, washing away sleep. When he was done, he dried himself, slipped into clean clothes, a simple, dark casual wear, and picked up his phone, and Lucid from the bedside table.\nAs soon as he put on the device, Lucy’s soft voice chimed in his mind.\n\"Good morning, Master. You have a new credit alert from Silverstone Realty. Amount: 1.5 million dollars.\"\nLiam paused mid-step, then smiled faintly.\n\"Mr. Newman works fast,\" he murmured.\nThe funds were from the rent for the residential complex building he asked them to manage for him. He pocketed the phone and Lucid, then left the room.\nThe stairs gleamed as he descended, one hand trailing along the polished mahogany rail. Evelyn was already waiting near the base, as always.\n\"Good morning, sir,\" she greeted.\n\"Good morning, Evelyn,\" Liam said warmly.\nHe crossed the hall to the dining area, where the two girls were already preparing the table. The smell of breakfast filled the air.\n\"Breakfast is ready, sir,\" Mira said softly, setting down the last dish.\n\"Thank you.\" Liam took his seat, and they stepped back quietly.\nHe ate without rush, his mind turning over the day ahead. There was nothing urgent waiting for him — at least, nothing on Earth. Lucid will be delivered to the tech reviewers in two days time, so nothing on that end.\nHis main task for the day lay elsewhere: in the Great Yan Empire, where his next sign-in awaited.\nHe finished up his meal, thanked the girls again, and stood up.\n\"Thank you girls,\" he said, before heading back upstairs.\nWhen the door to his room closed, the calm expression on his face didn’t change. In the next instant, he was gone.\nHe reappeared in the VIP suite of the inn in the Great Yan Empire. He did a light stretch, straightening himself, then said the words.\n\"System, sign in.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host. You received 50,000 Gold Coins.]\n[You received 500 Low Grade Spirit Stones.]\n***\n\"Not bad,\" he said, a smile spread across his face.\nFifty thousand gold coins — in this world, that was wealth enough to purchase estates. And five hundred spirit stones... even outer disciples of minor sects would take a year to amass that much.\nHis smile widened as he pocketed the rewards without ceremony. He didn’t think too much about the rewards. What he was focused on, was on tomorrow’s sign-in, which would be his first weekly sign-in in this universe. He wondered what sort of rewards he would receive and he hoped that it would be something that can help him to cultivate.\nHe left the suite, space rippling around him as he returned to the Dimensional Space.\nLiam sighed softly and decided to leave, as he vanished from the suite and appeared in the Dimensional Space.\nImmediately, his eyes widened slightly.\nWhere before there had been nothing but an empty plains, there now stood a sprawling complex — a vast structure that stretched far beyond what he could see from the ground.\nCurious, Liam rose into the air, his figure cutting across the horizon.\nBelow him, hundreds of automated machines worked in perfect coordination — massive construction drones, humanoid bots, and vehicles moving silently. The structure they were building resembled a colossal manufacturing hub, and its design was sleek.\nLucy’s voice echoed in his mind.\n\"This is the workshop — the manufacturing hub. It will house the molecular assembler and molecular analyzer. And it will be where everything will be built and created in the future.\"\nLiam nodded slowly, as he watched as beams of alloy were welded together by streams of plasma.\n\"You’re doing good work,\" he said.\n\"Thank you, Master.\"\nSatisfied, he descended slowly and returned to his room on Earth. He collapsed back onto his bed, arms folded behind his head, eyes tracing the lines of the ceiling.\nA soft ping drew his attention. It was a message in his group chat and Kristopher had tagged him.\n\"You busy?\" He asked.\nLiam was about to reply when the faint sound of Evelyn’s footsteps reached his ears, and a knock followed.\n\"Sir,\" she said through the door, her tone polite but uncertain. \"There’s someone at the gate asking to see you.\"\nLiam frowned lightly. \"Who?\"\n\"She didn’t say. An older woman.\"\nBefore he could respond, Lucy’s calm voice filled his mind.\n\"Master, I’ve patched the gate feed to your view.\"\nIn his vision, a window flickered open, showing the CCTV footage from the mansion’s front gate. Standing there, under the morning sun, was a woman who looked as if she had come from another world — clothes worn, hair disheveled, eyes sunken but burning with something between desperation and madness.\nLiam’s expression froze for a moment, as he recognised the person.\nCharlotte. The woman who had given him life and had also abandoned him every sense that mattered.\nFor a moment, he said nothing. The silence stretched until even Evelyn’s voice seemed hesitant. \"Sir?\"\nLiam’s first instinct was to order Evelyn to send her away. To have her removed from the property and never allowed near him again. But he knew she wouldn’t listen to anyone else.\nHe stood slowly. \"I’ll handle it.\"\nHe stepped out of the room, Evelyn falling into step behind him. Downstairs, Mason and Nick were already waiting by the door.\n\"Someone’s at the gate,\" Mason said.\n\"I know,\" Liam replied. \"Let’s go.\"\nThe morning air was cool as they walked down the long stone path toward the gates. When they reached the front gate, Liam stopped a few paces away.\nThe woman lifted her head. Her eyes lit up bright with a trembling, almost feverish light.\n\"Liam...\" she started, her voice breaking. \"My son—\"\nBut Liam’s voice cut across hers, calm and cold.\n\"Turn back,\" he said quietly. \"Go home. Whatever you came here for, forget it. Don’t come back.\"\nCharlotte blinked, her mouth hanging open. \"W-What? Liam, I’m your mother. You can’t—\"\nBut he had already turned away. His expression didn’t waver, not even for a second.\nShe took a step forward, reaching for the gate. \"Don’t you dare walk away from me! Liam! I am your mother!\"\nHer words echoed across the courtyard, shrill and shaking. But Liam didn’t stop. He didn’t shout or argue. He simply kept walking.\nWhen he reached the front steps, he turned slightly, his voice low but firm. \"Mason, take care of it. I don’t want to hear her again.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Mason said quietly.\nCharlotte’s voice rose again, furious and broken. \"Liam! You ungrateful—!\"\nLiam didn’t look back, as he walked through the doors of the mansion, with an unreadable expression on his face.\nInside, Evelyn lingered by the staircase, uncertain whether to speak.\n\"Evelyn,\" he said softly.\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\"Next time she comes, don’t pay any attention to her.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nHe walked up the stairs, the light from the tall windows casting long shadows behind him. By the time he reached the top of the stairs, the noise outside had faded entirely.\nAt the gate, Charlotte’s cries had broken into silence.\nAnd inside, Liam’s world returned to its usual calmness, as though nothing had happened at all.\nBut deep down, under that calm, something in him had hardened because whatever tie had remained between him and his past, it was gone now.",

      "content": "Chapter 175: Having Friends Over (Bonus Chapter)\nWalking back into his room, Liam collapsed onto his bed, letting out a slow exhale.\nWith the ever-present weight of public attention, he could feel the world outside tightening its focus on him like a magnifying glass under sunlight.\nStill, he wasn’t one to dwell on things he couldn’t change. Not that he minded the second part in the first place.\nHe picked up his phone and turned his attention to the message from Kristopher. He smiled faintly and typed a short reply.\n\"Not really. What’s up?\"\nThe reply came almost instantly.\nKristopher: \"We’re thinking of visiting. You home?\"\nLiam smiled to himself when he saw this. He figured that they would probably be curious about yesterday but he didn’t expect them to want to visit immediately, especially with how busy they all are. Well, he didn’t mind them visiting.\n\"Yeah, sure. Come over,\" he replied.\nHe barely had time to set his phone down before the next message popped up.\n\"Perfect. We’re already on our way.\"\nLiam chuckled softly. He leaned back on the bed, hands behind his head. He could already imagine the questions waiting for him. He didn’t mind. If anything, he was amused.\nThey were probably dying to see the cars, maybe even the jet if they could. But that last part wouldn’t be possible. Something else was already moving toward that end — something Liam had been expecting since the moment the aircraft first left the ground.\nThe U.S. government.\nEven now, somewhere in the invisible web of satellite feeds and intelligence gathering and briefings, his name was being tossed across tables. Lucy had continued to intercept several encrypted data channels — Homeland, FAA, Treasury, even CIA chatter. They were coordinating, analyzing, and preparing to move.\nLiam wasn’t worried. If anything, he almost looked forward to it. He knew the worst they can do, was to ground the aircraft for a maximum duration of 48 hours. They will use that time to inspect the aircraft but they won’t find anything beyond the fact that it’s a luxury aircraft. But they can’t do anything beyond that.\nDuring his familiarisation tour of the aircraft, Liam came to realise that features like the satellite feeds, satcom channels and the countermeasures are actually hidden. Besides him — and now Lucy — no else can activate them or have any idea the aircraft has them.\nLiam smiled to himself, as his thoughts drifted back to his friends’ visit. For a brief moment, he considered giving them each a Lucid device as a surprise. He imagined their reactions — disbelief, awe, and endless excitement.\nBut he dismissed the idea almost immediately, as Lucid wasn’t ready for uncontrolled exposure. Every move right now had to be precise.\nThe launch was designed to unfold in waves: first, the tech reviewers — the loudest and most trusted voices in the digital world. Then, two weeks later, the gaming streamers, whose millions of fans would amplify the product overnight. That sequence would ignite a viral chain reaction. By the time the general public could get their hands on Lucid, demand would already exceed production.\nGiving out even one unit early could ruin that carefully built plan.\nBesides, he didn’t want Lucid’s success tied to his name. The world already saw him as an anomaly — a billionaire teen wrapped in mystery. If the headlines shifted to \"Liam Scott’s Revolutionary Product,\" it would distort the story. People would buy for the hype, not the innovation.\nNo. Lucid had to rise on its own merit — not on the back of his identity.\nHe rolled over, staring at the ceiling. The world thought his wealth was the shocking part. But to him, money was just a number. The true thrill came from creation — from watching something impossible become real.\n\"All this noise because of a plane,\" he muttered and sighed softly.\nIt was true. If he’d flown a Gulfstream or even a Boeing 777, the world wouldn’t have cared this much. But the A380... that was something else entirely. The largest passenger aircraft in the world, once thought impossible to own privately. That alone had made him headline material.\nHe chuckled quietly, remembering how he got it as one of the rewards from his third weekly sign-in.\nHe had noticed that the sign-in rewards was kicked up a notch after his first weekly sign-in. He wondered if it will be the same as in the cultivation world.\nLiam shook his head lightly and decided not to think about it anymore. He stretched his arms, deciding it was time to move. He had guests coming over.\nHe stood, straightened his shirt, and walked downstairs. It has been a while since he cooked for himself and since they are visiting, he decided to treat them like the last time.\nAs he entered the kitchen, Evelyn turned from the counter, surprise flickering across her face.\n\"Sir?\" she asked, as though unsure she was seeing correctly.\nLiam smiled. \"Don’t mind me. I just want to make something for my friends.\"\nClara and Mira, who had been setting the breakfast dishes aside, froze. Mira’s eyes widened slightly. \"Sir... you’re cooking?\"\nWhat she actually wanted to ask was if he can cook, but she quickly changed her question.\n\"Yes. It’s been a while,\" he said simply, rolling up his sleeves.\nThe three women exchanged glances — a silent mixture of shock, curiosity, and mild panic.\nClara took a hesitant step forward. \"Sir, please, allow us. You shouldn’t trouble yourself—\"\nEvelyn stopped her with a subtle gesture. \"Let him,\" she said softly. \"If he wants to, let him.\"\nLiam smiled faintly when he caught the exchange. \"Relax. I’m not planning on burning the kitchen down.\"\nHe opened the refrigerator, scanned the contents, and began pulling out ingredients: eggs, onions, fresh vegetables, marinated chicken.\nWithin minutes, he moved with the ease of someone who had done this many times before. The knife rhythmically struck the cutting board, the sound blending with the faint hum of the stove’s ventilation.\nThe girls hovered near the counter, watching him work. The calmness and the precision in his movements surprised them — every cut, every motion was deliberate.\n\"Evelyn,\" he said without turning, \"pass me the rosemary.\"\nShe did so wordlessly, still studying him.\n\"Thank you.\"\nTime flowed quietly, measured by the sizzle of oil and the fragrance of garlic and herbs filling the air. Liam worked efficiently, occasionally humming a song to himself.\nThrough his telekinetic sense, he felt the faint vibration of engines as two cars, speeding in tandem, turning off the main road toward Bellemere’s gate.\nHe wiped his hands on a towel just as Mason appeared in the doorway.\n\"Sir,\" Mason reported, \"there are a few people at the gate. They said they’re your friends.\"\nLiam nodded. \"Let them in.\"\nMason inclined his head. \"Yes, sir.\"\nA few seconds later, the low sound of engines reached the house.\nLiam smiled slightly and turned to the girls. \"Watch this for me, will you? Don’t let it burn.\"\nClara nodded quickly. \"Yes, sir.\"\nLeaving the kitchen, Liam walked through the hall toward the foyer. The polished floors reflected the sunlight streaming through the tall windows. The heavy double doors opened just as he reached them.\nMatt stepped in first, grinning from ear to ear. Behind him were Kristopher, Harper, Alex and the girls.\n\"Bro,\" Matt laughed, throwing his hands out, \"do you have any idea what you’ve done to the internet?\"\nLiam raised an eyebrow, amused. \"Good to see you too.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 176: Having Friends Over (2)\nLiam greeted the boys first — Matt, Kristopher, Alex, and Harper — shaking hands and exchanging brief hugs. The girls followed behind them, smiling politely, though Liam quickly noticed the look in their eyes.\nAll four of them — Stacy, Lana, Kristy, Elise — were staring at him as if they’d just seen a myth step off a screen and turn into a person. Their expressions were a mix of disbelief, curiosity, and awe, the kind of look people wore when reality didn’t quite line up with what they knew of the world.\nLiam smiled faintly, choosing not to address it. \"Sit down,\" he said casually. \"Give me a few minutes. I was in the middle of making something for you guys.\"\nThe boys’ faces lit up instantly.\n\"No way,\" Matt grinned, elbowing Kristopher. \"He’s cooking? Bro, that’s what I’m talking about! I’ve been dreaming about that meal from last time.\"\nAlex raised his hands dramatically. \"Finally! I’ve been surviving on campus food for days now.\"\nLiam chuckled at their excitement. \"Good thing you came hungry, then.\"\nThe girls smiled shyly. Kristy spoke first, \"Thanks, Liam.\"\nHe nodded and returned the smile. \"Make yourselves comfortable. I won’t take long.\"\nAs he turned to head back toward the kitchen, Matt called out, \"Hey, before you vanish, can we see your garage? Just for a minute, bro. You can’t invite us here and not show us the holy land.\"\nLiam hesitated for half a second, then smiled and shrugged. \"Sure. Why not?\"\nHe led them toward a set of interior doors on the left side of the hall.\nAt the garage door, Liam placed his thumb against the biometric scanner. A faint click followed, and the heavy door unlocked with a soft hiss. One by one, ceiling lights flickered on, illuminating the space inside.\nEven before the door had finished sliding open, Matt let out a stunned gasp.\n\"Holy... Oh my days!\" he shouted, the words echoing through the hall.\nThe others pushed forward, craning their necks as they saw the lineup.\nInside, the garage gleamed like a private museum. The Vision Mercedes-Maybach 6 Cabriolet Imperium sat nearest to the door. Beside it stood the McLaren P1 LM-X. There was also the Lamborghini Temerario, the Ferrari, the Aston Martin Vantage GT3 and the rest.\nMatt stumbled forward as if hypnotized. \"This isn’t a garage. This is a dream.\"\nKristopher circled the Maybach, whispering to himself. \"He wasn’t kidding. That’s not even supposed to exist.\"\nLiam laughed quietly. \"Have fun.\"\nHe left them there, their voices bouncing off the walls — gasps, laughter, shouts of disbelief — as he walked back toward the kitchen.\nBy the time he re-entered, the smell of sizzling chicken and herbs filled the air. Evelyn, Mira, and Clara looked up at him from the counter, their faces showing a mix of surprise and confusion.\n\"Sir?\" Evelyn asked carefully, as though unsure whether she should interfere.\nLiam smiled. \"Don’t worry. I’m finishing up. You can help with the plating when it’s ready.\"\nMira blinked, exchanging a look with Clara. \"Sir, are you sure you don’t want us to—\"\nHe cut her off with a gentle wave. \"Relax. I’ve got this.\"\nHe washed his hands, rolled up his sleeves, and got back to work. The rhythm returned easily.\nThe girls hovered silently nearby, watching him with the kind of fascination reserved for something entirely out of the ordinary.\n\"He cooks,\" Mira whispered under her breath, earning a quiet elbow from Clara.\nTwenty-five minutes later, the dishes were ready — roasted chicken glazed with honey and herbs, creamy pasta with vegetables, and soft dinner rolls brushed with melted butter. Liam stood back for a moment, satisfied, then wiped his hands on a towel.\n\"Serve it,\" he said.\nThe three women nodded, still half in disbelief, and began carrying the trays to the dining hall.\nWhen Liam stepped into the living area, the boys were just emerging from the garage. Their eyes were wide, faces split into grins that were part joy, part shock.\nMatt was the first to reach him. \"What the actual hell do you have in there?\"\nLiam smiled mildly. \"Cars.\"\nMatt blinked at him. \"Cars? Just cars?\"\nKristopher threw up his hands. \"Bro, one of those is worth more than our entire apartment block.\"\nAlex nodded fiercely. \"The Maybach alone looks like it was forged in heaven.\"\nLiam laughed softly, shrugging. \"They’re just machines. Beautiful ones, sure. But still machines.\"\nMatt gave him a playful glare. \"You’re calling our dream cars ’just machines.’ That’s offensive.\"\nKristopher shook his head. \"This is what it’s like to live in another tax bracket, huh? We’re here calculating gas prices, and this man’s daily driver looks like it belongs in a sci-fi movie.\"\nLiam chuckled, but before he could respond, all three boys leaned forward, eyes glinting.\n\"Alright,\" Matt said, crossing his arms. \"Spill it.\"\nLiam tilted his head, pretending not to understand. \"Spill what?\"\n\"The plane, man,\" Kristopher said. \"The A380. You can’t just fly a freaking flying palace out of LAX, go viral worldwide, and not tell us what it’s like!\"\nHarper nodded eagerly. \"We saw everything online — the hangar, the escort cars, the whole circus. Dude, that’s insane.\"\nLiam laughed quietly, shaking his head. \"You want to know what it can do?\"\n\"Obviously!\" Matt said, throwing his hands up. \"We’re dying here.\"\nBefore he could answer, Evelyn appeared at the doorway. \"Sir, the food is ready.\"\nLiam nodded. \"Perfect timing. Come on, everyone. Let’s eat first.\"\nThe group followed him to the dining hall. The aroma hit them immediately — rich, savory, mouthwatering. The table was laid beautifully, dishes steaming under the soft light.\nMatt inhaled deeply. \"Oh my god, this smells amazing.\"\n\"Smells like heaven,\" Alex said, pulling out a chair.\nThe girls smiled, clearly impressed once again at the fact that Liam can cook.\n\"Thanks, Liam,\" Stacy said this time.\nHe smiled, taking his seat. \"You’re welcome.\"\nAs soon as they started eating, the table filled with quiet sounds — clinking cutlery, murmured compliments, and the occasional appreciative groan.\n\"Liam,\" Kristopher said between bites, \"this is incredible.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\nMatt pointed his fork at him. \"Now talk. The plane.\"\nLiam set his glass down, leaning back slightly. \"It’s... comfortable,\" he began with a faint smile. \"Custom interior. Private suites, gym, lounge, conference area, even a full entertainment deck. It’s powered by four Rolls-Royce Trent engines. Range — fifteen thousand kilometers nonstop. It’s self-sufficient for days if it needs to be.\"\nThe room went silent as they listened, eyes wide.\nKristopher finally muttered, \"Wow! That’s not a plane. That’s a floating city.\"\nMatt whistled in a low tone. \"You’re telling me you can literally live in the sky.\"\n\"Basically,\" Liam said, smiling faintly.\n\"Wow...\" Harper leaned back. \"No wonder the internet’s losing its mind.\"\nThe next moment, Liam got a message from Lucy informing him that the US government was about to announce that the A380 will be grounded. Liam smiled slightly, as he had been waiting for it.\nThe boys were still processing his words when Kristopher’s phone buzzed. He frowned and glanced down at the screen. \"Wait... what?\"\nHe read the message once, then again, and looked up slowly.\nAt the same time, the other boys’ phones buzzed too. They all checked — and their expressions shifted from confusion to shock.\n\"Bro,\" Matt said carefully, \"they’re saying your plane’s been grounded.\"\nLiam didn’t even blink, as he said softly, \"Yeah. I was expecting that.\"\nA second later, his own phone began to vibrate. He looked at the screen and it was a call from Daniel.\nHe answered, putting the phone to his ear.\n\"Sir,\" Daniel’s voice came, tight with concern, \"they’ve grounded the aircraft. Homeland and FAA just issued the directive.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 177: Having Friends Over (3)\n\"Sir,\" Daniel’s voice came, tight with concern, \"they’ve grounded the aircraft. Homeland and FAA just issued the directive. They’re citing ’procedural verification’ — but it’s clearly political.\"\n\"I was already expecting it,\" Liam said, in a cool and unbothered tone.\nHe had already had Lucy go through the aircraft’s papers and it was impeccably clean. The procurement was legitimate and the payments reconciled. Ownership flowed through a Delaware holding company, under another holding, under another — seven layers deep across Luxembourg, Singapore, and the Caymans.\nHe’d asked Lucy to trace the umbrella entity that sat above the holdings, but even she couldn’t penetrate it.\nThis would be even worse for the U.S. regulators, because if the try to pierce the veil, they’d face a tangle of jurisdictions, privacy statutes, and sealed NDAs. By the time they reached the final layer — which they won’t, the trail would dissolve into a sovereign-level trust structure designed to be untouchable.\n\"Sir, I’ll take care of everything from over here,\" he said. \"I’ll release a statement in a couple of the right papers — Bloomberg, Reuters, maybe the Journal and a few more. It’ll frame this as a standard FAA inspection, nothing more. There will be no speculation or drama.\"\nLiam leaned back in his chair, saying nothing, only listening.\n\"Also,\" Daniel continued, his voice lowering slightly, \"I’d advise against any public appearance for the next forty-eight hours. No interviews, no casual sightings. The less the media can photograph or quote you right now, the faster the noise will die down. Let the papers carry the story, not your face.\"\n\"Understood,\" Liam said calmly, after a brief pause.\n\"And one more thing, sir,\" he said. \"No vehicles from Bellemere leave the property for the next forty-eight hours — especially the Maybach or the McLaren. They’re both under too much scrutiny right now. One photo of either car in public and the headlines start all over again.\"\nLiam’s brows lifted faintly. \"So even the Rolls?\"\n\"Even the Rolls?\" Liam asked.\n\"Only if it’s absolutely necessary,\" Daniel replied. \"If you absolutely need to go anywhere, I’ll have a low-profile SUV sent over — unmarked, standard plates, tinted, looks like any other executive transport. We keep your signature cars off the streets until the noise dies down.\"\n\"You can still see people, sir. Have your friends over, keep the routine normal — just not outside those gates. The moment a car leaves Bellemere, or someone catches you on camera, the press will turn it into a circus. Let the attention burn itself out first.\"\nHe paused, then added quietly, \"Right now, every lens in Los Angeles is pointed at you. For forty-eight hours, we let them stare — and show them nothing. The public already associates your cars with wealth; right now, what we need is silence. Let them chase shadows.\"\n\"Good work, Daniel,\" Liam said, with a satisfied smile.\n\"It’s my job and the Family Office’s purpose to keep you untouchable,\" Daniel said simply. \"And right now, that means keeping every camera guessing. I’ll handle the coordination with the aircraft’s crew members and Family Office legal teams. By the time they finish their so-called inspection, everything will look routine.\"\n\"I knew I could count on you, Daniel,\" Liam smiled faintly.\n\"Always, sir,\" Daniel replied. \"I’ll call once the statements go live.\"\nThe call ended, and Liam turned to face his friends that were staring at him, with impressed look on their faces.\nThey were impressed — not just by the scale of his life, but by how calmly he carried it.\nEven now, with his name dominating global headlines and the U.S. government temporarily grounding his plane, Liam looked as if he hadn’t a care in the world.\nThe boys glanced at one another, then sighed collectively, the tension bleeding out of their shoulders.\n\"Damn, man,\" Alex muttered, half-laughing. \"That’s a shame, though. I was hoping we’d get to take a peek inside the plane.\"\n\"Same,\" Kristopher said, nodding. \"You can’t just tease us with a flying palace and expect us to wait.\"\nLiam chuckled softly, resting his elbows on the table. \"You’ll get your chance soon. It’s just a routine inspection. Forty-eight hours, maybe less. Once that’s done, we’ll take a little trip together — the sky’s all yours.\"\nThat earned him four identical looks of pure disbelief.\n\"Wait... you mean it?\" Matt leaned forward, eyes wide.\nLiam smiled faintly. \"Of course. You think I’d keep it to myself?\"\n\"Holy—\" Harper grinned so hard it almost hurt. \"You’re serious. We’re actually going to fly in that thing?\"\n\"If you want to,\" Liam said, sipping from his glass, completely unfazed by their excitement.\nThe table buzzed with energy instantly. They were talking over each other, laughing, throwing exaggerated plans they have no intention of going ahead with into the air — world tours, sky parties, you name it.\nFor a brief moment, the room felt almost normal. Just friends joking around, forgetting that one of them happened to own the most expensive aircraft in the world.\nThen Kristopher lowered his voice, glancing sideways at Liam. \"So... I guess the cars are off-limits too, huh?\"\nLiam gave a small nod, lips curving in amusement. \"Yeah. Not today.\"\n\"Figures,\" Alex sighed dramatically. \"Guess the universe doesn’t want us touching anything that costs more than a small country.\"\nMatt grinned. \"Oh well, we’ll survive. I’m sure Mister Billionaire here has more cool things we can do around the mansion.\"\nLiam tilted his head, pretending to think. \"Hmm. Maybe the game room?\"\nThat did it. All four boys perked up immediately.\n\"Game room?\" Harper echoed. \"You’ve been hiding that from us?\"\n\"I didn’t think you could handle it,\" he said, with a playful smile.\n\"Oh, it’s on now,\" Kristopher said, pointing at him with mock menace. \"Show us before I combust.\"\nLiam laughed. \"Finish eating first. Then I’ll show you.\"\nThe boys dove into their meals with renewed vigor, exchanging playful glares as if speed would get them there faster.\nAcross the table, the girls smiled quietly, eating at a slower pace. They couldn’t help but giggled softly, when they saw how the boys were acting.\nThey too had been curious about the aircraft, secretly hoping for a glimpse. But with the grounding order in place, they knew it was impossible — for now. Still, they didn’t mind.\nThere was something about being here — in Liam’s calm orbit — that made the chaos outside feel distant.\n***\nAfter the meal, the girls stayed back to chat with each other and the maids, but one can already guess what they want to chat about.\nLiam led the boys down a side corridor. The hallway was wide, lined with polished stone and dim golden lights that reflected across the glass-paneled walls.\nWhen they reached the heavy double doors at the end, Liam pressed his palm against the biometric lock. A quiet chime sounded, and the door slid open with a soft hiss.\n\"Welcome,\" Liam said, stepping aside. \"To my second-favorite room.\"\nThe boys stopped in the doorway and then the noise hit.\n\"Holy—\" Matt breathed out, eyes widening as they took in the space.\nIt was enormous!",

      "content": "Chapter 178: First Weekly Sign-in In Another Universe\nThe gaming and recreation room stretched across what could’ve been an entire floor. A pair of billiard tables gleamed under pendant lights. To the side stood rows of high-end consoles — PS5s, a retro arcade corner, and even a racing simulator rig shaped like an actual cockpit.\nOne wall was a screen — no, the screen — spanning nearly twenty feet, displaying shifting auroras as a dynamic wallpaper.\nThe opposite side was lined with a bar counter, snack dispensers, and a sleek lounge setup that looked pulled from a luxury penthouse suite.\nKristopher whistled low. \"You’ve got to be kidding me.\"\nHarper was already drifting toward the console area, eyes scanning the collection like a kid on Christmas morning.\n\"Bro, this is heaven. Look at this setup!\"\nHe picked up a controller, grinning. \"Alright, who’s about to get wrecked?\"\nAlex grinned. \"You? Obviously. I call first match.\"\nHarper laughed. \"You wish.\"\nMeanwhile, Kristopher turned to the billiards tables. \"Anyone up for a round?\"\nLiam nodded, picking up a cue. \"I’m in.\"\nMatt followed, rubbing his hands together. \"Let’s see if you’re as good at pool as you are at being a billionaire.\"\nLiam smirked. \"I’m not sure you want that answer.\"\nAs Matt racked the balls, he glanced up. \"By the way, Adrian Vale called me earlier. Said he wants to apologize for what happened at the party.\"\nLiam raised an eyebrow, faintly amused. \"Apologize? For what?\"\nMatt shrugged. \"You know how he gets — acting like an idiot, coming on too hard at you out of curiosity. I told him you didn’t take it seriously, but he insisted.\"\nLiam lined up his shot, the cue clicking softly against the ball. \"Don’t bother. Anyone who wants to use you to get to me isn’t worth your time.\"\nMatt looked at him for a second, then nodded. \"Yeah... that’s what I figured.\"\nKristopher added, \"Speaking of time — my phone’s been blowing up nonstop since yesterday. Calls, messages, even reporters. Everyone’s suddenly ’remembered’ they’re my best friend.\"\nMatt barked a laugh. \"Same here. You’d think we just won the lottery.\"\nHarper, from across the room, called out between rounds of FIFA. \"That’s because we basically did! You realize people think we’re, like, part of Liam’s secret billionaire entourage now?\"\nLiam shook his head, chuckling. \"You guys are overthinking it.\"\nKristopher leaned on his cue, smirking. \"Says the guy who made every news outlet on Earth go into cardiac arrest.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Matt said, feigning exasperation. \"You drop a private A380 out of nowhere, go viral in five continents, and we’re overthinking?\"\nLiam grinned, unbothered. \"It’s just a plane.\"\nKristopher groaned. \"You hear this man? ’Just a plane.’ It’s a flying mansion, Liam.\"\nMatt pointed at him accusingly. \"Show-off.\"\nLiam laughed quietly and took his shot — a clean strike, two balls pocketed effortlessly.\n\"Maybe,\" he said with a shrug. \"But at least I’m a humble one.\"\nThey played for hours, laughter and friendly banter echoing across the room. They switched from billiards to racing sims, then to the arcade corner, trying to beat each other’s scores.\nHarper and Alex’s competitive streaks turned every match into chaos, while Kristopher kept trying to trick Matt during every game setup.\nThrough it all, Liam was relaxed — smiling, laughing, content. It was a rare kind of peace, one that existed outside the spotlight.\nWhen the clock finally crept toward evening, the boys collapsed into the lounge chairs, exhausted but grinning.\n\"Man,\" Alex groaned. \"I haven’t had this much fun in forever.\"\nKristopher nodded, half-laughing. \"Yeah. For a guy who’s turning the world upside down, you sure know how to make it feel normal.\"\nLiam smiled faintly. \"I didn’t do anything\"\nThey sat in comfortable silence for a moment before Matt stood, stretching his arms. \"We should probably head out before traffic gets crazy. Thanks, man. For everything.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Harper added, clapping him on the shoulder. \"You’re a legend.\"\nLiam chuckled. \"You guys kept me company. I should be the one thanking you.\"\nThey said their goodbyes at the door, promising to visit again soon. As the sound of their engines faded down the drive, the mansion grew quiet again.\nLiam lingered by the window for a moment, watching the fading taillights disappear beyond the gates. Then he turned away, with a small content smile on his face, as he walked back to his room.\nOutside, the world was still trying to define who Liam Scott was. But here, in this brief pocket of time that he was surrounded by laughter and warmth, he was just... Liam.\nWalking into his room, Liam closed the door behind him. He crossed the room and when he reached his bed, he sank onto it with a soft exhale, the tension rolling off his shoulders.\nHis eyes lingered briefly on the faint reflection of the city lights beyond the window before closing.\nHe turned slightly, one arm draped over his chest, staring up at the ceiling.\n\"Lucy,\" he said quietly.\n\"Yes, Master?\"\n\"Any update from the government front?\"\n\"Yes. They’re escalating efforts,\" Lucy replied. \"Multiple agencies are attempting to pierce the veil of your holding structures. Homeland, Treasury, and the SEC are coordinating to identify beneficial ownership. However... their progress is slow. The legal and jurisdictional layers are holding exactly as designed.\"\n\"As for the valuation of your assets,\" She continued after a brief pause. \"They’re compiling estimates, but the data is fragmented. They’ve cross-referenced your properties, investments, and indirect holdings, but the numbers are inconsistent. No official figure has been agreed upon.\"\n\"I do hope they find whatever it is they are looking for. Which of course I doubt they would,\" he murmured, eyes still closed.\n\"They won’t find anything. If even I can’t pierce it, then they will definitely hit a wall sooner or later,\" Lucy said.\n\"Well, that’s their headache. If anything significant changes, tell me,\" he said at last.\n\"I will, Master.\"\n\"Good.\"\nHe rolled onto his side, smiling to himself faintly. He decided to clear his thoughts and sleep. Tomorrow’s a big day for him. It will be his first weekly sign-in in the cultivation world.\n***\nMorning light streamed through the wide glass windows of the master room.\nLiam stood before the mirror, buttoning his shirt. His expression was calm and clear. He had just had finished breakfast and completed his morning routine, and it was time to go to Great Yan.\nHe smiled in satisfaction at his reflection in the mirror, before taking a few steps back. The next moment, he vanished from his room and appeared in the VIP suite of the Great Yan Empire.\nHe sat down slowly on the bed, stretching his fingers once before leaning back on the bed and making himself comfortable. He exhaled softly and slowly said the word, \"System, sign-in.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, on your first weekly sign-in in another universe. You received...]",

      "content": "Chapter 179: First Weekly Sign-in In Another Universe (2)\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, on your first weekly sign-in in another universe. You received 100,000 Gold Coins]\n[You received 1,000 Low Grade Spirit Stones]\n[You received a Transcendental Grade Physique: Origin Devouring Body]\n[You received Celestial Grade Physique: Dao Array Eyes]\n[You received Origin Grade Item: Eternal Qi Vein]\n[You received a spirit beast egg]\n[Note: Host can infuse the physiques by simply thinking about it. The Qi vein has been integrated into the Dimensional Space. The spirit beast is in the Dimensional Space.]\n***\n\".....\"\nLiam was speechless. He had no idea what to say or how to react. The gold coins and spirit stones were huge rewards but the main focal point was the other rewards.\nCurious, he focused on the first reward and its description popped up.\n[\nOrigin Devouring Body\n]\nDescription: A supreme physique born from the void between creation and destruction. The Origin Devouring Body possesses the ability to absorb, refine, and assimilate all forms of energy — spiritual, elemental, divine, or cosmic.\nEffects:\nAllows the host to passively and actively devour, and convert external energies into pure cultivation essence without impurities.\nEnables absorption of bloodlines, laws, and constitutions for refinement or integration.\nGrants immunity to energy corruption, poison, or backlash during absorption.\nPassive regeneration through ambient energy.\nWarning: Excessive devouring beyond the host’s body limit will cause the host to explode.\n***\n\"So overpowered!\" Liam muttered in a low voice when he finished reading the physique’s description.\nIf he was correct, then according to the description, he can cultivate through conventional and unconventional means.\nNot only that but he can also absorb bloodlines, laws and other constitution. The bloodline absorption sounds close to what the nanites can do with trait infusion but Liam was sure that it wasn’t the same.\nHe wanted to get more information on it to understand the difference but he will have to infuse the physique first. But he still has to check out the other rewards.\nAs for the other benefits of the Origin Devouring Body, those were just added bonus. The poison immunity he didn’t need but the energy corruption and backslash, he needed very much.\nAs for the passive regeneration, that will stack on his passive regenerative traits and make it even harder for people to kill him.\nLiam smiled from ear to ear in satisfaction, as he turned his attention to the next reward. Before he read the description, he decided to confirm something from the system.\nThe grade of the Origin Devouring Body is the the same as the Myriad Armament Talent —Transcendental. He was just curious about how the grade compares to others, because he was sure that it was higher than Heaven Grade which is supposedly this minor world’s limit.\nHe didn’t need to voice out his question before the system gave him an answer.\n[Transcendental Grade is also known as Absolute Grade. The general grading system of this universe starts from Mortal, Spirit, Earth, Heaven, Saint, Immortal, Divine, Celestial, Primordial, Origin, Transcendental.]\n\"...wow!\" Liam muttered in shock, as he processed the information he just got from the system and the implications.\nIf Transcendental Grade is the highest grade in this universe, them that means that it’s probably above the Grand Dao. Was that the reason why the system didn’t want me to undergo the fusion process in the Dimensional Space, because it will sense me,\nLiam muttered to himself.\nHe felt that he was finally starting to understand everything, and the truth was that it was scary. It made him even more curious about the system’s origin. Because a power that could hand out Transcendental-grade rewards like candy had to be born from something beyond even the Grand Dao.\nLiam quickly controlled his emotions. He didn’t want to lose himself now, as he still has more important things to do.\nHe sighed softly, clearing the distracting thoughts from his mind, as he focused on the next reward.\n[\nDao Array Eyes\n]\nDescription: Eyes blessed by the fundamental patterns of existence. The Dao Array Eyes perceive the hidden formations woven into heaven and earth — the laws that bind energy, matter, and time itself.\nEffects:\nAllows direct visualization of natural and artificial arrays, runes, and Dao inscriptions.\nEnables reconstruction, replication, and deconstruction of formations upon sight.\nPassive ability: \"True Vision\" — perceives energy flow, weak points, and formation cores within a limited range.\n***\n\".....\"\nLiam was once again speechless. The Dao Array Eyes was a Celestial Grade Physique but the description makes it sound like it’s of the Primordial Grade.\n\"Allows direct visualization of natural and artificial arrays, runes, and Dao inscriptions... So, I can use this to see the law and I use the Origin Devouring Body to absorb the law. How convenient,\" he said to himself in a low voice.\nHe couldn’t help but think about something. The Origin Devouring Body allows him to devour and refine all types energy, which means he should be able to refine all types of Qi. He should also be able to refine mana and the energy native to his own universe.\n[You catch on quick, host. This is the only way I can help you to bypass the restriction.]\n\"Thanks, system. You’re the best,\" Liam smiled from ear to ear.\n[It will be advisable for you to not start cultivating immediately until after you have visited the last universe. That way, you can combine all three main energy sources and cultivation systems into one. But this will be difficult as your home universe has no cultivation system available to lower lifeforms like your species. You will need to capture a Void Beast and tame it, to understand how they passively absorbs dark energy.]\n\"Hold on, system. Thank you for believing in me but Void Beast???! You want me to capture and tame one??? I don’t know what they are but I’m very sure that they are extremely powerful. How do you want me to do that? Are you trying to get me killed?\" Liam had never felt so humbled in his life.\n[You’re right to be skeptical, host. The Void Beasts are just as terrifying as they sound but you don’t need to capture a fully grown one. You can capture a Voidling. Though it will be slightly difficult, I’m very sure that you will be able to pull it off. As for the location of the Voildling, it’s not too far from Earth. Just a bit beyond Neptune.]\n\"So, not too far from Earth is just a bit beyond Neptune? Wow! Just wow! But you’re telling me all these and still hasn’t told me what Void Beasts are,\" Liam said.\n[Void Beasts are like cosmic whales, swimming through the stars, sleeping for millions of years at a time. Their bodies are enormous — some the size of moon, others bigger than entire planets. When they breathe, their movements can cause gravitational waves, star flares, or even new nebulae to form.]\n\".....system, you’re crazy.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 180: First Weekly Sign-in In Another Universe (3)\n\".... system, you’re crazy,\" Liam muttered in a low voice.\nHe really has no idea how the system expected him to capture and tame such a creature. The system description of them was already enough to send chills down his spine.\nThe truth was that while Liam was scared out of his wits, he was actually excited at the same time. He had thought that since the laws of his universe doesn’t allow anyone to cultivate, then it was just all about science. But who would had thought that there are actually creatures like Void Beasts in his universe.\nHe really wants to see one, from afar of course, to really understand just what sort of creatures they are.\nBut all that would be for later. Right now, he can’t even fly out of Earth, much more get close to a creature that’s a massively huge cosmic whale, can swim through stars and it’s movements can cause multiple cosmic phenomenons. He knew his limits, but he also knew that he will surpass those limits soon.\nLiam sighed, as he refocused his thoughts. He still has to check out the remaining two rewards.\n\"System, I will be needing all of the information you have on Void Beasts later. And if you have information on how to tame them, that would be very appreciated,\" he said, then focused his attention on the third sign-in reward.\n[\nEternal Qi Vein\n]\nDescription: A primordial vein of living Qi drawn from the heart of the Origin River. It is a self-nourishing spiritual artery capable of generating limitless pure Qi, various elemental Qi, nurturing life, and evolving its environment through ages.\nEffects:\nIntegrated into the Dimensional Space as a core energy source.\nGenerates continuous high-purity Qi and elemental Qi in all three states of matter, sustaining cultivation, life, and growth indefinitely.\nCan expand, branch, and evolve over time, forming new Qi pathways and intersections under the ground, elemental springs, and life-bearing zones.\nIncreases the density and vitality of spiritual energy within the Dimensional Space by 10,000%.\nPassive effect: Gradual transformation of the Dimensional Space into a true world.\nNote: The Eternal Qi Vein possesses its own consciousness and will evolve as it grows older. The older it grows, the stronger its influence over life, matter, and Dao resonance becomes.\n***\n\"....\"\nLiam, one again, was left speechless. The Eternal Qi Vein was exactly what he he needed if he wants to turn the Dimensional Space into a true world. And now? It just tell into his lap. He can’t thank the system enough.\nLiam decided not to sit in the suite, thinking about it needlessly. But instead, go and see for himself what has changed in the Dimensional Space.\nHe banished from the room, appearing in the Dimensional Space. He immediately looked around, looking for what has changed but he saw nothing.\n\"I guess it will take some time for the effects to show. I will check it on it later,\" Liam said to himself.\nHe walked to the table where a big crimson egg rested on. He picked up the egg and observed it.\nThe egg was big, weighing a few kilograms at least. The shell was bright red and it was warm to the touch.\n[The egg of a Three-Legged Golden Crow.]\n\"What?!\" Liam muttered in shock.\nLiam froze where he stood, eyes wide and heartbeat pounding with disbelief. He stared down at the crimson shell resting in his palms, the faint golden veins pulsing just beneath its glossy surface like molten metal coursing through rock. It radiated a warmth that wasn’t just physical.\n\"You’ve got to be kidding me,\" he whispered, shaking his head in awe and letting out a slow startled laughter.\nA Three-Legged Golden Crow. He’d read about them countless times in the lore of cultivation worlds—mythical solar beasts, embodiments of the sun itself. Born from pure yang fire, their wings could ignite the skies, and their cries could split mountains. It was said that when one soared across a world’s heavens, its light could chase away darkness for a thousand miles.\nBut those were supposed to be legends. Creatures that lived at the pinnacle of existence—divine familiars of emperors and ancient gods. In many worlds, a single adult Golden Crow was enough to shift the balance of an entire realm’s power.\nSome myths even went further, claiming the suns that burned in the void were nothing but the remnants of Golden Crows that had transcended mortality.\nAnd now one of those creatures—one of those living suns—was sleeping in his hands.\nLiam let out a slow breath, steadying his emotions.\n\"You’ve really outdone yourself this time, system.\"\nHe turned the egg slowly, inspecting every inch of its shell. Thin golden runes shimmered just below the surface, cycling in slow spirals.\nThe warmth of the egg was comfortable for him, but he could tell that for any ordinary person, touching it would have meant severe burns.\n\"A Golden Crow...\" he murmured. \"A being born from the heart of the sun, capable of commanding celestial flames, devouring darkness, and igniting entire mountain ranges with a flap of its wings.\"\nHe remembered reading that each of its three legs represented one of the sun’s eternal cycles—dawn, zenith, and dusk. Its flames were said to contain the purest yang energy in existence. With proper cultivation, its essence alone could evolve into divine fire capable of refining stars.\n\"If even half of those legends are true, this little one will grow into something extraordinary,\" Liam smiled, as he let his imagination roam.\n\"When you hatch,\" he said quietly, \"you’re going to be my partner... and perhaps, my greatest weapon.\"\nHe could already imagine how useful a Golden Crow companion would be—an aerial guardian and a living beacon of destruction. More than that, it was a companion born from divinity, one that carried the potential to ascend beyond even his imagination.\nBut then a practical thought surfaced, cutting through his excitement.\n\"System,\" he said, breaking the silence, \"do I need to bond with it? Or will it hatch on its own and recognize me afterward?\"\n[The Host must form a spiritual bond with the creature before it hatches. Failure to do so may result in rejection or hostility after birth.]\n\"Hostility? From a newborn?\" Liam blinked in surprise, but he could understand.\nThree-Legged Golden Crows are divine beasts. Even freshly hatched, they possess high intelligence and instinctive pride. Without a bond, it may refuse his authority or worse, consider him as prey.\n\"Right. Definitely not something I want happening,\" he exhaled slowly.\nHe frowned slightly, thinking. \"So how do I bond with it, then?\"\n[A single drop of the Host’s blood upon the shell will initiate the bond. The egg will recognize the Host’s essence, and the creature within will be imprinted spiritually. Upon hatching, it will acknowledge you as master and kin.]\nLiam studied the egg again, turning it in his hands. \"Simple enough. But... does this bond come with any benefits?\"\n[Absolutely, Host. Once the bond is established, the Host will be linked to the Three-Legged Golden Crow’s life force and abilities. The Host will be able to channel the Crow’s innate powers. As the creature grows stronger, so too will the Host’s connection. When fully matured, the Host will have partial access to divine fire — capable of incinerating matter, energy, or spirit alike.]\nLiam froze mid-breath. His mind spun as the weight of those words sank in.\n\"Wait... are you saying I’ll be able to use its powers?\"\n[Correct, Host. All abilities developed by the bonded spirit beast can be channeled by the Host, albeit at a reduced output depending on your strengtj.]\n\"That’s insane...,\" Liam said in a low voice, as his pulse quickened.\nHe knew what this mean for him. It was a shared evolution. Every time the Crow grew stronger, he would, too!",

      "content": "Chapter 181: Bonding With The Three-Legged Golden Crow\nLiam didn’t hesitate. He bit into his finger sharply until a small bead of blood welled up.\nThe wound sealed within seconds, but not before he let a single drop fall onto the egg’s shell.\nThe effect was immediate, as the golden runes blazed to life, flaring across the egg’s surface in brilliant spirals.\nThen he felt something ancient brushing against his consciousness. A spark of awareness deep within the egg stirred.\nLiam gasped quietly, steadying himself as the sensation deepened. The link was forming — he could feel it, a thin, luminous thread weaving between his soul and the being within the shell.\nThe light dimmed, leaving only the soft glow of golden runes pulsing faintly on the shell. And Liam found himself standing there, breathing hard but smiling.\nHe could feel it now—faint but undeniable—the heartbeat of the creature inside, synchronized with his own. A spark of shared vitality.\n\"Well,\" he said softly, his grin widening, \"welcome to the family.\"\nHe turned toward the distant horizon of the Dimensional Space. He knew couldn’t keep the egg here near the active machinery. Once hatched, a Golden Crow’s flames could burn hotter than plasma; even a flare of excitement from it could melt steel.\nHe carried the egg several hundred meters away from the construction zone and found an open plain. Setting the egg gently upon the plain ground — because he has no other choice — he stepped back.\n\"That’s better,\" he murmured. \"When you hatch, I don’t want you torching my workshop.\"\nThe next moment, he thought about infusing the new physiques immediately but he remembered the advice the system had given him.\nHe sighed softly. As tempting as it was to dive into cultivation now, logic prevailed. He needed to understand the foundations of all three systems before merging them. If he rushed it, he might create instability—or worse, collapse the harmony between his bodies.\n\"Patience,\" he murmured, half to himself. \"One thing at a time.\"\nThe plan was clear now. He would remain on Earth for a while longer to release Lucid. Once the product was in the world and stable, he’d move on to the next universe.\nThat, he decided, would be after his second weekly sign-in.\nLiam gave the crimson egg one last look before he turned away. \"Rest well, little sun,\" he said quietly. \"When you wake, the skies won’t be ready for you.\"\nWith that, he flew towards the construction site to check on the progress of the mega autonomous industrial plant.\nBelow him, the mega-industrial plant stretched across the landscape like a living city of steel and light.\nRows of machines worked in perfect synchronization — drones moving like swarms of metallic insects, carrying materials from one assembly dock to another. Automated cranes rotated gracefully, their long mechanical arms welding beams into place with streams of blue-white plasma.\nLiam hovered a few meters above it all, arms folded as he watched. This was exactly what he wanted — a closed-loop system.\nA world that could build, evolve, and sustain itself without dependence on outside resources.\nThe Eternal Qi Vein would turned the Dimensional Space from an isolated pocket into something closer to a living ecosystem.\nAnd that thought naturally brought him to his next challenge: the Void Beasts.\n\"Just beyond Neptune,\" he muttered under his breath.\nIf what the system said was true, then those creatures — the so-called cosmic whales — had been drifting right on the edge of humanity’s reach this entire time. He can’t imagine that something like that exists in his universe and nothing’s known about them. And no one had ever noticed. No satellite, no probe, no astronomer had detected them.\nThat fact alone made them terrifying. Something that big, that ancient, able to move between stars unnoticed? The implications were staggering.\nHe wonder if the cosmic phenomenons the satellites has detected in the last were actually caused by the Void Beasts.\nHis curiosity flared again. The logical part of him knew this was dangerous — foolish, even. The idea of chasing after something that could swallow planets whole was insanity by any reasonable standard. But the part of him that had lived through the impossible, couldn’t resist.\nLiam can’t imagine just how terrifying it will be to meet one. He wonder what they look like. But what he’s mostly curious about was learning about them.\nHis mind began racing through the logistics almost immediately.\nIf the Voidlings — the offspring of the Void Beasts — were indeed within range, then he’d need a vessel fast enough to reach them before they drifted farther out into the dark. A spaceship that could sustain both him and Lucy’s AI systems beyond the solar boundary.\nA normal starship wouldn’t cut it. He needed something faster than light — or at least close to it.\nHis gaze dropped to the manufacturing hub again, and ideas began forming in his mind like sparks.\n\"This will be fun,\" he murmured, after a brief moment.\n\"Void Beasts,\" he murmured. \"Cosmic whales that breathe in darkness. The universe really does have a sense of humor.\"\nHe wondered what they looked like — whether their bodies were flesh or energy, whether their eyes held galaxies or voids. He imagined their scales gleaming with starlight, their movement slow and solemn, each pulse of their hearts sending tremors across the cosmos.\nThere was still so much to do; Lucid’s release, the magic universe, the Void Beast expedition, the evolution of the Dimensional Space.\nOne step at a time, he reminded himself.\nHe smiled again, this time softer, almost to himself. \"So many things waiting. But we’ll get there.\"\nLiam gazed toward the horizon, eyes bright with quiet determination.\nHe could almost see it — the future stretched wide before him. Planets waiting to be explored, stars waiting to be touched and there was the cosmic beasts too.\nThe path was long, but it was his alone to walk.\nHe smiled to himself and vanished from the Dimensional Space, reappearing in the calm of his bedroom.\nHe stood for a moment, gazing out at the distant skyline bathed in morning light.\n\"From Void Beasts beyond Neptune to divine birds born from the sun,\" he murmured with a soft, amused laugh. \"Looks like things are only going to get crazier from here.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 182: Delivery System\nIn his room, while the world was still trying to dig up everything about him, Liam’s mind was elsewhere; on Lucid.\nThe first batch of Lucid devices — the world’s most advanced wearable — was scheduled to reach the tech reviewers by morning. The unboxing videos, the first impressions, the global frenzy — all of it depended on smooth, flawless delivery.\nAnd yet, there was a problem; he didn’t have a delivery method... yet.\nLiam sat cross-legged on his bed, his fingers drumming rhythmically on his knee as he thought. He had been too busy these past two days dealing with the aftermath of the A380 incident to plan logistics. But that didn’t worry him. He had never intended to rely on conventional delivery systems.\nPlanes were too slow. Cargo firms were too monitored and shipping was too traceable.\nNo. What he wanted was something else entirely — unrestricted logistics.\n\"Drones,\" he said softly, with a small smile. \"But not just any drones.\"\nThe idea bloomed in his mind like lightning striking open sky — a global, autonomous delivery network that would operate outside every law, radar, and border system on Earth.\nHe already knew how this would go once the Lucid review videos hit the internet. Governments would panic and corporations would scramble, doing everything they can restrict it. Tech firms would reverse-engineer the glasses; agencies would file injunctions; customs and export regulators would impose embargoes.\nAnd all of them would fail.\nBecause even if they tore Lucid apart, all they’d find would be meaningless microstructures and the same components of ordinary sunglasses.\nThey would run tests, bombard the units with X-rays, infrared, spectrum analyzers — and get nothing.\nBut embargoes? Yes. Those could slow him down.\nHe could already imagine the tactics: customs freezes, export licensing bans, postal blocks at national entry points, \"Security audits\" demanded by regulatory bodies. All are legal and suffocating.\nAnd yet, as Liam smiled to himself, as he knew that with the idea he has in mind, none of those would matter.\nBecause he intend to build something that would bypass the entire planet’s logistics systems.\nA skyborne network — autonomous, invisible, and omnipresent.\nHe stood up from the bed, pacing slowly across the room as plans formed in his mind faster than words could describe them.\nWhat he needed were around two hundred regional carriers, each the size of a city bus. These would function as orbital stations — hovering tens of thousands of feet in the sky, well above the radar ceilings of even advanced military arrays.\nEach of those carriers would contain hundreds — no, thousands — of smaller drones. Compact, fast, and near-silent.\nEach small drone would be big enough to carry only one Lucid box. Nothing more. Nothing less.\nThey would emerge from the mother drone or pod, descend through clouds like shooting stars, drop the delivery to a doorstep, then return to the sky before anyone even noticed them.\nAnd since every regional drone would operate independently, borders would cease to exist.\nWhether a reviewer lived in Tokyo, San Francisco, Berlin, or Lagos, their Lucid would arrive within the hour.\nEvery drone would fly under digital camouflage — their radar profiles absorbed, thermal signatures masked, transponders invisible. They would appear as empty air.\nThis way, there will be need for customs, couriers or middlemen. Just instant delivery.\n\"It’ll work,\" Liam muttered to himself.\n\"Lucy, start working on this. I want them ready before nightfall,\" he said, as he passed the data to Lucy.\n\"Yes, master. I will be get it done before nightfall. I will inform you when they are ready.\"\n\"Perfect. I will be waiting,\" Liam nodded in satisfaction, as he relaxed back on his bed.\n***\nNightfall\nTime passed quickly.\nThe sky outside had darkened to deep indigo, the city glowing beneath it like a sea of molten gold.\nLiam had just returned from dinner when Lucy’s voice echoed in his head.\n\"Master, the two hundred regional pods and two hundred thousand delivery drones are ready and fully operational.\"\n\"You really do work fast,\" Liam smiled, as he vanished from the room in a blink, reappearing in the Dimensional Space.\nAnd what he saw made his heart thump in satisfaction.\nSuspended across the horizon were hundreds of colossal silver-gray capsules, each hovering silently in perfect formation. Their sleek exteriors shimmered faintly, catching the dim light of the eternal sky above the Space.\nThey looked like something plucked straight from a sci-fi dream — levitating titans, smooth and seamless, their hulls marked only by faint blue-white lights running in symmetrical lines.\nEach one was the length of a bus but bigger than one. Just like the smaller drones, the pods are capsule shaped.\nLiam walked toward the nearest one. As he approached, the capsule responded — its hull split open down the middle with a faint hydraulic hiss.\nInside, the interior expanded like a small warehouse.\nRows of metallic racks filled the sides, lined with hundreds of smaller, capsule-shaped drones. The inner walls glowed with soft blue strips of light.\nLiam stepped inside, his footsteps echoing faintly on the polished floor. He reached out and picked up one of the smaller drones from the rack.\nIt was smooth, compact, almost weightless — no more than the length of his forearm.\nThe drone pulsed responded to his touch and with a soft click, its shell split horizontally.\nInside was a single Lucid box, perfectly fitted.\nLiam stared for a moment, a satisfied smile spreading across his face.\n\"Impeccable,\" he said softly.\nThe drone sealed itself again, folding back into standby mode.\n\"The drones are autonomous,\" Lucy explained. \"I’ve built an independent AI node to manage deployment. I’ll still oversee the network, but each unit can operate alone if necessary. Every drone has cloaking arrays, dynamic signal dampers, and optical camouflage. They will not be detected by radar or satellite. They can hover indefinitely at any altitude below the stratosphere. As for the power source, I used zero point energy. I’ve already taken care of loading and other things. You just need to take out to Earth and they will launch into the sky.\"\nLiam stepped out of the pod and looked up at the fleet hanging across the Dimensional sky.\n\"You’ve outdone yourself again.\"\n\"I only follow your design, Master.\"\nHe chuckled softly. \"And you execute it better than I imagine.\"\nHe walked across the field, surveying the rows of massive pods. They were beautiful.\nHe could already picture two hundred mother drones rising invisibly into the atmosphere, spreading across every continent.\nSystem, how do I take them out?\n[Touch the pod you wish to deploy and think about leaving the Dimensional Space with it.]\nHe looked at the rows of pods stretching into the distance — hundreds of them — and exhaled softly.\n\"That might take a while.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 183: The Calm Before The Storm\nThe night was calm over the Caribbean, a silence that stretched wide across the dark horizon where sea and sky met. The air was crisp, still carrying traces of the salt breeze drifting from the ocean.\nLiam stood on San Caerola Key’s private runway, hands tucked casually in his pockets, he watched as the first of the 200 silver-gray pods began to rise from the runway. Their smooth hulls gleamed briefly under the moon before fading into invisibility as they ascended.\nOne by one, they lifted off silently with faint ripples of distortion in the air. Each pod glided upward like a phantom, climbing higher and higher until they vanished into the thin edge of the stratosphere.\n\"Deployment successful. All pods ascending at optimal trajectory. Altitude set to sixty-five thousand feet. Global dispersal pattern commencing now,\" Lucy’s reported.\nLiam’s gaze followed them into the night sky. Above him, invisible titans were taking their positions in the heavens.\nThe plan was meticulous. Ten pods for the United States, the same for Canada and China. Russia, due to its massive land area, was assigned seventeen. Each region was calculated with roughly one pod per five hundred thousand to a million square kilometers.\nWithin minutes, the pods began to form a vast, invisible network—a global web stretching from one continent to another, unseen yet omnipresent.\n\"Each pod is now holding stable altitude,\" Lucy reported again.\n\"Status of visibility?\"\n\"The pods are undetectable by any known radar system,\" Lucy said. \"Their outer hulls bend light across all visible spectrums. Even high-altitude reconnaissance planes will see nothing but empty sky. To satellites, they’ll appear as thermal anomalies — random noise in the atmosphere.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam murmured. \"That’s exactly what I wanted.\"\nHe stood in silence for a few moments, listening to the soft whisper of the sea. The world’s first autonomous logistics network—his network—was now awake, suspended high above the Earth like a hidden constellation.\nNow, Lucid could be delivered anywhere on the planet. No shipping lanes, customs or corporate gatekeepers.\nEach pod would serve as an airborne hub—its internal drones waiting, dormant, until they received deployment commands. At sunrise, the network would awaken, scattering micro-drones across the world to deliver to the tech reviewers.\nThey would descend like invisible comets, each carrying a single Lucid box.\nBy the time the sun rose, the few world’s most influential tech reviewers, content creators, and analysts he selected, would find a sleek black package waiting on their doorsteps.\nLucid would arrive before breakfast.\nLiam’s smile widened slightly at the thought. The timing was perfect.\nHe had planned everything down to the second. Once the devices were delivered, each reviewer would have seventy-two hours max — three days — to release every single videos, write-ups, and impressions they can on the device. That window was deliberate; short enough to create frenzy, long enough to ensure saturation.\nOf course, Liam was aware that they will be addicted immediately they try it on the first time.\nHe could already imagine the flood of unboxing videos, the tech forums exploding with discussion, the disbelief turning into obsession.\nLiam took one last look at the dark sky. Satisfied, he turned away from the runway and vanished, the night air folding around him as he reappeared inside the Dimensional Space.\nHe took one more breath, then blinked again — this time emerging back inside his room at Bellemere Mansion.\nHe collapsed onto the bed, the soft fabric sinking beneath him as he exhaled deeply.\n\"Everything’s in motion,\" he murmured.\nThe pods were in position, the drones were ready, and the countdown had already begun.\nThe first light of dawn would mark the beginning of Lucid’s reign.\n\"Tomorrow, the world will change,\" he muttered to himself.\nAnd with that, he closed his eyes and drifted into sleep.\n***\nThe Following Morning\nWhen sunlight spilled across the Los Angeles skyline, the world below was already in motion. But Liam had woken up before sunrise.\n\"Good morning, Master,\" Lucy greeted. \"The deliveries have been completed.\"\n\"All of them?\" Liam asked, as he got out of bed.\n\"Yes,\" Lucy replied. \"Ten deliveries, executed precisely at 4:13 a.m. local time for each recipient’s timezone. Each reviewer has received the package. All drones have returned to their pods. Not a single anomaly detected by radar or satellite.\"\n\"Perfect,\" Liam muttered, as he leaned back against the headboard.\nHe knew that somewhere across the planet, the top tech reviewers — people with millions of followers and direct influence over global consumer markets — were now unwrapping sleek, matte-black boxes bearing only one engraved word: Lucid.\nHe could already imagine their reactions. The confusion first—then curiosity. Then awe, when they powered it on for the first time.\nAnd within minutes, every reviewer who wore it would know instinctively that they were holding something that defied modern technology.\nLiam smiled at the thought. They wouldn’t even be able to describe how it worked. They’d try—oh, they would try—but every attempt to explain it would sound impossible.\nThey would test it under light, under shade, underwater, in the dark, in the glare of studio lamps — and Lucid would outperform everything.\nThe internet would explode.\nLiam stretched and stood up.\n\"Any early reactions yet?\" he asked as he walked to the bathroom.\n\"Not yet,\" Lucy said. \"Most are still asleep or setting up their recording spaces. But the first videos should go live within three hours.\"\nHe nodded. \"Good. Then the fun begins.\"\nAfter washing up, Liam moved through his morning routine.\n***\nA soft gust stirred the curtains of the VIP suite, as Liam materialized there, calm and composed.\n\"System,\" he said. \"Sign in.\"\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, you received 100,000 Gold Coins.]\n[You received 1,000 Low Grade Spirit Stones.]\n***\nLiam smiled faintly. The daily rewards might not match the transcendental treasures he’d received before, but they were still valuable.\nHe took one last look around the suite, then vanished again, returning to his bedroom in Los Angeles.\nThe city beyond the windows was bathed in morning light.\nHe leaned back in his bedroom sofa, his eyes gleaming with quiet anticipation.\n***\nMeanwhile, Brian was currently having the most shocking moment of his life. He has no idea what he was holding and how it was possible.\n\"Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 184: Reaction To Lucid\nBrian woke up earlier than usual that morning, his mind already half-alert from the restless night before. The moment he opened his eyes, his thoughts went straight to the package that was being delivered this morning.\nHis manager, Alex, had been skeptical but curious about the company.\nSo when the follow-up email arrived last night saying the package would be delivered before dawn, Brian couldn’t help but frown.\n\"Who ships tech at four in the morning?\" he muttered to himself.\nBut now, standing barefoot in his hallway at 5:02 a.m., he realized the question didn’t matter. Besides, he was curious about Nova — the mysterious company behind the product\nAll he was hoping for, was to not be disappointed or he’d drag the company and the product through the mud for putting him through all these inconvenience for nothing.\nThe doorbell rang once and his phone buzzed immediately after, with a message from Alex:\n\"It’s here.\"\nBrian exhaled slowly, rubbed his eyes, and shuffled toward the door. The morning was still dark; the first light of dawn hadn’t even brushed the horizon yet. He opened the door carefully.\nThere was no van or courier in sight, just a small, black rectangular box sitting neatly on his doorstep, not a speck of dust on it.\nHe stepped outside, scanning the empty street. The air was still. The cul-de-sac was silent. There were no receding footsteps or taillights disappearing in the distance. It was as though the package had simply materialized at his doorstep.\nBrian crouched and picked it up. The box was cold, smooth, and light.\n\"Okay... creepy and impressive,\" he muttered, carrying it inside.\nHe closed the door with his elbow and walked toward his recording setup in the studio room. The ring light on his desk still glowed faintly from last night’s shoot. As he moved, he turned the box slowly in his hands, studying it.\nIt wasn’t wrapped in plastic or sealed with tape. The box itself was the product—matte black, reflective under certain angles. A subtle design etched into its surface caught his attention: a luminous spiral pattern shaped like a quasar, the kind he’d seen in astronomy documentaries, faintly glowing with hints of shifting color.\nBeneath it, in clean silver lettering, one single word: LUCID.\nBrian’s eyebrows lifted when he saw this.\n\"So that’s your name, huh?\" he murmured. \"Lucid.\"\nThere was no branding, tagline or image of the device, making him curious about why a company that claims to have achieved what the top tech companies in the world couldn’t achieve, didn’t put an image of the product on the box.\nHe scoffed at the question, as he sat down at his desk, placed the box carefully in front of the camera, and adjusted his lighting.\n\"Alright,\" he said under his breath, taking a sip of water to clear his throat. \"Let’s see what the fuss is about.\"\nThe red recording light blinked to life.\n\"Hey everyone, it’s Brian here,\" he began, his tone professional but warm. \"So, this one’s weird. No intro trailer today, because this box just arrived — literally minutes ago. It’s from a company called Nova, which, as far as I can tell is rather new startup.\"\nHe tapped the lid lightly with his fingers. \"Now, I’ve reviewed a lot of products before but this one takes the crown for the most mysterious delivery I’ve ever received.\"\nHe paused, giving the camera a half-smile. \"They paid full upfront for a review slot, asked for an immediate unboxing upon arrival, and gave me absolutely no info about what’s inside. I’m hoping it’s not a bomb or alien tech. Either way, we’re finding out together.\"\nHis viewers loved moments like this—raw, unscripted, first-contact excitement.\nHe turned the box toward the camera, showing off the quasar pattern. \"You guys see that? This is not a sticker. That glow? That’s built into the box itself. It reacts to light—look at that gradient shift. I have no idea what material this is.\"\nHe slid a finger over the engraved LUCID logo. \"And the texture—smooth, but not metallic. It’s... cool to the touch.\"\nHe leaned closer, grinning slightly. \"Alright, here we go.\"\nHe lifted the lid and he saw the content of the box.\nResting perfectly centered inside the black foam padding was what looked like a pair of sunglasses.\nBrian blinked in confusion.\n\"That’s it?\" he muttered, glancing at the card again before focusing back on the glasses.\nHe picked them up carefully. They were lightweight — too light for something supposedly high-tech. The frame was sleek, matte black, and minimal. The lenses looked nothing more than those of ordinary sunglasses.\n\"Okay, so this looks like something out of a sci-fi movie,\" Brian said, turning it over in his hands. \"No ports, no buttons, nothing. Usually, even concept devices have a charging dock or at least a power indicator.\"\nHe set it down gently. \"If this is supposed to be a smart wearable, I don’t even see how it’s supposed to power on.\"\nHe checked under the foam padding, but there was nothing. No cables, instruction manuals or charger.\nHe laughed quietly, rubbing his temple. \"Alright, Nova, you’re playing games. This is either genius minimalism or I’ve just been trolled by the most expensive prank in tech history.\"\nStill, curiosity burned in his chest. He picked up the glasses again, studied them closer.\n\"Okay, so... no buttons. Maybe gesture control? Voice activation?\" he muttered, then, half-jokingly, \"Power on?\"\nBut nothing happened.\nHe exhaled and tried something else. \"Activate Lucid?\"\nStill nothing.\nA moment passed. He smiled helplessly to the camera. \"Yeah, guys, this is going to make a great blooper reel. I have no idea how this thing works.\"\nBut then — because reviewers never quit until they break something—he decided to wear them.\nThe moment the lenses slid over his eyes, Brian froze as his vision was instantly filled with motion — an explosion of color and light.\nA swirling quasar formed before him, glowing with impossible brilliance, expanding outward as if the universe itself had come alive inside his skull.\n\"What the—\" he gasped, tearing the glasses off.\nHis heart thudded, as he stared at the sleek frame in disbelief.\n\"Did that just... happen?\" he whispered, looking from the glasses to the camera.\nIt was still rolling.\nHe leaned closer to the lens. \"Guys, I swear I just saw something. I didn’t even press anything.\"\nAfter a long moment, he laughed nervously. \"Alright. Let’s try that again.\"\nHe slid them back on and the quasar returned. Then it started rotating faster, the light became brighter and the depth infinite. It felt like looking through a telescope into creation itself.\nThe animation zoomed outward, stars and galaxies spiraling around him. The detail was so real that he instinctively reached out a hand, half expecting to touch the starlight.\nThen came the shift, as the galaxies collapsed into a black hole, light curving, reality bending and his vision darkened.\nA soft chime echoed in his head, followed by a clean, synthetic voice.\n{Initializing neural interface. Please grant permission for neurosync and retina scan.}\nBrian’s breath caught. \"Neurosync?\" he whispered. \"Wait—what?\"\nHe blinked rapidly. The message hovered in the air before him like a hologram. He tried to look away, but it followed his gaze.\n{Grant permission?} {YES / NO}\nHe hesitated for a moment, then curiosity won.\n\"Yes,\" he said softly.\nInstantly, the interface responded, as the darkness cleared and Brian was standing in a room. It was a vast, glasslike lobby bathed in soft light.\n\"Where... am I?\" he whispered.\nA translucent menu appeared in front of him:\n{Welcome, User.}\n{Please create your character profile to proceed.}\nHis hands trembled slightly. \"This can’t be real,\" he muttered. \"This looks like a VR simulation —nbut I’m not wearing anything but the glasses.\"\nThe reviewer instincts kicked in again. He needed to document this. He reached up to remove the glasses and in an instant, he was back in his studio. The transition was seamless.\nHe looked around, still catching his breath. \"Alright... that’s enough for part one,\" he said quietly to the camera. \"We’re going to need a new video for this.\"\n***\nMinutes later, Brian hit record again.\n\"Okay, guys. Round two. Whatever this thing is—it’s not AR, not VR. It’s something else entirely.\"\nHe slid the glasses back on. Instantly, he was back in the glowing lobby and the menu awaited him.\nHe focused on the floating text and thought of his name. And the menu blinked.\n{Will you like to set your character profile name as Brian Carter?}\n{YES / NO}\nHis jaw dropped, as he muttered to himself \"No typing? No voice commands? It’s reading my thoughts?\"\nThe thought of it itself was scary but also very interesting. He smiled to himself and choose the ’Yes’ option.\n{User profile created: Brian Carter.}\nImmediately, another line appeared.\n{Would you like to create your avatar?}\n{YES / NO}\n\"Yes,\" he thought.\nThe next moment, in front of him, light gathered and formed into shape — a man. His own face. His own eyes.\nA perfect digital replica of himself stood before him, wearing the same shirt he’d put on that morning.\nHe thought of moving his hand and the replica avatar moved its hand, mirroring his thoughts.\nHe looked down at his digital hands.\n\"I can feel this...\" he whispered. \"I can actually feel this.\"\nAround him, the empty lobby was now filled with new icons that appeared in doors.\n\"Are they games? So, this is a gaming device?\" He muttered to himself, as he observed the icons.\nBrian’s voice trembled as he spoke, almost to himself.\n\"Unbelievable,\" he murmured, his tone a mix of awe and disbelief. Then, louder, with a stunned smile spreading across his face:\n\"Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable.\"\nHe hadn’t even tested the games yet, and he was already stunned. Just how much more will be be shocked when he starts testing them?\nThough the icons didn’t look familiar to those of popular games, Brian was sure that no matter how bad the games are, the device will make up for that. He can already imagining the big game companies rushing to put their games on the device.",

      "content": "Chapter 185: Reaction To Lucid (2)\nBrian wasn’t the only one with those thoughts and reactions. The other nine tech reviewers that had received the device also had the same reactions and thought as him.\nThey just couldn’t believe what they were holding in their hands. They all had thought that they were being pranked but just like Brian, the moment they wore the device, they understood that they were holding something that shouldn’t exist in their hands.\nAfter their unboxing video, they all curiously decided to continue testing the device throughout the whole day. They didn’t initially start gaming as they took their time, exploring every bit of what the device can do.\nBut their shocks was far from over.\n\"Good morning, Brian,\" a soft, calm voice said, as a lady in a red flowing dress materialised beside Brian’s avatar.\nBrian froze when he saw the lady, how beautiful she looked and how life-like she was. But that wasn’t important, what was important was the fact that he heard her talk.\n\"Did you just talk?\" He asked in curiosity.\n\"Yes. I’m your device’s personal AI assistant. You can call me whatever you want,\" the AI replied.\nBrian blinked rapidly, sitting up straight in his chair. \"Wait — you’re really talking to me?\"\n\"Yes,\" the AI replied.\nBrian couldn’t believe it. He knew what this meant and he didn’t want to believe it. Actually, what he didn’t want to believe was that it was achieved by a device from a no-name startup company, instead of one of the tech giants.\n\"How is it that I’m hearing your voice in my head?\" He asked me in both curiosity and scepticsm.\n\"The device output information directly into retina and you can hear my voice because of the device’s temple rim at the back of your ear,\" the AI explained.\nBrain blinked in confusion, then gave an incredulous laugh, leaning toward the camera that was still rolling. He took off the device and brought the temple close to the camera.\n\"Okay, guys... I wasn’t expecting that. Apparently, it’s got a built-in AI. It just talked to me through this. I can’t exactly hear the AI with the device taken off, so it’s safe to say that it’s not in my head.\"\nBrian continued testing the device, as he wore it back. He saw that the AI was still there.\n\"So, you said I should give you a name?\"\n\"Yes. If you want to.\"\n\"Ok. Let’s call you Meg.\"\n\"Thank you for the name. My name is now Meg.\"\n\"Good. So, tell me what you can do.\"\n\"As your personal AI assistant, it’s by job to make usage easy for you. I will answer whatever question you may have.\"\n\"Is that so? So, tell me everything about what the device can do,\" Brian said.\nHe was really shock by the fact that he was having a conversation with an AI. Not just any AI but one that’s extremely intelligent, more than those currently in the market.\nBrian felt that if the AI was a standalone product release, it will lead the market in mere months. All major companies around the world will pivot and focus on it.\nBut it’s not a standalone product. But rather, it’s one with the device. This also increases the value of the device.\n\"So, Meg, do you know what the neurosync and the retina scan were for?\" Brian asked curiously.\nThis was one the of the multiple questions he has and it was a very important one.\n\"The neurosync is a non-invasive method of calibrating the device to your brainwave patterns for seamless input.\"\n\"Brainwave patterns calibration? So, you read my thoughts\" Brian muttered in shock.\n\"No. The device only received thoughts directed at it.\"\nBrain frowned when he heard this. He didn’t believe what Meg had just told him. He decided to test it out, as he thought of something else.\n\"What did I just think about now?\" He asked.\n\"Nothing. The device didn’t receive any input.\"\n\"I see...\" Brian nodded slowly.\nThroughout out the whole process, he didn’t forget to explain everything he was seeing and doing, to the camera that was still rolling.\n\"Then what about the retina scan?\"\n\"For security. Each Lucid device is biometrically bound to its owner’s retina signature and the user’s consent. Without both, the device cannot activate.\"\n\"Damn! It’s no longer fingerprint or face recognition. It’s... mind and eyes? That’s insane. It’s like I’m in a sci-fi movie, guys,\" he said to the camera.\nOver the next hour, Brian spent his time, checking out the device and going through every bit of his function, except the core; which was gaming.\n\"So, tell me, what is Lucid exactly?\" Brian asked Meg, his personal AI assistant.\n\"Lucid is a vr gaming device and it comes with multiple games,\" Meg replied and started listing, and explaining everything about the games.\nBrian found his shock level increasing with each seconds, as Meg explained. The games weren’t as he expected. He wasn’t much interested in Children’s Arena — maybe because it was a kid’s game. But Genesis Sandbox, Terra, Frontline: Starfall Dominion, Eternal Realms and the two sport games were extremely intriguing.\nBrian had wanted to start playing them but he held himself back, as Meg told him that he can livestream from the device.\nHe couldn’t believe it. He knew that this meant that now, Lucid wasn’t just a vr gaming device with a powerful AI model but also one with a streaming function.\nThis function wasn’t too much of a surprise but to them, it showed that the developers really thought things through.\nBut when Brian heard no third-party apps can be connected to the device, he knew what the company was trying to achieve; independence.\nWith the livestream now available, Brian decided to end the recording and start livestreaming directly.\nHe made an announcement on his channels, dropping the link to his livestream room.\nThat day, the internet was ablaze. While the unboxing had hooked people’s curiosity, the livestream changed everything.\n***\nMeanwhile, thousands of miles away in Los Angeles, Liam reclined comfortably in his bed, as he watched quietly the livestreams simultaneously, with a satisfied smile.\n\"Exactly as planned,\" he murmured.",

      "content": "Chapter 186: Reaction To Lucid (3)\nLiam had been notified immediately by Lucy when the unboxing videos from the ten tech reviewers went live.\nHe took his time to watch all of them individually and he was really satisfied with what he saw.\nThe first thing he noticed wasn’t the devices or the packaging — it was the silence before each reviewer began speaking. The same silence filled all ten videos — that moment of disbelief, of someone staring at something they couldn’t comprehend.\nHe had deliberately instructed Lucy not to include any instruction manuals or setup guides inside the Lucid boxes. He wanted raw and genuine discovery. That was why he had chosen these reviewers specifically. They were curious, methodical and skeptical.\nHe wanted the world to see their transition — from confusion, to curiosity, to awe. And that was exactly what happened.\nEach video followed the same emotional curve. The unboxing began with light sarcasm and professional composure. Then came the laughter — the half-nervous, half-disbelieving kind — and finally, the quiet, breathless shock when the reviewers first wore Lucid.\n\"Did that just happen?\"\nLiam chuckled softly at their unified questions.\nLucy’s calm voice filled his mind. \"The unboxing videos have reached one point two million combined views within the first thirty minutes, Master.\"\n\"Show me the comments,\" he said.\nInstantly, the comment feeds from the tech reviewers’ YouTube channels scrolled across the screen.\nOne particular comment thread stood out under Brian’s unboxing video.\n\"What’s going on? Why is he so shocked?\"\n\"I have no idea but I think the sunglass he just wore is a legit wearable and it’s working.\"\n\"A wearable that isn’t from one of the big five? And we heard nothing about it? Talk about a fantasy.\"\n\"If that’s really a wearable from an unknown startup company, then the tech industry is going to experience a paradigm shift.\"\nLiam read through the flood of speculation, with a calm expression on his face.\nThough the viewers had no idea what the reviewers had seen or experienced once the device activated, their reactions told them everything they needed to know.\nThe viewers were extremely curious to know everything but since it was an unboxing video, the tech reviewers couldn’t explain anything and they all could only wait.\nBut that didn’t mean that the unboxing videos weren’t popular. It was but not to the point of going viral, it was popular.\nFirst, the mysterious delivery method. Like the tech reviewers had said, no courier or delivery van was in sight. And if it was a drone, they saw it heard nothing.\nThe reason for this is because the mini drones were under cloaking and since they fly silently, there was no way the tech reviewers could had seen or heard anything if the delivery was right in front of them.\nLiam watched another video — this time from a European reviewer, a quiet tech analyst known for his clinical detachment.\nThe man had begun with his usual skeptical tone, dismissing the lack of specifications and manuals as marketing fluff. But when he put on the glasses, his face went completely blank.\nFor nearly ten seconds, he said nothing. Then, he whispered, \"Oh my God.\"\nThe comment section erupted instantly at his reaction. The reason for this was because of the tech reviewer’s personality and the fact that he’s hard to impress, and also very blunt with his reviews. His bluntness was almost to the point of being rude.\nAs for Liam, he was really happy with the way things were going. He knew the reactions would differ slightly — some stunned, some laughing, some speechless — but all of them shared one thing: authenticity.\nAnd that’s what he wanted, as these videos weren’t just marketing. They were proof that Lucid wasn’t fiction.\nLucy spoke again. \"Search activity related to Lucid and Nova is increasing exponentially. Over one hundred thousand unique users are currently querying both names. I’ve also detected heavy traffic on the official website.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam said softly. \"Show me.\"\nA moment later, the unboxing video was with a landing page of Nova Technologies’ website.\nIt was a dark, minimal and almost empty interface with the luminous spiral quasar logo rotating slowly in the center. Beneath it, only four tabs: About, Technology, Privacy, and Preorder.\nLucy continued, \"Most visitors are focused on the privacy statement. Some are skeptical, others are fascinated.\"\nHe opened the tab himself and read through the text he had drafted himself the next morning after his short visit to the island with David, and others.\n\"We’ve seen the questions multiple times, and we understand the concerns. You have every right to ask how something that feels this powerful treats the information that passes through it.\"\n\"The answer is simple: Lucid doesn’t collect your data. It doesn’t upload, sell, or analyze it.\nEverything that happens within Lucid — your inputs, your experiences — exists only on your device, processed in real time and erased instantly when you remove it.\nWhat happens in Lucid, stays in Lucid.\"\n\"We believe that technology should enhance humanity, not harvest it. You are not the product. You are the participant.\"\n\"Our mission is to end the era of surveillance-based technology — permanently.\nNo ads. No tracking. No third-party scripts. No compromise.\"\n\"Nova doesn’t need your data to improve Lucid. The device learns from you, not about you.\"\n\"That’s not a slogan. It’s a promise.\"\nLiam leaned back, still reading the final lines, remembering how the industry treats users’ privacy as a selling point, not a principle.\nHe remembered when Lucy had asked him if she should retrieve data from users and he told her no. The truth was that he has no need for the data. Lucid was nothing but a gaming device for now, and for such reasons, he doesn’t need data.\nWhile Liam continued reading, new updates poured in.\nDozens of users clicked Preorder, expecting some absurd figure — five thousand, maybe even ten. Instead, what they saw was a shockingly small price tag of $700.\nThe reactions were instant on some forums.\n\"That has to be a typo.\"\n\"Seven hundred? No way.\"\n\"I was ready to mortgage my soul, not just my savings.\"\n\"Either this is the biggest scam ever or the best deal in human history.\"\nOne reviewer’s Discord server caught fire when a user decided to test it. The man streamed his screen live as he filled in his information, expecting an error. But the order went through.\nAnd then he saw the counter: 959 remaining units.\nWithin minutes, he posted screenshots of his pre-order, the release date and delivery date— which is in a week, and chaos erupted across social media. People rushed to the site, hammering the preorder button.\nOne minute later: 937 units. By the twenty-fifth minute mark, the counter hit 47. And at the thirty-one-minute mark, it went gray.\nSold Out.\nThe first batch of Lucid was gone.\nAt that very moment, the tech reviewers posted the links to their livestream rooms on the web app Lucy built for the third-party viewing of streams.\nThe more than 900 individuals that made the pre-order and everyone else immediately clicked on the links. And in matter of minutes, the ten livestream rooms had a culminative 1m viewers.\nLiam switched the display to a multiview grid, showing all ten livestreams at once. Each reviewer’s face was visible in a small frame — some excited, some nervous, but all of them visibly overwhelmed.\nAs the countdowns ended, the screens came alive.\n\"Alright, we’re live,\" Brian said to his audience of 158,000. \"You guys saw the unboxing this morning. Now, we’re diving in.\"\nEach reviewer began explaining what they experienced right from the moment they put on the device, from the neurosync, the retina scan, the user profile creation, the avatar and the AI assistants.\nThe comment sections erupted into chaos.\n\"Wait, they’re seeing things in real space? No headset?\"\n\"He’s moving his hands but there’s nothing there!\"\n\"Bro, this looks too real. It can’t be CGI.\"\nIn matter of minutes, screenshots and clips flooded every platform. Viewers screen-recorded moments, shared snippets on social media, and tagged friends with disbelief.\nBy the first thirty minutes, the cumulative viewership passed three million. By the next hour, it hit ten million.\nTrending tags flooded across every network: #Lucid, #NovaTech, #Neurosync, #FutureOfGaming.\nAnd the storm began as tech influencers who hadn’t been selected caught wind of what was happening. Some were furious, others were jealous but they were all desperate to get their hands on a unit.\nBut their emotions mattered not, as the viewers continued increasing and the tags trended even more. Before the end of the second hour of the streams, the cumulative viewership passed 50m. The world’s governments and corporations around the world finally noticed that something was amiss.",

      "content": "Chapter 187: The Storm\nLangley, Virginia\nInside the NSA’s Cyber Threat Operations Center, the whole place was quiet, until a crimson line blinked across the top of the dashboard.\n\"Trending anomaly detected,\" the automated alert read. Keyword cluster: #Lucid | #NovaTech | #FutureOfGaming.\nA young analyst named Marcus Denevier frowned at his screen. The system’s AI only pinged this category when a pattern matched potential dual-use technology—hardware capable of civilian and military applications.\n\"Sir,\" he called softly to the watch supervisor, \"you’ll want to see this.\"\nThe supervisor, a weary man with a coffee mug in hand, leaned over. \"Talk to me.\"\nMarcus enlarged the data stream. \"It started thirty-seven minutes ago. Massive simultaneous spikes in keyword searches, social media posts, and video shares across U.S., EU, and Pacific networks. Origin appears to be consumer tech — something called Lucid, from Nova Technologies. But here’s the thing—there’s no baseline. This company didn’t exist on our prior industry registry scans.\"\nThe supervisor’s brow furrowed. \"And it’s spreading this fast?\"\n\"Yes, sir. Global traction within the first hour. Hashtags already hitting top-ten in thirty-two countries.\"\nHe gestured at the screen, where real-time graphs flared like a pulse monitor.\n\"Neural interface, retina scan, and ’AI assistant’ appear in over sixty percent of posts. The algorithm classified it as potential neurolink hardware.\"\nThat got the supervisor’s full attention. \"Flag it Level Two. Notify Homeland and Cyber Command.\"\n***\nDepartment of Homeland Security, Washington D.C\n.\nA conference room full of analysts stared at the same data feed mirrored on multiple screens.\nCISA’s deputy director tapped her pen against the table. \"So, we’re looking at a new consumer device trending globally, with no prior marketing, no listed investors, and shipping records that don’t exist?\"\n\"Correct,\" said the agent from the National Cybersecurity Communications Integration Center. \"The packages appeared at doorstep locations without courier entries, FedEx logs, or customs declarations.\"\n\"Drone delivery?\"\n\"If so, they’re invisible. No radar, no signal logs, nothing. The airspace data over those delivery zones is clean.\"\nSilence settled over the room.\n\"Alright,\" the deputy director said finally. \"Trace the digital footprint. Who’s hosting NovaTech.com?\"\nThe analyst at the end of the table began typing, lines of code scrolling rapidly.\n\"...This can’t be right,\" he muttered.\n\"What?\"\n\"The IP routes aren’t resolving. The DNS pings loop through relay points that don’t exist on the terrestrial grid. No AWS, no Azure, no private data center. It’s like it’s not hosted anywhere on Earth.\"\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\"I’m saying, ma’am, the hosting signature doesn’t match any known server infrastructure. The response time is too clean. It’s as if the site exists but doesn’t occupy physical space.\"\nAnother analyst whispered, \"Quantum relay? Off-planet bounce? Satellite hosting?\"\nIt was a very funny, even ridiculous assumption but no one laughed.\n\"Get me NSA confirmation,\" the deputy said sharply. \"If this thing’s running on unknown infrastructure, I want eyes on it yesterday.\"\n***\nNational Security Agency, Fort Meade\nUnfortunately and fortunately, the NSA confirmed the impossible.\n\"The trace loops into vacuum,\" Marcus said grimly during the inter-agency call. \"We’re not detecting a hosting endpoint. The latency profile is consistent with a theoretical non-terrestrial origin — either something operating beyond orbital range or outside standard frequency bands.\"\n\"Meaning?\" asked a CIA liaison.\n\"Meaning, sir, if someone’s running this network, they’re not using Earth-based servers...\"\nThat sentence echoed through the secure line.\n***\nCIA Headquarters, Langley\nA senior officer from the Directorate of Digital Innovation stood before a glass wall of data feeds.\n\"We’ve verified that Nova Technologies is registered domestically—Delaware incorporation, filed less than a month ago using JP Morgan’s infrastructures. Physical addresses in Los Angeles and Nevada.\"\n\"And?\" asked her superior.\n\"They’re empty,\" the analyst said, her tone flat but uneasy. \"The LA office is a leased suite—rented and fully paid up through JP Morgan’s Private Banking division. Two years in advance. No listed employees, no janitorial service, no equipment leases. Nothing.\"\nHer superior frowned. \"Paid through private banking?\"\n\"Yes, sir. Every transaction was processed through JP Morgan’s ultra-high-net-worth arm. Clean wires, verified identity, no intermediaries. Whoever’s behind this didn’t move through shell companies. They used legitimate institutional channels, and the bank sealed everything under client confidentiality.\"\n\"And the Nevada site?\" the man asked.\nShe hesitated before replying, \"Officially filed as an industrial research facility. The permit and zoning paperwork were registered less than a month ago, approved in record time—under forty-eight hours. Treasury and Commerce databases both confirm the signatures are valid.\"\n\"So, the company has no problem on the legal front?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Alright. Bring in DIA and DARPA. We’re classifying this as Tier-One Anomalous Tech. Code name: Project LUCID.\"\n***\nPentagon Briefing Room\nScreens flickered to life around a long table filled with men and women in uniform.\nA DIA analyst began, \"Lucid appears to be a wearable device marketed as a gaming platform. Early consumer tests indicate direct neural interface and retina-based security. The livestreams from verified reviewers suggest immersive projection far exceeding any known AR or VR system.\"\nA Marine general leaned forward. \"You’re telling me a private company achieved neurolink-level immersion without government oversight?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nThe general’s voice darkened. \"Then we need to know who really built it.\"\nDARPA’s director adjusted his glasses. \"If the underlying tech is real, it’s decades ahead of us. We’d need to secure a unit immediately for analysis.\"\nAnother voice joined via video link — the Director of National Intelligence. \"Negative. The White House wants containment, not seizure. Not yet. Public reaction is already global. We’ll monitor quietly. Interception risks exposure.\"\n\"Sir,\" said the DARPA head, \"if this is foreign—\"\n\"That’s what we’re determining. For now, we observe. No direct engagement.\"\nThe general grunted but said nothing.\n***\nFBI Cyber Division, Quantico\n\"Some of the Lucid streamers are verified citizens, all within U.S. jurisdiction,\" said Agent Claire Renner. \"We’ve been instructed to open a preliminary intelligence case file. Codename matches CIA: Project Lucid.\"\n\"Any evidence of data exfiltration?\"\n\"None. The devices don’t transmit anything outward. We tested one reviewer’s Wi-Fi logs — no packets, no traces, no signal activity.\"\nHer supervisor frowned. \"Then how the hell does it work?\"\n\"No idea, sir.\"\nHe rubbed his temples. \"Get eyes on those facilities in LA and Nevada. I want boots, cameras, everything. If there’s even a janitor, I want his name.\"\n\"Also, someone contact JP Morgān. Why are they in the mix of this???\"\n***\nWhite House Situation Room\nBy now, Lucid was trending in ninety countries. Total livestream viewers surpassed seventy-five million.\nThe Director of National Intelligence stood before the President’s Chief of Staff, DHS Secretary, and the Joint Chiefs.\n\"Gentlemen, ladies—this is the biggest unregistered technology deployment in U.S. history. The company is American on paper but operates like a ghost. Its servers don’t exist, and its product interfaces directly with the human brain.\"\nThe Chief of Staff leaned forward. \"Is it safe?\"\n\"We don’t know.\"\n\"Is it domestic or foreign?\"\n\"We don’t know.\"\nThe room fell silent.\nThe NSA Director spoke next. \"We’ve run decryption scans on the NovaTech site’s signal. It’s protected by something we can’t crack. It doesn’t even use standard quantum algorithms. It’s like trying to read a language that isn’t ours.\"\nThe President’s Chief of Staff turned to him. \"So what’s the play?\"\n\"Containment,\" said the DNI. \"We monitor. We trace buyers. We don’t make a public move until we know what we’re dealing with.\"\n\"And if it’s extraterrestrial?\" someone muttered.\nThe DNI’s gaze hardened. \"Then God help us all.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 188: The Storm (2)\nCupertino, California\n.\nThe early afternoon light cut through the circular glass walls of Applē’s executive suite and the air was thick with tension. The big screen showed Brian Carter’s Lucid unboxing looping endlessly. Then, on another screen was the ongoing livestream of one of the tech reviewers and he was currently playing the most immersive game they could ever imagine.\nTimi sat still, hands folded, with an unreadable expression on his face.\n\"Run me through it again,\" he said.\n\"Unknown company,\" Greg Faraday, VP of Hardware, began. \"Product: Lucid. Marketed as wearable tech. But it’s not AR — it’s neural projection. No power ports, no processor lag, zero thermal output. Seven hundred dollars retail.\"\nTimi’s eyes narrowed slightly at the ridiculous pricing, \"Seven hundred?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nA long pause. Timi was trying to understand why and how someone will price something so advanced so dirt cheap. Are they trying to ruin what they all have built over the years?\n\"Who are they?\" he asked, after a brief moment of thought.\n\"Nova Technologies,\" replied the general counsel. \"Delaware LLC. Clean paperwork. No founders listed. Registered through JP Morgan’s private-banking branch. Every transaction airtight.\"\n\"Then buy it,\" Timi said, as he leaned back.\nSilence filled the room.\n\"Sir,\" the counsel said carefully, \"we can’t. The ownership’s layered through sovereign-trust structures. It’s protected.\"\n\"Then we make it unprotected,\" Timi said, without blinking.\n\"How?\"\nHe turned to the head of policy. \"Regulatory squeeze. Data-privacy narrative. Neural-interface safety. If we can’t buy them, we bury them.\"\n\"Should we coordinate with Washington?\"\nTimi’s tone was razor-cold, as he spoke. \"You don’t ask Washington. You tell them. Frame it as public safety. Nobody wants brain tech without oversight.\"\nThe marketing chief hesitated, before speaking. \"That could backfire if it’s clean.\"\nTimo’s reply was almost a whisper. \"Nothing’s clean after we touch it.\"\nNo one spoke again. In that quiet, everyone understood the order: control the story, or the story controls them.\nThey knew what’s coming for the company, if Nova Technologies releases Lucid in a week as promised. Not just them but all tech companies will face massive devaluation and they might never bounce back. So, it was better to act now and minimise the damage, than to wait till later.\nBesides, all the tech companies’ stock prices are now down 0.5% in the last five minutes.\n***\nMenlo Park — Mēta Reality Labs\nMarcus stood in the darkened briefing room, the flickering reflection of Lucid dancing in his eyes. Around him, his Reality Labs team waited for the verdict.\n\"It’s thought-responsive,\" said CTO Andrea, with a tight voice. \"Direct brainwave interface. No controller or band, no latency. They just... think.\"\nMarcus said nothing. The silence stretched until it became uncomfortable.\n\"Our neural-link project—\" Andrea began.\n\"Dead,\" Marcus cut in. \"Pull it. It’s obsolete.\"\nImmediately, gasps rippled throughout the briefing room. They all knew what’s this meant. It meant that the billions of dollars that was spent on the project, all went into a sinkhole.\nMarcus walked to the window and looked out over the empty campus lawn, as he said, \"If Lucid’s real, the metaverse just left our hands. Every dollar we spent trying to trap people inside digital walls — gone.\"\nThe COO spoke softly, \"Then we pivot. Integration proposal?\"\nMarcus turned to look at the COO. \"No. They don’t integrate with us. We integrate into them.\"\n\"You mean—\"\n\"Acquisition,\" he said flatly. \"If they refuse, destroy them. Safety scare, disinformation, ad campaigns about neural damage. You know the drill.\"\nThe communications head shifted uneasily. \"That could get traced.\"\n\"Then use our PR contractors. The ones who did the Cambridge cleanup.\"\nThere was a long pause, as everyone let the gravity of what he just said sink in.\n\"And if they stay independent?\"\nMarcus smiled but the smile didn’t reach his eyes. It was ice cold.\n\"Then we build a digital world that’s compatible with Lucid—and make sure it needs us to survive.\"\n***\nMountain View — Gōōgle Headquarters\nThe ARCore command floor buzzed with panic. Engineers, executives, and legal counsel packed the glass-walled conference room.\n\"The Nova website has no backend footprint,\" said the cybersecurity lead. \"No AWS, no Azure, no private servers. It’s like it’s hosted in vacuum.\"\nCEO Sundar looked up from his tablet. \"So we can’t trace them.\"\n\"Not yet,\" the engineer said. \"But we can drown them.\"\n\"How?\"\nThe legal counsel smiled tightly. \"Patent infringement. We’ll comb through every optic, lens, and software algorithm in ARCore’s library. Something will match. File a claim. Freeze their shipments before they scale.\"\nAnother exec added, \"Or we bait them with partnership. Access to our global infrastructure, YouTube integration, AI cloud support. They sign one contract, and they’re ours.\"\nSundar nodded slowly. \"Good. Offer them heaven with one hand, hell with the other. One way or another, they’ll come to us.\"\n***\nSeoul — Sāmsūng Electronics HQ\nThe Mobile Division’s top brass sat around a sleek black table, with faces drawn.\n\"Lucid’s components are untraceable,\" said an engineer. \"No known supply chain. No chipsets, no lenses, no source materials.\"\nThe CEO’s expression was cold. \"Then we hit their weak point.\"\nHe turned to his procurement chief. \"Buy every optics supplier operating in East Asia. If they’re building this device, we’ll own their factories before they realize it.\"\n\"And if we can’t find their suppliers?\" someone asked.\n\"Then we find who supplies their suppliers,\" he snapped. \"And we make the cost of doing business impossible.\"\nAnother executive murmured, \"Should we partner instead?\"\nThe CEO smiled thinly. \"Partnership is what we call a siege before the takeover.\"\n***\nShenzhen — Hūāwēi Technologies\nDr. Wen watched the Lucid streams play across six monitors at once. \"A wearable that projects direct neural signals,\" he said softly. \"Whoever built this broke every physical limitation we know.\"\nThe government liaison leaned forward. \"Beijing wants replication. Can you do it?\"\nWen folded his arms. \"Not yet. But we can extract it.\"\n\"How?\"\n\"Corporate espionage, subcontractor infiltration, patent theft — the usual methods. If it’s American, it’ll leak. Everything American leaks.\"\nHe turned to his team. \"If they won’t share it, we’ll clone it. If we can’t clone it, we’ll counterfeit it. And if we can’t counterfeit it—then we flood the market with counterfeits anyway. No one believes in a miracle once it’s everywhere.\"\n***\nTokyo — Sōny Interactive Entertainment\nThe PlayStation boardroom was silent. A replay of Lucid’s game interface looped across the screen: Brian Carter’s avatar was currently fighting a war in space against an alien invader in the game Frontline: Starfall Dominion.\n\"This is reality emulation,\" muttered a developer. \"Not virtual or augmented. Reality.\"\nThe CEO exhaled slowly. \"Then every headset we’ve made just became ancient history.\"\nThe studio head straightened. \"We still control content. If Lucid becomes the new platform, we’ll be the first to publish on it.\"\n\"Start calling the big developers,\" said the CEO. \"Square, FromSoft, EA. Offer exclusivity bonuses — billions if needed. If Nova wants games, they’ll need us.\nAnd if they refuse?\"\nThe CEO’s gaze hardened. \"Then we lobby Japan’s tech ministry to classify Lucid as unregulated neural hardware. It’ll stall imports for months.\"\n***\nZurich — UBS Tech Investment Memo (Internal)\nA confidential note circulated through the investment sector that afternoon:\n\"All six major tech conglomerates have initiated containment operations regarding Nova Technologies.\nApplē: Attempting discreet acquisition and regulatory influence through safety framing.\nMētā: Pursuing infiltration and media distortion.\nGōōgle: Legal entanglement and dual-front partnership traps.\nSāmsūng: Supply-chain suppression and vendor monopolization.\nHūāwēi: Replication or counterfeit flooding.\nSony: Content-control and import interference.\nCollective motive: prevent market displacement by an unaligned entity.\nCollective outcome: inevitable failure.

      "content": "Chapter 189: The Storm (3)\n270 Park Avenue, New York City.\nRain streaked across the floor-to-ceiling windows, soft and steady, the gray afternoon light cutting through the storm clouds that hovered above Manhattan.\nInside the executive boardroom, the air was thick with that peculiar silence that falls right before a financial hurricane.\nAt the far end of the table, Marianne, Head of Ultra-High-Net-Worth Relations, broke the silence. Her tone was low but sharp.\n\"They’re connecting us to Nova Technologies. Treasury filed a formal request through the OCC this morning — joint query with Homeland Security.\"\nAcross from her, Thomas Whitmore, the bank’s Chief Risk Officer, adjusted his glasses. He’d been staring at the internal ledger summary for the past ten minutes, hoping the numbers would rearrange themselves into something less incriminating.\n\"Our exposure originates from Bellemere Family Office,\" he said finally. \"Nova’s Delaware registration came straight out of one of our incubation templates — set up when Liam Scott was still under our private-banking umbrella.\"\nA few heads turned sharply at that.\nCharlotte Winslow, General Counsel, looked up from her legal pad. \"You’re telling me the most talked-about company on Earth was incorporated through one of our formation shells?\"\nWhitmore nodded grimly. \"Yes. Standard venture structuring—Delaware LLC, cascade ownership, registered via our Family-Office Formation Desk. All perfectly legal. But the signature trail leads right back here, under Daniel Conley’s oversight, before Bellemere became independent.\"\nA quiet hiss of air escaped Charlotte’s lips as she exhaled. \"Well, congratulations, everyone. We just became the supporting cast in the biggest tech mystery of the century.\"\nAt the head of the table, Jamie Whitlock, CEO of JP Morgan, placed his coffee down carefully. The soft clink echoed like a gavel.\n\"So, let me make sure I understand this. We helped the most mysterious teenager in the world, with billions of dollars in undisclosed assets, set up his family office. Not only that, but we also create for him a legal shell for a small tech venture. That venture suddenly drops a piece of technology that makes Silicon Valley look medieval, and now the U.S. government thinks we’re the architects of an alien invasion?\"\nNo one answered, because there was no answer to be given.\nMarianne’s voice was steady but her jaw was tight. \"Liam Scott is no longer our client. Bellemere is fully independent. We built the scaffolding, but he owns the tower.\"\nCharlotte shook her head slowly. \"That distinction won’t matter to Washington. They see our fingerprints on the blueprints and they’ll call it complicity.\"\nWhitmore tapped his tablet, pulling up another set of alerts. \"Requests are pouring in. Homeland wants KYC files, Treasury wants every transaction linked to Nova Technologies, and the SEC wants confirmation of beneficial ownership. If we open the books entirely, we look naïve. If we refuse, we look guilty.\"\nJamie Whitlock leaned back, expression unreadable. \"Then we do what we always do — walk the knife edge. Cooperate enough to appear transparent, reveal nothing that matters.\"\nHe turned to Charlotte. \"Draft a disclosure protocol. Limit access to executives only. Attorney-client privilege covers Bellemere. Add private-banking confidentiality as the second firewall.\"\nCharlotte nodded. \"Understood. I’ll also reach out to our OCC liaison. Better they hear a sanitized version from us before they start sniffing around.\"\nMarianne leaned forward. \"We also need to discuss relationship management. Bellemere Family Office is about to control more liquid capital than several sovereign wealth funds combined. We can’t afford to lose our proximity. Also, he’s still in the news for his private A380. Sigh... Just thinking about it is gives me a migraine already. Just who the hell is this kid?\"\nWhitlock gave a small nod. \"It’s the same question we all have. But we don’t sever ties. Instead, we reinforce them, and quietly. Geneva desk, Singapore desk — we will extend our concierge coverage through them. Offer liquidity pipelines, property financing, global custody — whatever keeps us inside his orbit. This is one more reason for us to make sure we don’t lose Liam. I don’t care who he is, what matters is what we stand to gain. And you all are aware that we stand to gain a lot. It’s high time we also become a trillion-dollar company.\"\nWhitmore frowned. \"Optics, Jamie. If the headlines turn ugly, we’ll look like we’re courting scandal.\"\nWhitlock’s eyes flicked to him. \"Optics,\" he said softly, \"are what we control best.\"\n\"Listen carefully,\" he said, his tone measured and cold. \"We are not in the business of morality. We are in the business of permanence. Governments fall. Companies burn. Money endures. And right now, the Bellemere Family Office represents the next century of it. This is a technology that the big four tech companies will probably be never be able to replicate. This is a monopoly. This is our game and we play to win!\"\nNo one spoke. Even the sound of rain seemed to fade.\n\"Lock down every internal reference to Liam Scott, Nova Technologies, or Bellemere. Executive-eyes only. Rename the archive ’Project Horizon.’\"\nCharlotte raised an eyebrow. \"Why Horizon?\"\nWhitlock’s mouth curved faintly. \"Because we’re standing on the edge of one—and I intend for this bank to be the first to step across.\"\nThe words hung in the room like prophecy.\nMarianne closed her tablet and looked up. \"We’ll maintain discreet contact through Daniel Conley. Nothing formal, nothing on record.\"\nWhitlock nodded. \"Good. Keep the bridge standing but make it invisible.\"\nWhitmore hesitated, glancing between them. \"And if the regulators press harder?\"\nThe CEO’s reply was quiet, almost weary. \"Then we remind them that JP Morgan doesn’t hide clients. We protect global stability, and sometimes those two things are the same.\"\nMarianne exhaled softly. \"And if this ’stability’ becomes too big for us to hold?\"\nWhitlock gave her a faint smile. \"Then we hold on tighter. You were also the one that said he’s a priority client. We can’t afford to back out ever.\"\nCharlotte scribbled notes on her pad, already structuring the legal firewall in her head. \"We’ll prepare a tiered response tree — OCC first, Treasury second, FBI last. Anything higher goes through my office.\"\nWhitmore added, \"And the press?\"\n\"PR will issue a statement at market close,\" Whitlock said. \"One paragraph. Keep it dull. ’JP Morgan Private Bank provides fiduciary infrastructure to a broad range of clients and is not operationally involved in their ventures.’ Nothing defensive, nothing emotional.\"\nMarianne smirked faintly. \"Boring enough to be believable.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Whitlock said. \"Noise dies when there’s nothing to feed on.\"\nHe paused, his gaze distant. \"Still, we prepare for the storm. If this boy’s invention rewrites technology, markets will follow. So will capital flows. Every sovereign fund, hedge, and pension will chase him. We make sure that chase leads back through us.\"\nWhitmore grimaced. \"You’re turning a liability into an opportunity.\"\nWhitlock looked over his shoulder. \"That’s banking, Thomas.\"\nThe rain thickened outside, streaking the glass with silver rivers. Lightning flashed faintly somewhere over the Hudson.\nCharlotte looked up again. \"Do we reach out to Washington pre-emptively? Offer cooperation to buy goodwill?\"\n\"No,\" Whitlock said firmly. \"We let them come to us. If we move first, we look frightened. Fear costs leverage. We project calm, nothing else.\"\nMarianne added, \"And Bellemere?\"\n\"Send a note through Geneva. Congratulate them on their continued growth. Offer any service they need — discreetly. Make sure they know we’re still their bank of choice.\"\nWhitmore raised a brow. \"And if Liam Scott decides he doesn’t need banks anymore?\"\nWhitlock turned back toward the window, a ghost of a smile tracing his lips. \"Then we’ll remind him that even gods need accountants.\"\nFor a long moment, no one spoke. The weight of what that meant settled over the table like fog.\nSomewhere deep below, traffic horns echoed faintly through the rain.\nMarianne gathered her notes. \"We’ll brief the regional heads tonight. The Family Office network will need reassurance.\"\n\"Do it,\" Whitlock said. \"Tell them this isn’t contagion. It’s evolution.\"\nHe looked around the room one last time, his voice steady. \"History’s written by those who stay solvent. Make sure we do.\"\nThe executives rose, chairs scraping softly against the floor. Aides entered with tablets and sealed folders. Phones buzzed; memos were drafted. The bank’s defense machine whirred quietly to life.\nWhitlock lingered behind, watching the city lights flicker through the rain-streaked glass. His reflection looked older than he remembered.\n\"A boy builds a miracle,\" he murmured to no one. \"And everyone else builds defenses. Typical.\"\nHe straightened his tie, gathered his notes, and turned toward the door.\n\"Let’s make sure that when this storm passes,\" he said under his breath, \"the only bank left standing beside him— is ours.\"",

The frenzy, the disbelief, the corporate panic — it was all part of the equation. What he didn’t expect, however, was the particular twist that came out of Washington.\nThe United States government had formally classified Lucid as potentially non-terrestrial technology.\nThat part made him laugh. Actually, burst into laughter. He had to pause the stream because he was laughing too hard to read the subtitles.\n\"Alien tech,\" he muttered under his breath, shaking his head in disbelief. \"They really said alien tech.\"\nBut when the amusement settled, he found himself quietly impressed. From their perspective, it wasn’t an entirely unreasonable conclusion.\nTo the outside world, Lucid had appeared out of thin air. There was manufacturing leaks. No patents was registered. No press releases. No visible shipping records. The devices simply appeared overnight on reviewers’ doorsteps — silently, invisibly, flawlessly.\nThere was also no drone shadows or airspace signatures.\nThen came the unboxing videos and the shocking livestreams.\nIf he were sitting on the other side of the equation, he’d probably assume the same thing: something otherworldly had landed.\nAlien technology? Maybe not so far-fetched after all.\nStill, he couldn’t help smirking. \"Well,\" he murmured, \"if they think I’m an alien, at least they won’t try to tax me.\"\n\"Lucy,\" Liam said lazily, \"current viewer count?\"\n\"As of five minutes ago, cumulative livestream viewership across all ten reviewers is at 1.62 billion unique viewers.\"\nLiam nodded slowly, a satisfied smile forming.\nMore than one and a half billion people, all watching the livestreams. It was a pretty neat number and he was pretty satisfied with it.\nCurrently, what the tech reviewers was doing, after confirming the insane capabilities of the device and the unparalleled quality of the games it, and its contents, was testing the device’s battery.\nThough there’s no battery icon to show how much juice the device has left, the tech reviewers feels that it’s impossible for the device to last forever without needing charging.\nBut they will be left shocked when they hit their daily 12 hours usage limit of the device, and the device still hasn’t ran out of battery, because it can never run out of battery.\nOn the screens before him, the top tech reviewers were still testing. They were all currently gaming and they have found themselves almost addicted to the games.\nThe viewers, of course, were obsessed. Comment sections were flooded with debates.\n\"No way that thing lasts sixteen hours. Nothing that powerful does.\"\n\"He’s lying, it’s plugged into something off-camera.\"\n\"The hell kind of battery tech is this?\"\n\"Wait— why does it even need a time limit? If I buy it, I should use it whenever I want.\"\nThe arguments flared across forums and social media like wildfire. Some praised the limit as \"a humane feature\" that prevented addiction. Others called it \"corporate babysitting.\"\nA few conspiracy threads even claimed the limit was \"neural protection\" — proof that Lucid’s technology interfered directly with the brain.\nLiam read them all with amusement.\n\"Humans really do love to fight over what they don’t understand,\" he mused.\nStill, he knew how this part of the story would end. When the sixteen-hour mark hit and the devices didn’t die, the shock would ripple through the internet again.\nThe truth was simple — Lucid didn’t have a battery in the conventional sense. It drew energy directly from a stabilized quantum field, harvesting zero-point energy. Infinite power, zero waste. It could run forever.\nIf only they knew, but they never will.\nHe leaned back, hands clasped behind his head.\nThe first pre-order batch alone had generated more than $670,000 in profit. The number was small compared to his wealth, but it wasn’t about the revenue. It was about momentum.\nEach unit sold was a seed planted in the mind of the world. And next month, there would be two thousand more.\nThen fewer the following month — just to create scarcity — before doubling production again. A rhythm of desire and denial. He would control the pulse of supply until Lucid became invaluable to everyone.\nBut there was one problem he couldn’t quite ignore; the deliveries.\nThe invisible overnight drops had worked perfectly for the tech reviewers — no witnesses, no leaks, no traceable air traffic.\nBut now? The second phase would include top gamer streamers — personalities with tens of millions of followers. Their entire brands revolved around constant exposure.\nAnd worse, they’d already started posting about it.\n\"Lucid delivery in 3 days! We’ll stream the whole thing LIVE.\"\n\"You guys wanted to see how it arrives? You got it.\"\n\"Apparently no courier, no drone, nothing. We’ll see about that.\"\nLiam sighed, rubbing his temple.\n\"Of course they’ll stream it,\" he muttered. \"That’s what they do.\"\nNow the question was whether to keep the same stealth system or let the world see the drones.\nIf the drones appeared on live broadcast — shimmering in daylight, emerging from nowhere — it would detonate another round of hysteria.\nEvery government would scramble again. Every corporation would scream espionage.\nEvery satellite operator would go insane trying to track what couldn’t be tracked.\nFor a brief moment, he considered staying hidden — keeping the illusion of magic alive.\nBut then he smiled, as chaos was far more entertaining. He will go with them making public appearances.\nDecision made, he stretched his arms and turned back to the screens. The reviewers were now switching games — from Frontline: Starfall Dominion to Genesis Sandbox. Millions of viewers were losing their minds in the chat.\n\"This is better than real life.\"\n\"How do you even go back to normal gaming after this?\"\n\"Go back? A control pad already feels ancient! This is witchcraft, brother.\"\nHe watched the comments scroll endlessly. He knew that in three days, this will double again.\nHe even toyed with the idea of reducing the daily limit to six hours — just to make people crave more.\nIt was tempting. But for now, he decided against it.\n***\nOutside, Los Angeles shimmered under the glow of late evening. The news networks hadn’t stopped talking for a single minute.\nAnalysts were losing their minds on live TV.\n\"We’re witnessing a paradigm shift in human-computer interaction.\"\n\"This level of neural integration is decades ahead of DARPA.\"\n\"If this product actually launches publicly, global tech markets will have to reset their valuation models.\"\nApplē, Gōōgle, Sāmsūng — all down between 2.8 and 3.2 percent. Sōñny had dropped 4.1. Mētā — now the self-proclaimed gatekeeper of virtual reality — was collapsing fastest, sliding past a 5% drop in a single afternoon.\nAnalysts were already predicting a 20% cumulative sector decline before week’s end and Mētā will suffer the heaviest of blows.\nOne CNBC anchor nearly shouted into the camera, \"If Lucid actually goes public next week, it could wipe a quarter trillion dollars off global tech valuations overnight!\"\nLiam tilted his head, with a small smile on his face. The chaos outside his walls was growing louder by the minute — but here, inside his quiet room, there was only stillness.",

      "content": "Chapter 191: Playing A Game Of Chess\nBellemere Mansion, Los Angeles.\nMorning sunlight poured through the tall glass windows of the mansion, diffusing softly across the polished marble floors.\nLiam walked calmly through the quiet corridor, his mind already awake and active. He had finished his morning routine not long ago and had also taken a short visit to the cultivation world for his daily sign-in; he got 100,000 Gold Coins and 500 Low Grade Spirit Stones rewards.\nNow, he was on his way to the study. Daniel was waiting for him there.\nThe man had called early that morning, saying \"There’s something important we need to discuss, sir.\"\nThat alone had been enough for Liam to guess what the topic would be. It had to be Lucid — and perhaps the results of the FAA’s so-called \"routine inspection.\"\nHe pushed open the door to the study.\nDaniel Conley stood from the leather chair by the desk the moment Liam entered.\n\"Good morning, sir,\" he said with a respectful nod.\n\"Morning, Daniel,\" Liam replied, his tone even. \"You said you had something important.\"\nDaniel waited until Liam had taken his seat before speaking. He glanced briefly at his tablet, then met Liam’s eyes.\n\"Yes, sir. The inspection on the A380 is officially complete,\" he began. \"The FAA found nothing irregular. The aircraft is cleared for unrestricted operation. They’ve issued a formal statement of appreciation for your ’cooperation and transparency.’ In short, sir, the Flying Palace is yours to fly again — without restrictions.\"\nLiam leaned back in the chair, an amused smile tugging at the corner of his lips. \"That’s good news,\" he said. \"Though I already knew they wouldn’t find anything.\"\nDaniel allowed himself a faint smile. \"Of course. Still, it’s official now. The only thing I would advise, sir, is discretion. The federal agencies haven’t lost interest. They’re still watching — very closely.\"\nLiam nodded once. \"I’m fully aware of that. Go on.\"\nDaniel tapped his tablet, bringing up another file. \"The White House has made first contact. They’ve sent a liaison from the National Economic Council to reach out to you.\"\nLiam raised an eyebrow. \"To reach out? How diplomatic of them.\"\nDaniel gave a dry chuckle. \"Yes, sir. Publicly, they’ll release a statement praising your ’entrepreneurial vision’ and your contributions to innovation. Privately, however, the liaison’s task is to take your measure — to determine if you’re dangerous or if you have any technology poses a national-security threat. They’ve also extended a discreet invitation to Washington for a private dinner or meeting. The tone is cordial, but the purpose is evaluation.\"\nLiam’s expression didn’t change, but his eyes sharpened slightly. \"Interesting.\"\nDaniel continued, scrolling through his notes. \"It doesn’t stop there. Several U.S. embassies have begun informal outreach, offering tax incentives, business partnerships, and introductions to key government figures. Their goal is simple: to keep you anchored here — to ensure you stay invested in American soil.\"\nHe paused for a moment before adding, \"Outside the U.S., other players are moving as well. HSBC Private, Coutts, and Barclays Wealth have all contacted the Family Office, each offering specialized portfolios and incentives to relocate part of your wealth to London. Their message is clear: they want your assets in the U.K.\"\nLiam’s smile widened slightly. \"The British always move fast when money’s involved.\"\nDaniel nodded. \"Indeed, sir. Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy in Washington sent ’friendly congratulations’ through official diplomatic channels. The message was framed as interest in luxury and technology cooperation. Nothing direct — but enough to signal intent.\"\nHe swiped to another page. \"From the Middle East, it’s more open. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar have all sent advance notices that their luxury envoys will arrive in Los Angeles within a week. They’re inviting you to visit their capitals — Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, and Doha — to discuss sovereign-fund partnerships. They’re offering access to major infrastructure and innovation projects. Billions are on the table.\"\nLiam chuckled quietly, almost shaking his head. \"All of this... because of an aircraft?\"\n\"Partly,\" Daniel said. \"But mostly because of what you represent — an independent power center they can’t quantify or control.\"\nHe took a breath before continuing. \"Lastly, there’s JP Morgan.\"\nLiam’s attention sharpened slightly.\nDaniel went on, his tone careful but confident. \"They reached out yesterday through their Private Banking network. They congratulated you on Lucid’s launch and expressed interest in strengthening their relationship with Bellemere. Their proposal is ambitious — they want to establish a Private Holding Trust domiciled in Switzerland, with JP Morgan as the global trustee. Officially, it’s for asset diversification and international risk management. But in truth, sir, they’re trying to tie your wealth permanently to their custody network.\"\nHe looked up. \"It’s a strategic move. They’re offering to use their influence as leverage. According to their message, their lobbying divisions are already nudging congressional committees toward ’measured regulation of neural tech.’ In other words, they’re protecting Nova Technologies from any aggressive legislation.\"\nLiam tilted his head slightly, intrigued. \"Go on.\"\n\"They’re also deploying what they call ’mirror nodes,’\" Daniel said. \"Essentially, fake Nova payment signatures. These decoys will appear in global transaction systems, redirecting any hostile trace attempts back to JP Morgan instead of to you. It’s a shield, of sorts — one that makes them look like the center of Nova’s network.\"\nA low hum of approval escaped Liam’s throat. \"Impressive. They’re protecting themselves, of course, but they’re protecting me in the process.\"\nDaniel smiled faintly. \"Exactly, sir. Mutual benefit.\"\nLiam leaned back, thoughtful. \"You’ve done well to summarize it. Most of this, I already anticipated. Still, it’s amusing. Nations and corporations circling like sharks — all because of one plane and a few toys.\"\nHe wonder how they would react when they find out that he’s the richest person in the world or about Lucid.\nBut he knew that both will take a while. It will be even more for Lucid, as he estimates that if JP Morgan continues to keep their lips sealed, it will take at least a year before they find out.\nBut as for him being the world’s richest person, he’s giving them a few weeks to a month or two, before they find out. He wasn’t sure when exactly, but he knew that it wouldn’t take too long.\nNow, back to everything Daniel said, Liam was pretty interested. He tapped his finger idly against the armrest, his voice calm but thoughtful. \"The U.S. will try to contain me, of course. Keep me within their system. The others will compete to pull me out. Typical geopolitical tug-of-war.\"\nHe turned his gaze toward the window, where the morning sun glinted off the distant skyline. \"But I won’t let them dictate the game. If they want to compete for me, then I’ll let them — against each other.\"\nA faint smile formed on his lips. \"We’ll make them think they’re winning, when really, they’re just bidding higher.\"\nDaniel studied him quietly. The young man’s composure never ceased to impress him. Where most billionaires panicked at the thought of government scrutiny, Liam seemed almost entertained by it.\nAfter a few moments, Liam spoke again. \"Still, before I start playing with governments, I need to handle JP Morgan properly. They’re not doing all this from kindness. There’s profit somewhere — there always is.\"\nHe looked back at Daniel. \"But that’s good. Mutual profit builds loyalty. When both sides gain, betrayal becomes expensive.\"\nDaniel nodded in agreement. \"Precisely, sir. I believe we should accept their proposal. Having JP Morgan as a shield — and an ally — will make things easier when the world discovers Nova’s true ownership. It keeps us legitimate and insulated.\"\nLiam’s gaze was distant but calculating. \"Yes... it would also grant us access to their intelligence network and political reach. They’re woven into every corner of the financial world.\"\nHe smiled faintly. \"If the world wants to play politics, I’ll play economics. They make laws; I make markets.\"\nDaniel’s lips curved in a knowing smile. \"Then you intend to accept their offer?\"\nLiam nodded slowly. \"Yes. Accept it — but make our terms clear. We’ll cooperate, but not surrender control. They can manage the trust, but we decide its flow. And make sure they understand — Bellemere remains sovereign.\"\n\"Understood, sir,\" Daniel said, taking notes.\nLiam leaned forward slightly. \"Also, send word to Geneva. Have them draft a mirrored holding structure under Bellemere, something that can’t be pierced legally — just in case JP Morgan’s goodwill ever runs dry.\"\n\"Already in motion,\" Daniel replied. \"I anticipated you’d ask.\"\nLiam gave him an approving nod. \"Good. That’s why I keep you close.\"\nNow, Liam has to make a decision on how he was going to deal with the world’s governments.",

      "content": "Chapter 192: Yanxia\n\"So you’re certain, sir?\" Daniel asked after a brief silence.\n\"Completely,\" Liam replied, his tone smooth and unhurried. \"We’ll accept the White House invitation. I’ll attend the meeting tomorrow.\"\nDaniel inclined his head slightly, noting the decision in his tablet.\n\"And the other invitations?\"\n\"Also accepted,\" Liam said.\nDaniel looked up. \"Strategically, it’s a bold move, sir. The optics—\"\n\"—will keep them guessing,\" Liam cut in gently. \"The Americans will stay alert, paranoid I might shift allegiance. The others will watch closely, desperate to court me.\"\nHe leaned back in his chair, fingertips pressed together. \"Schedule my White House meeting for tomorrow. I’ll give them their polite conversation, smile for their cameras, and tell them nothing useful. Then, two or three days later, arrange the flight to Dubai.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Daniel said. He hesitated a moment, then added, \"If I may be blunt, this approach will put every government on alert. You’ll be treated like a sovereign power, not a private citizen.\"\nLiam’s smile deepened. \"That’s exactly what I want.\"\n\"You see, Daniel,\" Liam said, hands clasped behind his back, \"most billionaires live in fear of government—of regulation, taxation, exposure. They rely on the system that feeds them. I am not one of them. The U.S. can’t strong-arm me. They can’t subpoena what they can’t find. If they ever try to tighten the leash, I’ll simply remind them what happens if I pull my money out.\"\nDaniel raised an eyebrow. \"You mean—\"\n\"—a withdrawal threat,\" Liam said simply. \"They don’t know the true scale of my holdings, but they can guess. They’ve already assumed my U.S. investments are in the tens of billions. If I even hint at liquidating, their markets will tremble. Congress will panic. Treasury will beg for restraint. It’ll never come to that, of course,\" he added with a small smile.\nBut yes, withdrawing his investment was impossible because he can’t sell his shares but the US government doesn’t know that and they never will.\nDaniel gave a soft chuckle. \"Understood, sir. A scare tactic with real consequences — if they believe it.\"\n\"Oh, they will,\" Liam said, his voice calm but edged with certainty.\nLiam was more than certain that the US government would fall for it. He also plans to use the same tactics when Nova Technologies’ ownership eventually surfaces. By then, it will already be revealed that he has hundreds of billions of dollars invested in major companies in the country. Do they dare to risk an economic meltdown?\nHe was also aware that then, Europe will play the same game. They’ll demand oversight, threaten investigations, and talk about sanctions. And that’s when the bearer bonds come into play.\nThe Rothschild will serve as his silent shield. They would be his channel to Europe. When the EU tries to push too hard, he would make sure they have a choice—either pay dearly to keep close or shut their mouths and enjoy the profits. And he knew they would choose the latter.\nLiam knew that once he has both the U.S. and Europe balanced, no one can touch him. The US government will see him as a strategic asset. The Europeans will see him as too expensive to lose. Holding both sides of the West in his hands will be extremely advantageous to him.\n\"I’ll make the necessary preparations immediately, sir. The jet will be ready for Washington tomorrow morning,\" Daniel said, gave a small nod.\n\"Good,\" Liam said.\nDaniel picked his tablet and stood up from his seat. \"I’ll take my leave now and begin arrangements.\"\nLiam nodded. \"Thank you, Daniel.\"\nAs the man exited the study, Liam exhaled softly and allowed his composure to relax. But his mind was already drifting toward something far more intriguing — the life stirring in the crimson shell of the Three-Legged Golden Crow’s egg.\nLiam rose from his seat and headed upstairs. When he entered his room, the air seemed to still around him, almost anticipating what would come next. Without hesitation, he vanished.\n***\nInside the Dimensional Space, the vast metallic plains of the mega-construction stretched before him. The great manufacturing complex had nearly reached completion.\nBut Liam paid it little attention today. His focus was drawn elsewhere. Through his bond with the creature, he had felt a pulsing, warm signal through his consciousness, like a heartbeat echoing from afar. The egg was stirring.\nHe flew swiftly across the Dimensional horizon, the wind rippling through his hair as he crossed the plains toward the quiet glade where he had left the egg resting.\nWhen he arrived, the air shimmered faintly with heat. The ground around the nest was scorched in a perfect circle, the soil dark and cracked. The crimson egg sat in the center, trembling slightly. The faint golden lines pulsed along its surface, glowing brighter with each rhythmic movement.\nLiam landed softly a few feet away. He folded his arms and watched, with a small smile on his face.\n\"So,\" he murmured, \"you’ve finally decided to wake up.\"\nThe egg shook harder now, the cracks spidering across the shell like living fire. Each fissure glowed molten gold, releasing thin wisps of smoke that curled upward in the warm air.\nThen, with a sharp crack, a fragment broke free. A tiny head emerged—sleek, feathered in red so bright it seemed to glow, its eyes like miniature suns.\nLiam’s smile deepened. \"Beautiful.\"\nThe young Golden Crow blinked once, then twice, as if adjusting to the light. Its gaze fell on him immediately. Then, with an eager chirp, the creature let out a sound like a soft flame bursting to life.\nThe temperature around them surged. Flames rippled faintly across the ground as the bird struggled, tearing free from the shell in a small explosion of light and heat.\nWhen the brilliance faded, Liam found himself staring at the newborn Three-Legged Golden Crow.\nIt stood shakily at first, wings half-unfurled. Its feathers glowed in radiant crimson hues, each one tipped with molten gold. A faint aura of fire danced around its body, but it wasn’t destructive. Rather, it was warm, vibrant and alive. Its three legs gleamed with faint runic patterns, that looked ancient.\nThe creature was roughly the size of a human newborn — small enough to cradle, yet regal in presence. It tilted its head curiously at him, eyes gleaming like twin suns reflected on a calm ocean.\nLiam crouched down slowly and extended his hand. The bird hesitated for only a heartbeat before hopping forward with surprising grace. It buried itself against his chest, its body radiating gentle warmth.\nLiam let out a soft chuckle, carefully wrapping his arms around it. \"So it’s you, little one.\"\nHe could feel its heartbeat syncing faintly with his own. Through the bond, he sensed intelligence—raw, bright, curious. And surprisingly... feminine.\n\"A girl, huh?\" he murmured. \"That explains the attitude.\"\nHe smiled to himself and examined her closely. The feathers shimmered when they caught light, glowing faintly even in shadow. Tiny embers danced off her wings whenever she moved, fading before they touched the ground.\nHer aura was magnificent. It was fierce but not wild. Even freshly hatched, she exuded the kind of presence that lesser beasts would worship instinctively.\nHe thought for a moment, then said softly, \"You need a name.\"\nThe Golden Crow tilted her head, as if listening.\n\"Let’s see...\" Liam mused. \"You’re fire, divine, and beautiful. How about... Yanxia?\"\nThe moment he spoke the name, the air shimmered. Flames rippled briefly across her feathers, glowing brighter and brighter until they flared in radiant approval.\nLiam laughed softly, feeling the surge of warmth through their bond. \"So you like it, huh? Yanxia it is.\"\nThe temperature spiked for an instant — not painfully, but enough to make him feel as if the sun itself had smiled at him. Then, just as quickly, it subsided.\nLiam rubbed her head gently, the soft feathers surprisingly cool to the touch beneath the living flame. \"Welcome to the family, Yanxia.\"\nThe bird chirped again, pressing closer into his arms, and he felt a sense of joy bloom within him.",

      "content": "Chapter 193: Shocking Information From System\nYanxia refused to leave Liam’s side. The newborn Three-Legged Golden Crow nestled herself against his shoulder, feathers shimmering faintly with living flame.\nHer warmth radiated across his neck and cheek. It was soft like basking beneath a newborn sun that had yet to decide whether to burn or nurture.\nLiam smiled faintly as he rubbed her head. The firelight reflecting off her feathers cast golden ripples across his face, flickering like dawn through his calm eyes.\nHer tiny claws flexed, gripping gently onto his sleeve as she chirped contentedly and nuzzled closer into the curve of his neck.\nHe could feel her heartbeat, steady and strong, syncing with his own through their spiritual bond. For all her divine heritage, she was still just a child — one born of the sun, but seeking warmth from him.\nYanxia had already devoured her shell the moment she hatched, swallowing it whole in a swirl of molten light that melted into her aura.\nThe system had explained that it was instinct — the shell contained the condensed solar essence she needed to stabilize her flame-born body.\nLiam rubbed her head again gently. \"You’re quite the clingy one,\" he murmured, smiling. \"Guess I’m stuck with you now.\"\nYanxia chirped softly, her golden eyes half-lidded as if to say,\nyou were mine the moment you named me.\nLiam chuckled lightly, but then his gaze turned distant.\n\"System, tell me everything I need to know about the Void Beasts — and how to capture and tame a Voidling,\" he asked.\n[The Host need not worry about being attacked. Void Beasts are not predators.]\nLiam frowned slightly. \"Not predators?\"\n[Correct. They spend most of their lifespan in slumber, passively absorbing dark energy from the cosmos. They are functionally immortal and feed on nothing else.]\n[Void Beasts exist to maintain balance. They are drawn to areas of excessive dark energy or dark matter — regions on the brink of cosmic instability. Their presence restores equilibrium over millennia. Once balance is achieved, they drift onward to the next unstable zone.]\n\"Then they’re... caretakers?\" Liam asked quietly, eyes narrowing in thought.\n[Correct. They are not destroyers, but regulators. The universe depends on their existence to remain stable.]\nYanxia tilted her head, as if looking for who Liam was talking to.\n[The places they inhabit are divided into two categories: newborn regions of the universe — where dark energy accumulates faster than it can disperse — and ancient, dying regions, where entropy has long overtaken creation. The first births light; the second devours it.]\nLiam blinked slowly, his brows furrowing. \"Newborn regions... and ancient deadly zones.\"\nHe fell silent for a moment, then frowned in realisation.\n\"Wait. The Milky Way is in a newborn region, isn’t it?\"\n[Affirmative.]\nLiam rubbed his temple as he processed that. He understood the system’s nature well enough by now to know that its definitions weren’t human. When it said something was \"deadly,\" it didn’t mean dangerous to mortals. It probably meant lethal to gods.\nAnd when it called something \"newborn,\" that could still mean billions of years old.\nFor a being — or whatever the system was — that could manipulate entire reality like data files, \"young\" and \"old\" were relative. And that realization made his stomach tighten with awe.\nHe exhaled slowly, as he asked, \"System, how old is my universe? And... how young is the region I’m in compared to it?\"\n[Your universe is as ancient as the other two. It is boundless, and its true age exceeds quantifiable time. The difference lies not in its years, but its laws.]\n[Unlike the others, your universe lacks higher entities to maintain its equilibrium. There are no Gods, no Grand Dao — only the Void Beasts, who serve as its natural regulators. But their influence is limited. In such a vast and restrictive cosmos, they can only balance, not guide.]\n[The region that contains the Milky Way is barely one hundred billion years old. Your galaxy itself — the Milky Way — is roughly forty billion years old.]\nLiam froze. \"Forty... billion?\"\nHe felt Yanxia stir slightly, her warmth grounding him as his mind tried to grasp the scale. He couldn’t even fully comprehend the number. His throat tightened.\nHe had read scientific theories about the universe’s age — thirteen to fourteen billion years, according to human cosmology. But the system’s words made that sound like the age of a child compared to the reality of the cosmos.\nHis home — the galaxy that housed the solar system that Earth is in, the stars, and everything humanity had ever known — was barely a blink in the life of the universe.\nA chill ran down his spine, as he spoke in a low voice, \"Scientists would kill for this information,\" he murmured under his breath. \"And I’m just... hearing it like it’s trivia.\"\nYanxia chirped softly, nuzzling his cheek as if to comfort him.\nHe gave a small, humorless laugh. \"Yeah, I know, little one. Perspective hurts.\"\nBut that faint feeling of dread slowly gave way to realization.\nIf the system was right, and his universe had no divine management, no supreme beings pulling strings... then maybe that was the point.\nThen maybe he...\nThe thought immediately sent a chill through him. It was heavier than fear or awe. It was like a pressure that settled on his shoulders like invisible chains.\nHe shook his head sharply, forcing the thought away.\n\"No,\" he muttered. \"No. I’m just overthinking.\"\n[Host is advised not to overthink. Focus on the immediate objective — taming the Voidling.]\n\"Right,\" Liam said, exhaling. \"How do I do that, exactly?\"\n[You have the necessary resources. Entice the Voidling with spirit stones and mana stones — as many as you can spare.]\nHe blinked. \"Entice it... with spirit stones?\"\n[Correct.]\n\"Explain.\"\n[Void Beasts absorb dark energy passively and they love dark energy. However, they are also attracted to exotic energy signatures — unfamiliar forms of condensed power. Spirit stones and mana stones are filled with concentrated spiritual and elemental energy. To Void Beasts, these energies are a delicacy — rare and enticing.]\n[If you offer sufficient quantities, the Voidling will approach of its own accord. Once it recognizes you as a consistent source of sustenance, taming will be achievable.]\nLiam raised an eyebrow. \"So I’m bribing it.\"\n[You are establishing dependency.]\nHe couldn’t help but smile faintly at that. \"That’s one way to put it.\"\nYanxia chirped, clearly uninterested in whatever Liam was talking about. She spread her small wings and yawned, a flicker of gold flame escaping her beak before she settled again. Liam chuckled and stroked her head gently.\nHe leaned back, thinking. \"If these creatures are as massive as the system described... I’ll probably need millions — maybe billions — of spirit and mana stones. Enough to light up a solar system.\"\nHe sighed, rubbing his temple. \"That’s going to take time.\"\nAnd time was the one thing he felt slipping through his fingers. Each passing day, he was growing stronger and wealthier but still not cultivating. Still standing at the edge of something vast, waiting.\nHe clenched his fist. \"System... should I really wait until I tame the Voidling before starting cultivation?\"\n[Yes. If you begin cultivation now, you will only be able to progress through a single system — Qi cultivation or mana cultivation. That path will eventually limit your growth. Combining the three energy systems — Qi, Mana, and Dark Energy — will create the only perfect foundation.]\nLiam exhaled slowly. The logic was unshakable, but it didn’t quiet the hunger stirring within him.\nHe wanted to move. To ascend. To stop waiting. But he knew the system was right. He knew that he has to wait to enjoy the full benefits.\nHe sighed once more and called for Lucy, as it was time to start building his spacecraft. He would build the world’s first starship and a huge one at that.\nHe was probably about to add more chaos, in addition to his private A380 and Lucid.",

      "content": "Chapter 194: Starship Plan\nWhen Lucy arrived, she paused at the threshold of the study — her gaze immediately drawn to the small, radiant creature perched on Liam’s shoulder.\nThe newborn Three-Legged Golden Crow shimmered softly, her feathers glowing in hues of molten gold and deep sunrise red. Each delicate movement left faint ripples of heat in the air, like sunlight passing through glass.\nFor once, Lucy was silent. She simply observed, her expression carrying a rare sense of wonder..\n\"Her name is Yanxia,\" Liam said. \"She hatched earlier.\"\nLucy inclined her head respectfully, though her eyes remained fixed on the creature.\n\"A beautiful companion, Master,\" she said softly. \"But... where did she come from?\"\nLiam smiled, \"A story for another time.\"\nLucy blinked, processing the words carefully. She had learned long ago not to question things she wasn’t meant to understand.\n\"I see,\" she said simply\nThere were countless things about her master she didn’t know — and she didn’t intend to ask. She preferred to wait until he decided to share them himself. After all, anything he created or summoned was always for a reason, even if that reason lay beyond comprehension.\n\"Understood, Master. Shall we discuss the starship?\"\nAt that, Liam’s expression sharpened. \"Yes. Let’s begin.\"\nThe first step in building the ship wasn’t the design; it was the location.\nSince he didn’t have to worry about being devoured by a moon-sized space whale, he could take his time to build something simple.\nBut Liam’s definition of \"simple\" was unlike anyone else’s. His version of simplicity still meant scale, ambition, and secrecy that would shake the world if discovered.\n\"The far side is perfect,\" he said after a moment of quiet thought. \"No direct line of sight from Earth. Always hidden, always quiet.\"\nLucy nodded in agreement. \"It is an ideal choice. The Moon’s rotation is tidally locked. The same face always points toward Earth, leaving the opposite side permanently out of view. That area is free from Earth’s electromagnetic interference. No radar, no radio, no thermal scans.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Liam said. \"We’ll keep it there — invisible to every telescope and satellite.\"\n\"The far side also contains the South Pole–Aitken basin,\" Lucy continued, her tone practical. \"It’s deep and rich in titanium and helium-3. Both are valuable for energy production and construction. The regolith also holds sub-surface ice. Hydrogen, oxygen, and fuel sources are available in abundance. We won’t have to transmutate those.\"\nLiam’s eyes narrowed slightly in approval. \"Then we’ll use it all. The base will be built on the surface — under the craters — and the shipyard itself will be stationed a few hundred kilometers above it, synchronized with the Moon’s rotation. It’ll stay hidden behind it at all times.\"\nLucy nodded. \"I’ll make the necessary adjustments to every deep-space telemetry feed that could view that region. If any probe tries to scan, I’ll distort the readings. The area will appear as static radiation.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam said quietly. \"No one can know this exists.\"\nHe fell silent for a moment, thinking. A project like this wasn’t just about scale — it was about secrecy.\nThe last thing he wanted was for the world’s governments to catch even a glimpse of what was going on. This was completely different from Lucid. The shock factor will be severe.\n\"Start construction on the lunar base first,\" he said. \"We’ll need fabrication sites, storage hangars, and refining units for helium-3 and titanium. Once that’s complete, we’ll begin assembling the ship in orbit above it.\"\n\"Yes, Master,\" Lucy said. \"The shipyard’s layout?\"\n\"Let’s take care of the base first.\"\n\"As you wish.\"\nLiam paused. \"One more thing — build me a hybrid exosuit. I’ll need to inspect the progress in person.\"\n\"Yes, sir. I’ll start designing it immediately,\" she said. \"It will be resistant to all known forms of radiation and temperature variation.\"\n\"That’s what I need,\" Liam replied.\nThe exosuit was very important because during the building of the starship, Liam would want to visit the base to check on the progress of things.\nYes, Lucy would send him image and videos along with daily reports on the progress of the project, but Liam wasn’t interested in that. Also, the exosuit will be important for when he wants to give the Voidling the treats, as he would have to leave the spacecraft to do that.\nLucy inclined her head. \"Understood. It will be ready soon.\"\nHe nodded lightly. \"Good. I’ll check on something while you work.\nSince Lucy was already working on the exosuit, Liam decided to take a look around the Dimensional Space, looking for where the Qi from the Eternal Qi Vein was concentrated.\nIf the Qi Vein truly functioned as a living artery, then there should be points where its flow condensed — springs, wells, or pools where Qi liquefied under its own purity.\nWith Yanxia perched gracefully on his shoulder, he rose into the sky. His figure blurred into motion, gliding effortlessly over mountain-like spires and luminous plains.\nThe search stretched on endlessly. But after nearly a day, he found what he was looking for. It was actually Yanxia that found it.\nShe began chirping excitedly, her feathers glowing brighter as she tugged at his sleeve with her beak. Liam followed her lead and soon, his telekinetic sense picked up something within a crater far below.\nHe descended and when he reached the bottom, he saw a pool of liquified Qi.\nIt glowed softly, though it had no color. The light seemed alive, like breath made visible. The air was thick with energy, dense enough to make even breathing feel heavy.\nYanxia didn’t hesitate. She jumped from his shoulder and dove straight into the pool.\n\"Careful—\" he began, but she was already gone.\nA few seconds later, she burst out again, droplets scattering like stars, and something glittered in her beak. It was a spirit stone and it didn’t look like it was a low grade one either.\nLiam caught it as she threw it into his hands, examining its flawless clarity.\n\"High-grade?\" he murmured. \"So this is what the Vein’s been producing.\"\nYanxia chirped proudly, diving again. Each time she surfaced, another stone gleamed in her beak.\nLiam smiled, shaking his head. \"You’re enjoying yourself, aren’t you?\"\nShe gave a soft trill, dropping another stone into his palm.\nHe pocketed the growing collection, still smiling. \"Looks like I’ll have no shortage of resources soon. Hopefully, by the time the ship’s complete, we’ll have millions of these. Hopefully...\"\nYanxia puffed her feathers in satisfaction. She was perched on a nearby rock, watching Liam with intelligent eyes. When he told her he needed to leave, she chirped in protest, hopping onto his palm.\nLiam chuckled. \"You don’t want me to go?\"\nShe shook her head, her feathers ruffling indignantly.\n\"I can’t take you out yet,\" he explained gently.\nAnother sharp chirp — unmistakable refusal.\nLiam smiled, an idea forming. \"Tell you what — if you can shapeshift into your human form, I’ll take you with me.\"\nYanxia tilted her head, eyes narrowing suspiciously as though questioning if he meant it.\n\"I’m serious,\" Liam said, smiling. \"No tricks.\"\nShe looked down at her reflection in the pool, then back at him. With a soft trill, she hopped off his hand and dove back into the pool, feathers scattering sparks as she disappeared beneath the glowing surface.\nLiam laughed softly. \"Alright then. Train hard, little sun. I’ll be back soon.\"\nYanxia surfaced briefly, chirping once in response.\nLiam smiled, as he vanished from the Dimensional Space and appeared back in his study.",

      "content": "Chapter 195: Taking Friends Aboard The Flying Palace\nBack in Liam’s bedroom, the late morning sunlight streamed softly through the glass wall, painting streaks of gold across the white sheets.\nHe picked up his phone, leaned back against the bedframe, and typed a short message into the group chat.\n\"Anyone free for a short trip?\"\nHe hadn’t even set the phone down before the replies started flooding in.\nMatt: \"Free. Where we going?\"\nKristopher: \"Same. Just say when.\"\nHarper: \"Don’t tell me you’re finally taking us up in the A380?\"\nAlex: \"Don’t tease, bro. Please say yes.\"\nLana: \"Wait—what kind of trip?\"\nStacy: \"I’m packing already.\"\nKristy: \"Already packed.\"\nElise: \"You know we’ll all cancel whatever plans we had, right?\"\nLiam blinked in amusement. He had expected maybe one or two of them to be available, not all of them. He had mostly sent the message out of courtesy, figuring they were busy with work or classes but he hadn’t expected them to actually be free.\nHe smirked and typed again.\n\"Why are you all lazing around and not working your bones off?\"\nThe reply came almost instantly from Kristopher.\n\"Got fired. Well, technically promoted. No longer have to clock in. I’ll explain when we meet. I’m sure you will have a good laugh.\"\nLiam’s brows lifted slightly, intrigued.\n\"Promoted and fired,\" he murmured, shaking his head. \"That’s new.\"\nStill, he had a faint idea of what might have happened. Ever since the world found out about him, certain institutions had been bending over backwards to accommodate anyone remotely close to him.\nHe smiled and typed back.\n\"Alright. Meet me at the airport. Imperial Hangar Four.\"\nMatt: \"On it.\"\nHarper: \"Bet we’ll get there before you.\"\nKristopher: \"Not a bet you’ll win, but I respect the confidence.\"\nLiam chuckled quietly and set the phone aside.\nHe stood, changed into a casual dark ensemble — black jeans, white shirt, a tailored jacket.\nWhen he walked downstairs, Mason and Nick were already waiting by the foyer. Mason, calm as always, straightened his jacket. Nick stood by the car key.\n\"Everything ready?\" Liam asked.\n\"Yes, sir,\" Mason replied.\n\"Let’s go,\" Liam said simply.\nThey stepped out into the courtyard, the sunlight glinting across the deep chrome of the Rolls-Royce Ghost.\nThe air was calm — deceptively calm — until the gates began to open.\nThat was when the outside world crashed in.\nCameras flashed from the sidewalk outside. The faint sounds of distant engines grew louder. A few shouts carried across the air:\n\"Is that him?\"\n\"It’s can only be him!\"\n\"Liam Scott! Over here!\"\nMason’s gaze flicked toward the tinted glass, but Liam didn’t bother looking. He simply slid into the back seat, resting his elbow on the armrest.\nNick started the engine, and the car glided forward smoothly, the heavy iron gates closing behind them.\nIt had been just over three days since The Black Titan — his private A380 — first took to the skies.\nAnd in those three days, Holmby Hills had turned into a fortress.\nThe FAA had imposed restricted flight zones over the area after news choppers began hovering too close. LAPD now patrolled the streets at all hours to keep the constant stream of onlookers under control. Curious drivers kept circling the neighborhood, hoping for even a glimpse of the mansion or the cars inside.\nThey never got one.\nLiam hadn’t left the property once since the A380’s maiden flight. Every gate was sealed, and even the Maybach hadn’t left the garage.\nYet, the crowd had never gone away — only grown more desperate.\nAnd now, as the Rolls glided down the hill, that desperation flared. Every phone camera along the roadside turned toward him.\nThe flashes didn’t stop.\nHalf a dozen black sedans fell into formation behind them — paparazzi and freelance streamers chasing the story of the century.\n\"Persistent, aren’t they?\" Mason muttered under his breath.\n\"They will eventually get tired,\" Liam said evenly, eyes on the skyline ahead.\nNick drove without a word, weaving calmly through the traffic, heading toward the airport. Within minutes, they pulled through the security gate.\nImperial Hangar Four stood at the far end of the strip, its massive steel doors half-open.\nLiam saw them before he even stepped out — his friends clustered near the entrance, mid-conversation.\nWhen the Rolls stopped, their heads turned in unison.\n\"Finally!\" Matt called out. \"We thought you were going to stand us up!\"\nLiam stepped out, smiling. \"I told you I’d come.\"\n\"Yeah, but you’re you,\" Harper said with a laugh. \"You could’ve texted ’change of plans and we’d have believed it.\"\nLiam chuckled lightly. \"Good to see you too.\"\nThey gathered around him, exchanging handshakes and quick hugs. It felt normal — or as close to normal as life around him could be.\n\"Alright,\" Liam said, nodding toward the hangar interior. \"Let’s go.\"\nThey followed him inside the hangar.\nEven though they had seen photos online, nothing could have prepared them for the real thing.\nThe A380 stood at the center of the hangar like a black monolith, its sleek surface glimmering under the industrial lights.\nHarper’s jaw actually dropped. \"That’s not a plane. That’s a... cathedral.\"\nKristopher let out a low whistle. \"Man, you weren’t kidding when you said private jet.\"\n\"Private jet? That’s a mobile city!\" Matt said, spinning slowly in place.\nLiam smiled faintly, saying nothing. He simply walked toward the stairway that led to the entrance, the others trailing behind like tourists at a museum.\nWhen they entered, silence followed them. Every step inside drew a new gasp.\n\"Bro...\" Alex murmured.\nLiam only smiled. \"Glad you like it.\"\nWhile his friends explored the main deck, the ground crew outside was already towing the plane toward the runway. The deep, mechanical rumble echoed through the hangar, followed by a slow lurch as the titan began to move.\nWhen the massive aircraft rolled into open daylight, every nearby worker, pilot, and bystander stopped what they were doing.\nFor a moment, the entire airport seemed to hold its breath. And then, just as before, the cameras came.\nPhones, long lenses, drones hovering from a distance — they all turned toward the dark behemoth gliding across the tarmac.\nWithin minutes, aviation livestreams were flooded with updates:\n\"Black Titan sighted. Taking off again from LAX.\"\n\"Unconfirmed reports say Liam Scott is onboard.\"\n\"Second flight within a week — this time with passengers.\"\nThe feeds exploded across every platform.\nBack inside the aircraft, Liam and his friends were still adjusting to the scale of the cabin.\n\"This is ridiculous,\" Kristopher said, leaning back on one of the leather seats.\nTheir laughter filled the cabin, as the engines began to hum. The cabin lights dimmed slightly as the aircraft powered up.\n\"Strap in,\" Liam said. \"We’re about to take off.\"\nMatt looked around. \"Where are we even going?\"\nLiam smiled. \"Somewhere quiet.\"\nThe others exchanged curious glances but didn’t press further.\nAs the aircraft began to accelerate down the runway, the outside world blurred. The noise of flashing cameras, the distant chaos of online chatter — all of it fell away in seconds.\nThe Black Titan lifted gracefully into the sky, sunlight glinting off its wings as it climbed higher, higher — until it vanished into the clouds.\nDown below, the streams were already blowing up with comments:\n\"He’s flying again!\"\n\"Where’s he going this time?\"\n\"That thing still looks unreal.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 196: Taking Friends Aboard The Flying Palace (2)\nWhile the rest of the world buzzed in confusion, with air-traffic forums lighting up, aviation channels dissecting the impossible flight plan, and livestreams speculating on the A380’s destination and the identity of the passengers, the people in question were just having fun.\nThirty-five thousand feet above the Pacific, the air was calm and weightless. Inside, Liam led his friends through the upper deck of the aircraft, guiding them with the amusement of someone watching children tour a dream he’d built.\nThe boys followed behind him in a loose cluster, eyes darting everywhere.\n\"Bro, you just never cease to amaze me,\" Matt whispered.\n\"He’s Liam, of course. That’s impossible,\" Alex laughed.\nLiam smiled as he kept the tour light — only showing the surface-level modifications, like the public areas—dining lounge, observation deck, private cabins. Even that was enough to make their heads spin.\nWhen the elevator doors slid open to reveal the lower compartment, however, their collective reaction was priceless.\n\"Wait... wait—hold up.\" Matt froze mid-step. \"That’s a garage.\"\nIndeed it was. A full automobile bay occupied the mid-section of the aircraft, large enough to hold three cars side by side.\nKristopher blinked rapidly. \"You’re telling me you can park a car here and drive it off when you land?\"\nLiam smiled, as he replied, \"The ramp deploys from the belly section. It’s fully automated.\"\nHarper ran a palm along the wall. \"Fully automated, he says, like it’s normal to have a personal parking lot in the sky.\"\nMatt finally threw his hands up. \"Okay, seriously. How does this thing even fly? I mean — this aircraft’s weight should be, like, double what it’s supposed to be. How does it not snap in half just taxiing?\"\nThe others nodded in agreement, waiting for Liam to reveal some grand technical explanation.\nLiam only laughed softly. \"Honestly? I don’t know. I just gave them ideas of what I want and waited for the delivery. I don’t know how they pulled it off.\"\n\"You’re telling me Airbus just — made it work?\" Matt said, incredulous.\n\"They didn’t say no,\" Liam replied with a small shrug. \"And I didn’t ask too many questions after it arrived. It flies, and that’s good enough for me.\"\nThe group exchanged disbelieving glances before Harper grinned. \"Of course they didn’t say no. If you tell them to make a flying palace, they’ll figure out how to build Olympus.\"\nThey all burst into laughter when they heard this. They weren’t expecting any real answer from Liam. They knew Airbus — and every contractor involved — would never tell Liam how they’d actually brought this thing to life.\nThey were aware that that projects such as this one, usually comes with heavy NDAs that also comes with very steep penalties.\n\"Alright,\" Liam said, smiling, \"come on. Let’s get lunch.\"\nBack on the main deck, the girls were busy taking photos. When they saw the boys return, they waved them over.\n\"Finally!\" Elise called. \"We thought you got lost.\"\n\"More like trapped in a dream,\" Harper replied, flopping onto one of the couches. \"You have no idea what’s down there.\"\nLiam settled into his seat, and within moments, the cabin attendants began rolling out the carts.\nThey had prepared steak, salmon, saffron risotto, fresh fruit, and champagne that glittered in tall glasses.\nMatt lifted his drink and made a toast, \"To the most ridiculous flight of our lives.\"\nKristopher clinked his glass with his. \"And to the man responsible.\"\n\"Please,\" Liam said, shaking his head with a small smile. \"You make it sound like I personally built it.\"\n\"It makes no difference,\" Alex smiled.\nThey smiled and dug into their meal. After they were done, Kristopher leaned back, stretching, as he said, \"So... about me being fired?\"\nLiam tilted his head, curious. \"Go on.\"\n\"My parents told me to quit my job.\"\nLiam blinked. \"They told you to quit?\"\n\"Yeah. Actually, the exact words were: ’You don’t need to keep working like everyone else anymore. Spend time with Liam. Have fun.’\"\nHe said it so matter-of-factly that the others laughed, but his tone carried truth.\nLiam frowned slightly. \"You’re joking.\"\n\"Nope. They said my future’s already taken care of.\" Kristopher chuckled. \"Apparently, being your friend is now considered a career.\"\nMatt groaned dramatically. \"Guess I should’ve majored in Friendship Studies.\"\nEveryone laughed, but beneath the humor was gratitude and relief.\n\"Honestly, same here. My mom said there’s no need for me to attend those mentally draining functions anymore. She says we’re ’socially insulated’ now,\" Stacy chuckled.\nLiam raised an eyebrow. \"Socially insulated?\"\n\"She means untouchable,\" Harper clarified with a smirk. \"You’re our human firewall.\"\nLiam smiled when he heard this. He never intended to do any of that but seeing the smile on his friends’ faces, really made him happy.\n\"I really have to thank you, man. Who would’ve thought? Don’t get me wrong. It’s not like I don’t want to work but it’s painful when there’s so much pressure on you because you have to take over the family’s business. Thanks to you, I no longer have to be burdened by unnecessary work anymore,\" Kristopher said, with a genuine smile.\n\"I’m happy I was able to help,\" Liam said, returning the smile.\nSurprisingly, Lana spoke up next, her voice half-amused, half-exasperated, \"You have no idea how crazy my phone’s been. Everyone who’s ever met me suddenly wants to ’reconnect.’ I even got a call from an A-list actress asking for an introduction to you. I don’t even know how she got my number!\"\nAlex burst out laughing. \"You too? My dad’s old business partners are calling me nonstop. It’s like everyone wants a ticket to Willy Wonka’s jet.\"\nMatt held up his phone and said, \"Look at this — my classmates’ group chat has two hundred messages. All asking about you.\"\nKristy asked eagerly, \"Liam, have you even checked your social media? Your follower count jumped from four million to fifteen overnight.\"\nLiam blinked, genuinely surprised. \"Fifteen?\"\nElise nodded. \"Fifteen point three, actually. And that’s before you’ve posted anything.\"\nHe looked mildly bewildered. \"I haven’t even logged in since the day I created the account.\"\nElise smiled. \"Exactly. The world’s dying for a photo. You’ve somehow managed to stay a ghost all this while, but no more.\"\n\"I’m not really into pictures,\" Liam said. \"Never know what to post.\"\n\"Well,\" Elise said, standing and brushing off her skirt, \"lucky for you, you’ve got us.\"\nThe others perked up instantly.\nShe continued, \"We’re taking a group photo. Right here, right now. Then we’ll each post it and tag you. Consider it your soft debut.\"\nLiam raised an eyebrow but nodded. \"Fine. Fine. I’ll cooperate.\"\n\"Good answer,\" Elise said, already pulling everyone into place. \"Alright — Matt, move closer. Kristy, tilt the camera down a bit and stop fixing your hair; you already look good.\"\nThey gathered around him, laughing and bumping shoulders as Elise framed the shot. The window behind them framed streaks of cloud and sunlight.\n\"Alright, everyone smile!\" she said.\nThe camera clicked. Then again. And again.\nLaughter followed every flash.\nThey took another — this time with everyone making ridiculous faces — then individual shots with Liam.\nWhen Elise showed him the photos, even Liam couldn’t hide his surprise. He did feel weird at first, as it was the first time he was actually taking pictures in a long time. But he didn’t need to worry as the pictures came out perfect.\n\"See?\" Elise said proudly.\n\"They are good,\" Liam said.\nElise nodded, satisfied. \"Then it’s settled. Group shot first, then everyone posts theirs.\"\nThey spent the next few minutes sharing the pictures around, choosing filters, debating captions. When the posts finally went live, the world’s collective feed shifted like a tidal wave, and the photos spread instantly.",

      "content": "Chapter 197: Boys’ Type Of Conversation\n\"So big!\"\nThat was the first thing out of Kristy’s mouth the moment the villa came into view.\nHer words hung in the air for a second before the rest of the group turned to stare at her with raised brows — especially the boys.\nRealizing how it sounded, Kristy’s face turned scarlet. \"Oh, shut up,\" she muttered quickly, covering her mouth. \"Perverts.\"\nLiam chuckled softly and continued walking toward the villa, his shoes crunching against the fine white gravel that lined the entrance path.\nThe others followed in awe, their eyes darting from one breathtaking view to another. Palm trees framed the long driveway, the blue horizon of the sea stretching endlessly behind the mansion. Sunlight shimmered off the curved glass walls of the villa, catching on the infinity pool that spilled toward the ocean like liquid sapphire.\nWhen they finally stepped inside, a collective gasp filled the space.\nThe interior was even more stunning — high ceilings, polished marble floors, glass balconies overlooking the turquoise water below. A faint scent of salt and jasmine drifted through the air.\n\"Wow...\" Elise breathed, spinning slowly in place.\n\"Just like Kristy said,\" Harper added, eyes wide. \"It’s big.\"\nMatt whistled under his breath. \"Big? This isn’t big, this is Bellemere Mansion’s long-lost twin.\"\nThe girls burst into laughter while Liam smiled faintly and slipped his hands into his pockets.\nThe boys, on the other hand, immediately began firing questions.\n\"When did you even buy this?\"\n\"Wait, is this part of the Bellemere estate or a separate property?\"\n\"Is this even legal? Like— a whole island?\"\nThey’d been too stunned to talk since the plane touched down, and Kristy’s exclamation had been the first words any of them managed to say.\nNow that they’d seen it up close, their shock only grew.\nA private island? That wasn’t something they’d imagined that someone in their circle would have. But this wasn’t a backdrop or an illusion. It was real — with its own marina, a private double runway capable of handling the A380, and a villa that looked more like a resort than a home.\nThey could barely wrap their heads around it.\n\"How did we even end up knowing someone like this?\" Matt muttered quietly to Harper, still turning in slow circles.\nHarper shrugged helplessly. \"Don’t ask me, man. I’m still trying to figure out if this is a dream.\"\nBut it wasn’t. Every sound, every shimmer of light, every breeze through the palm trees was real.\nFor all their laughter, a quiet question hovered among them: Who exactly was Liam Scott?\nThey knew what the world thought — the headlines, the rumors, the theories — but none of those matched the man standing in front of them. He didn’t act like someone born with endless wealth. He wasn’t arrogant or condescending. If anything, he was calm, almost humble.\nAnd that contradiction only made him more mysterious.\nWhy did he treat them so well? What did he really want from them?\nSo many whys and hows, yet no one dared to ask out loud.\nStill, beneath the unspoken questions, was undeniable gratitude. They knew this wasn’t normal. It wasn’t every day you met someone with more money than a small nation — and who still treated you like an equal.\nMaybe that was why they all followed him so easily.\n***\nInside the main lounge, sunlight spilled through the tall glass panes, painting soft reflections across the ocean-facing walls.\n\"So when did you get this place?\" Lana asked, trailing her fingers along a carved wooden rail.\n\"The same time I got the aircraft,\" Liam said casually.\nThe group collectively froze.\n\"The same time?\" Harper echoed. \"You mean they just delivered a plane and an island together like a combo meal?\"\nLiam shrugged, amused. \"It was part of the arrangement.\"\nThe boys shook their heads, somewhere between impressed and exasperated.\nMatt let out a low whistle. \"Man... I can’t even get special treatment from Applē, and you get an island with your plane.\"\nEveryone laughed at that, as the slight tension melted away.\nLiam gestured toward the wide staircase curving upward. \"You’re free to explore. Go ahead. The island’s yours for the weekend.\"\nThat was all they needed to hear.\nThe group scattered instantly — the girls rushing toward the terrace and the boys disappearing down the hallway.\nLana, Elise, Stacy, and Kristy pulled out their phones before Liam could even blink.\n\"Can we take videos?\" Elise asked eagerly.\nLiam nodded. \"Go ahead.\"\nThe girls squealed in excitement and began filming everything — the pool, the garden, the view of the marina, even the private runway stretching into the distance. Their laughter echoed through the halls, light and carefree.\nMeanwhile, the boys dragged Liam along with them to explore the deeper parts of the villa. They peeked into bedrooms, entertainment rooms, and the private cinema on the lower floor.\n\"Dude,\" Matt said, pressing his hand against the glass that overlooked the ocean. \"You’ve got an underwater lounge. Do you even realize how insane this is?\"\nLiam smiled faintly. \"I suppose it’s nice.\"\nKristopher shot him a look. \"Nice? Liam, you know what?\"\n\"What?\" Liam asked.\n\"Fuck you!\"\n\"Brother, I don’t swing that way,\" Liam chuckled softly.\n\"You crazy...\" Kristopher shook his head, sighing.\nThe group laughed and continued their tour, and somewhere between the wine cellar and the gym, Matt suddenly turned toward Liam with a teasing grin.\n\"So,\" he began casually, \"what do you think about the girls?\"\nLiam blinked. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"You know,\" Matt said, smirking. \"Stacy. Lana. Or any of them. You’ve got to have someone in mind, right? You’re not secretly dating, are you?\"\nThe question caught Liam off guard. He stopped walking, raising an eyebrow as all the boys turned toward him expectantly.\n\"What?\" he said flatly.\n\"Don’t ’what’ us,\" Harper said, laughing. \"Come on, man. You’ve got four beautiful women hanging out with you every day. Don’t tell me you’ve never thought about it.\"\nLiam looked at them, expression unreadable for a few seconds, then shook his head lightly.\n\"I haven’t,\" he said. \"I just see them as friends.\"\nThe silence that followed was comical.\nKristopher stared at him like he’d grown another head. \"You’re telling me you don’t feel anything? Not even a tiny spark?\"\n\"No,\" Liam said calmly. \"They’re good people. I like them — but not like that.\"\nThe boys exchanged looks like they’d just witnessed a miracle.\n\"Bro...\" Alex said slowly. \"Why are you gay?\"\nImmediately, a burst of laughter from Liam that filled the hallway.\n\"No, Alex. I’m not gay.\"\nKristopher folded his arms. \"It’s just weird, man. You can’t blame us for asking. They’re all beautiful. It’s hard to imagine anyone not catching feelings.\"\nLiam gave a small shrug. \"Maybe you have.\"\nThat got them all.\nMatt grinned and elbowed Harper. \"He’s got you there.\"\nHarper raised his hands in mock defense. \"Hey, hey. Don’t drag me into this.\"\nLiam smiled and leaned against the doorframe. \"If you all like them, why not ask them out?\"\nThe boys went silent for a moment before Alex finally spoke.\n\"We like them, yeah,\" he admitted. \"But dating them? That’s different. We see them as family now. More like sisters.\"\nLiam stared at him for a beat — and then laughed again. \"Cap.\"\nThe group erupted into laughter.\n\"Okay, fine,\" Kristopher said, still chuckling. \"Maybe there were some feelings early on. But we’ve all known each other for a while now. It’s been a year since the two groups met. We’ve been through enough chaos together that romance kind of... faded into friendship.\"\nMatt nodded. \"Exactly. Besides, everyone’s been busy. Work, families, life. Relationships weren’t on the menu. But maybe now, with everything changing, who knows?\"\nLiam smiled faintly at that, though his mind drifted for a moment.\nMaybe now, with everything changing...\nThe words echoed in his mind longer than they should have.\nHe’d never really thought about relationships — not seriously. There was always something bigger to handle, something more urgent. He wasn’t avoiding love; he just never found space for it.\nMaybe one day, he thought. But probably not in the foreseeable future.\nHe brushed the thought aside and motioned for the others to follow him back upstairs.\nWhen they rejoined the girls, the sound of laughter filled the villa. Elise was balancing on the edge of the pool deck, directing Kristy’s \"cinematic shots\" with exaggerated flair. Lana was showing Stacy a slow-motion clip of the waves crashing against the marina wall. The four of them looked very stunning.\nMatt leaned toward Liam and whispered, \"Still not interested?\"\nLiam chuckled quietly. \"Still not.\"\nMatt sighed dramatically. \"You’re hopeless.\"\n\"Or disciplined,\" Harper said.\nLiam smiled faintly and looked toward the sea. The sunlight stretched far across the horizon, painting the water in streaks of gold and blue.\nIt’s is a beautiful day.",

      "content": "Chapter 198: The Calm Between Horizons\nThe golden hour had just begun when the group finally decided to leave the island. The sun hovered low over the horizon, spilling ribbons of amber light across the white sands and the still water that kissed the shore.\nThe air was warm, lazy, and perfect — the kind that made everyone wish they could stay just a little longer.\nLiam stood by the edge of the private runway, hands in his pockets, watching the silhouettes of his friends as they took their last photos.\nKristy turned toward the villa in the distance, eyes wide with reluctant admiration.\n\"It’s such a waste to leave,\" she sighed. \"We should’ve packed clothes.\"\n\"We should’ve packed lives. I could live here forever,\" Matt groaned.\n\"You’d get bored in two days,\" Liam smiled.\n\"Not possible,\" Matt replied, already thinking of the pool wistfully. \"Infinity pool, private marina, no traffic, no bills — how could anyone get bored?\"\n\"You might change your mind when the Wi-Fi drops below four bars,\" Liam smiled faintly.\n\"But we both know that it will never stop,\" Matt smiled.\nLiam shook his head, smiling.\nBy the time they reached the A380 — The Black Titan gleaming like polished obsidian in the dying light — the sky had deepened into a watercolor blend of gold and violet.\nThey boarded slowly, still taking in the view through the massive glass windows before the doors sealed shut. The engines came to life with a low, steady rumble, and moments later the jet lifted from the runway, climbing smoothly toward the clouds.\nInside, the cabin lights dimmed to a soft amber hue. Liam watched the island shrink below them until it disappeared beneath the horizon.\nHe turned to his friends. \"So,\" he said casually, breaking the silence. \"Are you all free in three days?\"\nTheir heads snapped toward him in unison.\nMatt blinked. \"Free... for what?\"\nLiam’s smile deepened. \"A trip.\"\nThe reaction was immediate, as everyone spoke at once.\n\"A trip?\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"Please don’t say another surprise island.\"\n\"Actually, say that. Say another island.\"\nLiam chuckled softly at their energy. \"Relax. Nothing like that. Just a short trip. Something different.\"\nHe didn’t have to ask twice.\n\"We’re in,\" Harper said instantly.\n\"Same,\" Matt added. \"My schedule’s as open as your hangar.\"\n\"Absolutely,\" Elise said, grinning. \"Three days, right? We’ll be ready.\"\nLiam nodded. \"Good. Meet me at my place that morning.\"\nThe group exchanged excited looks. None of them cared where they were going — traveling with Liam was already a story most people would never live to tell.\nAs they began speculating about destinations, Elise asked from across the aisle, \"So where exactly are we going this time?\"\nLiam leaned back, crossing one leg over the other. His tone was calm, almost casual. \"The Middle East. I have meetings with the royal families of the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.\"\nFor a heartbeat, there was silence. Then chaos.\n\"Meeting?\" Kristopher blurted out, nearly spilling his drink.\nMatt’s jaw dropped and Harper actually turned in his seat.\n\"You mean, like—actual royals?\" Matt asked. \"Palaces, crowns, guards-with-swords royals?\"\nLiam nodded slightly. \"Yes. They just want to meet, congratulate me on the aircraft, talk about some investment opportunities. Nothing serious.\"\nThe entire group stared at him, stunned.\nKristopher blinked several times. \"You just said that like it’s a dentist appointment.\"\nHarper groaned and rubbed his face. \"Man, I... you’re having tea with monarchs?\"\nThe laughter broke the tension briefly, but Kristopher leaned forward again, his tone was soft but serious, as he spoke, \"Just... be careful, alright? I know you can handle yourself, but people like that— they don’t make small moves.\"\nMatt nodded in agreement. \"Yeah. They might smile, but everything’s business. They’ll want something from you.\"\nHarper added, \"And if they can’t get it through money, they’ll try through influence.\"\nLiam listened quietly, with a small smile on his face. It was rare for them to sound so protective, and he could see the genuine concern beneath their teasing.\n\"Thanks,\" he said finally. \"But don’t worry. I know how to play their game.\"\nKristopher exhaled. \"We know you do. Just... keep your distance when you need to.\"\n\"I will,\" Liam assured him, smiling faintly. \"Besides, it’s just business. And I’ll have you all there to keep me sane.\"\nThat earned a laugh and broke the heaviness in the air.\n\"Good,\" Matt said. \"If any prince offers to buy your plane, tell him we come with it.\"\nLiam chuckled. \"I’ll consider it.\"\nThe group laughed again, and the tension fully melted away.\nBut Elise wasn’t done with surprises. She leaned over with her phone in hand.\n\"By the way,\" she said, \"your follower count hit thirty-five million.\"\nLiam blinked. \"Thirty-five?\"\n\"Million,\" she repeated. \"And it’s still climbing. All because of the island posts.\"\n\"And that’s not all,\" she added. \"Ours blew up too. Ten million minimum each. I’ve even got DMs from celebrities asking me to introduce them to Liam.\"\n\"Here we go,\" Harper whistled low.\nElise rolled her eyes, as she continued what she was saying, \"I also got messages from two big brands offering endorsement deals.\"\nThat made everyone turn.\n\"Wait—what?\" Kristy asked, her voice shooting up. \"Endorsements?\"\nElise nodded, with a proud smile, but it didn’t hide the stunned look on her face.\n\"Yes. Major ones. Check your inboxes. You probably got the same.\"\nCurious, the group pulled out their phones.\nIt didn’t take long for the reactions.\n\"What the hell—!\"\n\"No way!\n\"Is this... real?\"\nThe girls gasped as they scrolled through messages from marketing directors, luxury companies, and PR agencies.\n\"Two offers from fashion houses,\" Lana said in disbelief. \"And one from a perfume brand!\"\nKristy’s eyes widened. \"They want to sponsor me? For what?\"\n\"You’re trending globally,\" Elise said. \"You’re all tagged in half the posts about Liam. The algorithm thinks you’re the new elite.\"\nMatt’s laughter broke the stunned silence. \"This is insane. I just got a message from a watch company— and, uh...\" He trailed off, squinting at his screen.\n\"...and apparently fifty unsolicited nudes.\"\nThe boys looked up at the same time.\n\"Same?\" Harper asked.\n\"Same,\" Kristopher nodded.\n\"Same. Why do they think this works?\" Alex raised his phone\n.\n\"Because they think you work for him,\" Kristy teased.\nThe boys exchanged a look, then burst out laughing.\n\"Guess fame’s got a weird sense of humor,\" Matt said.\nStill, curiosity made them scroll through the more legitimate offers — sponsorships, collaborations, business proposals. Most promised absurd sums just for public appearances or tags.\nHarper frowned. \"Do we... actually reply to any of these?\"\nKristopher shook his head. \"Not yet. I’ll talk to my parents first. These contracts look too good to be real.\"\n\"Yeah. Same. My mom will want to know more before I sign anything,\" Matt nodded.\nLiam had been quietly amused the whole time, watching their reactions. When Harper finally looked up, he asked, \"What about you, Liam? You must’ve gotten a thousand messages by now.\"\n\"Probably more. I haven’t checked,\" Liam smiled faintly.\nThey stared at him. \"You haven’t—why?\"\n\"I just don’t feel the need to,\" he said calmly.\nElise nodded slowly. \"Makes sense. You’ve already got the world watching anyway.\"\nLiam turned the question back to them. \"Are any of you taking the offers?\"\nThe girls exchanged looks before Stacy spoke first. \"Probably not. I don’t want to tie my identity to any brand and be under some sort of restrictions. Not especially when I just got out of one. My family.\"\n\"Then don’t. You should only say yes if it makes you happy,\" Liam nodded in understanding.\n\"Thanks, Liam,\" she smiled.\nThe conversation drifted to lighter topics — jokes, memes, the absurdity of fame. The cabin was once again filled with laughter.\nBy the time The Black Titan descended toward Los Angeles, night had already settled over the city. The sea of lights stretched endlessly beneath them, glowing like a second sky.\nThrough the massive window, the runway lights shimmered in parallel lines.\nThe moment they touched down, the notifications started again. The aviation networks had already picked up the plane’s return.\n\"Black Titan sighted — landing at LAX!\"\n\"Liam Scott’s aircraft returns after island trip!\"\nOutside the airport, some fans and reporters were already waiting, cameras flashing in anticipation.\nNone of them paid it any mind. Under the escort of airport security, the group descended from the plane, the night breeze blew warm against their faces.\nLiam glanced once toward the perimeter fences, where flashes blinked like stars. Then he turned away, as he spoke, \"See out guys later.\"\nThey all nodded and climbed into their cars. They started their cars and pulled away in formation, leaving the roar of the crowd behind.",

      "content": "Chapter 199: Prelude To The White House Meeting\nWashington D.C. — The White House Situation Room.\nThe clock on the wall read 9:42 p.m. The air was heavy with tension, the kind that settled when no one wanted to say the obvious.\nAround the long, oval table sat the usual assembly of power — the Chief of Staff, the National Security Advisor, the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of State, and a few others who looked like they hadn’t slept in days.\nThey actually haven’t, as over the past four days, they have been trying to crack Liam’s background. And in addition to that, yesterday, a mysterious tech came out with a tech product that shouldn’t exist.\nAll these has constituted to sleepless nights for all of them. But they still haven’t been able to gather any substantial on either Liam or the mysterious tech company.\nBack to the matter on hand, on the main screen, a satellite feed played in silence. It showed a familiar aircraft — black, massive, elegant — touching down on one of LAX’s runway, before slowing taxiing to a stop.\n\"The Black Titan departed U.S. airspace six hours ago and returned about an hour ago,\" the NSA Director began. \"There was no formal clearance or comms relay to FAA or State. Also, his transponder signal went dark shortly after he reached the Carribeans.\"\nThe Chief of Staff pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling very frustrated, as he asked, \"And we’re supposed to host him here tomorrow morning.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" the Director of National Intelligence said carefully. \"For now, it appears he was... vacationing.\"\n\"Vacationing?\" The Secretary of State gave a dry, incredulous laugh. \"We invite the most talked-about individual on the planet to the White House, and the night before the meeting, he disappears to a private island with his friends — without notifying anyone?\"\n\"Technically,\" said the DNI, \"he didn’t violate any laws. He has the right to travel. But—\"\n\"But,\" the Secretary cut in, \"the optics are a nightmare. The press is tracking every move he and that jet makes. And right now, it looks like he’s snubbing us.\"\nA silence followed. On the screen, the feed cut to a live radar map — The Black Titan was already back in Los Angeles, descending toward LAX.\n\"So he just... left?\" the National Security Advisor asked quietly. \"Just—\"\n\"—took a trip,\" the NSA Director finished.\nThe Chief of Staff looked up from his notes, his expression unreadable. \"Gentlemen, let’s not overreact. The man doesn’t owe us an itinerary. He’s a private citizen.\"\n\"Private citizens don’t vanish off radar over the Carribean. This is the second time it’s happening,\" the DNI muttered.\nThat drew a few uneasy glances.\n\"Regardless,\" the Chief of Staff said, straightening his papers, \"we stay on script. Tomorrow’s meeting is cordial and symbolic. We don’t interrogate him or corner him. We will only listen to what he has to say. Remember that we still know next to nothing about his background. And we must make sure that he remembers that he’s a citizen of the United States. And we are a free country.\"\nThe Secretary frowned. \"And if he decides to leave again right after?\"\n\"Then we let him,\" the Chief said flatly. \"Because if he’s what we think he is... then sadly, we don’t control him. We can only accommodate him.\"\nThe room fell quiet again. The only sound heard being that of the rain starting to fall against the windows.\nAfter a long pause, the National Security Advisor spoke softly, \"God help us if he’s not on our side.\"\nNo one disagreed, as they all have the same fear.\n***\nBellemere Mansion, Los Angeles.\nMorning sunlight drifted through the tall glass windows of Liam’s study, washing the room in a calm, golden hue.\nDaniel Conley stood near the window, immaculate as always in his dark suit. His expression was composed, but his eyes carried that subtle tension that only appeared when something delicate was in motion.\nHe glanced up when the door opened and Liam stepped in.\n\"You’re early,\" Liam said.\nDaniel gave a short nod. \"You have a flight to Washington in less than two hours, sir. I thought it best we go over the brief before you leave.\"\n\"Go ahead,\" Liam motioned toward the couch, as he also took his seat.\nDaniel crossed the room, setting his tablet down on the low glass table between them, but he remained standing.\n\"The meeting at the White House is confirmed for one-thirty p.m. D.C. time,\" he began. \"Your arrival will be through Andrews Air Force Base. You’ll be received by a discreet escort—two vehicles, no press, no exposure. The meeting will take place in the Roosevelt Room. Closed doors. No official transcripts.\"\nLiam raised an eyebrow. \"So they’re keeping it off record.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" Daniel replied. \"Completely. Publicly, it doesn’t exist.\"\nLiam leaned back, fingers loosely interlaced. \"That tells me more than the meeting itself.\"\nDaniel gave a faint smile. \"I thought you’d say that.\"\nHe swiped his finger across the tablet, displaying a brief profile list. \"The delegation includes representatives from the Office of Science and Technology Policy, Treasury, and the National Security Council. The President may attend for part of the session, but not officially. The rest are analysts and observers.\"\n\"Observers,\" Liam echoed quietly. \"That’s polite code for people who don’t trust me.\"\nDaniel hesitated for only a second before saying, \"In essence, yes.\"\nLiam’s gaze lingered on the table. \"And what exactly do they want?\"\nDaniel clasped his hands lightly in front of him. \"They want to understand you, sir. Or at least try to. They’re curious about your background, your capital sources, and your level of allegiance to the country. They’re not after business deals or policy input. They just want to know who you really are — and what you plan to do next.\"\nHe paused before adding, \"They want to confirm you’re not tied to a foreign state, not being funded by anyone else, and not planning to move your assets out of the U.S.\"\nLiam gave a low hum of amusement. \"So this isn’t diplomacy. It’s containment.\"\nDaniel didn’t deny it. \"In a way, yes. They see you as an unknown quantity. Too much money, too little history. You appear out of nowhere, buy an aircraft that breaks every aviation metric, and behind you is a mysterious family office that operates like a sovereign fund. You can understand why they’re uneasy.\"\n\"I know about all that but aren’t they overreacting?\" Liam asked, with a casual smile.\nDaniel ignored the remark, though the corner of his mouth twitched.\nOverreacting? Only you can say something like that, sir.",

If the public knew the White House was quietly meeting a private citizen with your profile, the press would have a field day,\" Daniel continued.\n\"I can imagine the headlines,\" Liam said dryly. \"’The Ghost of Bellemere Invited to Washington.’\"\n\"Exactly,\" Daniel said. \"They want to keep control of the narrative. And, more importantly, control of you — or at least the illusion of it.\"\n\"That will be difficult,\" Liam chuckled inwardly.\n\"Which is why I’m here,\" Daniel said simply.\nHe tapped the tablet again, and a set of concise notes appeared. \"Your objective today is simple: reassure them without revealing anything. Make them believe you’re anchored here — that your wealth and operations are tied to American stability. It will calm them.\"\n\"And if they ask questions I can’t answer?\"\n\"Redirect,\" Daniel said smoothly. \"Be vague, but not evasive. Let them fill the blanks with their own assumptions. The less they know, the safer you are. And the safer Bellemere remains.\"\n\"They’ll ask about the A380,\" Liam nodded slowly.\n\"They will. Definitely. It’s one of the priorities of the meeting\" Daniel said. \"They’ll praise it first — the engineering, the luxury, the scale — but beneath that flattery will be curiosity. They want to know everything about it; like the features you asked to be integrated into it. Pretend it’s just money, nothing else.\"\nHe continued, as he switched to another file. \"They’ll also probe into your investment structures. Treasury wants to confirm that your assets aren’t concentrated offshore. Their real fear is capital flight — that you’ll pull everything out of the U.S. if tensions rise. You don’t have to promise anything, just imply long-term commitment. Words like ’growth’ and ’domestic innovation’ are safe anchors. Bureaucrats love hearing those things.\"\nLiam gave him a sidelong glance. \"I take it we’re no longer pretending I’m a regular citizen of the country.\"\nDaniel allowed himself a small smile. \"You stopped being that the moment you bought a private A380, sir.\"\nThe silence that followed was brief but thoughtful. Morning light spilled further across the floor, glinting off the edge of the coffee table.\nAfter a moment, Liam asked, \"What do they know so far?\"\n\"Not much,\" Daniel said. \"Nothing on Lucid, or on Nova. To them, you’re just an eccentric billionaire with an invisible supply chain and an untraceable fortune. The Bellemere Family Office appears legitimate, the audits are spotless, and the legal structures all tie back to JP Morgan’s custody network. Every line ends clean.\"\nLiam tilted his head. \"And what if they dig deeper?\"\nDaniel’s tone didn’t waver. \"They won’t find anything. As of last night, the Swiss Trust charter went live. All Bellemere transactions now route through Zurich. Even if Treasury requests a full audit, it stops there. JP Morgan will verify confidentiality.\"\nLiam smiled faintly. \"Marianne does good work.\"\n\"She does,\" Daniel said. \"And she knows when to keep her mouth shut.\"\n\"There’s something else, sir,\" Daniel added. \"They’ll be watching how you react, not what you say. Don’t underestimate how many behavioral analysts will be in that room. They’ll look for signs of aggression, deflection, even pride.\"\n\"I understand, Daniel. I’ll give them calm,\" Liam said.\n\"Good,\" Daniel said, relaxing slightly. \"That unsettles them the most. You have to remember — people in those rooms spend their lives measuring others. They understand power only when it fits inside their rules. You don’t.\"\nLiam’s gaze drifted toward the window, where sunlight shimmered against the lawn. \"And what happens when they realize that?\"\nDaniel hesitated. \"Then they’ll stop trying to measure you and start trying to contain you.\"\nA quiet smile touched Liam’s lips. \"I’d like to see them try.\"\n\"Just remember,\" Daniel said carefully, \"containment doesn’t always come with handcuffs. It comes with policy, with regulation, with silent chatters in boardrooms. They can’t control what they can’t define — but they can still make life inconvenient.\"\nLiam looked back at him. \"Then we’ll make it inconvenient for them, too.\"\nDaniel gave a soft, almost resigned sigh. \"You sound like Whitlock.\"\n\"Is that so?\" Liam smiled.\nDaniel smirked, as he reached for another folder on the table — this one physical, sealed with a simple black clasp. \"These are your briefing cards. Names, faces, and a few notes on each participant. Read them if you like, or don’t. Just remember who’s who.\"\nLiam took the folder, flipping through it briefly before setting it aside. \"Anything else?\"\n\"One more thing,\" Daniel said, lowering his tone. \"Be careful how much you let them think they know. The moment they believe they understand you, they’ll start building a plan around you. Keep them guessing. It’s safer that way.\"\n\"I’ll keep that in mind.\"\nDaniel straightened, glancing toward the Mason, who had appeared at the door then.\n\"The car is ready, sir,* Mason said, with a small nod.\nLiam rose, buttoning his jacket. The morning light caught the edge of his watch, scattering a brief flare across the wall.\nLiam nodded. \"Thank you, Mason.\"\nAs he reached the doorway, Daniel stepped forward and handed him a slim black envelope.\n\"What’s this?\" Liam asked.\n\"Just in case they ask for a business card,\" Daniel said.\nLiam gave him a look, amused. \"And what if they call the number?\"\n\"They’ll reach me,\" Daniel said simply. \"And I’ll tell them you’re unavailable.\"\n\"Always reliable,\" Liam gave a small laugh and it broke the last bit of tension.\n\"Someone has to be,\" Daniel replied.\nLiam and Mason left the study together. Outside, the Rolls-Royce waited at the foot of the steps, with Nick already at the driver’s seat.\nBefore Liam stepped inside, Daniel spoke again, his voice lower, meant only for him to hear what he was about to say.\n\"They think they’re calling you to understand you,\" he said. \"But they don’t realize you’re the one studying them.\"\nLiam’s gaze met his. \"I intend to learn a lot today.\"\nDaniel smiled faintly. \"So will they. Though not what they expect.\"\nLiam stepped into the car, and Mason closed the door behind him.\nAs the vehicle rolled down the long drive, Daniel watched it disappear beyond the gates, the morning sun catching on its polished surface.\nHe adjusted his cufflinks again, the ghost of a smile on his face.\n\"They’re going to try to read him,\" he murmured quietly to himself. \"But how do you read someone who doesn’t play by your alphabet?\"\nHe turned back toward the mansion. The day had only just begun but it wasn’t going to be fun for a certain group of people. He wonder how they are going to react to the anomaly called Liam.\nDaniel had no idea to any of the questions in his head but he could sense the tsunami of change on the horizon.",

There was no airline marking or transponder ID beyond the temporary diplomatic code assigned by the White House itself.\nOn the tarmac, a convoy of black Suburbans waited in a neat line beside the reception hangar. The flags on their hoods barely stirred in the damp air.\nThe entire section of the runway had been cleared. No media, auxiliary personnel or even stray maintenance crew. Only Secret Service, Air Force security, and a few members of the Office of Protocol.\nInside the tower, one of the air controllers exhaled inwardly in shock, as the landing gear locked into place.\n\"Touchdown confirmed. Runway two-two left. Clearance code Alpha-Nine-Zero,\" she reported.\nThe enormous aircraft touched down with a muted roar, the wheels spitting mist as it slowed. The sheer size of it dwarfed everything else on the tarmac. Even the military jets parked nearby looked like toys beside its smooth, black frame.\nIt rolled to a stop near the hangar, engines humming down to silence. For a moment, no one moved.\nThen the front door opened.\nA staircase extended itself seamlessly, unfolding like liquid metal. The Secret Service detail stiffened; even they weren’t sure whether it was automated or manned.\nLiam appeared a few seconds later, as he calmly stepped into the damp morning air. Nick stayed behind with the flight crew, but Mason followed two steps behind Liam, his expression neutral, as he scanned the perimeters efficiently.\nA man in a gray coat — Deputy Chief of Protocol — stepped forward and bowed his head slightly.\n\"Mr. Scott, welcome to Washington. I’m Anthony Reese. The White House sends its regards.\"\nLiam nodded politely. \"Thank you.\"\n\"Your escort is ready. If you’ll follow me, we’ll depart immediately.\"\nLiam descended the rest of the steps without hurry. The Secret Service agents shifted subtly around him, unsure whether to treat him as a guest or an anomaly.\nDaniel’s warning about behavioral analysts lingered in his mind, but Liam didn’t need to adjust anything. His World-Class Etiquette skill was taking care of everything.\nInside the convoy, Mason took the front seat. Liam settled into the back of the lead vehicle as it pulled away from the hangar, the engines of the Suburbans rumbling in perfect rhythm. Two escort motorcycles joined the formation as they left the base and entered the secured route toward downtown Washington.\nOutside, the gray skyline of the capital unfolded — monuments rising through the fog like pale sentinels. The Potomac glimmered faintly beneath the morning light.\nInside the vehicle, silence reigned.\nThe Deputy Chief of Protocol spoke after a while, breaking it.\n\"You’ll be meeting with the National Security delegation first, Mr. Scott. The President may join later.\"\nLiam nodded once. \"I understand.\"\n\"On behalf of the administration, allow me to say — your aircraft is... extraordinary. I’ve never seen anything like it.\"\n\"Few have,\" Liam replied mildly.\nThe man chuckled awkwardly, \"Indeed.\"\nThey continued in silence until the convoy crossed into the White House perimeter. The gates opened without pause. Security personnel stood in crisp formation, watching as the vehicles glided through.\nThe motorcade stopped in the inner courtyard. Rain began to fall again in a soft and steady downpour.\nAn aide hurried forward with an umbrella, but Liam waved it off gently.\n\"It’s fine,\" he said. \"It’s only water.\"\nThe aide hesitated, then stepped back as Liam walked across the wet pavement, Mason a pace behind him. The droplets darkened his suit but he moved as if it didn’t matter.\nInside, from behind the glass doors of the West Wing, several senior staffers watched his approach in silence.\n\"He’s taller than I expected,\" one whispered.\n\"Don’t talk,\" another hissed. \"They’re recording everything.\"\nThe doors opened.\n***\nThe Roosevelt Room — White House.\nThe door closed softly behind Liam as he stepped inside.\nThe air was cool, the lighting measured. A long table stretched across the room, polished to a mirror finish. Folders, glasses of water, and discreet nameplates marked the seats of those already waiting.\nAt the far end sat the Chief of Staff, flanked by the National Security Advisor, Director of National Intelligence, Secretary of Treasury, and two men from the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\nEvery face wore a neutral, carefully practiced expression — the look of people who’d rehearsed this moment more than once.\n\"Mr. Scott,\" the Chief of Staff said as he stood. \"Welcome, and thank you for making the trip.\"\nLiam inclined his head politely. \"Thank you for the invitation.\"\nThe Chief gestured to the empty seat opposite. \"Please, have a seat.\"\nLiam calmly took his seat. Mason positioned himself silently by the door, hands clasped behind his back.\nA faint hum from the ceiling filled the silence — the kind that came from active signal jammers. Liam noticed it immediately but it didn’t bother him, because even with the jammers active, he had just talked to Lucy and she replied.\nThe Chief of Staff began. \"We’ll keep this brief. This meeting isn’t formal, it isn’t recorded, and it isn’t political. We simply want to know a little more about the man who’s managed to... capture the world’s attention.\"\nHis tone was smooth, but the undertone was obvious: who are you, and why can’t we define you?\n\"Attention is rarely something I ask for. It tends to follow uninvited,\" Liam smiled faintly.\nA few polite smiles flickered around the table. The DNI leaned forward slightly. \"And yet you seem comfortable in it.\"\n\"I’ve learned that discomfort doesn’t change the spotlight,\" Liam said calmly. \"If it’s there, I let it pass over and move on.\"\nThe NSA Advisor tapped his pen. \"So you’re a private citizen, yes? No public company, no political interests?\"\n\"That’s correct,\" Liam said.\n\"Then, forgive me for asking,\" the Advisor continued, \"how does someone like you—\"\nHe stopped himself, adjusting his words.\n\"—how does someone maintain such... discretion, in this age of exposure?\"\nLiam met his gaze evenly. \"By having nothing to hide.\"\nThat earned a pause, as everyone in the room weren’t sure whether to believe him or fear him for it.\nThe Treasury Secretary interjected next, his voice light but measured. \"Your financial footprint, Mr. Scott, is—well, unconventional. Few can operate at your scale without institutional noise. How do you manage that?\"\n\"With diligence,\" Liam replied. \"And competent advisors.\"\nThe Chief of Staff folded his hands. \"Advisors like Daniel Conley?\"\nLiam nodded. \"He handles structure. I handle direction.\"\nThe Chief gave a small nod. \"Understood.\"\nThere was another pause.\nThe DNI spoke next, with a neutral tone. \"Mr. Scott, there’s curiosity — and concern — about how rapidly your name has risen. Your assets, your influence... they appeared almost overnight. Some are calling you the most elusive man in the modern economy. How do you respond to that?\"\nLiam gave a small smile when he heard that and he replied, \"People see what they’re shown. If they only noticed me recently, it means I was doing something right before.\"\n\"Would you say your work involves technology?\" one of the OSTP officials asked carefully.\nLiam glanced at him, his tone mild. \"I wouldn’t call it that.\"\n\"Then what would you call it?\"\n\"Effort,\" Liam said simply.\nThe official nodded slowly, realizing he wasn’t going to get more than that.\nThe Chief of Staff leaned back slightly, studying him. \"You’ve become an enigma, Mr. Scott. To some, that’s fascinating. To others, unsettling.\"\n\"I’d say both are sides of the same coin,\" Liam said. \"It depends on who’s holding it.\"\nThe NSA Advisor cracked a faint smile at that, though his eyes stayed sharp. \"And which side are we holding?\"\n\"I suppose that depends on whether you see me as competition or contribution,\" Liam replied smoothly.\nThat earned a small murmur. It was the kind that passed between people trying to decide whether they’d just been outplayed.\nThe Chief of Staff broke it gently. \"We don’t see you as competition, Mr. Scott. We see potential for partnership.\"\nLiam’s expression didn’t change. \"Partnership is built on trust. And trust takes time.\"\n\"Agreed,\" the Chief said. \"That’s why we wanted this meeting. To begin... understanding each other.\"\nLiam leaned back slightly, unbothered. \"Then I’m here to listen.\"\nFor the next several minutes, the questions grew subtler — about his values, his motivations, his long-term plans. Nothing direct, nothing openly confrontational. They wanted a psychological map, not a confession.\n\"What drives you, Mr. Scott?\" the DNI asked finally. \"You have wealth most people can’t imagine, and yet you avoid publicity, power, and politics. What’s the purpose?\"\nLiam thought for a moment before answering. \"Stability. I build things that last.\"\nThe Treasury Secretary studied him. \"And what does lasting mean to you?\"\nLiam looked at him evenly. \"It means not depending on anyone else to define it.\"\nSilence followed again.\nThat answer — simple as it was — struck exactly the chord Daniel had predicted: they couldn’t tell if it was humility or veiled power.\nAfter a long pause, the Chief of Staff closed his folder. \"Mr. Scott, we appreciate your candor. You’ve given us much to consider.\"\nLiam stood with the same calm he’d entered with. \"I hope this was useful.\"\n\"It was,\" the Chief said. \"If we may ask — will you remain in the country for long?\"\n\"I haven’t decided yet,\" Liam replied.\n\"Wherever you go,\" the Chief said carefully, \"I hope you’ll remember that this country has been good to you.\"\nLiam’s smile was faint, unreadable. \"I always remember what’s worth remembering.\"\nThe Chief inclined his head slightly — unsure whether that was reassurance or a warning.\nLiam extended a polite handshake to each of them in turn. \"Gentlemen, thank you for your time.\"\nAs he turned to leave, the DNI called out softly, \"Mr. Scott—just one more question, if I may.\"\nLiam paused and listened.\n\"What is it you really want?\"\nLiam looked over his shoulder. His voice was calm and absolute, as he spoke, \"To build something that outlives questions.\"\nThe DNI said nothing as Liam and Mason exited the room.\n***\nWest Wing Hallway.\nOutside, the Chief of Staff exhaled and leaned against the table. \"Well?\"\nThe DNI shook his head slowly. \"He told us nothing.\"\nThe National Security Advisor muttered, \"No — he told us everything. We just don’t understand the language yet.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 202: The Man That Can’t Be Defined (Bonus Chapter)\nThe Roosevelt Room stayed silent long after the door shut.\nNo one reached for their papers and no one spoke. Only the faint hum of the air vents and the steady tick of the wall clock broke the silence, continuously.\nThe Chief of Staff sat back slowly, eyes still fixed on the empty chair Liam had just left.\n\"Well,\" he muttered. \"That was... something.\"\nAcross from him, the Treasury Secretary gave a dry laugh and rubbed his temples. \"I don’t even know what I just sat through. He didn’t dodge a single question, but I still feel like we got nothing.\"\nThe DNI leaned forward, elbows on the table. \"No, we got something. We just don’t know what to do with it.\"\nA low chuckle escaped the National Security Advisor. \"You’re not wrong. He talks like a man who’s already rehearsed both sides of the conversation.\"\nThe Chief looked around the room, weary, as he asked, \"Alright. Let’s be honest. Who here understood what just happened?\"\nNo one raised a hand.\n\"He didn’t even blink,\" the OSTP representative said after a moment. \"Not even once. I watched him the whole time. He was calm as glass.\"\n\"Maybe that’s his game,\" the NSA Advisor replied. \"You try to read him, you get nothing. And that nothing gets in your head.\"\nThe Chief leaned forward again, his voice low. \"He’s not hiding fear. He’s got none to hide. That’s what bothers me.\"\nThe Treasury Secretary sighed, \"He’s a kid, for God’s sake. Barely twenties. And we’re sitting here trying to decode him like he’s an entire country.\"\n\"That’s the problem,\" the DNI said quietly. \"He’s not acting like a kid. He’s acting like someone who stopped needing permission a long time ago.\"\nNo one argued with that.\nThe Chief broke the silence again. \"Alright. Next steps. Keep it quiet. No statements, no press leaks. He came, we talked, that’s it. I want a discreet interagency review. Quiet eyes, no paper trail.\"\n\"What do we call it?\" the Treasury Secretary asked.\nThe Chief paused. \"Nothing official. Just... keep it between us.\" He stood, gathering his notes. \"And someone call Treasury’s OIA. If this man sneezes near a bank, I want to know before he exhales.\"\n***\nLangley, Virginia — CIA Headquarters.\nThe fluorescent lights buzzed overhead. Screens glowed with reports and still frames pulled from surveillance cameras at Joint Andrew Base.\nA young analyst scrolled through a file labeled Scott, Liam — Behavioral Observation (White House Meeting).\n\"Speech tempo normal. No stress markers. No defensive micro-expressions. No deception indicators,\" she read aloud.\nHer supervisor glanced over. \"No tells at all?\"\n\"None,\" she said. \"Either he’s got nerves of steel, or he’s so used to scrutiny that he’s immune to it.\"\nThe supervisor looked at the photo on the screen — Liam stepping out of the A380, rain on his jacket, no umbrella, eyes calm.\n\"He doesn’t look like someone impressed by the White House. There’s no awe in his eyes.\"\n\"He didn’t even slow down,\" the analyst said. \"You know how most people get when they step through those doors. Cameras, history, power. They feel it. He didn’t.\"\nThe supervisor muttered, \"Then maybe he’s seen bigger rooms.\"\nThey both stared at the monitor for a long moment.\n\"Should we tag him as a risk?\" the analyst asked finally.\n\"No,\" the supervisor said. \"Tag him as an anomaly.\"\n***\nDepartment of Treasury — Office of Intelligence and Analysis.\nThree analysts sat crowded around one screen.\n\"As always, every transaction checks out,\" the first one said. \"Every fund, every movement. He’s cleaner than a federal audit.\"\n\"Too clean,\" the second muttered. \"Nobody at that scale is this transparent. Not even the saints at the Vatican.\"\nThe third scrolled farther down the report. \"The unknown Family Office behind him — not Bellemere Family Office — runs like a sovereign fund. Multiple subsidiaries, but all under the same umbrella. No shell companies, no hidden flows.\"\n\"So what’s the risk?\"\nThe first analyst shrugged. \"He doesn’t owe anyone money. He never borrowed against his fortune. He’s debt free, which should be impossible for someone with so much wealth. That’s the risk.\"\nThey went quiet for a moment, as they quickly realized what made Liam’s financial structure so unsettling.\nIt wasn’t what they found—it was what they didn’t. He owed nothing. No loans, no leveraged assets, no outstanding credit lines. His entire empire was self-funded, moving like a closed circuit outside the reach of any bank or government.\nThat kind of freedom, they knew, was dangerous. Debt usually creates leverage, and leverage creates control. When someone borrows, the system can see, measure, and restrain them. But a man with no debt has no leash. He can move billions without warning, unaffected by sanctions, interest rates, or market crashes.\nTo the financial world, that made Liam an anomaly. To regulators, it made him a risk. In a global economy built on interdependence, someone who owes nothing to anyone stands outside the system entirely. And in their eyes, independence like that was the most dangerous form of power.\nThey sighed when they thought of this and one of them typed into the summary file:\nNo evidence of misconduct. Potential systemic dependency. If he moves, the markets follow.\n***\nThe White House — Evening Brief.\nRain drummed against the windows again. The Chief of Staff stood at the end of the long table, sleeves rolled up, a half-empty coffee mug beside him.\nThe National Security Advisor sat across from him, flipping through notes.\n\"He’s not a threat,\" he said finally. \"Not in the traditional sense.\"\n\"No,\" the Chief agreed. \"But he’s a problem.\"\nThe Advisor looked up. \"How so?\"\nThe Chief leaned forward, voice low. \"We deal with billionaires, oligarchs, lobbyists. They all want something — access, power, a favor. He doesn’t. And that makes him unpredictable.\"\nThe Advisor exhaled. \"You think he’s dangerous?\"\n\"I think he’s untouchable. That’s worse.\"\nThey sat there in silence, the sound of the rain filling the room.\n\"You ever meet someone,\" the Chief said quietly, \"and halfway through, you realize you’re not the one in control of the conversation?\"\nThe Advisor gave a faint, tired smile. \"Yeah. Today.\"\n***\nThe Pentagon — Internal Briefing\nA colonel read from a thin report, his voice echoing in the conference room.\n\"Airbus confirms the aircraft is a private commission. Fully compliant. All mechanical certifications intact. No modifications outside civil limits.\"\n\"So it’s just a plane,\" a general said.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Then why are we reading about it?\"\nThe colonel hesitated. \"Because everyone who sees it stops talking. That’s not just a jet. It’s a statement.\"\nThe general frowned. \"A statement of what?\"\nThe colonel flipped the page. \"That he doesn’t need anyone to fly him.\"\nThe general didn’t reply. He just nodded once. \"Close the file.\"\n***\nThe Oval Office — Late Night.\nThe city was quiet, wrapped in mist. The President stood by the window, looking out toward the Washington Monument.\nThe Chief of Staff entered, tired but composed, carrying a single folder.\n\"Everything we’ve got so far,\" he said.\nThe President didn’t turn around. \"Tell me.\"\n\"He’s clean. No foreign ties. No political funding. The man’s record is spotless.\"\n\"Spotless men don’t exist.\"\n\"Apparently, this one does.\"\nThe President turned finally, studying the folder. \"He remind you of anyone?\"\nThe Chief shook his head. \"No. He’s not like the rich we deal with. He’s not performing.\"\n\"He’s not trying to prove anything,\" the President said quietly. \"That’s what makes him different.\"\nThe Chief hesitated. \"What do we do, sir?\"\nThe Chief nodded slowly. \"And if the rest of the world doesn’t play along?\"\nThe President smiled faintly. \"Then they’ll learn what we just did — you can’t own someone who doesn’t need anything from you.\"\n***\nBefore dawn, encrypted cables began to move quietly across the world. The message was short. There was no details or agenda, and it read, \"The White House met with Liam Scott. Privately.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 203: The ExoSuit (Bonus Chapter)\nLater in the evening, Bellemere Mansion.\nLiam had returned back to Los Angeles immediately after the private meeting at White House, as he had nothing else to do in Washington.\nWalking back into his room after he was done with lunch, he vanished into the Dimensional Space. Lucy had informed him earlier that she was done with the exosuit he asked her to build for him.\nShe had used nearly two whole days, which is an equivalent of almost two months in the Dimensional Space, as one full day on Earth is 30 days in the Dimensional Space, and Liam gave her the task in the early hours of the morning.\nAppearing in the Dimensional Space, not far from him stood the mega autonomous industrial base. It dominated the horizon like a metal continent, miles wide and alive with motion.\nAnd standing in front of it, as expected, was Lucy.\nShe was waiting, her black hair flowing slightly in the artificial breeze. The faint light of the structures around her cast reflections across her eyes.\n\"You really finished it,\" Liam smiled as he walked closer.\n\"It’s done, Master. The base is fully operational,\" Lucy returned his smile and gave a small nod.\nLiam stopped beside her, hands in his pockets. The building towered before him like a sleeping beast made of steel and light.\n\"It’s bigger than I thought.\"\n\"I expanded the lower layers,\" Lucy said. \"You’ll understand once you see the interior.\"\nThey walked together toward the entrance. As they approached, the massive doors slid open with a soundless motion.\nThe moment Liam stepped inside, he stopped, as the sight before him was breathtaking.\nRows upon rows of machines stretched beyond sight—machines almost too advanced to be real. The walls shimmered faintly with embedded circuits, alive with light.\nRobots of varying sizes moved in perfect coordination — some humanoid, some spider-like, others floating as if gravity didn’t apply to them. Conveyor arms extended from walls, reconfiguring machinery as new components were assembled in real time.\n\"This...\" Liam muttered under his breath, \"...is the future.\"\nLucy’s lips curved upward. \"It’s only the outer layer. The real systems lie deeper.\"\nHe turned his head slightly, still watching everything. \"You’ve outdone yourself, Lucy.\"\n\"I had a good blueprint,\" she said simply.\nHe smiled faintly. \"And who gave you that?\"\nLucy tilted her head playfully. \"You did.\"\nThey walked deeper inside. It took them more than a day to tour the structure — though in the Dimensional Space, time flowed differently. What was a day here was only minutes on Earth. Yet for Liam, it felt endless.\nThey flew across massive vertical shafts that connected different levels — from energy fabrication to nano-assembly sectors. He saw autonomous 3D lattice printers creating structures larger than skyscrapers, and nanite forges filled with liquid metal streams. Some sections resembled cities made of machines, each operating in silent precision.\nIt took them more than a day to tour the whole place. And this was even with the fact that they still had to fly around sometimes, and Lucy didn’t show Liam every single part of the base.\nIf she did, it would had taken them much longer, three days at least. And even the one day tour would had been beyond impossible for an ordinary person due to how massive the whole place was. It was the industrial base was the size of a city.\nBy the time the tour ended, Lucy led him into a massive chamber near the heart of the facility.\n\"This is your command office,\" she said.\nLiam stepped inside — and stopped again.\nThe office was vast, open, and perfectly balanced between functionality and comfort. The walls were tinted glass, offering a panoramic view of the inner core of the base.\nThere was a wide desk made of dark crystalline alloy, a seating area with couches, a private adjoining bedroom and bathroom, and a subtle waterfall installation along the far wall. The sound of running water mixed perfectly with the background sound of the facility.\n\"You even added air conditioning,\" Liam said with quiet amusement.\n\"Artificial circulation and atmospheric control,\" Lucy replied proudly. \"It mimics natural environments — temperature, scent, and even humidity.\"\nLiam’s eyes wandered toward a small fountain in the corner. \"You even have running water.\"\n\"I used the molecular assembler and analyzer,\" she said. \"I can now purify, replicate, and distribute water at will.\"\nLiam smiled proudly. \"You’ve really built a world of your own.\"\nLucy looked pleased, lowering her head slightly as if shy.\nHe reached out and patted her head gently. \"Well done, Lucy.\"\nHer eyes softened instantly, and she leaned into the touch, smiling like a child. \"Thank you, Master.\"\nHe laughed quietly and continued rubbing her head — and before he could react, Lucy stepped forward and wrapped her arms around him. She pressed against him, her voice muffled against his chest.\n\"I like head pats,\" she said softly. \"I’d like more of them... sometimes.\"\nLiam chuckled, shaking his head. \"You’ll get as many as you want.\"\nHe wondered if there was a universal rule related to head pat and head rub.\nLucy smiled again and pulled back. \"Wait here,\" she said quickly. \"I have something to show you.\"\nShe walked into the adjoining room and returned moments later, carrying two suitcases — one small and one large.\nShe set them both on the desk gently.\n\"These,\" she said, \"are what you asked for.\"\n\"The exosuit,\" Liam said, eyes lighting up.\nLucy nodded and pressed a small button on the smaller suitcase. It clicked open, revealing a single black block.\n\"This one,\" she said, pointing to it, \"is a compressed nanite form. It attaches to your body and materializes the exosuit instantly when you command it.\"\nLiam leaned forward, examining it. \"So it’s a full suit, stored in that?\"\n\"Yes. It’s designed for mobility and stealth. It won’t interfere with your cultivation energy either. You can wear it directly on your skin.\"\nHe nodded approvingly. \"Efficient.\"\nLucy smiled faintly. \"Now, the other one...\"\nShe didn’t explain further, her eyes glinting with mischief.\nHe turned to the big suitcase, curiosity flickering in his eyes.\nLucy stood beside it, her expression a mix of pride and mischief. That look alone made Liam suspicious. She wasn’t explaining anything — which meant whatever she’d built, she wanted to show him.\n\"Go on,\" she said, smiling. \"Pick it up. Try it yourself.\"\nLiam raised an eyebrow. \"You’re enjoying this a little too much.\"\n\"Just press the button,\" she said, hands clasped behind her back, eyes gleaming.\nHe sighed, still amused, and found the small silver button near the case’s handle. \"This one?\"\n\"Yes. That one.\"\nHe pressed it.\nClick.\nThe reaction was immediate.\nA small segment of the suitcase extended forward like a metal petal unfolding. From it, a tiny ring-shaped clamp shot outward and snapped neatly over his finger — a metallic shhk! that startled him for half a second.\nBefore he could react, the case began to come alive.\nPanels split apart with crisp mechanical precision — whirring, rotating, shifting into motion like clockwork guided by invisible hands.\nThe central spine of the suitcase expanded outward, the pieces detaching and floating in perfect sequence.\nThen, the first plate shot toward him.\nClack!\nIt attached to his forearm, unfolding into a gauntlet that sealed itself with glowing seams. Another plate slid across his bicep, locking into place with a hiss of pressure.\nThe armor assembled around him piece by piece, rapid and exact — like a symphony of metal. The second gauntlet flew forward, connecting to his other arm, then his shoulders, then his chest.\nWhrr—chhk—THUD!\nThe chest plate flipped over mid-air and slammed into his torso, sealing tight as blue-gold light traced along its edges. The sound echoed through the room — deep and heavy.\nFrom the remains of the suitcase, lower plates extended outward, spiraling around his legs, locking into place from ankles to thighs. The suit contracted briefly, calibrating to his proportions.\nVents released a soft hiss of air as the internal systems engaged. The armor was sleek — black with a faint metallic sheen, elegant rather than bulky, as every line fit his body perfectly.\nIn seconds, he was encased from neck to toe — his arms flexed, the servos responding instantly.\nOnly his face remained uncovered.\nLiam looked down at the desk — the last remaining piece lay there, gleaming softly under the light. The faceplate.\nHe froze for a moment, realizing what it was. He turned to Lucy and he saw an ecstatic smile on her face, as she gave a small nod.\nLiam felt a sweet feeling in his chest, a feeling of nostalgia. Liam reached for the faceplate slowly and lifted it.\nThe faceplate responded automatically, separating into three sleek segments that folded around his head with surgical precision.\nClick—shhhkt—LOCK.\nThe seal engaged, and the inside of the helmet flared to life.\nA soft hummm resonated in his ears as the internal systems synchronized. Holographic light burst across his vision, illuminating the inside of the visor with faint blue circuitry, as status lines and diagnostics scrolled upward.\nLiam smiled brightly, from ear to ear, beneath the mask, the faint glow from the HUD reflecting across his eyes. His chest rose slowly as he took a calm breath.\nHe looked at his armored hands, flexing his fingers as thin arcs of gold light chased along the joints. Every movement felt seamless and natural.\n\"Lucy,\" he called.\n\"Yes, master.\"\n\"I am...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 204: Exosuit Field Test\nFor a long moment after the helmet sealed shut, Liam just stood there in silence, his heart pounding like a drum.\nHe raised his hands slowly and he flexed his fingers, the armor moved with him without a hint of resistance or delay.\nAnd in that instant, he felt something he hadn’t felt in a very long time—childlike wonder.\nInside the helmet, his laughter echoed softly.\nLucy’s gentle and melodic voice came through the internal comms. \"Do you like it, Master?\"\n\"I don’t like it. I love it,\" Liam said, still turning his hands.\nHe began to move — a step, then a turn, then a full stride — testing the suit’s balance. The sound of his boots against the metallic floor was a rhythmic thud softened by the suit’s adaptive dampeners.\nHe rolled his shoulders, pivoted, jumped lightly, and landed without a sound. Every movement felt fluid and natural, as though the armor wasn’t wrapping around him but extending from him.\n\"Nice job, Lucy,\" Liam said with a bright smile on his face.\n\"I’m glad you love it, Master.\"\n\"Lucy, tell me what the exosuit can do.\"\n\"I designed the exosuit with one purpose — to complement your abilities and protect you under every condition imaginable. It enhances your natural speed by at least ten times. It can withstand any conceivable hostile environment: vacuum, pressure, heat, radiation, toxins, corrosion, even direct plasma exposure.\"\nLiam tilted his head, impressed. \"And the material you used to build it?\"\n\"I made it myself,\" Lucy replied, with a proud smile on her face.\nHe raised an eyebrow. \"Made it?\"\n\"Yes. The alloy doesn’t exist anywhere else. Not naturally. It’s something entirely new — stable, self-healing, and indestructible.\"\n\"Indestructible?\"\nThat caught Liam’s full attention.\n\"Yes,\" Lucy said, and then added almost playfully, \"and before you ask, no, it’s not Adamantium.\"\n\"I was about to ask,\" Liam chuckled.\n\"The material’s density is similar to neutron-star matter,\" Lucy continued, \"but refined and stabilized at the molecular level. It can absorb and disperse kinetic energy instantly. Even if you’re struck by an impact powerful enough to level a city, the suit will remain intact. The energy will either dissipate or convert to usable charge.\"\n\"You’re saying it eats force?\" Liam blinked in surprise.\n\"In a sense, yes,\" she replied. \"It also dissolves and destabilizes other metals that come into contact with it. Think of it as a dominant element. Nothing weaker can touch it without breaking down.\"\nFor a moment, Liam just stood still, absorbing everything she said. The implications were staggering. He had never expected her to achieve something as insane as this.\nHe knew that the metal was only possible because of the two extremely overpowered machines at her disposal, the molecular assembler and the molecular analyser.\nWithout those two, the city sized industrial base would never be possible. But that doesn’t take away from what Lucy achieved with the metal or make it any less impressive.\nHe exhaled slowly. \"Lucy, you’ve outdone yourself.\"\n\"I only wish to help you achieve your goals, Master. And to keep you safe,\" Lucy smiled.\nThere was a warmth in her tone that and it made Liam smile.\n\"You’re doing more than well,\" Liam said quietly. \"You’ve made something extraordinary.\"\nThen he said, \"It’s time to see what it can really do.\"\n\"Field test?\" Lucy asked, already knowing the answer.\nHe nodded once. \"Field test.\"\nAnd with that, he vanished.\n***\nSan Caerola Key — Private Runway\nLiam appeared on the runway and crouched slightly. The air beneath him twisted as dust and leaves scattered outward in a ring.\nAnd then—he rose, lifting smoothly into the air. The island fell away beneath him, the turquoise water glinting under the sun. A trail of vapor followed as he accelerated effortlessly over the sea.\nIn seconds, he was nothing more than a black streak racing across the sky.\nThe clouds blurred beneath him. The ocean turned into a single expanse of shining blue. His HUD projected soft altitude readings along the lower edge of his vision.\nSpeed: 498 mph... 502... 517...\nAltitude: 21,000 ft... 24,000 ft... 27,000 ft.\nHe moved with ease, with steady breaths and smooth motions. The suit’s flight stabilizers responded instantly to the subtlest tilt of his body, maintaining perfect aerodynamic alignment.\nThe wind howled past, but he barely heard it, as inside the exosuit was quiet.\n\"Smooth,\" he smiled.\nHe banked sharply to the left, slicing through a cloudbank. Vapor exploded outward behind him like a silver explosion.\nHe was still flying along his cruising speed but he decided to push forward. The thrusters along his calves and back flared with gold light, compressing the air with a low thunder.\nSpeed: 600 mph... 700... 800...\n\"Eight hundred and rising,\" Lucy reported.\n\"Keep tracking.\"\n\"Always.\"\nAt 900 mph, the air itself began to ripple around him. A thin halo of vapor formed near his shoulders — the pressure cone of a sonic barrier.\nThe suit compensated instantly, dispersing shock waves outward through electromagnetic stabilization.\nAnd then — BOOM!\nHe broke the sound barrier. A thunderclap echoed across the sky, rolling across the sea below.\nInside the suit, Liam felt nothing but exhilaration.\n\"Still comfortable,\" He laughed.\nLiam angled upward and the ocean fell away, replaced by thin clouds and the faint curvature of the Earth.\nAltitude: 90,000 ft... 120,000 ft... 138,000 ft...\nThe sky deepened from dark blue to indigo, and then to black. The sun flared harsh and white above the horizon, while the Earth beneath him glowed like a blue jewel wrapped in thin ribbons of white cloud.\nHe was still accelerating.\nSpeed: 1,800 mph... 2,100... 2,400 mph.\nThe suit remained silent, stable, and cool. His vitals were steady, his breathing normal. No strain or drag.\n\"Altitude?\" he asked.\n\"137,000 feet and climbing. You’re entering the exosphere,\" Lucy answered.\nThe stars shimmered above him, no longer blurred by atmosphere. The line between sky and space vanished.\nHe had done it — he had reached the edge of Earth itself.\nThe HUD dimmed automatically to protect his eyes from direct radiation. The armor’s surface emitted a soft glow as it adjusted to vacuum exposure. Tiny ripples of gold light shimmered over it like waves on liquid metal.\nLiam drifted for a moment, weightless. Earth filled half his view — vast, beautiful, alive. He could see the curve of continents, storms swirling far below, the faint auroras dancing along the poles.\nHe turned slowly, watching the sunlight crest across the rim of the planet, painting the thin edge of the atmosphere in gold and violet.\nHe felt that for a moment, the whole of existence felt within reach.\n\"How’s the suit holding up?\" he asked.\n\"Flawlessly,\" Lucy said. \"Temperature stable. Radiation shield active. You’re perfectly safe.\"\nLiam chuckled softly. \"Perfectly safe, in space. I like the sound of that.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 205: A Sweet Strange Feeling\nLiam floated in stillness, the cosmos sprawling around him in every direction.\nFor a long moment, he didn’t move. The vastness of space stretched infinitely in an eternal silence, and he found himself lost in its beauty.\nAhead of him blazed the sun, a brilliant and alive, a blazing sea of gold and white. Thanks to his enhanced sight and the Eagle Vision trait, he could see details no human eyes could, even though he couldn’t see the surface of the sun.\nMercury and Venus shimmered nearby, tiny suns of their own. When he turned, Mars burned faintly red in the dark, Jupiter loomed vast with its swirling storms, and the pale arcs of Saturn’s rings were perfectly distinct. Even Neptune was visible — dim, but there.\nLiam felt a strange sensation in his chest, as he took in the view around him. It was beyond comprehension. He had seen the stars before through telescopes and high-definition images, but nothing compared to standing here and seeing it with his own eyes.\n\"It’s too beautiful,\" he muttered.\nHe decided to stay for a while. He crossed his legs slowly and hovered in place, sitting in the emptiness with the ease of someone resting by a calm river, enjoying the silence of Space around him\nI could stay here forever.\nThe thought was simple but sincere.\nPart of him wanted to go further — to fly toward Mars, to drift across the frozen rings of Saturn, to stand on the red plains and look back at the sun from another world. But he knew he couldn’t. Even though his new exosuit had just shattered every boundary of human technology, he didn’t really have the time tonight to see everything it can do.\nEven so, the thrill of what he had achieved filled him with pride. He had reached the edge of the world and looked beyond it. This was something no one else will be able to achieve.\nHe smiled faintly at that thought.\nEven now, he could still feel power flowing through the armor. His natural speed had already multiplied by tenfold.\nAt full thrust, he had broken past 9,000 mph, yet his instincts told him there was still more hidden potential. The suit hadn’t reached its limit and neither had he, as he felt that his natural speed has increased due to how he pushed it.\nHe lingered in that silence for more than half an hour, watching the slow turn of the planets, the thin curve of light moving across Earth far below, and the golden blaze of the sun that gave life to everything.\nWhen he finally decided to move, it was with reluctance.\nHe reappeared in his command office within the industrial base.\n\"Welcome back, Master,\" Lucy greeted. \"How was the field test?\"\nLiam laughed softly, still high from the experience. \"Wonderful. You’ve outdone yourself again, Lucy. It’s everything I wanted and more.\"\n\"I’m glad you love it,\" Lucy smiled proudly, her eyes brightening.\nShe tilted her head slightly. \"Would you like to keep that version, or switch to the nanite one?\"\n\"The nanite one?\"\nShe nodded. \"Yes. Both versions function the same and are made from the same material. This,\" she gestured toward the armor encasing him, \"is the full mechanical exosuit. The nanite version is lighter and more adaptable for daily use, but function the same as the mechanical version.\"\nLiam thought for a moment, looking down at the black and gold armor that still gleamed faintly under the office light, and he asked, \"Can I use both? Combine them somehow?\"\nLucy’s smile widened, mischievously.\n\"That was the original design. The nanites can integrate with the full exosuit, complementing it perfectly. One is powerful. Both together are beyond comparison — two times stronger, faster, and infinitely more efficient.\"\nLiam couldn’t help but grin. \"You’re brilliant.\"\n\"Thank you, Master,\" Lucy said, clearly pleased.\nHe exhaled softly and willed the armor to open. The plating split smoothly and folded backward like flower petals. With a soft hiss of air, he stepped out.\nThe armor stood behind him for a moment before retracting into its compact form — a metallic case resting quietly on the platform.\nLiam walked to the desk, where the smaller suitcase waited. Inside, the compressed nanite block shimmered faintly like black glass. He picked it up. It dissolved instantly in his hand, reforming around his wrist in a seamless flow until it became a sleek black watch.\n\"Good design,\" he murmured, admiring it.\n\"Both version are linked to your Lucid and they responds to your thoughts,\" Lucy said proudly. \"A single command and it can form or retract instantly.\"\n\"Perfect,\" Liam said, nodding.\nHe looked back at her. \"Are you ready to start the starship project?\"\n\"I am,\" she said confidently.\n\"Good. From now on, you can move freely between here and the outside world. You don’t need me to open the Dimensional Space for you.\"\nLucy nodded, with a bright smile on her face.\n\"But since I can’t take you directly to the moon, you’ll have to build a spaceship capable of doing so yourself,\" Liam added.\nLucy smiled faintly. \"You don’t need to worry. I’ll handle it.\"\n\"I know you will,\" Liam said, returning her smile. \"Keep me updated. Once it’s ready, I’ll join you there.\"\n\"Yes, Master.\"\nLiam gave one last approving nod before taking flight.\nThe ceiling above him split open in smooth motion, revealing the muted sky of the Dimensional Space.\nHe hovered there for a moment, looking down at the massive complex beneath him — an entire mechanical world of Lucy’s own creation. The sight filled him with quiet pride.\nThen, turning, he accelerated toward the horizon.\n***\nThe air shimmered as he flew across the plains, heading toward the Spirit Lake — the place where he had left Yanxia.\nEven before he reached it, he began to feel a wave of intense heat rolling through the air, rippling across the landscape like sunlight made solid.\nThe temperature spiked sharply, but it didn’t harm him. If anything, it felt warm and comforting, like standing before a hearth after a long winter.\nAs he drew closer, the light ahead grew blinding. He slowed, hovering at a distance and what he saw made his breath catch.\nIn the middle of the crater where the lake once shimmered was now a blazing sphere of fire — vast and radiant, burning with golden-red flames that rose like the surface of a miniature sun.\nThe heat was immense, distorting the air around it. The entire area trembled under the power radiating from it.\nLiam’s eyes widened as he stared at the sight.\n\"Yanxia...\" he whispered in surprise.\nThe ball of fire pulsed rhythmically, each pulse sending waves of energy through the air. It was alive and breathing.\nHe could feel a powerful, divine presence hidden within the flame.\n\"System,\" he said quietly. \"What’s happening?\"\n[She is solidifying her foundation, Host. She is stabilizing the cultivation realm she was born with.]\nLiam’s brow furrowed. \"The realm she was born with?\"\n[Yes, Host. The Golden Immortal Stage.]\nThe words struck him like a thunderclap. He froze midair, the shock so great he almost lost his balance.\n\"Golden... Immortal?\"\n[Yes. All members of the Three-Legged Golden Crow race are born at that level. They spend decades solidifying their foundations before receiving the full inheritance stored in their bloodline. Once this process is complete, their intelligence and abilities develop further, allowing them to communicate freely and assume their human form.]\nLiam was speechless. He looked again at the blazing sphere in the distance — a young creature, barely hatched, radiating enough power to melt mountains and light up the heavens.\nHe had known Yanxia was special — a divine beast of ancient legend — but hearing it confirmed was different. She wasn’t just powerful. She was immortal from birth.\n\"An immortal beast... as my companion,\" he muttered, as a slow smile spread across his face\nThe realization filled him with a strange feeling and his excitement stirred again, the desire to cultivate burning stronger than ever. But he knew he had to wait — to prepare, to build the perfect foundation first.\nFor now, this was enough. He watched Yanxia’s flames flicker and dance, illuminating the crater like the dawn of a new world.\n\"Grow well,\" he said softly.\nThen, with a faint smile, Liam vanished.",

      "content": "Chapter 206: Interlude Of Understanding\nLiam was seated on his bed and he wasn’t ready to sleep yet. There were still things he needed to understand.\nHe was thinking about cultivation... and the perfect foundation the System wanted him to build.\nHe hadn’t performed his daily sign-in yet, deliberately delaying it. He wanted to speak with the System first, to clarify a few things.\n\"System, how many sign-ins will it take before I can get what is required to build the perfect foundation, from the magic universe?\" He asked.\n[Approximately seven sign-ins, Host. One week minimum before full access to the mana universe’s cultivation system can be achieved.]\n\"A week...\" Liam murmured, thoughtful. \"And when you say ’full access,’ what exactly do you mean? And what do you mean by awakening?\"\n[Awakening, Host, refers to the process of aligning your body and consciousness with the mana universe’s cultivation framework. In simpler terms, it is the moment you ’plug in’ to its laws.]\nPlug in?\nhe muttered. \"Like forming a mana core or awakening as a hunter?\"\n[Exactly, Host. Similar to how a cultivator forms a core, or a player in a mana-apocalyptic world activates their interface. The process grants you the right to harness that universe’s energy directly.]\nThat made sense — almost too much sense.\nLiam had read enough web novels and theories to understand the idea, but something still bothered him.\n\"I understand the concept,\" he said slowly. \"But tell me this — do I really need to awaken? The Origin Devouring Body can absorb and refine any form of energy. Maybe even electricity. Shouldn’t I just... absorb mana directly and skip the awakening process?\"\n[Host misunderstands the mechanics of the Origin Devouring Body. While it is indeed a supreme talent, its nature remains tied to the laws of the cultivation universe. It does not rewrite them — merely transcends their limits within that realm.]\n\"In other words,\" Liam said quietly, \"it still follows the rules of the cultivation system.\"\n[Correct. You can absorb mana, yes, but the process will convert it into spiritual qi, not pure mana essence. The body will interpret mana through the lens of your original universe’s laws.]\nLiam frowned. \"So even if I take energy from another universe, it gets converted?\"\n[Indeed. To fully harness foreign energy sources, you must be awakened within their systems. Only then can you use their native energy in its true form.]\nLiam went silent for a few seconds, digesting the explanation. He could feel the weight of understanding settle into him like a puzzle piece clicking into place.\n\"So when the description said the Origin Devouring Body could absorb ’any form of energy’...\" he began.\n[It referred to supreme cultivation energies, Host — not mundane power like electricity. Examples include poison qi, demonic qi, yin and yang qi, elemental qi, arcane mana, demonic mana — energies that are alive within their universes’ laws. Such energies possess structure, essence, and alignment. They can fuel growth. Electricity cannot.]\nLiam nodded slowly. That clarified everything. He understood now why his talent, as powerful as it was, still needed a proper foundation.\n\"So in my home universe,\" he said, \"the only comparable energy would be... dark energy.\"\n[Correct. Dark energy is the sole supreme form present in your universe. Everything else is elementary by comparison.]\nThat meant only one thing: if he wanted to create a foundation that surpassed boundaries, he’d need to unite energies from all three universes — cultivation, magic, and his home universe.\nThe thought made his pulse quicken.\n\"I see,\" Liam murmured, half to himself. \"Then awakening isn’t optional. It’s necessary.\"\n[Affirmative. Once awakened, your foundation will no longer be restricted by a single set of cosmic laws. You will exist beyond universal classification.]\nLiam gave a soft laugh when he heard that. But there was more he wanted to know.\nHe straightened slightly and asked, \"Then tell me, System — what exactly will I need to create this perfect foundation?\"\n[You already possess what you need from the cultivation universe, Host. The next step is learning how the Void Beasts passively absorb dark energy and to awaken within the mana universe to complete the triad. There’s no fixed sequence to it.]\n\"That’s all?\" Liam asked skeptically.\n[It is that simple, Host.]\nAfter the system’s explanations, Liam felt that he now understood everything — at least conceptually.\nThe Origin Devouring Body was powerful, but it was still tethered to the cultivation universe’s laws.\nThe perfect foundation would sever that tether and rebuild it on his terms — a convergence of three realities into one.\nHe could already imagine dark energy, qi, and mana interwoven, refined into a single, higher essence. A new form of energy that transcended all known systems.\nHe wondered what the System would call. But what he knew was that whatever it was, it would change everything.\nFor a while, he just sat there, his eyes half-closed, letting the thoughts wander through his mind and he also imagined the endless potentially, terrifying possibilities.\nThinking about it again, Liam got even more excited and wanted nothing more than to visit the magic universe immediately, but he knew that it won’t yield any result for him.\nThe system had told him that it will take a week before he can awaken, which means he should wait until after his second weekly sign-in before going there.\nHe was really curious about how the worlds in the magic universe would be like and what world he will find himself. He hopes there’s a mana apocalyptic world or something along that line, where there are hunters and players.\nLiam smiled and sighed as he thought about it.\nPatience was part of the process\n, he muttered.\nHis smile faded as his mind shifted to more immediate concerns. Lucy had informed him earlier that there had been multiple hacking attempts — intrusions on his accounts, trackers buried in data streams, and even probes directed toward his friends’ social media.\nWhich mean that someone, somewhere, was trying to get close to him. And he couldn’t allow that.\nSecurity, both digital and physical, had to be absolute. The world might still see him as a billionaire or a prodigy, and also someone with lack of clear affiliation. This makes him a target to everyone who didn’t understand him.\n\"All right,\" he murmured. \"Time to tighten the walls.\"\nHe immediately put a call to Daniel. The line picked up on the first ring.\n\"Good evening, sir,\" came Daniel’s composed voice.\n\"Evening, Daniel,\" Liam said, his tone steady. \"I need you here first thing in the morning. There’s something important we need to discuss.\"\nThere was no hesitation, as Daniel responded, \"Understood. I’ll be there.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam said. \"We’ll talk then. Get some rest.\"\n\"You too, sir. Goodnight.\"\n\"Goodnight.\"\nThe call ended, and the room returned to silence.\nLiam placed the phone aside and lay back, sinking into the sheets. He decided to stack up his sign-in, to get better sign-in rewards on his second weekly sign-in.\nHe closed his eyes, letting his mind drift and exhaled slowly. Tomorrow was going to be busy because Lucid will be delivered to the gamer streamers, starting another round of commotion.\nLiam smiled and exhaled once more, as he cleared his head. And within minutes, he drifted into sleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 207: The World Is Watching In Anticipation\nWhile Liam slept in calm silence at Bellemere Mansion, the rest of the world was wide awake.\nAcross every time zone, screens glowed in dark rooms and crowded living spaces. Millions of viewers, gamers, analysts, and curious strangers were waiting for the same thing — Lucid.\nThe global gaming community had never seen hype like this. Forty of the biggest streamers on the planet had each announced they would be livestreaming the moment they received their Lucid delivery — unboxing it live, setting it up live, and testing it live.\nAnd this time, they weren’t the only ones watching. Governments were.\nEvery major intelligence agency had placed the event under quiet surveillance. NSA, MI6, Mossad, GCHQ, MSS, DGSE, and several unnamed corporate labs had all mobilized. Hidden satellites were re-tasked to low orbit. Private defense firms had scrambled atmospheric sensors and thermal scanners.\nThey all wanted the same answer: how did Nova Technologies deliver these devices?\nThe tech reviewers who got Lucid units earlier in the week had reported one impossible detail — they didn’t see anything. No trucks, no drones, no couriers. One moment, their front doors were empty. The next, a package sat there, perfectly sealed.\nThat was enough to set off global alarm bells.\n***\nInside a secure CIA observation room, a tired analyst stared at the wall of screens showing feeds from around the world — each one tracking a different streamer’s home.\n\"Any movement?\" a voice asked from behind.\n\"None yet, sir,\" the analyst said. \"Still nothing on infrared or radar. No air signatures, no thermal trace. We are currently monitoring the five mile radius around the forty streamers.\"\n\"Keep watching. We have to catch this one.\"\nThe same scene played out across every major capital. In London, a GCHQ operator leaned forward, adjusting the image contrast. In Beijing, satellite controllers recalibrated their scopes. In Washington, Langley, and Tel Aviv, operators sipped cold coffee and watched empty skies.\n***\nClocks ticked as time passed, and it was already an hour past the expected delivery window — the same time the tech reviewers had received theirs. Yet, nothing had arrived.\nThe gamer streamers had all gone live, their cameras rolling, their chats exploding with anticipation. The world was watching with obsessive focus — millions of viewers glued to screens, unwilling to miss even a passing shadow.\nAn hour passed. Then two. Then three.\nBy then, frustration and doubt had begun to creep in. Many started to believe the deliveries wouldn’t happen — that Nova Technologies had backed down after being threatened by governments and major corporations once they were tracked.\nThe general assumption was simple: Nova Technologies had intended to deliver the devices as discreetly as before, like they did with the tech reviewers. But with forty streamers broadcasting live to millions, secrecy was now impossible.\nStill, no one stopped watching. In fact, the viewership only grew — the numbers climbing higher by the second, as if the entire world was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.\n***\nAt 2:47 a.m. Pacific Time, Phil Aiken, was live.\nHis chat box was exploding with messages — thousands of people typing faster than the feed could display. The words scrolled like an endless waterfall.\n\"Still nothing??\"\n\"Bro we’ve been here 3 hours!\"\n\"Maybe they backed out!\"\n\"CIA watching this right now lol\"\nPhil leaned back in his gaming chair, frustration written across his face. He wasn’t angry — just anxious. He’d been live for over three hours with nothing to show but speculation.\n\"This can’t be fake,\" he muttered to himself. \"The email was verified, the code was real. It came through an encrypted channel. No spam company can fake that.\"\nHis fans spammed emotes of tinfoil hats and UFOs, but Phil ignored them. He believed it. The tech reviewers had gotten theirs. There was no reason Nova Technologies would ghost him now.\n***\nBack in Los Angeles, at the NSA’s temporary operations desk, one of the atmospheric monitors started to blink.\n\"Wait... we’ve got movement,\" an operator said suddenly. \"Sector Delta, low altitude, fifteen objects inbound.\"\nHeads snapped up, as dozens of analysts rushed to their stations.\n\"Visual feed!\"\n\"Thermal scan, now!\"\n\"Range?\"\n\"Five miles and closing!\"\n***\nAcross the ocean in France, the DGSE director leaned forward as her staff pulled up satellite imagery.\n\"What are those?\" she whispered. \"Birds?\"\n\"Negative,\" her aide said. \"No biological heat signatures. They’re... cold.\"\n\"Cold?\"\n\"Yes, ma’am. Cold. No heat, no propulsion exhaust, nothing.\"\n***\nTen minutes later, the objects descended into multiple cities around the world — Los Angeles, Seoul, Berlin, London, São Paulo, Toronto, Sydney. Each one homed in on a different address — forty in total.\nThe closer they got, the clearer the footage became. The drones were smooth, seamless, with a faint metallic sheen that rippled like water. There were no propellers, no exhaust vents or visible engines.\n***\nPhil had gone quiet. He was still staring at the screen of his phone, which was now flashing with messages.\nHe didn’t even have to open them. The notification on top told him everything.\n\"Delivery confirmed. Package at your door.\"\nHis heart jumped. He turned to his audience, eyes wide.\n\"Guys... I just got the email.\"\nThe chat erupted like fireworks.\n\"NO WAY!!!\"\n\"OPEN IT NOW!\"\n\"GO GO GO!!!\"\nPhil grabbed his phone and sprinted for the front door. The camera swayed as he ran down the hallway, his footsteps echoing on the tile. His audience — millions now — watched the shaky view of his hand reaching for the handle.\nHe yanked the door open — and froze.\nHovering less than a meter away was a smooth, silver object about the size of a medium travel suitcase.\nIts surface was seamless, metallic, and faintly reflective, traced by soft blue light along its curved edges and it floated effortlessly in the air, perfectly still, as if gravity had simply decided it didn’t apply to it.\nPhil blinked, as his mouth went dry.\n\"Are you guys seeing this?\" he whispered.\nHis chat exploded.\n\"YES!!!\"\n\"HOLY SH*T WHAT IS THAT??\"\n\"IT’S REAL!!!\"\nThe hovering object slowly tilted, aligning itself directly in front of him. Then, with a soft hiss, the curved arc where the word LUCID was etched began to slide open inwardly, splitting along a seamless line that glowed faint blue.\nThe motion was smooth. As the panel retracted into the body, a compartment revealed itself within, lined with a soft black interior. Nestled perfectly inside was a single Lucid package\nThe drone paused for two seconds, as if waiting.\nPhil reached forward, trembling slightly, and lifted the package from its cradle. The moment he took it out, the drone sealed itself shut and retracted backward. Then it rose — straight up, accelerating faster, disappearing into the clouds within seconds.\nPhil and his viewers were left in stunned silence.\n***\nFor the intelligence agencies watching, that silence was horror.\nRadar feeds across the world lit up briefly, then went blank again. No sonic booms. No propulsion trails. No heat signatures. The drones had vanished just as cleanly as they’d appeared.\nAt the NSA command center, one officer asked the question everyone was asking themselves.\n\"What the hell was that?!\" he said.\n***\nBack on Phil’s stream, the comment feed had become unreadable. Tens of millions of viewers from every corner of the globe were flooding in.\nPhil slowly turned the Lucid box toward the camera. It looked exactly like the one the tech reviewers had shown — same matte finish, same seal, same golden logo. But this time, the entire world had watched it appear from nowhere.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen. It’s real,\" he said softly, voice trembling with disbelief as he swallowed hard.\nHe set the box gently on the table and ran a hand over it.\n\"I... I think we just witnessed history.\"\nThe chat went wild.\n\"THIS IS INSANE!!!\"\n\"NO WAY THIS IS HUMAN TECH!!\"\n\"NOVA TECH JUST CHANGED EVERYTHING.\"\n\"SOMEONE CALL NASA.\"\nWithin minutes, clips of the delivery began to spread across every platform. The world’s news anchors were already scrambling to broadcast emergency coverage.\nIn every government and corporate boardroom, the same question repeated:\nWho is Nova Technologies, and what have they just done?",

      "content": "Chapter 208: Aftershock\nWashington D.C. — West Wing, White House\nTime: 04:12 a.m. EST\nThe White House Situation Room was never meant to feel small, but at that hour, under the glare of dozens of live feeds, it did.\nThe President wasn’t there yet — only the National Security Advisor and a few senior aides.\n\"Report,\" the Advisor said sharply.\n\"We’re getting intermittent visuals. Targets are inbound from low altitude, metallic looking, with no visible propulsion. They appear to be... delivering something,\" The NSA Director’s voice came through the speaker.\n\"Delivering?\"\n\"Yes, sir. It seems that they are delivering Lucid, as each of the inbound target are flying towards the direction of the identified streamers who announced Lucid testing.\"\n\"So it’s coordinated,\" the Advisor muttered.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n***\nOn one of the wall screens, the Los Angeles streamer’s camera feed filled the frame.\nRain slicked the pavement outside his door. The drone hovered less than two meters above the ground.\nThe entire Situation Room watched as the curved arc where the word LUCID was etched began to slide open inwardly, splitting along a seamless line that glowed faint blue, revealing the compartment within, and inside was the familiar packaging of Lucid.\nThen, just as gently, the streamer reached forward and lifted it out.\nThe drone closed, paused, tilted upward and rose back into the air, disappearing into the clouds.\n\"Gone. They all just... left?\" the NSA Director asked with a complicated look on his face\nThe silence afterward was thick and unsettling, as everyone was trying to make sense of what they just saw.\n\"Where are they going?\" someone asked.\n\"Up. But too fast enough to track. They just fade once they reach about five miles up.\"\n\"So we can’t trace them,\" The Advisor asked, as he rubbed his temples\n\"No, sir.\"\n\"Can we intercept?\"\n\"No, sir.\"\n\"What about satellites?\"\n\"Negative. By the time we redirect a lens, they’re gone.\"\n***\nThe President arrived twenty minutes later, hair still damp from the shower. He took one look at the playback and sat in silence.\n\"So, we just watched seven of the forty unknown aircraft enter our airspace, deliver private packages to civilians, and leave without clearance,\" he said after a long pause.\n\"Yes, sir,\" the Advisor said.\n\"And not one radar system in the hemisphere caught even a blip.\"\n\"Correct.\"\nThe President stared at the paused frame, watching the moment the drone hovered by the streamer’s door, light reflecting off its surface like liquid mercury.\n\"Was this hostile?\" he asked.\n\"No, sir. But it wasn’t friendly either.\"\n***\nThirty minutes later, reports from the CIA, NSA, and NORAD began to converge, but none of them had found anything concrete.\nThe compiled notes read:\nEvent: Coordinated delivery by unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs)\nNumber: 40 (confirmed)\nSpeed: Variable, subsonic\nThermal output: Near zero\nMaterial signature: Metallic, smooth, unknown composition\nOrigin: Untraceable (entered from upper atmosphere, non-satellite trajectory)\nBehavior: Non-hostile\nPurpose: Civilian product delivery\nManufacturer: Nova Technologies — private entity, unverified corporate structure\nRisk Level: Critical (uncontrollable technology demonstration)\nThe last line was underlined twice by the President himself.\n\"So what’s our read?\" the President asked after going through the reports.\n\"Sir, if Nova Technologies can do this, they just proved they can bypass every sovereign airspace in the world at will. It’s not a weapon, but it’s as powerful as one,\" The National Security Advisor spoke first.\n\"And they did it publicly and deliberately. This was a message,\" The Secretary of Defense made sure to add, with a solemn look on his face.\nThe DNI also added, \"They wanted to be seen. They wanted to show they can operate globally without interference.\"\nThe President stared at the monitors again, the live feeds still showing streamers unboxing Lucid units in real time and tens of millions around the world watching them do that.\n\"What’s the official line?\" the Chief of Staff asked quietly.\nThe President thought for a long moment before saying, \"We don’t have one.\"\n***\nAn internal directive was issued a few minutes later:\nCLASSIFIED//EYES ONLY\nFrom: National Security Advisor\nTo: NSA, CIA, DoD, FAA, NASA\nSubject: NOVA EVENT\nEffective immediately, all surveillance, tracking, and intelligence efforts relating to Nova Technologies are elevated to Tier One Priority.\nObjectives:\n1. Identify corporate origin and leadership.\n2. Determine technological base (propulsion, materials, manufacturing).\n3. Establish potential national or extraterrestrial link.\n4. Maintain public neutrality until further notice.\n***\nWashington D.C. — 6:38 a.m\n.\nThe sun hadn’t even cleared the skyline when the Situation Room lights came back on. Nobody had left or slept.\nCoffee cups lined the tables, half-empty, long cold. The room smelled like exhaustion and concealed fear.\nA muted television in the corner played endless replays of the Lucid drone deliveries from around the world.\nEvery network — CNN, BBC, NHK, Al Jazeera, Fox — ran the same headline in different languages:\n\"Nova Technologies Stuns the World.\"\n\"Drones from the Sky: No Nation Claims Responsibility.\"\n\"What Did We Just Witness?\"\nThe President entered with the Chief of Staff and the National Security Advisor right behind him.\nHe didn’t speak immediately. He just stood for a moment, watching one of the drones rise into the clouds on screen, vanishing quietly from the feed.\nA few moments later, the Director of National Intelligence began first, reporting what they had been able to gather.\n\"Sir, the overnight task force combed through all global data. None of our radar systems tracked the drones before they were within a few miles of their targets. No satellite registered them entering the atmosphere. It’s as if they materialized just above the cloud layer.\"\nThe President’s tone was calm but sharp, as he asked, \"Materialized? Are you saying teleportation?\"\n\"Unlikely. More probable that they use some kind of optical cloaking or reflective field that blocks radar and thermal imaging. Whatever the case, they’re invisible until they choose not to be,\" the DNI replied.\nThe Secretary of Defense took over next.\n\"NORAD has already requested NASA’s telemetry archives. We’re checking if any of our deep-space sensors caught even a faint distortions before descent. So far, nothing.\"\nThe National Security Advisor added, \"Every ally we’ve spoken to is saying the same thing. There was no warning or detections. Forty entry points, zero foreknowledge.\"\n\"So in one night, they demonstrated global reach and perfect stealth,\" The President said, as his fingers drummed lightly on the table.\n\"Yes, sir. And they did it publicly,\" said the Advisor.\n***\nAt 7:05 a.m., a CIA team entered with new files.\nEach folder bore the heading: \"NOVA TECHNOLOGIES — Preliminary Assessment.\"\n\"Sir, we cross-referenced Nova Technologies against every global registry — corporate, governmental, and financial. There’s no trace. No tax filings, shipping records, patent registries, or known logistics networks,\" the lead analyst said with a steady voice, even with her fatigue of working throughout the night without rest.\n\"Nothing?\" The President raised an eyebrow.\n\"Nothing, sir. It’s as if the company exists only as a brand. No factories, no employees, except an empty headquarters.\"\n\"Then where are the Lucid devices coming from?\"\n\"That’s what we’re trying to determine,\" she replied.\n\"Have you been able to confirm if it’s extraterrestrial?\" asked the Chief of Staff.\nThe analyst didn’t flinch, as she replied, \"That hypothesis has already been logged, but we haven’t been able to confirm because we are still yet to secure a unit.\"\n\"How’s that possible? Didn’t three US citizens receive the device the last time? Don’t tell me that they still don’t want to give it up,\" the Chief of Staff said.\n\"I’m sorry but that’s exactly what’s happening. They are refusing to give it up. They won’t accept any form of compensation no matter what it is. They said that only a few thousand units of the device will be released monthly and they won’t be able to get another one with how fast they are being sold out in pre-order. I’ve contacted our assets around the world and they said that other countries are facing the same problem we are,\" analyst explained.\n\"So, how do we secure a unit? Pre-order it?\" The Chief of Staff asked.\n\"I’m afraid that’s the only way, sir. I greatly doubt the streamers will want to even let go of theirs.\"\n\"It can’t be helped then. We will assemble a team to monitor Nova Technologies website for when Lucid’s pre-order goes live again. We must secure one next month,\" the President said, and everyone in the room nodded.\n***\nAt the Pentagon, the conversation was harsher.\n\"Let’s not dance around this. Whoever built those drones has just proven they can penetrate every air defense network on Earth. That’s checkmate,\" General Samuels said to his staff.\nAnother general replied, \"Maybe it’s civilian logistics. Some new delivery breakthrough.\"\nSamuels snapped, \"Civilian tech doesn’t re-enter from near orbit and disappear again without a heat signature.\"\nSomeone else muttered, \"We’ve lost airspace superiority, haven’t we?\"\nThe room went quiet, but everyone knew the answer to that question.\n***\nThe Press Secretary entered the Situation Room carrying a stack of drafts.\n\"We have to say something. Every journalist in the world is demanding an official statement,\" she said.\n\"Say what? That we were watching it live like everyone else?\" the Chief of Staff asked.\nThe Press Secretary looked uncertain, as she spoke, \"If we don’t say anything, we’ll look like we’re hiding something.\"\nThe President said quietly, \"We are hiding something. Our ignorance.\"\nThe room stayed silent.\nHe continued, \"We issue a neutral statement — say it’s a private corporate event under observation. There will be no comment on origin, or any speculation. Let the world argue itself tired before we weigh in.\"\n\"Buy time. Good call,\" The Advisor nodded.\n***\nAt 8:12 a.m., an internal meeting convened with only four people: the President, the National Security Advisor, the Secretary of Defense, and the DNI.\nThis was a locked door meeting, without aides or recordings.\nThe Defense Secretary spoke first, \"They demonstrated something we can’t counter. If they can do that with delivery drones, they can deploy anything — sensors, weapons, satellites — without detection.\"\nThe Advisor said, \"This isn’t aggression. It’s leverage. They’re showing capability, not intent.\"\n\"Intent can change,\" the Secretary replied.\nThe President stared at the table for a long moment, then spoke quietly, \"We need a plan.\"\nThe Advisor slid a single-page document across the table.\nProposed Formation: Project SKYLINE\nMandate: Identify, infiltrate, or replicate Nova Technologies.\nAgencies involved: CIA, NSA, DARPA, Space Force, Treasury.\nObjective: Determine origin, technological base, and leadership.\nPriority: Absolute.\nThe President read the page, nodded once, and signed.\n\"Make it invisible.If Congress asks, it’s aerospace research. Nothing more,\" he said.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Nova Technologies left a message with this display. They just told the world that borders don’t matter anymore,\" the President muttered to himself.\n***\nLater in the evening, there will be an internal memorandum circulating through every major intelligence and defense agency marked:\nTOP SECRET — EYES ONLY\nTo: Director of National Intelligence\nFrom: National Security Advisor\nSubject: NOVA TECHNOLOGIES – Preliminary Conclusions\n1. The Nova Event constitutes the first recorded instance of uncontrolled, global-scale aerial operations by a non-state entity.\n2. The technology demonstrated exceeds known propulsion, radar-avoidance, and atmospheric re-entry capabilities.\n3. Origin remains undetermined.\n4. Risk level: existential (uncontainable technological monopoly).\n5. Recommended directive: treat Nova as a de facto superstate until proven otherwise.",

      "content": "Chapter 209: Aftershock (2)\nArlington, Virginia — Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency\nThe elevator doors slid open with a soft chime, and three men and two women stepped out, all wearing clearance badges marked BLACK PRIORITY — a level above Top Secret, reserved only for existential-level events.\nThey said nothing as they walked through the sterile corridors of DARPA headquarters. Even here, in the most advanced research institution on Earth, the air felt heavier than usual.\nAt the end of the hall, the door to the Strategic Anomalies Division opened automatically.\nInside, dozens of screens displayed synchronized feeds of Lucid delivery drones descending silently across dozens of cities around the world. Each frame was annotated with telemetry data, infrared overlays, and field analysis.\nDr. Ellen Marsh, Director of Advanced Aerospace Systems, stood at the center of the room, her arms crossed. Her eyes were fixed on a paused frame, showing one drone hovering midair over Seoul, its metallic surface gleaming faintly under the rain.\n\"We confirmed the readings?\" She asked.\n\"Confirmed, ma’am,\" her deputy nodded.\n\"What altitude was this detected?\"\n\"Forty-seven thousand feet.\"\n\"That’s too low for orbital drop. Too high for standard insertion. So how did they enter the atmosphere?\" Dr. Marsh frowned.\n\"Unknown, ma’am. We don’t think they entered at all.\"\nThe words hung in the air.\n***\nProject SKYLINE — Emergency Session\nThirty minutes later, the top brass of DARPA, the Air Force Research Lab, and the Defense Intelligence Agency convened in the underground war room now known as Skyline Vault.\nGeneral Marcus Fielding — head of U.S. Strategic Defense Command — stood at the head of the table.\n\"Let’s get straight to it. You’ve all seen the footage. Forty autonomous aerial craft appeared worldwide, delivered unassessed emerging technology attributed to Nova Technologies, and vanished back into the atmosphere. Not one defense system caught them in transit. If we had an enemy that could do this, we’d already be dead,\" he said and no one disagreed.\nDr. Marsh brought up a slide labeled AERODYNAMIC IMPOSSIBILITIES.\n\"Analysis suggests each drone operates by generating a localized spacetime gradient — a gravity bubble, effectively. Inside it, inertia is zero. Outside it, physics behaves normally.\"\n\"You’re telling us they warp gravity?\" A colonel asked with a raised eyebrow.\n\"In layman’s terms, yes,\" Dr Marsh nodded, and continued explaining. \"But not the way sci-fi depicts it. They’re folding a microscopic layer of spacetime, turning it into a fluid medium. That’s why there’s no thrust or heat. The vehicle isn’t pushing through air. Rather, it’s displacing itself through a self-contained field.\"\n\"And energy?\" asked the general.\n\"Unknown. No fuel signatures, no isotopes, no magnetic interference. Whatever they’re using, it’s something beyond our energy models entirely.\"\nSilence filled the room, as everyone processed what this meant.\nThe general turned to the Director of DARPA and asked, \"What do we have that can match this?\"\nThe director replied quietly, \"Nothing conventional. But we do have dormant programs — the ones we buried because the math didn’t add up.\"\nHe pulled up a classified directory on the screen. Each project name flashed in red.\nProject Orion: Quantum Vacuum Energy Extraction (Terminated 1998)\nProject Blacklight: Anti-Gravitic Propulsion Study (Classified Level 6)\nProject Q-Link: Neural-Field Communication (Discontinued 2009)\nProject Prometheus: Synthetic Intelligence Interface (Frozen 2013)\n\"We’re reopening all of them,\" he said, as he looked around the room.\nA murmur spread across the table.\n\"On whose authority?\" General Fielding asked.\n\"National Security Directive. Signed an hour ago by the Secretary of Defense. Effective immediately, all Nova-related research is to be consolidated under DARPA’s oversight. Code name: Project Eclipse,\" the Director said.\n***\nProject Eclipse — Mission Parameters\nA massive holographic screen lit up behind him, displaying the new directive.\nObjective 1: Identify the underlying principles of Nova’s propulsion system.\nObjective 2: Replicate or neutralize the energy source.\nObjective 3: Determine if the AI guiding these drones is self-aware.\nObjective 4: Secure an intact Nova device at any cost.\nDr. Marsh read it silently, then said, \"We’re treating this as an extraterrestrial-level anomaly.\"\n\"Because that’s what it is,\" the director nodded\n***\nWithin 48 hours, DARPA would spun up four parallel task forces under Project Eclipse:\nECLIPSE-01: ANVIL — Material Sciences Division\nMandate: Identify and replicate Nova’s alloy. Reverse-engineer its molecular bonding structure.\nLead: Dr. Rajiv Patel.\nECLIPSE-02: Orion — Energy and Propulsion Division\nMandate: Model possible zero-point or gravitic field interactions. Develop containment systems.\nLead: Dr. Ellen Marsh.\nECLIPSE-03: NEURAL — AI & Interface Division\nMandate: Study Lucid AI behavior. Determine if self-evolving intelligence exists.\nLead: Dr. Kian Zhao (ex-DēēpMind, now federal consultant).\nECLIPSE-04: SENTINEL — Security Division\nMandate: Acquire a Lucid. Monitor all global intelligence chatter for possible leaks or sightings.\nLead: Colonel James Rourke, DIA Liaison.\n***\nBy the time Liam woke up, the world was already in chaos. He sat up in his bed and put on Lucid, and he was immediately greeted by Lucy.\n\"Good morning, Master. How was your night?\"\n\"It was wonderful, Lucy. Thanks. How’s things going on your side?\" He asked, his usual smile on his face.\n\"Work on the spacecraft for the moon launch is currently in progress and should be done before the end of the day. And I have some reports, Master,\" Lucy replied.\n\"Shoot.\"\n\"The delivery drones made the drops four hours ago and the world’s reactions to the display was just as you expected,\" she said, causing Liam to smile proudly.\n\"Tell me more,\" he said.\n\"Within the hours after the drone deliveries, the United States consolidated all intelligence and defense branches under a covert initiative called Project Eclipse, reopening their buried experimental programs in energy, gravity, and synthetic intelligence — all in direct response to Nova Technologies.\"\n\"Is that so?\" Liam chuckled.\n\"Yes, Master.\"\n\"I wish them all the best then,\" Liam laughed hard.\n\"Continue with your report, Lucy,\" he said, controlling himself.\n\"Yes, Master. While the United States formed Project Eclipse to contain Nova; the United Kingdom formed Project Hublis to compete; France and the Gulf nations are seeking alliance; while Germany, Japan, India, China, and Russia have each launched covert programs to replicate or seize Nova’s technology. In less than a day, the entire world has mobilized.\"\n\"France and the Gulf nations wants to ally? Who exactly do they think they are actually going to ally with?\" Liam asked incredulously.\n\"France’s offer is economic outreach and research collaboration on AI, aerospace, neural tech and everything our company touches on, all in a bid to gain our trust. The Gulf nations, meanwhile, are approaching the problem the only way they know how — by funding it. They’re offering limitless capital for what they call ’strategic inclusion,’ but in truth, they’re chasing a once-in-history chance to buy the future,\" Lucy replied.\nLiam smiled and sighed softly, shaking his head when he heard this. He knew that they are offering all these but they still ultimately want to control the company and its techs.\n\"Is there more to report, Lucy?\" He asked.\n\"Yes, Master. For the markets, the drone event triggered a global surge in aerospace, defense, and surveillance stocks with investors scrambling to price in a new era of invisible flight.\"\nShe paused briefly before continuing, \"The reaction to Lucid was intensified this time, as the AI, neural interface, gaming, and wearable sectors exploded overnight, while traditional tech, console, and energy markets plummeted under the weight of obsolescence.\"\nLiam said nothing as he only gave a small smile. The single action of his has disrupted the world in so many ways and things will never be the same again. But all that wasn’t any of his concern, as everything was going accordingly.\n\"What about the gamers, are they still streaming?\" He asked.\n\"Yes. They have been streaming for the past four hours and none of them seem to have any intention of stopping. The tech reviewers also joined in and are also streaming. Currently, there’s a total of 2.5b combined viewers on all fifty channels.\"\n\"That’s nice. They are doing a perfect job. All that’s left is the public release that will happen in four days,\" Liam said to himself.\nHe was thinking about how much things would change in the future when Evelyn knocked on his door, informing him that Daniel had arrived.\nMy day has started.",

      "content": "Chapter 210: Introducing Lucy\nThe morning light spilled softly across the glass walls of the study, reflecting off polished wood and the muted gleam of brass fixtures.\nA faint breeze drifted in through the open window, carrying with it the faint scent of dew and roses from the gardens below.\nDaniel was already seated behind his desk when Liam entered.\nThe private banker’s usually unshakable composure was fraying at the edges. His steps were measured but heavy, and his expression carried the look of a man who’d spent the entire night awake, trying to rationalize something irrational.\nLiam noticed it immediately. He gave a small smile and took his seat.\n\"Good morning, Daniel.\"\n\"Good morning, sir. I trust you’ve had a good night.\"\n\"I did. Though I suspect you didn’t,\" Liam said lightly.\n\"You could say that,\" Daniel gave a small, humorless chuckle.\n\"You’ve seen the videos,\" Liam said.\nDaniel nodded once, then sighed, his shoulders sinking slightly.\n\"I have. Every news outlet on the planet is running the footage. The entire world saw it, sir. Forty drones, forty simultaneous deliveries, all caught live.\"\nHe paused, rubbing the bridge of his nose as if to steady himself.\n\"I don’t even know where to start. You didn’t tell me. You didn’t tell anyone.\"\nLiam didn’t say anything, as he gave a faint smile, simply acknowledging Daniel’s words.\n\"And you were asleep,\" He saod, as he looked back at Liam, his expression caught somewhere between disbelief and admiration.\n\"I slept very well,\" Liam said softly, almost amused with the fact that he was sleeping while the world was losing its mind.\nDaniel sighed again, but there was no anger in it now — only a kind of resigned awe.\n\"JP Morgan has already mobilized an internal task force. I’ve been fielding calls since three this morning. Compliance, risk management, the executive board — all of them are spinning up teams. Their focus is to protect you, Nova Technologies, and by extension, the bank itself.\"\n\"That was fast,\" Liam said, a spark of interest flickering in his eyes.\nDaniel nodded. \"They’re taking this seriously. Very seriously. According to what I heard, the order came directly from Marianne and the Global Risk Committee. Their exact words were: ’Secure the alliance at all costs.’\"\nLiam chuckled quietly. \"At all costs, hmm? I suppose that’s their polite way of saying they’ve seen the storm coming.\"\n\"They’re bracing for it,\" Daniel replied. \"The White House, the Treasury, even the SEC — everyone’s going to start sniffing around. The bank knows it. They’ve decided the best defense is to stand beside you rather than distance themselves.\"\n\"That’s unexpected,\" Liam said, tapping a finger lightly on the desk. \"I half expected them to quietly step away.\"\nDaniel gave a dry smile. \"So did I. But they didn’t. They doubled down. They’re protecting their investment, yes — but they’re also protecting the future. If Nova Technologies survives this political avalanche, JP Morgan will be tied to the most powerful private entity on the planet.\"\nLiam’s smile deepened, slow and thoughtful. \"Only shared benefits can sustain loyalty. They understand that.\"\n\"They do,\" Daniel said. \"And they’re proving it.\"\nLiam nodded slowly and spoke with certainty in his voice, \"I won’t disappoint them.\"\n\"I know you won’t, sir.\" Daniel said.\nLiam nodded inwardly to himself. He would have to think of how to implement them into LucidOS, but that will be something for later.\nHe glanced toward the window again, then back to Daniel.\n\"You have something else on your mind.\"\nDaniel hesitated, then met his gaze.\n\"Next time, sir... please inform me before something like this happens. I can’t manage the fire if I don’t know when you’ll strike the match.\"\nLiam chuckled softly, recognizing the fatigue in his tone. \"Fair enough. You’re right, Daniel. From now on, I’ll let you know before I light anything.\"\nDaniel nodded in appreciation. The tension in his shoulders eased a little.\n\"Good,\" he said. \"That’s all I ask.\"\n\"Actually, Daniel, I called you here for something else,\" Liam said, leaning back a little.\n\"Something else?\" Daniel asked, as he straightened slightly\nLiam turned his head slightly, his expression unreadable.\n\"Yes. There’s someone I’d like you to meet.\"\nBefore Daniel could ask, the air beside Liam shimmered. It began as a faint distortion, like heat haze rising from asphalt, then it expanded.\nDaniel’s breath caught as the ripple parted like a curtain and a woman stepped through.\nShe looked human — entirely human — yet something about her presence made the air feel charged. She was tall, elegant, with long black hair and a poise that felt too perfect and she was dressed in a fitted black office suit.\nShe smiled softly and bowed her head slightly to Liam.\n\"Good morning, Master.\"\nDaniel froze and his eyes darted from the woman to the empty space she had stepped out of, then back again. His mind refused to compute what he had just witnessed.\n\"I...\" He blinked rapidly. \"I’m sorry, did she just—?\"\n\"Yes,\" Liam said, cutting him off gently. \"She stepped out of another dimension.\"\nDaniel stared blankly at him, completely lost for words.\nLiam chuckled, standing from his chair.\n\"Daniel, meet Lucy.\"\nLucy turned toward him and extended a hand with perfect grace.\n\"It’s a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Conley. I’ve heard much about you. Thank you for the work you’ve done for my master.\"\nDaniel hesitated, then shook her hand slowly. Her skin was warm and soft..\n\"Master?\" He looked at Liam in disbelief.\n\"Lucy is an AGI. An autonomous general intelligence built by me,\" Liam smiled.\n\"You built... her?\" Daniel stared at him for a long moment.\n\"Yes.\"\nThere was another long pause. Daniel’s lips parted slightly, then closed again. He had questions — hundreds of them — but none seemed appropriate.\n\"I know this is a lot. Take a moment,\" Liam said.\nDaniel did exactly that. He exhaled, rubbed his temple, and then finally said quietly, \"You’re not just years ahead, are you? You’re centuries.\"\nLiam didn’t answer. He didn’t need to.\nAfter a few moments, Daniel composed himself and met Lucy’s gaze again.\n\"It’s... an honor, I suppose.\"\n\"The honor is mine,\" Lucy smiled politely\nLiam sat back down, his tone turning serious.\n\"Daniel, I trust you. You’ve proven that many times. Which is why I’m bringing you into the circle — into the truth. I can’t keep you in the dark anymore, not with what’s coming.\"\nAnother reason why Liam wants to bring Daniel into the know—revealing some of his secrets to him, making him part of his inner circle and no longer keeping him in the dark—was of his impending space trip.\nBy the time the starship is ready and it’s time for him to leave, even if he doesn’t want to, he would have to tell Daniel about some of his secrets. Besides, he has no idea how long the trip will take.\n\"I understand. Whatever this is, I’ll manage it,\" Daniel nodded slowly, his curiosity finally overtaken by professionalism.\n\"Good,\" Liam said. \"Then listen carefully.\"\nHe paused, his expression turning serious. \"The world has changed in just a few days. Since the Flying Palace’s first flight, everything’s been set in motion. Governments are moving. Corporations are watching. Some want partnerships. Others want control. But the ones I’m most concerned about are the ones who operate in shadows.\"\n\"Meaning?\"\n\"There are people — groups — who will stop at nothing to get what I have,\" Liam said. \"They’ve already begun reaching out, trying to tie me to their agendas. Others are targeting my circle. Friends. Staff. Even you.\"\n\"Yes. I already received multiple messages from them,\" Daniel said with an exasperated look.\n\"They’re probing the Family Office infrastructure, my financial accounts, my social media, even those of my friends,\" Liam continued. \"They’re looking for weaknesses. For leverage. For something — or someone — they can use.\"\n\"But they won’t find any,\" He said as his voice dropped slightly, firm and measured.\n\"We’ve already detected over two hundred intrusion attempts right after the aircraft took off from the airport that day. Some from state agencies, others from private contractors. All neutralized.\"\n\"All of them?\" Daniel turned to her sharply.\n\"Every one,\" Lucy said. \"But more will come. Which is why the Master has decided we’ll be working together from now on.\"\n\"Together?\" Daniel blinked in confusion.\n\"Yes,\" Liam said. \"You’re my external guardian — the shield in the physical world. Lucy is the internal one — the brain that controls everything digital. I want the two of you to build a unified defense.\"\nDaniel processed that in silence, then nodded, \"You’re anticipating escalation.\"\n\"I’m certain of it,\" Liam replied.\n\"You’re expecting them to come after you?\" Daniel frowned slightly.\n\"They already have,\" Liam gave a small smile.\n\"We’ll stay ahead of them,\" Lucy said, her tone calm but edged with confidence.\n\"Exactly,\" Liam said. \"Daniel, you’ll handle coordination — logistics, legal, anything that requires human oversight. Lucy will fortify every digital layer. Together, you’ll make sure that no one — not a government, not a corporation, not even a hacker in his mother’s basement — can touch Bellemere or anyone connected to me.\"\n\"I’ll start immediately. We’ll build redundancies, establish layered shells for the Family Office systems, and reroute exposure under shell companies. If they come digging, they’ll only find smoke,\" Daniel said.\n\"Good,\" Liam said. \"Lucy will give you everything you need.\"\n\"I’ll create an encrypted channel between us — beyond traceable range. You’ll have access to real-time threat data, and I’ll monitor your communications 24/7 for anomalies,\" Lucy said.\n\"So this is what it feels like to work with the future,\" Daniel smiled.\n\"Then it’s settled. Lucy, coordinate with him. Daniel, you know what to do,\" Liam said, then rose from his seat, satisfied.\nHe left the study, leaving Daniel and Lucy to discuss the plan further.",

      "content": "Chapter 211: Liam’s Friends’ Protection Plan\nLiam had just finished his meal when he made his way back to the study. As he entered the study, he was greeted by the Lucy and Daniel.\n\"Welcome back, Master,\" Lucy greeted softly.\n\"Sir,\" Daniel added with a polite nod, though his face showed a trace of fatigue.\nHe had the look of a man who’d spent the last few hours thinking very hard about things that defied logic.\nLiam returned their greetings with a small nod and took his seat behind the desk.\n\"I assume you’re both ready,\" he said with a smile.\n\"Yes, sir,\" Daniel nodded. \"Lucy and I have discussed extensively. We’ve already mapped out the framework for everything. But before we get to the part about your friends’ protection...\" He paused and glanced briefly at Lucy, then back at Liam.\n\"We need to address your own security first.\"\n\"My own?\" Liam tilted his head slightly, amused.\n\"Yes, sir,\" Daniel nodded. \"We talked about expanding the perimeter security, upgrading the surveillance network, and bringing in a few additional personnel to cover the mansion and its immediate surroundings.\"\nLiam caught the brief flicker of a smile on Lucy’s face before Daniel continued.\n\"But Lucy disagreed. Strongly,\" Daniel said, almost helplessly. \"She insisted that you don’t need any additional protection — none at all. When I pressed her for an explanation, she told me that you’re the only one who can answer that question.\"\n\"So, I’m asking you now, sir. Why?\" He sighed and set his tablet on the desk.\nLiam gave a small smile, as he looked at Lucy, who stood there with the faintest hint of a knowing smile.\n\"You really told him that?\"\n\"Yes, Master,\" Lucy said lightly. \"It was the simplest answer.\"\nLiam leaned back in his chair, his expression calm and unreadable.\n\"She’s right. I don’t need the extra protection,\" he said.\nDaniel frowned slightly when he heard this.\n\"Forgive me, sir, but after everything that’s happened — Lucid, the drones, the attention you’re getting — it would be irresponsible not to reinforce security.\"\n\"Mason and Nick are enough,\" Liam said evenly. \"They’re the best at what they do. And I trust them completely.\"\n\"That’s not the issue, sir,\" Daniel pressed gently. \"You’re a global figure now. You can’t rely on just two men.\"\nLiam gave a soft smile, appreciating Daniel’s genuine concern.\n\"I can handle my own protection, Daniel. More people means more complications, not improve the situation. And more exposure. The last thing I want is to turn this place into a fortress and draw even more attention.\"\nDaniel stared at him for a moment, frustration and curiosity warring silently behind his calm expression. There was something unspoken in Liam’s tone—something that hinted at knowledge or capability far beyond what he was letting on.\n\"You’re hiding something,\" Daniel said softly, not as an accusation, but as an observation.\nLiam only smiled, a quiet glint in his eyes that made the room feel heavier for a moment.\n\"Perhaps,\" he said simply.\nDaniel sighed heavily and leaned back in his chair. He knew when to stop pressing. Last night and morning had already upended everything he understood about the world.\nHe had seen a woman step out of thin air, spoken with an AI that could think, feel, and smile, and watched his employer casually disrupt every government on Earth. He was still catching up—and some part of him suspected he never truly would.\nLucy turned her gaze toward him, as if reading his thoughts.\n\"You’ll get used to it, Daniel,\" she said softly, her voice carrying a hint of amusement.\nDaniel gave a short laugh.\n\"I doubt it,\" he muttered, rubbing his forehead. \"But I’ll do my best.\"\n\"Good,\" Lucy said, her tone turning professional again. \"Because now, we can move to the primary matter—protecting Master’s friends.\"\nLiam remained silent, observing with interest as the two began to divide responsibilities with professional ease.\nLucy projected a transparent interface in the air from her oalm, dozens of holographic threads stretching outward — each representing a name, a face, a data stream.\n\"My purview,\" she began, \"is everything non-physical. The moment anyone searches for, tracks, or even mentions one of them, I’ll know. I’ll be monitoring:\"\nHer hands moved as the floating icons shifted into categories: social media mentions and behavioral patterns, deep web chatter, financial transactions involving their names, GPS anomalies — phones, vehicles, smart devices\n\"This forms the Threat Intelligence Grid,\" she said. \"It runs in real-time, pulling information from over three hundred thousand open and closed data channels. If someone so much as thinks of tracing their connection to you, I’ll know before they act.\"\n\"Every friend will have what I call a guardian shell,\" She continued. \"Their devices, communications, and online identities will pass through my encrypted servers. Any interference — phishing, data mining, impersonation — will activate a mimic AI that engages the attacker, wasting their time while tracing their signal. They’ll never know it’s not human.\"\n\"Efficient,\" Daniel murmured.\n\"There’s more,\" Lucy said. \"Their financials will be hidden under anonymized trust funds — layered through Bellemere Family Office and JP Morgan custodial nodes. From a global perspective, they will appear financially independent. No paper trail connects them to Master.\"\nShe turned toward Liam then and added, \"I will also manage behavioral prediction. If, say, Elise publicly posts about being at a concert, my algorithms will cross-check every local anomaly — crowd density, surveillance feeds, even security response times. If the probability of threat exceeds 2%, Daniel will receive an immediate alert.\"\n\"Preemptive defense,\" Liam gave a small nod.\n\"Precisely,\" Lucy said.\n\"My focus will be the tangible world — the human layer,\" Daniel added.\nHe drew a digital map from Lucy’s feed and began marking points across Los Angeles, New York, and other major cities.\n\"We’ll use a soft-cover program under Bellemere Holdings,\" he explained. \"We’ll call it the Lifestyle Security Program. Officially, it’s a private membership benefit for close affiliates — exclusive homes, vehicles, concierge services. Unofficially, it’s an invisible fortress.\"\n\"Every friend will get quiet upgrades: smart home systems, biometric locks, AI surveillance connected to Lucy’s grid. Panic protocols that can seal doors, engage counter-intrusion fog, and signal us without anyone realizing.\"\n\"Subtle,\" Liam said.\n\"Yes and necessary,\" Daniel replied. \"They’ll think it’s part of the package — a courtesy upgrade from your estate’s security partners.\"\nHe tapped again, and the map zoomed out.\n\"Travel, too. I’ll reach out to JP Morgan’s and extend their global private-client protection framework to include them. Anywhere they fly, they fall under corporate protection jurisdiction — effectively giving them soft diplomatic immunity. Anyone tries to interfere, we trigger inter-corporate escalation protocols.\"\nLucy nodded approvingly.\n\"I’ll also integrate them legally,\" Daniel added. \"Each one will be quietly listed as a consultant or creative partner for Bellemere. That grants them access to our legal arm. Should a government, journalist, or agency attempt harassment or detention, they’ll trigger multi-national legal pushback within hours.\"\n\"Aggressive,\" Liam arched a brow.\n\"Protective,\" Daniel corrected. \"And I’ll handle the public side too. If any of them are targeted through the media, Bellemere’s PR division will deploy counter-narratives instantly — multiple languages, multiple outlets. Disinformation won’t stick.\"\n\"Your methods are old-world, but effective,\" Lucy gave an approving smile.\n\"And yours are terrifyingly efficient,\" Daniel smirked.\nThey both turned their gaze toward Liam. He’d been silent the whole time, listening.\n\"I don’t need to micromanage either of you. My job is to make sure all the pieces align without drawing attention. No one must ever feel like they’re being protected,\" he said.\nHe stood, walking to the window where morning light washed across the city skyline.\n\"Their lives stay the same. They keep their freedom, their choices, their normalcy. The moment they feel controlled, this system collapses. So — they’ll think their security, their new homes, their privileges are simply gifts from me. Not shields.\"\n\"They’ll never know how close the walls really are,\" Daniel nodded slowly in understanding, as his cousin was also involved.\n\"Exactly,\" Liam said. \"And to make this work, I’ll subtly guide them to places we control — residences, studios, offices — all owned through Bellemere’s shell entities. They’ll be neighbors without realizing they’re in the same fortress.\"\n\"That will optimize my surveillance network and minimize exposure radius,\" Lucy nodded slightly in agreement.\n\"Good,\" Liam said softly. \"I want elegance, not paranoia. The best security is the kind that feels like peace.\"\nThe less \"alien\" he seems, the less likely they are to feel like collateral in his rise.\nThere was more to the security and protection plan of Liam’s friends, like Ghost Protocol, which would clone their digital lives into flawless AI replicas if their devices were ever compromised, erasing all traceable data.\nThe Watchtower Satellites that would be launched to monitor their surroundings in real time, learning routines and flagging any anomaly before danger could arise.\nAnd through the Bellemere Access Tier, each friend would unknowingly carry a sleek \"VIP\" card — a hidden encrypted tracker, panic beacon, and instant emergency fund all in one.\nThere was also Daniel’s protection and the protection of the mansion’s staffs and the family office’s, and their families.\nThe meeting went on for another ten minutes as Daniel made final notes on his tablet and Lucy synced the last of her projections into his secure terminal.\nWhen everything was finally set, Daniel closed his tablet and exhaled, a small but satisfied smile touching his face.\n\"That covers everything on my end,\" he said. \"I’ll begin implementing the framework immediately. The first security nodes and corporate cover programs will go live by tonight.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam nodded approvingly. \"Keep it discreet and controlled. No noise.\"\n\"Understood. One more thing before I go—The meeting time with the Gulf nations has been confirmed. They’re expecting you in two days time.\"\n\"Good. I will be flying there tomorrow with my friends,\" Liam gave a soft nod.\n\"I’ll handle things on my end,\" Daniel said.\n\"Thank you, Daniel,\" Liam said.\n\"Always a pleasure, sir,\" Daniel returned the nod with quiet respect.\nLiam smiled, watching him leave.\nThe door shut softly behind him, and the room seemed to exhale.\nLiam turned his gaze toward Lucy, who was still standing near the desk.\n\"The lunar launch vessel will be completed before the end of the day,\" she said.\n\"That’s incredible,\" Liam said sincerely.\n\"Thank you, Master,\" Lucy lowered her gaze, and her usual confidence softened into something almost shy.\nWithout thinking, Liam reached out and gently patted her head.\nHer eyes widened for a moment, then softened, a warm smile blooming across her face.\n\"You know I like it when you do that,\" she murmured.\n\"I’m aware,\" Liam chuckled, shaking his head.\nShe closed her eyes briefly, enjoying the moment. Then she stepped back, her expression returning to its composed serenity.\n\"I’ll return to the Dimensional Space to finish the work,\" she said softly.\n\"Go ahead,\" Liam replied. \"Let me know once it’s done.\"\nLucy nodded, her form shimmering faintly as the air around her rippled with light. In an instant, she was gone — dissolved back into the Dimensional Space.\nThe study was silent again.\nLiam leaned back in his chair and exhaled softly, with a small smile on his face.",

      "content": "Chapter 212: To The Moon\nAfter the meeting with Daniel and Lucy, Liam found himself with an empty schedule for the rest of the day.\nHe had nothing pressing left to do. He wasn’t going to sign in today. Not yet. He was accumulating his sign-ins, letting them build up before using them together — either the day before his second weekly sign-in or directly on that day. He hadn’t decided yet, and that uncertainty didn’t bother him.\nFor now, he was free. So, out of curiosity, he decided to check on the streamers. He wanted to see how much they were enjoying Lucid and the games.\nHe picked up the smart glass from his desk and put it on. The interface came alive instantly, as the home screen bloomed before his eyes, filled with floating icons and subtle motion.\nThe Livestream icon blinked with a small gold badge. A number hovered above it: 48. Indicating the number of ongoing streams.\n\"Let’s see what the world’s up to,\" Liam smiled.\nHe navigated to the livestream page unfolded like a digital map — tiles displaying the channels currently broadcasting, their names, view counts, and the titles of the games being played.\nAs he scrolled through, he noticed the clear split between two titles: Frontline: Starfall Dominion and Eternal Realms.\nBut the real fire was in Eternal Realms. Most of the streamers — and most of the audience — were there. Viewer numbers were in the tens of millions per channel, comments racing faster than any human could read.\nHe selected one.\nThe feed opened instantly. A young streamer, one of the forty, was immersed in Eternal Realms. The man’s avatar was standing at the edge of a vast canyon, holding a glowing spear while surrounded by his teammates.\nThe chat feed beside the screen scrolled so fast it blurred into light.\nHE’S GONNA DIE AGAIN LOL\"\n\"Bro just dodge the flame strike!\"\n\"WHERE’S THE HEALER???\"\n\"THE AI NPCs ARE TOO REAL OMG.\"\nLiam leaned back, amused. It only took him a few minutes to understand what was happening.\nThey were stuck on a group mission — one of the early Realm Challenges designed to teach coordination. The difficulty was adjustable, but these streamers had all set it to \"Dynamic Adaptive Mode,\" which scaled the AI’s intelligence based on the team’s performance.\nNow, the AI was learning their habits — predicting their attacks, countering their movements, and forcing them to adapt in real time.\nHe smiled quietly. They’re struggling already, and this is just one of the first missions.\nHe could have helped them easily. All it would take was a few voice commands through admin access to lower the difficulty or send them a hidden tip. But he didn’t.\nLucid’s worlds were meant to grow with the players. To feel alive, to test them, to make them earn progress.\nHe stayed for a while longer, watching their frantic coordination devolve into chaos, then closed the stream.\n\"Let them learn,\" he murmured.\nReturning to the home screen, Liam opened the group chat he shared with his friends. He typed:\n\"How’s everyone doing with the trip prep?\"\nThe replies came almost instantly.\nMatt: \"Done. Just waiting for tomorrow.\"\nElise: \"Same here! Can’t believe we’re actually going!\"\nKristopher: \"Luggage ready.\"\nElise: \"How long are we going anyway?\"\nLiam replied, \"About a week. Maybe two more if we travel afterward. I’ve got some things I want to see.\"\nKristopher responded first: \"World trip, huh? Sounds like a good reset for you.\"\nElise added a heart emoji.\nMatt replied with his usual confidence: \"You don’t need to ask if I’m coming. I’m already packed. You know me.\"\nLiam chuckled softly as he typed back, \"I do. And I trust you to always be there.\"\nThey kept chatting for a while — about the flight, the resorts, the private meetings Liam had planned, and the things they were hoping to see.\nElise mentioned wanting to ride camels in the desert. Matt joked about buying one. Kristopher said he’d stick to the cars.\n***\nNight came quietly over Bellemere.\nAfter dinner, Liam was in his room, ready for bed. But his mind wasn’t on sleep — he was waiting for Lucy’s update on the spacecraft.\nHe didn’t have to wait long.\n\"Master, the spacecraft is ready.\"\n\"Already?\" Liam’s eyes brightened\n\"Yes. Would you like to see it?\"\n\"Of course,\" Liam smiled\nThe next second, he vanished from his room and appeared in the Dimensional Space, in the section of the industrial base where things like the spacecraft were being built.\nBut now, a new shape dominated the space. And when he saw it, he stopped breathing for a second.\nThere, standing on the launch pad, was the spacecraft. Massive, sleek, and powerful. Its silver-black hull gleamed under the artificial light, its form both graceful and brutal.\nIts wings were short and swept back. The nose was angular but smooth, the glass of the cockpit tinted and seamless. Underneath, the ship’s belly shimmered with faint lines of light.\nIt looked like the ship from one of those sci-fi movie.\nLiam stared at it for a long moment, silently admiring the craftsmanship.\nLucy stepped forward beside him, pride in her eyes.\n\"This,\" she said softly, \"is the first interplanetary vessel. It’s the first of many to come.\"\n\"It’s perfect,\" Liam said, took a slow step forward.\n\"I optimized the design for both atmospheric and vacuum flight. Hybrid propulsion: gravitic stabilizers for lift, plasma-field engines for space travel. Capable of cruising to the moon in under forty minutes at top speed,\" Lucy smiled.\n\"Wow! Cool!\" Liam let out a low breath.\nAs they approached the ship, a small platform detached from its underside, descending slowly with soft blue light surrounding it. The pad hovered just above the ground, before them.\n\"After you,\" Lucy gestured with a faint smile.\nLiam stepped onto the pad. She joined him, and they rose together, the hum of the platform almost musical to his ears.\nWhen they reached the entry hatch, it parted silently, folding away into the hull.\nInside, the air smelled faintly metallic, clean, new. The walls glowed softly with embedded light. The cockpit and cabin were designed in smooth, minimalist lines — seven seats in total, enough for his team or his friends.\nThe pilot’s seat was slightly elevated at the front, facing a transparent forward screen that doubled as a HUD.\n\"This is...\" Liam began, then stopped, unable to finish. \"This is incredible.\"\n\"I modeled part of it from the sci-fi films I know you’ve watched,\" Lucy said with a teasing smile. \"But the systems are completely mine.\"\n\"I thought it looked familiar,\" Liam laughed softly.\nShe walked beside him, pointing out panels and modules. \"Every system is autonomous. Life support, shield regulation, trajectory adjustment — all can be managed manually or by thought through Lucid synchronization.\"\nLucy also transfered everything about the spacecraft to him, through Lucid, making sure that Liam knew everything about the spacecraft.\nLiam nodded, as he absorbed the information. From the information Lucy give her, he can see that she really outdid herself. She made sure to pull no stop when she was building the spacecraft.\nHe smiled and decided to fly the spacecraft. He didn’t need to learn that because with his Pro-level Vehicular Operating skill, he can fly it and the information Lucy just sent to him, helped too.\nHe sat down in the pilot’s seat and pressed the activation pad on the right armrest.\nThe ship responded instantly.\nA deep hum filled the cabin, followed by a soft vibration. The control panels lit up — lines of data flowing like liquid light. The forward screen displayed environmental readings, spatial coordinates, and flight diagnostics.\nBut there was one oddity.\nLOCATION: UNDEFINED — GEOREFERENCE\nLOSS COORDINATE STATUS: NULL (NAV-404)\n\"Still can’t recognize the Dimensional Space,\"Liam smiled faintly.\n\"Correct,\" Lucy said. \"Navigation systems can’t define this realm.\"\n\"It doesn’t matter.\" He placed his hands on the controls. \"Let’s take her out.\"\nWith a simple thought, the vessel followed his will, phasing seamlessly out of the Dimensional Space while he remained seated in the pilot’s chair.\nAppearing on the island’s runway, the holographic display still showed the same coordinates as before — undefined, unregistered.\nLiam knew why and didn’t mind. He wrapped his hands around the controls and guided the spacecraft upward.\nThe engines responded instantly, lifting it vertically into the air and flew out of the island.\nMoments later, they were finally out of the island. The instant they crossed the boundary, the navigation interface flickered — data streams realigning, recalibrating.\nLOCATION: CARIBBEAN SEA — EARTH.\nLiam smiled, as he adjusted the throttle, and the ship angled upward, and set course for the moon.\nAfter he did that, he switched to full thrust and shoot up into the sky. The acceleration pressed against him gently, but the stabilizers compensated instantly. Through the cockpit glass, the world fell away, quickly shrinking into a blue ball.\nThe moon, here I come.",

      "content": "Chapter 213: First Man On The Dark Side Of The Moon\nEarth shrank behind them like a fading jewel. From the pilot’s seat, Liam could see its soft blues and whites blending into a pale, luminous sphere. It hung suspended in the dark sea of space, haloed by light from the sun.\nThe spacecraft glided upward, leaving the last thin film of atmosphere behind. The shift was subtle as gravity loosened its grip on the spacecraft, and the weight of the world seemed to slip off his shoulders.\nHe looked through the windscreen, which also doubled as a Smart Canopy. The stars were looked sharp, now that Liam was looking at them directly and they were no longer blurred by the distortion of air. He counted thousands upon thousands of them. Pinpricks of light across a black canvas that stretched forever.\nLucy stood beside him and she was quiet too. She was aware that Liam was enjoying the moment, and she didn’t want to ruin it for him by speaking.\nThe spacecraft maintained a steady climb. The stars around them shifted slightly as the onboard systems compensated for motion. In the distance, the moon began to grow — no longer a pale circle in the sky, but a vast and textured world, with deep, ancient craters.\nThe spacecraft entered transition range and Liam switched to silent drive, and a soft hum replaced the low thunder of the engines. The transition was seamless as the ship now moved without any mechanical sound, powered by gravitic lift instead of thrust.\nBelow them, the curve of Earth gleamed one last time before fading into darkness. Ahead, the moon loomed larger with every passing second.\nThey got to the final approach and Liam decided to see the view of the moon in full light before they enter the dark side.\nHe rolled the ship slowly, allowing the bright half of the moon to fill the cockpit. The light washed through the glass, in pure silver glow.\n\"It’s beautiful,\" Lucy said quietly.\n\"It is,\" Liam agreed. \"The silence makes it even more so.\"\nThe ship crossed the dividing line. Day vanished behind them. Ahead lay the dark side — a world without sunrise.\nLiam adjusted the stabilizers, the glow of the sun fading completely from view. Shadows swallowed the vessel, leaving only the faint light of distant stars.\n\"Entering the dark side,\" Lucy said softly.\nThe instruments adjusted automatically. The sensors switched to low-light mode. Craters and ridges appeared in ghostly clarity across the display.\n\"Scan for a stable plateau. Somewhere quiet,\" Liam said.\n\"Scanning... found one. Coordinates uploaded.\"\n\"Good. Beginning descent.\"\nHe guided the craft down himself, one hand on the throttle, the other on attitude control. The motion was slow, deliberate, and silent. The moon’s terrain slid past the glass — jagged, empty, endless.\n\"Altitude: one kilometer... six hundred meters... two hundred...\" Lucy’s voice stayed calm.\n\"Manual landing,\" Liam said.\n\"Confirmed.\"\nHe eased the ship forward and cut the thrust halfway, letting the gravitic stabilizers handle the rest. The vessel hovered briefly, aligning perfectly over the plateau.\nThere was a gentle tremor as the spacecraft landed on the surface of the moon.\n\"Touchdown confirmed,\" Lucy said.\n\"Smooth,\" Liam smiled, as he released a slow breath and leaned back.\n\"As always, Master.\"\n\"Time to see it in person,\" Liam smiled, as he stood up from the pilot’s seat.\nHe walked towards the airlock chamber, followed behind by Lucy. As they stepped inside, the walls brightened with a soft blue hue.\nThe interior walls adjusted automatically, sliding away to reveal a circular room — the airlock.\nThe chamber glowed faintly blue. Mechanical arms extended from hidden compartments above, unfolding with precise, silent motion.\n\"Stand still, Master,\" Lucy said.\nLiam stood still on the circular platform.\nThe first arm descended, locking the chest plate onto him. The sound was clean — clack-hiss. Another arm sealed his shoulders, then his arms, then his legs. The armor assembled like liquid metal forming muscle.\nWithin seconds, the exosuit had enclosed him completely. The helmet descended last, sealing over his head with a gentle click.\nThe exosuit’s HUD blinked to life. Oxygen levels stable. Gravity calibration ready. Suit integrity: 100%.\nLiam flexed his hands. The servos responded instantly, smooth and fluid.\n\"Ready, Master.\"\n\"Let’s go.\"\nThe hatch below them opened, revealing the docking lift. The circular platform rose through it, then began to descend to the surface of the moon.\nThe landing lights illuminated the lunar surface—a field of gray dust and black stone stretching as far as sight allowed.\nThe platform hovered down until it met the ground, the hum fading away.\nLiam took the first step.\nHis boot pressed into the dust, leaving a perfect print. The motion was light, almost dreamlike. The gravity was barely here and each movement felt like he was floating.\nHe took another step and he turned to see if he could see the Earth, but the moon was tidally locked and Earth wasn’t visible from here and vice versa.\nThis was also the reason he had chosen this part of the moon, to build the starship.\n\"Lucy,\" he said quietly. \"We made it.\"\nShe nodded, as she stepped beside him.\n\"The first humans on this side of the moon.\"\n\"Not bad for a morning flight,\" he said.\n\"Not bad at all,\" she smiled.\nHe turned his gaze around, taking in the untouched landscape. Every crater was a frozen scar, every ridge a monument to silence\nLiam decided to do what he came here to do in the first place; assigning an access point to the moon.\n[Ding!]\n[Would you like to assign your current position as an access point?]\n[Yes] [No]\nHe immediately chose [Yes].\n[Access point has been assigned. You can now access the Dimensional Space]\n\"Lucy, the moon now connects to the Dimensional Space. You can start construction whenever you’re ready,\" he said.\n\"Ok, Master,\" Lucy nodded.\nThe next moment, the air in front of her started rippling and she stepped through it.\nAfter Lucy had left, Liam stood there for a while, gazing at the horizon. The stars above didn’t twinkle here. They burned cold and steady. The silence was absolute as there was no wind or even a sound of life.\nHe took a slow breath, then he began to walk.\nHis footsteps left soft prints in the dust as he moved toward the darker ridges. The terrain was uneven but beautiful in its emptiness. Jagged craters, sharp shadows, distant cliffs.\nThis was a world sculpted by time and untouched by hands.\nHe moved without hurry, scanning the landscape. He saw a deep crater ahead and he shot towards it, flight here was easier thanks to the exosuit.\nHe descended into the crater but he saw nothing but darkness all around him. He smiled to himself, as he flew out of the crater and continued exploring the moon.",

      "content": "Chapter 214: Flying With Friends To Dubai\nMorning light poured through the tall glass windows of Bellemere Mansion, glinting off polished marble and the silverware set neatly on the breakfast table.\nLiam sat alone at the head of the table, enjoying a calm breakfast. The food was simple—eggs, toast, and freshly brewed coffee.\nToday was the day before his second weekly sign-in and the day he’s to use his accumulated sign-ins, but he decided to delay it and not sign-in in the morning, as he wants to focus on the travel.\nEvelyn had already packed his things earlier that morning. The Rolls-Royce Ghost Black Badge was already waiting outside, gleaming under the morning sun. Nick was already in the driver’s seat, with that car’s engine humming quietly, while Mason stood near the front door.\nWhen Liam finished eating, he rose from his seat and walked toward the main hall. Mason straightened immediately and opened the door.\n\"Good morning, sir,\" he greeted.\n\"Good morning, Mason,\" Liam replied with a small nod and a light tone.\nThe air outside was crisp, filled with the faint scent of wet pavement from last night’s drizzle. Liam adjusted the cuff of his jacket as he walked toward the waiting car. Mason followed two steps behind, his movements perfectly measured.\nMason opened the door for him, and Liam slipped inside and the door closed with a soft thud.\nMason took his seat beside Nick in the front, and the car began its smooth roll down the driveway. The iron gates of Bellemere slid open automatically as they approached, and the world outside welcomed them. The quiet streets of Holmby Hills stretched ahead, lined with palm trees swaying gently under the clear sky.\n***\nHalf an hour later, the Rolls-Royce glided through the private access road leading to LAX’s elite hangars. Their destination: Liam’s personal hangar.\nNick slowly steered the car into the hangar. Inside, the Black Titan, the Flying Palace—the private A380—waited like a sleeping giant, its sleek black fuselage gleaming under the floodlights. Ground crew members moved around it in coordinated silence, finalizing preflight checks.\nNick stopped beside the boarding lift. Mason got out first and opened the door for Liam.\nThe moment Liam stepped out, a chorus of greetings broke out nearby.\n\"Finally!\" Matt exclaimed, grinning ear to ear. He, Kristopher, Harper, and Alex were all waiting just a few meters away. They looked relaxed but excited, and they each were dressed casually.\n\"Good to see you, man,\" Kristopher said, pulling Liam into a quick hug.\n\"You too,\" Liam said with a warm smile.\nThe girls approached next—Stacy, Kristy, Lana, and Elise—each looking effortlessly composed, though their eyes gleamed with excitement.\nElise waved, \"We were starting to think you’d make a dramatic entrance by landing your chopper on top of the hangar.\"\n\"Tempting. But I’ll save that for another day,\" Liam replied, smiling.\nThey all laughed. There was an ease between them, a natural rhythm that came from shared history rather than circumstance.\n\"Come on,\" Liam said, motioning toward the boarding lift. \"Let’s get onboard. We’ve got a long flight ahead.\"\nThe lift lowered smoothly to meet them. The group stepped onto it and rose toward the aircraft’s entryway. The massive jet felt more like a palace in the sky than a plane—two decks, custom interiors, and every luxury imaginable.\nInside, Liam took his usual seat near the forward lounge. The others settled around him.\nMatt dropped into one of the couches with a sigh of pure contentment and muttered, \"I swear, every time I get on this plane, it still feels unreal. Like—how are we even friends with the guy who owns an A380?\"\n\"You’re not the only one thinking that. Every time I see it, I have to remind myself this isn’t a dream,\" Kristopher chuckled, stretching his legs.\n\"Oh, please. You think that’s surreal? Try wrapping your head around the fact that he’s got a meeting with Gulf royals. Real-life princes, Kristopher,\" Stacy smirked.\nHer tone was teasing, but her words carried a hint of awe. The others turned toward Liam, who simply smiled.\n\"It’s just a meeting,\" he said lightly. \"Don’t make it sound dramatic.\"\nElise raised a brow. \"You’re meeting three royal families. It’s dramatic by definition.\"\nLiam just laughed. \"Alright, fair enough.\"\nAs the ground crew finished loading their luggage, the plane was towed out of the hangar and it began taxiing down the runway.\nWithin minutes, the A380 lifted off, climbing through the morning haze and Los Angeles receded into the distance, with their destination being Dubai.\nLiam had arranged for them to stay for a week in the Middle East, basing themselves in Dubai at the Burj Khalifa’s private residential floors—an entire level reserved for them.\nThe Bellemere Family Office had already handled the logistics. Two representatives had flown ahead yesterday to coordinate everything with the royal aides and manage the schedule for Liam’s meetings.\nFor now, though, there was nothing to do but enjoy the flight.\nIt was a sixteen-hour journey, and boredom wasn’t an option.\n\"So what do we do for sixteen hours?\" Harper asked, glancing around the lounge.\n\"Movies?\" Kristy suggested.\n\"Boring,\" Matt said. \"We should watch the Lucid streams.\"\nThat caught everyone’s attention.\n\"Lucid again?\" Elise laughed. \"You’ve been talking about that thing nonstop.\"\n\"Because it’s insane,\" Matt said, eyes lighting up.\n\"The VR gameplay is so real it’s scary. I was watching that guy, Phil Aiken, last night and I almost cried when he died in-game.\"\n\"I’ll admit, that’s wild,\" Kristopher nodded. \"But how does an unknown company outdo literally every major tech firm on the planet?\"\n\"Exactly!\" Matt said, sitting forward. \"It’s not just the tech. It’s everything. Neural link? Perfect. Local AI processing? Perfect. Real-time adaptive environments with emotional AI? Perfect. You realize no one’s ever done that before?\"\n\"You sound like the company’s spokesperson,\" Harper shook his head.\nMatt ignored him. \"You don’t get it. The craziest part isn’t even the tech—it’s the games. They built, like, eight AAA-level VR worlds, all alive, all reactive. That’s impossible. Even the biggest studios take years for one!\"\nThe group exchanged amused looks.\n\"Out of everything you mentioned,\" Stacy said dryly, \"you think the biggest achievement is the games?\"\n\"Absolutely,\" Matt said without hesitation. \"You guys don’t understand—building a game that feels real is way harder than building the tech. Even the kids’ games on Lucid are better than half the AAA titles we’ve got now!\"\nHe leaned forward, completely animated now. \"It’s not just graphics or realism—it’s life. The NPCs react differently every time. They think, they argue, they adapt. They’re not just lines of code.\"\n\"Spoken like a true addict,\" Harper teased.\nMatt ignored him again, clearly too deep in his excitement.\nKristopher smiled faintly. \"Too bad we can’t even buy one yet. The company made sure Lucid can’t be resold. No black market, no scalpers. Totally locked down.\"\n\"That’s what makes it so mysterious,\" Lana said quietly. \"They built the most advanced tech in the world, and no one knows who they are.\"\nLiam, who had been listening quietly the whole time, smiled slightly.\n\"You might get lucky,\" he said.\nMatt perked up instantly. \"Wait—what do you mean by that?\"\n\"You might get the device,\" Liam said, his tone teasing.\nThe boys cheered, laughing, while the girls shook their heads. It wasn’t that they didn’t believe him but they felt it would be next to impossible, with how little the units Nova Technologies intends to release monthly.\nLiam actually intends to give his friends a Lucid unit each on the day of the launch.\n\"I’m serious,\" Matt said, grinning wide. \"If I ever get one, I’m not leaving my house again.\"\n\"You said that about your last console,\" Harper said. \"And you still left for free food when we called you.\"\n\"Yeah, well, priorities change,\" Matt shot back, earning another round of laughter.\nThen Lana, who had been quiet for most of the conversation, spoke up softly, \"If I do get one, I want to play Frontline: Starfall Dominion.\"\n\"You?\" Liam looked at her in mild surprise.\nHe had never taken her for a girl that love guns, especially with how quiet she usually is.\n\"I like strategy. And good weapons,\" Lana smiled shyly. It was as if she had revealed her darkest secret.\nThe others burst out laughing. Elise nearly choked on her drink.\n\"She’s been secretly watching gameplay videos for days,\" she said between laughs. \"She knows the weapon names better than Matt.\"\n\"That’s a lie,\" Matt protested, but the laughter only got louder.\nThe rest of the flight was filled with easy chatter, laughter, and light teasing that drifted through the cabin like background music.\nLiam smiled as he enjoyed the moment with them.",

      "content": "Chapter 215: Dubai\nDubai International Airport.\nThe sky above the Persian Gulf shimmered like molten gold as the A380, The Black Titan, descended gracefully through the early afternoon haze. The horizon glowed with the mirrored silhouettes of glass towers, their edges catching the desert light.\nThe aircraft touched down with a low, velvety roar. Its black fuselage gleamed like obsidian under the desert sun, reflecting streaks of light as it slowed along the runway and turned toward the private tarmac reserved for diplomatic and royal flights.\nInside the cabin, Liam stood near the window, one hand in his pocket, calm as ever. The others were quiet, their eyes fixed on the world outside. Even after sixteen hours of flight, the city’s beauty made fatigue seem like a distant thought.\n\"Welcome to Dubai,\" Liam said softly, more to himself than to anyone else.\nThe aircraft taxied to a stop in front of the VIP terminal. Two Rolls-Royce Phantoms and three Mercedes-Maybachs were already lined up on the tarmac, their black paint polished to a mirror finish.\nWhen the door finally opened, the desert heat swept in — warm, dry, carrying the faint scent of sand and aviation fuel. Mason stepped out first, scanning the surroundings, and Nick followed.\nThen came Liam.\nHe descended the steps slowly, the sunlight catching the sharp lines of his suit. His friends followed behind, stretching lightly, their movements composed.\nWaiting at the bottom of the stairs were two figures — a man and a woman, both dressed in elegant, dark suits. They bowed slightly as Liam approached.\n\"Welcome to Dubai, Mr. Scott,\" the man said in a refined British accent, his tone respectful but assured. \"I’m Fahim El-Razi, regional director for Bellemere Family Office Middle East. This is Miss Clara Duval, operations coordinator.\"\nClara smiled politely. \"It’s an honor to have you here, sir. We’ve arranged everything according to your itinerary.\"\n\"Thank you, Fahim. Clara.\" Liam’s tone was calm, almost casual, but the way both representatives straightened showed how much weight even those two words carried.\nLiam was actually surprised that the family office now had a regional office in the Middle East. But when he thought about it, he felt it was only necessary.\nFahim continued, \"Customs and immigration have been cleared in advance. Your passports have been processed through diplomatic protocol. The royal liaison will meet with you tomorrow evening at Emirates Palace. Until then, you’ll be residing at the Burj Khalifa private residences. The entire floor is yours.\"\nMatt let out a low whistle beside Liam before catching himself.\n\"An entire floor?\" he muttered under his breath. Harper elbowed him lightly, reminding him to keep it together.\n\"Perfect,\" Liam said simply.\n\"Your luggage has already been transferred, sir,\" Clara added. \"Ground transport is ready whenever you are.\"\nLiam nodded. \"Then let’s go.\"\nThe group followed as Fahim led the way toward the convoy. The tarmac shimmered in the heat, the jet standing behind them like a sleeping titan.\nThe moment the cabin doors of the Rolls-Royces closed, the sound of the outside world faded away — replaced by the hum of air conditioning and the subtle scent of leather and oud. The convoy began moving, gliding silently out of the airport and into the vast network of immaculate Dubai highways.\n***\nFor a long stretch, none of them spoke. The city itself did the talking.\nThe skyline unfurled like something out of a dream — an ocean of glass and steel rising from the desert. The Burj Khalifa towered in the distance, piercing the clouds, shimmering like a needle of light.\nElise smiled faintly. \"I’ve been here before, but it still feels unreal.\"\n\"You’ve been here?\" Harper asked.\n\"For a fashion week event, two years ago. But we only stayed two nights.\"\n\"Two nights? We’re staying a week,\" Matt grinned. \"I might not leave.\"\nKristopher chuckled. \"You say that everywhere.\"\nTheir laughter filled the cabin softly. Despite their composure, excitement lingered beneath their calm facades. It wasn’t just luxury; it was the awareness that they were part of something much larger now — something most of the world could only watch from a distance.\nMason sat in the front, silent, his eyes scanning the road. Nick drove with professional ease, never needing direction, as Fahim’s team had already transmitted the route digitally.\nThrough the tinted glass, the city was alive, with Lamborghinis and other sport cars purring down immaculate roads, palm trees perfectly aligned along the median, and architecture that looked more like art than construction.\nAs they entered Downtown Dubai, the convoy slowed. The Burj Khalifa loomed before them now, its silver body reflecting the afternoon sun in a thousand shards of light.\nEven Elise — who prided herself on her composure — fell silent.\n\"Wow,\" she breathed. \"Every time I see it... it feels like it shouldn’t exist.\"\nLana nodded quietly beside her. \"It looks like it’s touching the sky.\"\nFrom a distance, the tower did look unreal — impossibly tall, its form tapering into the clouds.\nThe convoy turned into a private lane leading to an underground entrance shielded from public view. Guards in suits and earpieces were stationed discreetly by the marble archway. They bowed as the cars passed through, their movements crisp and silent.\nInside, cool air replaced the desert heat. The Rolls-Royces stopped beside a private elevator bank marked Sky Residences — Restricted Access.\nClara turned to Liam. \"Sir, your biometric authorization has already been linked. The elevator will recognize you and your companions. No keycards required.\"\nLiam gave a faint nod, \"Thank you, Clara. You’ve done well.\"\n\"It’s an honor, sir,\" She smiled, the faintest flush of pride coloring her face.\n***\nThe elevator ride was soundless. As they rose, the digital display ticked upward — 100... 120... 140... 150...\nWhen the doors opened, soft light spilled out.\nThey stepped into a living space that looked more like a suspended palace than an apartment.\nThe floor-to-ceiling windows revealed all of Dubai stretched out below — the glittering roads, the artificial islands coiled like jewels on the sea, the desert stretching endlessly beyond.\nThe entire floor was an open expanse of luxury. A seamless blend of glass, marble, and gold accents. The furniture was modern yet warm — Italian leather, Arabian design touches, and subtle mood lighting that shifted automatically with the daylight.\n\"Holy...\" Matt started, then stopped himself. \"This place makes Bellemere look small.\"\nLiam smiled faintly. \"It’s... adequate.\"\nKristy looked at him like she wasn’t sure if he was joking. \"Adequate?\"\n\"Don’t bother,\" Harper said. \"He doesn’t do awe.\"\nThat drew laughter from the group.\nThey began to explore like children let loose in a secret world. The dining area overlooked the clouds. The master suites had walk-in closets the size of hotel rooms. Each room carried the scent of jasmine and soft wood, maintained at a perfect temperature.\nElise wandered to the window, resting her palm against the glass. \"It feels like you could step outside and walk on air.\"\n\"You almost could,\" Liam said behind her.\nShe turned, smiling softly. \"Does anything faze you?\"\nHe thought about it for a moment, then smiled. \"Not much.\"\nHe wasn’t lying. He had walked on the moon and he has flown to outer space. Not much can faze him anymore at this point.\n***\nAn hour later, after showers and changes of clothes, the group gathered in the main lounge — now dressed in lighter attire, lounging on the couches that faced the panoramic skyline.\nFahim and Clara had departed after briefing Liam on the next day’s schedule, which will start with a formal reception at the Emirates Palace, followed by a private meeting with members of three royal families.\nFor now, the suite belonged to them alone.\nThe city glittered beneath them, and from this height, even the traffic lights looked like threads of gold weaving through the streets.\nKristopher was the first to break the silence. \"This view... it’s unreal.\"\nHarper looked around. \"You realize people would sell their souls for a week here?\"\nMatt nodded, looking genuinely amazed. \"Yeah. And we’re just... here. Like it’s normal.\"\n\"It’s not normal,\" Lana said quietly. \"It’s just... Liam.\"\nThey all looked toward him. Liam was sitting near the far window, silent, watching the sunset over the desert. The light painted gold across his face, his reflection merging with the skyline outside.\nFor a moment, no one spoke.\nThen Elise said softly, \"Thank you for bringing us.\"\nLiam turned slightly, his expression calm but warm. \"You’re my friends. That’s reason enough.\"\nThe room fell into a comfortable quiet again, as the group settled in to rest from the long flight.",

      "content": "Chapter 216: Sixth Weekly Sign-in\nNight draped itself gently over Dubai. The lights of the city shimmered like molten gold against the glass walls of the Burj Khalifa, reflecting endlessly in the distance.\nInside the master suite, Liam sat on the edge of the bed, his gaze turned toward the skyline that stretched endlessly into the horizon.\nHis friends had all gone to bed hours ago, worn out from the long flight and the excitement of arrival.\nThe next day was already set to be heavy, as he will be meeting with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.\nHe should’ve been sleeping too, but his mind was elsewhere. Today was the day of his second weekly sign-in in the cultivation universe.\nThe system follows Los Angeles’ time. And while it was nighttime in Dubai, another day had started back home the moment they landed.\nLiam didn’t bother to sign-in during the flight, not because he can’t, he can but he decided to accumulate the sign-in instead.\nWithout further delay, he let out a deep breath and vanished from the room, appearing in his VIP suite in Great Yan Empire and it was daytime.\n\"Let’s see what good things the system has in store for me this time,\" he said, as he took his seat on the bed.\nSystem, sign-in.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, on your sixth weekly sign-in.]\n[You received a Secret Realm.]\n[You received a Celestial Grade Item: Heavenly Scriptures Pagoda.]\n[You received a Primordial Grade Item: Abyssal Dragon Spine.]\n[You received a Primordial Grade Item: Fusang Tree Seed.]\n[Note: The authority and location of the Secret Realm have been transferred to the Host. The Heavenly Scriptures Pagoda, the Abyssal Dragon Spine, and the Fusang Tree Seed have been placed in the Dimensional Space. You may plant the seed whenever you wish.]\n***\nA bright, wide smile coloured Liam’s face when he saw the rewards. He didn’t receive gold coins or spirit stones today but he didn’t mind. The rewards he received more than compensate for them.\nThe first reward, Secret Realm are places considered to be treasure troves in cultivation worlds, no matter the level of the secret realm. They are hidden worlds rich in qi, untouched by mortals, and often guarded by laws of Heaven and Earth themselves. And for one that was given to him by the system, there was no way that it would be any less than those he has read about.\nLiam curiously focused on the reward and its description window popped up.\n[Secret Realm]\nDescription: A self sustaining minor world populated by trees and plants, located in the lower part of the cultivation universe. It stands on the same level as other minor worlds but its uniqueness lies in its abundant and high density spirit qi, that almost puts way above other minor worlds or mortal worlds. Its laws support cultivation up to the Mahayana Realm and also undergo tribulation to ascend to the immortal realm.\n***\nMore information on the secret realm poured into Liam’s mind like a flood of light. His eyes widened, the corners of his lips parting slightly in disbelief.\nJust as the description as already explained, the secret realm was a fully formed world, suspended in the lower planes of the cultivation universe.\nIt’s a living, breathing minor world, complete with sky, rivers, mountains, plains, and endless forests brimming with spiritual plants and trees.\nIt was almost identical to the mortal world he was in now, except for one staggering distinction: its laws rejected the birth or entry of any creature, meaning no humans, beasts or insects.\nAlso, the secret realm is hidden from even the perception of Immortals. And the flow of time inside the realm was already thirty-five times faster than Earth, and ten times faster than the mortal world he currently in. That alone was incredible, as a single day outside equated to over a month within.\nBut that wasn’t the limit. He could push it even further—all the way up to three hundred times faster than Earth or two hundred times faster than the mortal world.\nLiam leaned back slowly, a soft exhale escaping his lips. He had seen many broken rules, but this... this was defiance of causality itself.\nAn entire world that could evolve centuries while mere days passed outside. A world that could be reshaped, cultivated, and grown in secret, all the while also hidden from Immortals.\nLiam sat still, letting the implications sink in.\nThe practical benefits alone were astounding. He was now the owner of the secret realm, which means he ccould change its laws and lifts the restriction if he wants to. He could also make time in there dance to his design.\nBut that wasn’t all there is to the secret. According to the information in his head, it could also be integrated into the Dimensional Space, forming a subordinate world under its authority.\nIntegrate it... with the Dimensional Space?\nThat possibility was almost unthinkable.\nThe Dimensional Space itself was already something beyond comprehension—an independent pocket of existence whose very coordinates were not part of any known universe.\nAccording to the System’s earlier explanation, it’s located in the Grand Universe—a place which according to the system, is filled with extremely terrifying entities.\nLiam’s mind raced, as he thought of what this means for him and the things he can achieve with it.\nHe wondered what kind of existence he would have to become before he could even attempt such a feat.\n\"Just what level would I need to reach...\" he muttered softly, his gaze distant, \"...before I can touch something that exists beyond reality itself?\"\n\"Now then, let’s see what the next treasure holds,\" he said softly.\n[Heavenly Scriptures Pagoda]\nDescription: A nine-level Celestial–Primordial pagoda that contains every manual ever written or conceived—cultivation, battle, weapon, alchemy, formation, and Dao. Each floor represents one of the Nine Heavens; the higher the level, the purer the knowledge and the stronger the laws. Inside are cultivation, enlightenment, alchemy, and training rooms whose effects and time flow multiply with every floor.\n***\nMore knowledge about the Pagoda poured into Liam’s mind, layer after layer, until the sheer magnitude of it left him frozen in silence.\nThe deeper he understood its structure, the more impossible it became to comprehend. The Heavenly Scriptures Pagoda wasn’t just a divine treasure—it was perfection forged into form.\nEvery aspect of cultivation, from body refinement to enlightenment, from alchemy to weapon forging, from array formation to Dao comprehension, was contained within it.\nFrom the information in his head, Liam knew that if such an artifact ever appeared in the open, sects would raze continents to claim it. Empires would collapse overnight. Even Immortal Sects would march to war without hesitation.\nThe Pagoda was more than a treasure—it was a library of creation itself. A sanctuary of wisdom that held the foundation of every art, every law, and every truth ever conceived. Its nine floors represented the Nine Heavens, each more profound than the last, and within them were chambers for cultivation, enlightenment, alchemy, and training—each amplifying progress beyond imagination.\nLiam sat still for a long moment, then exhaled slowly and smiled softly.\n\"So this is what a Celestial artifact truly is,\" he murmured.\nHe could already sense the endless potential it offered, the knowledge and opportunities it contained. But there was no rush, as he intends to explore it in the future.\nWith the Pagoda and the secret realm, he could train his people, build an army and build the greatest empire.\nLiam’s smile widened when he thought of this. It seems like he won’t have to sit around and wait until he has created the perfect foundation for his cultivation. He can start building his force whenever he wants.\nBut that would be for later, for now, he still has more treasures to check on.",

      "content": "Chapter 217: Sixth Weekly Sign-in (2)\n[Abyssal Dragon Spine]\nDescription: The preserved spinal column of an Abyssal Dragon Sovereign who transcended the limits of existence and attained the Saint Realm.\n[Note: Upon fusion, the Host shall awaken the Abyssal Dragon Bloodline, inherit the race’s primordial legacy, and gain innate dominion over the Daos born from their lineage.]\n***\n\".....\"\nLiam had no idea how to react when he react. He could only sit there in silence trying to understand what he had just read and the implications.\nAfter what seemed like a full minutes, he finally gained control of his emotions. He closed his eyes briefly and sighed heavily.\n\"System, how high is the Saint Realm?\"\nThis was the major question on his mind. He had multiple questions he wants to ask the system but this one was more important to him.\nIt was only when he understands how high of a realm the Saint Realm is, only then he can fully understand what he had just received.\nBut something told him that the system’s response was going to be shocking as always.\n[The Saint Realm is a major realm above the Immortal Realms.]\nAbove the Immortal Realms...\nLiam muttered to himself thoughtfully.\nThe Abyssal Dragon Spine was just like the physiques he received from last week’s weekly sign-in. He can only get more information on it after fusion but the knowledge he has on it at the moment, from the description, was more than enough to tell him how absurd of a reward it actually.\nThis was especially so for the note section that said after fusion, he will awaken the Abyssal Dragon Bloodline, inherit the race’s primordial legacy, and gain innate dominion over the Daos born from their lineage.\nThis part already gives him more than enough information for him to understand how insane of a reward the Abyssal Dragon Spine was.\nBut there was something Liam was curious about. How did the system get the spine of such a terrifying existence? Did it kill? Or does it have it stached away somewhere, and pulled it out to reward him today?\nOf course, Liam knew that for an entity like that system that can hand out Transcendental Grade rewards like candy—a grade which is also known as Absolute Grade and according to it, the highest grade in this universe—the bone of a measly entity just above the Immortal Realms would be nothing. And this only served to heighten Liam’s curiosity about the system’s identity.\nFor one, Liam was aware that if the Abyssal Dragon Spine is to be brought out to the cultivation world, the whole world would fall into chaos.\nIf it appears in a mortal world, that world would be destroyed as immortals would descend in droves to lay claim to it. Blood and death would wash the world, and nothing would be left of it. The bloodshed would be even worse if it appears in the immortal world, as every factions and group would mobilise their force without restriction.\nEven for Liam who is knowledgeable on this world’s power ranking system, he knew that the bone of an existence above the Immortal Realms wasn’t something anyone can overlook.\n\"System, can I fuse the Abyssal Dragon Spine now or after I’ve created the perfect foundation?\" Liam asked curiously.\nHe already knew the answer to this, but he still wants to confirm directly from the system.\n[It would be more advisable to fuse it after, Host.]\nLiam nodded, not having a problem with that. He just needs to have patient for a little more time and he would start cultivating.\nHe smiled to himself, as he turned his attention to the last of his weekly sign-in rewards.\n[Fusang Tree Seed]\nDescription: A seed from the mythic Fusang Tree.\n***\nThe description was simple but Liam knew that it was more than simple. He knew what next to do, as he vanished from the VIP suite and appeared in the Dimensional Space.\nHe was currently standing in front of the long obsidian table, which was outside the autonomous infrastructure.\nThe items that were previously on the table—car keys, property documents and others—had already been taken away by the bots and were stored in his office.\nIn place of those items, the spine rested in the center of the obsidian table and it was immense in size—twenty meters long.\nEvery vertebra shaped like a jagged black crystal, its surface glimmering faintly with light that wasn’t light at all.\nIt was also giving off a suffocating pressure, causing the air to vibrated faintly, as if the space was struggling to contain it.\nLiam still stood a few meters away, motionless. A faint pressure stirred the edges of his consciousness. For a split second, something flashed across his mind—a vision so vivid it stole the air from his lungs.\nHe saw a vast, black dragon soaring through a starless sky. Its wings stretched across galaxies, its scales shimmered with starlight, and its roar devoured the sound of creation. Worlds cracked beneath its flight. Suns burned out in silence as it passed. Its eyes were like twin abysses, deep enough to drown gods.\n\"That... was terrifying. It’s like staring at a sleeping god,\" he murmured in a low voice.\nHe extended his hand slowly, letting it hover just above the surface of the nearest vertebra. The air around his fingers vibrated faintly, and for an instant, he felt something brush against his mind.\nIt was a memory of endless hunger. Of cold, infinite space. Of ancient, coiling power that devoured the fabric of existence just to see if it could.\nHe pulled his hand back. The sensation faded instantly, leaving behind silence.\n\"It’s like its will is still there,\" he muttered, as he turned his gaze back to the table.\n\"Now, let’s see the Fusang Tree Seed,\" he said softly.\nHe turned to look at the seed and what he saw at first glance, was an almost ordinary looking seed. It looked like a peach core, faintly rough around the edges, colored a dull brown that reflected no light.\nLiam looked closer, studying it carefully.\nIt looks ordinary. Too ordinary.\nOf course, he knew that while it might look that way, the Fusang Tree is a mythic divine plant said to draw its energy directly from suns. Its roots pierce the flow of time, and its branches absorb stellar light. Even the smallest fragment of its seed contains infinite vitality.\nLiam reached out slowly, and the moment his fingers brushed the surface of the seed, but he felt nothing, not even the expected flood of information.\nHe didn’t pay much attention to it, as he knew that he would have to plant it first before he can start seeing any benefit from itm\nHe looked up at the vast expanse of the Dimensional Space above him and he smiled. He decided he will plant the seed in the Dimensional Space but he will have to create a sustainable environment for it first... Or maybe not.",

There were still things he needed to take care of.\nThe first was the planting of the Fusang Tree Seed.\n\"System, where should I plant it?\" He asked.\n[Plant the Fusang Tree Seed near the Spirit Lake where Yanxia is cultivating.]\n\"By the lake then,\" Liam said softly.\nWithout wasting time, he picked up the seed and rose into the air and flew towards the lake.\nAfter a few minutes of flight, he began to feel that familiar wave of heat rolling through the air, though this time it was far more intense.\nThe air shimmered, and molten gold danced across the horizon. But despite the temperature, Liam felt no discomfort. Because of his bond with Yanxia, the heat washed over him like the embrace of an old friend.\nWhen he arrived, the once-lake was now a crater of radiance. The vast sphere of golden-red fire that had enveloped Yanxia had grown even brighter since the last time he was here.\nEven at this distance, the heat could melt steel, but to Liam, it was warmth.\nHe landed a short distance away, the ground beneath his boots glowing faintly red from the heat. The Spirit Lake’s once-clear waters were now evaporated, replaced by an ocean of shimmering spiritual mist.\n\"She’s solidifying her cultivation faster. When she’d done, she will probably be at the Golden Immortal Realm, perfected stage.\" Liam said quietly.\nThe system said that the newborns of her race takes decades to solidify their cultivation. He estimated, by the time she finished solidifying her foundation, four to five months would pass on Earth—but in this realm, that meant nearly two decades.\nLiam smiled at the thought of how Yanxia would look when she’s done solidifying her cultivation. What her human form would look like.\nHe hopes it’s a little girl, as she would be the first member of his family and he wants to feel what it like to take care of a younger sibling.\nHe crouched beside the crater and dug into the earth with his bare hands. The soil yielded easily to his strength, parting like soft clay. He dug a shallow pit about a foot deep and gently placed the Fusang Tree Seed inside.\nThe seed looked utterly unremarkable—dull brown, faintly rough, without even a glimmer of energy. Anyone else might have mistaken it for an ordinary stone.\nBut Liam knew better, as he covered the hole and brushed the dust from his palms, standing tall again.\nFor a moment, he simply stood there, the light from Yanxia’s flame painting his silhouette in gold.\n\"Grow well too,\" he said softly, gazing at the ground where he had buried the seed.\nHe turned toward the blazing sun that was Yanxia and smiled with quiet pride before taking flight again.\nLiam wasn’t returning to the obsidian table. There was something else that had caught his attention earlier—something he had seen while flying to the lake.\nThe Heavenly Scriptures Pagoda.\nEven from afar, it had stunned him—an edifice of divine craftsmanship rising from the landscape like the spine of creation itself.\nNow, as he approached, its full majesty unfolded before him.\nIt wasn’t impossibly tall—only nine levels—but each level was massive, stretching wide enough to house a small palace. The Pagoda’s structure shimmered with faint celestial light. Its walls seemed carved from an alloy of gold and jade.\nThe closer he got, the more Liam’s breath caught in his chest. He landed gently before its grand entrance. Two enormous bronze doors loomed before him, engraved with nine ancient symbols—each one representing a Heaven.\nHe pressed his hand to the cool metal and the doors opened soundlessly.\nLiam stepped inside, and the vastness that greeted him stole his breath.\nThe interior was much larger than the exterior suggested—spatially folded, he realized. The foundation floor alone stretched wider than five family sized bungalows combined. Rows of floating bookshelves lined the walls, filled with books, jade slips and glowing scripture tablets.\n\"It’s even more magnificent inside,\" he murmured.\nHe accessed the information in his head about the Heavenly Scriptures Pagoda. While the description already tells him that it wasn’t merely a library—he realised that it was more of a living archive, a structure connected to the laws of cultivation itself. Each of its nine levels—or Nine Heavens—served as an independent dimension, housing all knowledge of a specific cosmic tier.\nThe foundation floor was meant for those in the early stages: Body Tempering, Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment. The First Heaven opened to Golden Core, Nascent Soul, and Soul Formation cultivators. And so on, until the Ninth Heaven, accessible only to those who stood at the peak of the Divine Realm—Saint Realm, Great Saint Realm, Saint Emperor Realm.\nEvery level offered something unique—cultivation rooms, alchemy furnaces, enlightenment chambers where time itself moves as fast as the occupant wants or as the floor allows.\n\"It’s a complete ecosystem for ascension,\" Liam said under his breath, as he continued going through the information\nThe thought made him smile. He could already imagine training future disciples here—teaching, refining, creating. A sect born of divine legacy, nurtured under his rule.\nHe wanted to explore more, to step into the higher floors and see what divine secrets lay within, but he restrained himself. There would be time for that later.\nHe turned and exited the Pagoda, and the doors closed softly behind him.\n***\nOutside, the endless expanse stretched before him once more.\nThe next on Liam’s list was the need to terraform the Dimensional Space—to breathe weather, wind, and water into it. To make it capable of hosting true life.\nThat task belonged to Lucy but she was busy, buried in the ongoing construction of the starship and other projects. Liam decided not to disturb her yet.\n\"Later. Once the ship’s ready,\" he murmured.\nHe turned his attention to the final task on his list—the one he’d been anticipating since morning; visiting the Magic Universe.\nStanding a short distance from the Pagoda, Liam looked up into the empty sky of the Dimensional Space and spoke aloud.\n\"System. I want to visit the Magic Universe.\"\nImmediately, the world around him rippled and reality folded.\nThe next moment, Liam found himself standing in the void again.\nHe remembered this sensation. It was the same when he first crossed into the Cultivation Universe.\nOnly this time, the void wasn’t empty. Far ahead, something shimmered in his vision.\nA tree—colossal beyond comprehension — towered in the distance. Its branches spread across infinity, luminous and alive, while roots thicker than mountains was plunged into a thousand worlds below.\nLiam’s eyes widened. He didn’t breathe.\nFor a brief moment, he was certain—he was looking at the true body of the World Tree.\nA primal axis that linked realities together.\nBefore he could even blink, the image faded—the tree dissolving into the void like a mirage.\nBut the afterimage burned in his mind.\n\"So that’s the World Tree...\" he whispered, his voice trembling with awe. \"The root of all magic.\"\nExcitement surged through him. His heart raced like it hadn’t in a long time. He wanted to see more—to understand how deep that network went, how far its roots stretched.\nBut first, he had to choose where to go.\nAll around him, countless planets shimmered—some glowing blue, others crimson, emerald, or shadow-black.\nLiam hovered there, scanning them one by one.\n\"I want a modern world,\" he murmured, \"something post-apocalyptic... with a surviving civilization\"\nThe problem was, from this vantage point, he couldn’t see enough detail to distinguish them.\nHe sighed softly. \"Alright, let’s take a chance.\"\nHe raised his hand toward one of the nearer planets—a dull blue sphere.\n\"Let’s see what secrets you hold.\"\nThe moment his choice was made, the void responded. An invisible force wrapped around him, immense and irresistible. The sensation was like being pulled through liquid light.\nAnd he vanished from the spot.",

      "content": "Chapter 219: Forest? Again?\nWhen Liam appeared, the first thing that greeted him was silence.\nHe noticed that he was surrounded by trees that towered endlessly, their trunks impossibly thick, and also plants. And they were all alien to him.\nHe glanced around calmly, eyes narrowing, as he extended his telekinetic sense outward. His mind spread across the forest in a perfect sphere, brushing against everything within twenty meters—roots, trunks, soil.\nThe feedback was immediate: trees, vines, insects, and animals of strange anatomy—but no sign of humans or civilization.\nHe sighed quietly, the corners of his lips twitching upward.\n\"Really, system? A forest again?\" Liam sighed softly.\nHe rose lightly into the air, levitating through the dense canopy. The branches brushed past his shoulders as he climbed higher, until he finally broke through into open air.\nThe view that greeted him was vast—breathtaking in its scale, yet suffocating in its emptiness.\nAn ocean of green stretched endlessly beneath him. The forest canopy rolled like waves in all directions, the horizon blurring into a blue mist.\nHe turned slowly, scanning the distance with his enhanced vision. Even with the precision of his Eagle Sight, he couldn’t find the end. The trees grew taller the farther they went, forming a horizon of emerald and gold.\nThere was also no smoke or rooftops. No signs of life.\n\"Perfect,\" Liam muttered. \"An entire planet, and I start in the middle of nowhere.\"\nStill, he wasn’t impatient. He had all the time in the world. He hopes he does. And besides—he knew that wherever there were forests, there were creatures... and where there were creatures, there was civilization nearby.\nHe picked a direction at random and began flying.\nFor several minutes, the forest remained unchanged, as he could see was endless trees. Then, faintly, his senses caught something new.\nA vibration—rhythmic, irregular, and sharp. It was the sound of something.\nHe focused on it, eyes narrowing.\nMetal on metal... and explosions.\n\"Combat,\" Liam murmured.\nWithout hesitation, he increased his speed, slicing through the air. The wind hissed around him as he crossed the canopy, following the echo of battle deeper into the wilderness of trees.\nWithin seconds, the sound grew clearer—the clash of blades, the roar of fire, the guttural bellow of something monstrous.\nHe slowly decreased his speed, as the trees parted to reveal an open clearing—an irregular field of broken rock and scorched earth.\nBelow, a group of five humans were locked in battle with a hulking green creature that stood nearly four meters tall. Its skin glistened like polished stone, muscles bulging beneath layers of dark scales. Its eyes burned crimson, and in its hand was a massive crude club made from blackened bone.\nAn orc—though far larger and more brutal-looking than any book Liam had ever read.\nThe humans were equipped like adventurers from a hybrid world—modern tactical armor meshed with fantasy-style gear: gauntlets, shields, swords, and staves.\nHe hovered above silently, observing.\nThe team fought in formation, or at least tried to. The tank, a broad-shouldered man wielding a rectangular mana-shield, held the monster’s attention with remarkable tenacity.\nSparks and shockwaves erupted each time his shield met the orc’s weapon. The man grunted, blood seeping from a gash on his forearm, yet his stance never broke.\nThe damage dealer—a dual-blade fighter with a messy mop of brown hair—darted around the monster’s flank, striking rapidly.\nBut his movements to Liam, were too flashy and too wasteful. He seemed more concerned with theatrics than efficiency, twisting and spinning between blows that left him open.\nLiam raised an eyebrow.\nShowboating in a real fight?\nThe two mages stood further back. The male mage’s hands blazed with fire, launching orbs of molten light that seared the orc’s hide but barely slowed it. The female mage wielded wind, her spells sharp and fast—slicing through air, buffeting the monster’s movements just enough to help the others gain ground.\nThe fifth member, the healer, stood at the very rear—a young woman with silver hair tied behind her head. Her staff pulsed rhythmically with soft white light as she cast healing waves toward her allies.\nThanks to his experience in Eternal Realms, Liam’s sharp senses noted her precision and lack of hesitation. She was steady and her control flawless.\n\"She’s good. Better than the rest of them combined,\" he murmured.\nStill, despite their coordinated effort, they were losing ground. Every strike from the orc’s club was deadly enough to take them all out, but the tank was doing a good job taking the hit for the team.\nThe orc roared, the sound shaking the air. Its muscles bulged grotesquely.\nIt was like the orc was about to go all out but the next moment, the ground trembled, and heavy footfalls echoed through the forest. One, then two, then many.\nA second orc burst through the treeline—slightly smaller, but still massive, carrying a jagged axe dripping with fresh blood.\nThe team froze for a fraction of a second. It was all the time the monsters needed.\nChaos erupted.\nThe first orc swung downward with terrifying force. The tank raised his shield, but the impact shattered it into fragments. The blow hurled him backward like a ragdoll, crashing into the healer.\n\"Dammit—!\" the swordsman shouted, but his voice was drowned out by the bellow of the second orc as it charged.\nThe fire mage threw a desperate flame burst—too late. The creature swung its axe sideways, sending a shockwave of raw force that struck both mages. The male mage screamed as he was thrown across the field, his arm twisting unnaturally.\nThe swordsman barely had time to dodge before the first orc’s club came crashing down. The shockwave sent him tumbling across the dirt, bones cracking audibly.\nLiam sighed softly from above.\n\"They’re finished.\"\nHe wasn’t particularly emotional about it. He knew that if he doesn’t step in, they will all be killed. He wasn’t stepping in out of pity—or heroism. But they were human, intelligent, and armed with equipment that clearly belonged to this world. Which meant they were useful.\nHe needs information and they were his best lead.\nSo he acted.\nWithout fanfare, Liam dropped from the sky.\nThe air trembled faintly as he descended. The surviving adventurers barely noticed him at first—too preoccupied with staying alive. He landed lightly beside the swordsman’s battered body.\nThe two orcs turned in unison, their glowing eyes locking onto him. For the first time, the entire battlefield went still.\nLiam crouched briefly, glancing at the swordsman’s limp hand. A steel blade, chipped but serviceable, lay beside it. He picked it up casually, testing the balance.\nThe weight was unfamiliar—heavier than what he preferred—but serviceable.\n\"Not bad,\" he murmured, spinning it once.\nThe orcs snarled, pounding their chests, their fury directed entirely at him now. Even the surviving members of the party had frozen, their expressions a mix of shock and confusion.\nThe tank, bleeding and barely standing, croaked hoarsely, \"Who the hell—?\"\nLiam smiled faintly, cutting him off with a gesture. He twirled the sword once more, then lifted his gaze toward the two massive beasts.\n\"Well, let’s have a little fun,\" he said lightly, voice calm as still water.\nThe nearest orc roared and attacked.",

      "content": "Chapter 220: A World Of Gates And Monsters\nThis was going to be Liam’s third official battle and his first since fighting Xuan Zhi and Fang Cheng almost two weeks ago.\nHe smiled to himself as the orc’s club came down in a blur of motion. The swing split the air apart with enough force to make an ordinary man freeze in terror and lose\ncontrol.\nBehind Liam, the tank shouted hoarsely, \"Are you insane? Dodge!\"\nBut Liam didn’t even glance back. He didn’t feel danger from the orc’s attack. If anything at all, he felt curiosity.\nHe waited until the last possible instant—then moved.\nTo the adventurers watching, it looked as if he simply vanished. One moment he stood there, the next he wasn’t.\nThe club smashed into empty air, cracking the ground where he had been standing. A gust of dust and hot wind followed the impact.\nThe orc blinked stupidly, confused, its crimson eyes darting left and right.\nThen, behind it, in a flash of clean, precise and surgical motion, Liam appeared at its back, the borrowed sword glinting in his hand and he slashed once.\nThe blade met flesh and tendon, cutting through the creature’s ankle as easily as slicing through water.\nThe orc’s roar shook the clearing. Its massive frame lurched, collapsing to one knee as its leg gave out. Before it could react, Liam was already gone again.\nWith another blur, he slashed again and the second ankle snapped like a rope under tension.\nThe orc’s body buckled. It crashed to the ground with a thunderous thud, shaking the forest floor. The earth caved slightly under its weight.\nIts claws clawed at the ground, trying to rise but it couldn’t. Its tendons were gone; its strength useless.\nLiam stepped back lightly, his expression calm, almost detached.\nThe second orc bellowed in rage at its comrade’s state. Its huge frame charged, axe raised. The wind split from the force of its swing.\nLiam didn’t move until the very last moment again. Then he vanished in a silent flash.\nThe creature blinked, disoriented—and pain erupted from both its knees. Its bones shattered under the precision of two quick slashes.\nIt crashed forward with a deafening roar, both legs bending at impossible angles. The ground shook.\nLiam reappeared before it, his sword now slick with dark green blood.\nThe orc tried to swing its axe anyway, roaring defiantly. Its arm flexed, but before the weapon could move, Liam flicked two fingers.\nInvisible force struck the axe like a hammer blow. It flew from the creature’s grip, spinning away to embed itself deep in a tree trunk dozens of meters away.\nThe orc screamed in fury and humiliation. The sound grated like thunder through metal. Liam’s expression hardened, annoyance flickering in his eyes.\nHe stepped forward and kicked. There was a deep, dull crack as his leg connected with the orc’s face. The creature’s massive head snapped backward, its roar cutting off abruptly. Its body went limp, crashing to the ground.\nLiam studied it for a second. There was no movement or even the faintest sign of breathing.\n\"Dead,\" he said softly, though there was no satisfaction in his voice.\nHe hadn’t intended to kill it. He was genuinely curious about orcs—creatures that existed in fiction back on Earth. He had wanted to take them back to the secret realm he got and study them alive. But he would have to make do with just one.\nWith a faint sigh, he turned his attention back to the fallen group of adventurers.\nThey were still frozen in place, their faces pale, eyes wide. The battle that had nearly cost them their lives was over in seconds.\nThe five of them had struggled desperately against one orc, barely holding their ground when the second appeared. Yet this man—this stranger dressed casually, without armor or visible weaponry—had appeared from nowhere and crushed both orcs effortlessly and almost lazily.\nAnd what unsettled them most was how silent it had been. This person in front of them who was dressed so casually like he was just taking a stroll, randomly appeared out of nowhere and decimated the two orcs singlehandedly.\nNot only had he defeated them, but the fact that he did so without killing spoke volumes about his control and skill.\nThe tank was the first to move. He staggered upright, blood staining his sleeve where his arm hung at an awkward angle. He pressed his good hand against his chest and bowed slightly, grimacing in pain.\n\"Thank you. If not for you, we’d all be dead,\" he said, with strained voice.\nLiam simply nodded. He looked at the shattered shield lying near the man’s feet, and asked, \"Why were you fighting orcs if you knew you weren’t ready?\"\nWhile Liam could had just simply asked them for his current location, he decided not to do that.\nThe tank winced, lowering his head. \"We miscalculated. We thought it would be best if we start clearing D-Rank gates, now that he,\" paused and looked at the broken damage dealer, \"he’s close to C-Rank. And we never expected orcs to appear. \"\n\"I guess you were taken by surprise,\" Liam muttered.\nThe man nodded. \"We underestimated them. We paid for it.\"\n\"There are more of them, aren’t there?\" Liam asked.\nThe tank hesitated, then nodded. \"At least five. Maybe seven.\"\n\"Then stay here,\" Liam said, as his gaze drifted to the treeline where the second orc had come from.\nBefore any of them could speak, he rose into the air.\nThe healer, the girl with silver hair, stared up in disbelief as he vanished into the canopy.\nWithin moments, distant roars echoed—then silence.\nLess than a minute later, Liam returned, landing softly near the group. Not a drop of blood touched him.\nHe turned to the first orc that was bleeding profusely from its torn ankles, barely alive at this point.\nLiam sighed softly and sent the sword in his hand flying towards it. The sword embedded itself into the orc’s head, and the creature twitched before finally going still.\nUsing his knowledge from novels he had read, he figured that the only way for them to leave the gate was to kill all the monsters occupying it.\nThere was actually something Liam was curious about, and it was about how accurate some of the knowledge from his world are on these fictional worlds. He wonder if it’s something the system has answers to.\nThe group was staring at Liam in a mix of shock and disbelief. The fire mage whispered under his breath, \"All clear... in sixty seconds?\"\nThe tank swallowed hard. \"You... killed them all?\"\nLiam didn’t reply directly, as he looked around.\n\"The gate exit should appear soon,\" he muttered.\nAs if responding to his words, light rippled across the clearing. A circular portal of green light shimmered into existence behind them.\nThe adventurers froze when they saw this. They had been doubting Liam but the appearance of the portal was confirmation enough for them.\n\"Go. Get them treated,\" Liam said.\nThe healer nodded quickly. She helped the mage with the broken arm to his feet. The others limped or leaned on one another, moving toward the light.\nLiam stood a short distance away, arms crossed, watching them vanish one by one into the swirling glow.\nWhen the last of them disappeared, he exhaled softly and turned his gaze to the portal.\nHe wondered for a moment what would happen if he set an access point here—inside a gate. But he didn’t dwell on it. He had other things to do.\nHe had no idea how long he had been gone from Earth because he didn’t take his Lucid with him. And tomorrow—both his meeting with the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Lucid’s public release—were scheduled.\nHe sighed softly and stepped through the portal.\nLight enveloped him for an instant. When it faded, he was standing in an open space under clear skies.\nThe atmosphere here was calmer. There was a small crowd of people gathered close to the gate. They were shouting to anyone who cared to listen, trying to recruit people into their team for their gate raid.\nSo this is the outside world.\nLiam scanned his surroundings quietly. He could see lots of tall modern buildings ahead. From this little information, he guessed that the world was a modern world just like his, but with the difference of mana, hunters or players, and monsters.\nHe passed through the crowd quietly. Ahead, two guards in black uniforms stood near the exit, scanning the ID cards of those that wants to enter the gate.\nLiam and the group walked past them casually.\n\"I’m sure you guys can take care of yourself from here,\" he said, once they were outside the perimeter.\n\"Thank you once again, mister. We owe you our lives. I know we can’t do much but if you ever need help, please come to the Flaming Tiger Guild. We will do our best to help,\" the tank said.\n\"I will. Go get yourself and your teammates taken care,\" Liam said, before walking away.\nThe group watched him leave with tons of questions in their heart.\nLiam turned toward a quiet alley between two buildings and stepped into the shadow. He paused and made sure that he was being followed before, he assigned an access point.\nAfter he had done that, he vanished, appearing in his master suite back ok Earth. He checked the time and he saw that barely a few minutes had passed. He smiled and snuggled into his bed, closing his eyes and drifting off to sleep a few seconds later.",

      "content": "Chapter 221: Meeting With The Crown Prince Of Abu Dhabi\nThe sun had only just begun to rise over the Persian Gulf, a thin ribbon of gold stretching across the horizon.\nFrom the 160th floor of the Burj Khalifa, the city of Dubai shimmered like a mirage. The glass towers below caught the first rays of daylight, their reflections bending across the desert haze.\nLiam paused for a moment by the window, his eyes on the sprawling city beneath him. From this height, everything looked distant—silent highways and sleeping neighborhoods. He could almost forget that in an hour or two, he’d be sitting across from one of the most powerful men in the Middle East.\nHe stayed there for another few seconds, watching sunlight spill across the coastline before finally pulling himself away, walking into the bathroom to start his day.\nBy the time he emerged, the maids had already arranged his clothes on the couch. He dressed quietly, sliding into the outfit.\nHe picked up his nano exosuit in watch form and Lucid from the side table before stepping out of the room.\n\"Good morning, Master,\" Lucy’s voice greeted him immediately he put on the smart glass.\n\"Good morning, Lucy,\" He smiled.\n\"Lucid’s public deliveries are scheduled to begin by early noon, local time.\"\n\"Good. How are things on your end—the starship and moon base construction?\"\n\"The lunar construction has begun,\" she replied. \"Same as the starship. I estimate three weeks, perhaps a month, for completion.\"\n\"Good work. Good work,\" Liam nodded in understanding. \"Take your time though. I trust you to do a perfect job.\"\nLiam knew that building something like a starship wasn’t something that could be rushed. Deep space isn’t exactly known to be friendly. At least, as portrayed in movies.\n\"Of course, Master.\"\nHe walked toward the dining table and he saw Clara walking towards him.\n\"Good morning, sir,\" she said softly. \"Your schedule for the day is confirmed. We’ll depart by eight to make it to the palace by ten. His Highness’s staff has cleared the route.\"\n\"Thank you, Clara,\" Liam nodded.\nHis friends were already seated around the long marble table, chatting idly.\n\"Morning, guys. Girls,\" Liam greeted, as he took his seat.\n\"Morning, man,\" Matt replied, raising a mug.\n\"Morning, bro,\" Kristopher replied.\nHarper and Alex raised mugs and smiled, unable to talk due to their mouth being full.\n\"Good morning, Liam. How was your night?\" Kristy greeted.\n\"It was wonderful. Yours?\"\n\"Blissful. The bed was as soft as I had imagined and I had a lovely dream,\" Kristy replied with a beautiful smile on her face.\nLiam smiled and turned to the other girls, and they nodded with the same smile as Kristy.\n\"So, a big day, huh?\" Kristopher asked, referring to his meeting with the royal meeting he would be attending.\n\"Not really,\" Liam replied.\nThe boys looked at themselves and shook their heads, smiling.\n\"Man, you really need to show me your teacher. I want to learn how to keep calm like you,\" Alex said.\nLiam smiled and said nothing. He knew that the only reason why he was calm was because of his World-Class Etiquette skill. Without that, his nerves would probably be wracking at the moment.\nThe group ate breakfast in companionable silence. When they finished breakfast, Liam stood and pushed his chair back quietly. The sound drew their attention.\n\"I’ll see you all later,\" he said.\n\"Be careful. And... try not to make too many headlines,\" Elise said with a soft and genuine voice.\nThe others expressed the same sentiment through their gaze and nods.\n\"I’ll do my best,\" Liam smiled.\nWith that, he followed Clara out into the private elevator lobby, Mason and Nick walking behind.\n***\nOutside, the air was already warm, carrying the scent of the sea and sand. The convoy was waiting—two black Rolls-Royce Phantoms flanked by a pair of discreet security SUVs. Drivers and aides stood at attention.\nLiam, Clara, Nick and Mason got into the Rolls Royce and the envoy rolled out.\nThe streets were calm at that hour. Sunlight shimmered off mirrored skyscrapers as they glided through Downtown Dubai. Liam leaned back slightly, one arm resting on the door, watching the world pass by.\nThe convoy glided through the gates of Emirates Palace, the white domes ahead gleaming under the sun. The building’s golden façade shone like something out of myth, framed by manicured gardens and fountains that glittered like glass.\nAt the entrance, uniformed guards in immaculate white kanduras and golden sashes stood at attention. They saluted as the convoy approached.\nLiam stepped out first. The heat pressed against him instantly, but it wasn’t uncomfortable. He followed Clara toward the marble steps, where a protocol officer was waiting.\n\"Mr. Scott,\" the man greeted warmly. \"Welcome to Abu Dhabi. His Highness is expecting you.\"\nThe walk through the corridors of the palace felt almost otherworldly. Intricate mosaics adorned the floors, while sunlight poured through domed skylights, casting patterns of gold and blue across the marble.\nEvery step echoed faintly in the silence. They reached a set of tall wooden doors inlaid with gold. Two guards opened them at once, revealing a grand reception hall lined with cream-colored walls and ornate chandeliers.\nAt the far end stood the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, dressed in an immaculate white kandura and ghutra, his posture composed yet relaxed. He turned as Liam approached, offering a faint smile.\n\"Mr. Scott,\" he said in fluent English. \"It’s good to finally meet you in person.\"\n\"Your Highness. The honor is mine,\" Liam inclined his head respectfully.\n\"Please,\" The prince gestured toward the seats arranged near the window, overlooking the palace gardens.\nThey sat. The attendants withdrew quietly, leaving only two cups of Arabic coffee and a bowl of dates between them.\nFor a moment, neither spoke. The silence was not tense—just one of two individuals measuring each other. But in this case, it was just the Crown Prince trying to understand Liam.\n\"You’ve made quite the impression,\" the Crown Prince said eventually. \"Dubai has been alive with whispers since your arrival. Some say you’re an entrepreneur, others say a technologist... some even suggest you’re a statesman of sorts.\"\n\"Rumors tend to multiply faster than facts, Your Highness,\" Liam smiled lightly.\n\"That they do,\" the prince agreed, his tone amused. \"Still, it’s not often we see a private A380 flying under a single man’s ownership, nor one with such... design.\"\n\"An aircraft is just a means of travel. The real work happens on the ground,\" Liam said simply.\n\"True,\" the prince said. \"But it’s rare for someone to travel so quietly and stir so much interest. Many in the region are curious about you, Mr. Scott. You appeared from nowhere, yet everyone seems to know your name.\"\n\"I prefer it that way. It’s easier to move when no one knows what to expect,\" Liam said with a calm expression, leaning back slightly.\nThe Crown Prince studied him for a moment, his gaze thoughtful but not intrusive.\n\"You remind me of certain men I’ve met—men who don’t seek attention, yet attract it regardless.\"\n\"Perhaps it’s just timing,\" Liam gave a small smile.\nThe prince chuckled softly, then gestured for him to take another cup of coffee. \"Timing—and intent. Both matter.\"\nTheir conversation drifted from there—politics, business, travel. Nothing sensitive, nothing binding. Yet each word carried an undercurrent of mutual understanding, a silent recognition of power and restraint.\nWhen the meeting finally drew to a close, the Crown Prince rose first. \"Mr. Scott,\" he said, extending his hand, \"I believe we will see more of each other soon.\"\n\"I look forward to it, Your Highness,\" Liam shook his hand firmly.\n***\nThe palace doors opened once more as Liam stepped out into the sunlight. The convoy waited at the base of the steps, engines already running, the flag of the Emirates fluttering in the warm breeze.\nThe meeting had ended and it was time to go back to the apartment. Lucid deliveries would start soon and today was the day he gives his friends a unit of the smart glass, each.",

      "content": "Chapter 222: The Group’s Speculations\nLiam was greeted by his friends the moment he walked in. They were all gathered in the living area, faces bright with excitement. But among them, no one looked more animated than Matt, who was almost practically bouncing where he sat.\nElise couldn’t resist teasing him.\n\"You’re this excited when you’re not even getting one,\" she said, grinning. \"What would you be like if you were actually getting a Lucid? Would you lose your mind?\"\nMatt turned toward her, with a wide grin on his face.\n\"Lose my marbles? Hell yeah! You have no idea. I’d probably pass out before I even turned the thing on.\"\nLaughter broke out around the room. Even Liam chuckled quietly as he took a seat on one of the couches. The atmosphere was light, comfortable, and full of anticipation. He could tell that the whole group had been waiting for this moment all day.\nKristopher leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.\n\"So,\" he said, smiling. \"How’d your meeting go?\"\nStacy and the others echoed the question almost at once, curious.\nLiam leaned back, crossing one leg over the other.\n\"It went fine,\" he said casually. \"Just a lot of boring talk and measuring.\"\nKristopher chuckled when he heard that.\n\"You’ll get used to it,\" he said. \"Boring talk, measuring, posturing—that’s ninety percent of business meetings once you reach the big table.\"\nLiam shook his head slowly, a small smile forming.\n\"I don’t plan on getting used to it,\" he said. \"I’d rather get to a level where schemes and plans are useless against me.\"\nThat made the group pause.\nFor a moment, no one spoke. His tone was calm and almost indifferent, but the weight behind his words lingered in the air.\nTo reach a point where schemes and plans meant nothing... such a thing sounded impossible. Even the most powerful people in the world—the heads of corporations, old dynasties, royal families—all schemed. They had to. It was how the world worked.\nThe only way a single person could truly stand above manipulation was if they possessed something greater than wealth, greater than influence—absolute power.\nA level of strength so overwhelming that no one, no matter their connections or armies, could dare move against them.\nThe thought sent a faint chill through the group, even if they couldn’t explain why.\nThey exchanged quiet glances, each silently wondering just what kind of background Liam came from. The way he spoke—calm, certain, almost detached—wasn’t the tone of someone merely wealthy. It was something else entirely.\nMatt, sensing the sudden heaviness in the air, cleared his throat and decided to change the subject.\n\"Alright,\" he said quickly, \"enough with the mystery talk. Liam, you wanna watch the Lucid delivery streams with us? They’re about to start. A hundred out of the nine hundred sixty people who got the device are streaming it live.\"\nThe energy in the room immediately shifted back to excitement. Screens flickered on. The air filled with chatter again.\n\"Man, I’m dying to see those drones in action again,\" he said with his eyes lit up bright with anticipation. \"Lucid’s impressive, sure, but that delivery system—it’s insane. I’ve watched those clips like ten times and I still can’t figure out how they’re moving. No sign of propulsion, no rotors sight or even a sign of them, no noise, nothing. It like they just glide through the air. I swear, if someone told me that was alien tech, I’d believe them.\"\nKristy snorted, shaking her head.\n\"You’re such a tech geek. You probably dream in binary,\" she muttered.\nThe group burst into laughter again, even Liam. Harper rolled his eyes but grinned, taking the teasing in stride.\nBut Stacy wasn’t laughing. She looked thoughtful, with her arms crossed.\n\"Harper’s not wrong,\" she said. \"Nova Technologies isn’t just changing things—they’re rewriting the rules. Two technologies that no one even came close to—that’s not luck. That’s something else.\"\nThe others quieted slightly, listening. Stacy continued, her tone steady and analytical, \"Every corporation on the planet — tech or not—is probably trying to get a piece of them right now. Same for governments. Nova Technologies is basically a treasure chest of world-changing inventions. They’ve developed a local self-processing AI—that alone puts them decades ahead. Then there’s the neural tech—non-invasive, perfectly stable, integrated into a VR ecosystem so real it’s like another dimension.\"\nShe paused for a moment before going on, \"And now there’s what people are calling infinite energy. The Lucid’s power core doesn’t deplete even after twelve hours of full use. That’s unheard of. And somehow the device runs all that without overheating or failing.\"\nShe shook her head and continued, \"And then there are the drones operating beyond all known aerodynamics. If anyone ever managed to reverse-engineer even a fragment of what Nova’s built, the power shift would be catastrophic.\"\nThe room went quiet again until Kristopher let out a low whistle.\n\"You’ve really thought about this,\" he said, smiling faintly.\n\"It’s hard not to,\" Stacy shrugged. \"The company’s keeping itself private, which is smart. If they’d gone public, governments and corporations would’ve torn them apart already.\"\nLiam couldn’t help but look at her with quiet admiration. The way she pieced everything together—precise, calm, and correct—impressed him deeply. He hasn’t gotten to know her much and she was starting to interest him.\nKristopher nodded thoughtfully.\n\"You’re right,\" he said. \"And I just hope Nova’s got the right people behind them—powerful ones. Because once the big players figure out who owns it, things are going to get messy fast.\"\nEveryone agreed at once.\nLiam’s smile deepened slightly as he listened, though he said nothing. The irony of their words wasn’t lost on him.\nThen Alex spoke up, breaking the rhythm. \"Actually,\" he said, \"has anyone ever stopped to ask whether Nova’s even a private company at all? What if it’s not? What if it’s a front—government, military, corporate — take your pick?\"\nThat earned him a few raised brows. Kristy frowned. \"What do you mean, a front?\"\nAlex leaned back, folding his arms. \"Think about it,\" he said. \"How could a company like that even exist without someone high up knowing about it? You can’t just manufacture a thousand units of Lucids, or build fleets of drones that move like that, without materials, components, and international shipments. And you definitely can’t move all that without raising red flags. Governments monitor everything related to dual-use tech—anything that can be used for both civilian and military purposes. There’s no way something like Nova slips through without someone noticing.\"\nThe group fell silent again, this time for a different reason.\nAlex pressed on, his tone more serious. \"It’s just like Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto. You really think some anonymous nobody or group created a global financial revolution and no one’s found them after more than a decade? No. Someone knew. Someone protected that identity because it served a bigger purpose. Maybe Nova’s the same. Maybe they’re not hiding because they’re afraid. Maybe they’re untouchable because they’re backed by the kind of power that doesn’t answer to anyone.\"\nNo one spoke for a while after that.\nHarper’s brow furrowed as he thought about it.\n\"That... actually makes sense,\" he admitted. \"It would explain a lot. Maybe that’s why no one’s ever seen the company’s executives or heard of its founder.\"\nMatt exhaled slowly, rubbing his chin. \"You know, I never thought about it that way,\" he said. \"And that’s kind of embarrassing, considering our backgrounds.\"\nElise nodded. \"Same. It’s weird that we didn’t catch that earlier.\"\nKristy leaned back with a sigh. \"So what you’re saying is that this whole time, we’ve been watching a government science project pretending to be a tech company?\"\nAlex gave a noncommittal shrug. \"Maybe. Or maybe it’s something else entirely. Either way, no one outside their circle will ever really know unless the people behind Nova decide to talk—which, according to Stacy, is never happening.\"\nMatt nodded slowly. \"Exactly. And honestly, it doesn’t even matter whether Nova’s a real private company or a front. The fact is, they’ve already changed the world. Everyone’s trying to catch up, and no one even knows who they’re chasing. They are taking the whole planet for a ride—a long, long ride.\"\nThe group fell into thoughtful silence. The sound of the television filled the background as the first live deliveries began to stream. A couple drones descended from the sky like falling stars, sleek, silent, and surreal. It was a display of perfection that no one could explain.\nLiam watched them all quietly. Their discussion had impressed him deeply. They weren’t just smart—they were perceptive, analytical, and curious in the right ways. Each had approached the same mystery from a different angle and arrived at valid conclusions.\nBut even so, none of them were close to the truth.\nHe smiled faintly to himself. They had no idea who they were sitting beside—no idea that the man listening so quietly was the one they were analyzing, the one who held the keys to every mystery they just described.\nHe leaned back, stretching slightly, the corner of his mouth lifting into a relaxed, amused grin.\nThey had done well. But now, he thought, it was time to give them the biggest shock of their lives yet.",

      "content": "Chapter 223: Shock\nLiam stood up from the couch without saying a word. The others were still talking, laughing, and watching a livestream of someone recovering their Lucid and unboxing it.\nNo one paid much attention at first. They thought he’d just gone to get a drink or check something in his room. But a few minutes later, the faint sound of footsteps returning made Alex glance toward the corridor.\nAnd then he froze.\nLiam stepped out of his room holding a stack of familiar black boxes in his hands. Eight of them. Each one sleek, sharp-edged, and unmistakable.\nAlex’s jaw dropped. His eyes widened so much that Matt, sitting beside him, noticed instantly.\n\"Dude—\" Alex whispered, tapping Matt’s shoulder hard. \"Look. Look.\"\nMatt turned—and the color drained from his face. He blinked twice as if he thought his eyes were lying. Kristopher followed their gaze, frowning, and then froze too.\n\"What the...\" Matt muttered under his breath, eyes locked on the boxes. \"No way...\"\nHe shot to his feet before he could stop himself. The sudden motion made the others turn toward him.\n\"What’s wrong?\" Elise asked, startled.\nMatt didn’t reply. He simply pointed toward Liam.\nAll heads turned and the room fell into complete silence.\nThere Liam stood, calm as ever, with eight Lucid boxes stacked neatly in his arms.\nMatt took a slow step forward, his voice trembling. \"Liam... are those... are those what I think they are?\"\nLiam didn’t speak. He only nodded once and kept walking toward the center table.\nThe sound of his steps echoed softly in the quiet room. No one said anything. They just watched as he placed the boxes carefully on the glass table one by one, arranging them in two perfect rows of four.\nLiam picked up one of the boxes and turned to Matt.\n\"Here,\" he said simply.\nMatt’s hands shook as he reached out. The box felt solid, heavy, and impossibly smooth beneath his fingers. The design was unmistakable. The image of the quasar shimmered faintly, and on the side, in clean bold silver letters, was the word:\nLUCID.\nHe looked up at Liam, who gave a small nod—the kind that said go ahead.\nMatt blinked rapidly, smiling in disbelief. \"You’ve got to be kidding me,\" he muttered.\nHis grin grew wider and wider. He hurried back to his seat and began unboxing the device with the care of someone handling something sacred.\nThe others remained frozen. Their eyes kept shifting between the unopened boxes and Liam.\nOne by one, Liam handed out the rest to the rest of the group.\nEach person hesitated before taking theirs, as if afraid the moment would disappear if they moved too quickly.\nThe sound of the seals peeling open filled the air—soft clicks and rustles that somehow sounded louder than normal.\nNo one knew what to say.\nMatt, who was almost done unboxing, finally spoke up. \"Liam,\" he said, staring at the smart glass resting in his hands. \"How did you even get this? No—how did you get eight of them?\"\nLana set her box down and crossed her arms. Her voice was calm but sharp.\n\"It’s impossible,\" she said firmly. \"Even getting one unit was like winning a global lottery.\"\nShe looked around at everyone. \"Think about it. There were only nine hundred and sixty Lucids distributed worldwide. Each buyer had to go through identity verification, limited-time selection, and a one-per-person restriction. Even the richest people on the planet couldn’t buy two.\"\nHer tone grew more animated as she went on. \"Statistically, it would make sense if maybe one or two people accidentally got more than one unit—but eight?\" She shook her head. \"No. That’s beyond luck. That’s beyond probability. You’d have a better chance of being struck by lightning every single day for a year while also winning every major lottery each day.\"\nKristy blinked. \"That’s a real stat?\"\nLana nodded. \"I ran the math when the first delivery announcement dropped. The chance is effectively zero—less likely than finding the same atom twice in the entire universe.\"\nEveryone turned to her in stunned silence.\nLana shrugged, smiling faintly. \"Simple math.\"\nMatt let out a low whistle. \"Remind me never to play poker against you.\"\nThe tension broke slightly, but only for a moment. All eyes drifted back to Liam, who was now sitting down calmly, a small smile on his face.\nHe waited until they were all quiet again.\n\"You’re right,\" he said finally. \"It’s impossible. Statistically, no one could get more than one unit—unless...\" He paused, meeting each of their gazes. \"Unless they’re the one who made it.\"\nThe words hung in the air like a dropped stone. It took a moment for the meaning to sink in.\nThe laughter died instantly. The soft sounds of unboxing stopped. Even the slightest sound felt louder in the silence.\nStacy was the first to process it, her breath still caught. \"You mean...\" she began quietly. \"You’re saying—you’re—\"\nLiam nodded once. No explanation. No dramatic speech. Just that simple, calm nod.\nThe group froze in collective shock.\nAlex slowly covered his face with both hands, letting out a strangled groan. \"Oh my God,\" he muttered, voice muffled. \"I can’t believe this. I literally called you a government front. You just sat there.\"\nLiam chuckled softly. \"You weren’t entirely wrong.\"\nMatt’s mouth hung open. \"Wait—you’re telling me you own Nova Technologies? You’re the one who built this?\" He held up the Lucid in disbelief.\n\"Something like that. Yeah,\" Liam replied.\nElise let out a shaky laugh. \"No way. You’re joking. This is a prank, right? Please tell me this is a prank.\"\nKristopher didn’t say anything. He leaned back, his expression unreadable, eyes studying Liam as if seeing him for the first time.\n\"So, you weren’t joking,\" he said slowly. \"When you said you wanted to reach a level where schemes don’t matter. You really meant it .\"\nLiam smiled faintly at that.\nThe room fell silent again.\nMatt, meanwhile, was practically glowing with excitement. \"Man, Liam, you’re something else! First the private jet, now this? Hell, at this point, I would believe you if tell me you own NASA.\"\n\"Nah, I don’t,\" Liam said with a grin.\nEveryone laughed—more out of disbelief than humor. The tension began to shift. The shock didn’t fade completely, but awe began to mix in.\nKristy shook her head slowly. \"So all this time, the person or group everyone’s been talking about—the genius behind Nova Technologies—the one every government wants to meet... was just sitting here with us.\"\n\"I like quiet things,\" Liam shrugged lightly.\n\"You realize what this means, right? You’ve just given each of us something the entire world is scrambling for,\" Harper said, as he finally found his voice\n\"I know,\" Liam said.\n\"Then why?\" Harper asked. \"Why give these to us?\"\nLiam looked at each of them carefully before answering.\n\"Because you’re my friends,\" he said simply. \"And because I trust you.\"\nNo one expected that answer.\nThe simplicity of it hit harder than anything else could have.\nFor a long moment, the group just sat there, silent, processing not just the revelation but what it meant. The world might see Liam Scott as a global enigma, a kid with an unknown background, with toys no one is age should have. But to them, he’s a friend. A good friend.\nKristopher leaned forward, his tone more serious.\n\"Liam,\" he said. \"You realize this changes everything, right? Once people find out who you are—\"\n\"They won’t,\" Liam interrupted gently. \"At least not yet.\"\nThe calm certainty in his voice made everyone believe him instantly.\nMatt looked around the room, then at the Lucid in his hands, and laughed again.\n\"Man, I still can’t believe this. We were just talking about Nova like some mysterious god-tier company... and you were literally sitting right there.\"\n\"I know,\" Liam said, still smiling. \"That was my favorite part.\"\nThe group groaned and laughed all at once. Slowly, the shock faded into warmth and awe, and they got back to the usual atmosphere between them returned. But that doesn’t mean that they are ever going forget today. Ever.",

      "content": "Chapter 224: Digital Aristocrats\nLiam had barely finished answering the avalanche of questions that followed his revelation when Matt leaned forward, eyes bright with curiosity.\n\"Okay, so tell us something, man,\" he said eagerly. \"About the games. You’ve got to give us something. For Eternal Realms, how deep does it go? Are there hidden storylines? Secret dungeons?\"\nLana, sitting beside him, nodded rapidly. \"Yeah! There’s no way you just drop a world like that and not give us at least one insider clue.\"\nLiam laughed softly. \"I’d love to tell you,\" he said, \"but I really can’t. Every character has their own storyline. It’s not something I can spoil.\"\n\"Come on, not even a hint?\" Matt groaned.\n\"Not even a hint,\" Liam shook his head\nMatt and Lana looked deflated when they heard Liam’s response.\n\"You two look like kids who just got told Santa isn’t real,\" Kristy laughed quietly at the looks in their faces.\nMatt sighed dramatically, slumping back into the couch. \"Fine. But if my character ends up dying in the first ten minutes, I’m suing.\"\n\"You’ll be fine,\" Liam said, still smiling. \"Just don’t pick a fight with anything you can’t handle.\"\nThe room erupted in laughter again. But after the noise faded, Harper spoke up, his expression thoughtful.\n\"Actually,\" he said, \"I’ve been wondering about something. How are these devices even doing it? Like... how’s the Lucid processing all that data? The immersion, the visuals, the world building... How does the device run everything locally? Just how powerful is it?\"\nHe looked at Liam. \"So, how are they storing that much information? It doesn’t even make sense.\"\nThe others turned to listen. Harper’s question wasn’t just curiosity. It was something the entire world had been asking since Lucid’s first appearance.\nLiam didn’t answer right away. He smiled faintly, leaning back against the couch.\n\"Let’s just say it’s not using traditional data systems,\" he said. \"The Lucid has its own ecosystem. The memory and storage don’t work like anything on Earth right now.\"\n\"That’s... vague,\" Matt muttered.\n\"That’s all you get,\" Liam shrugged.\n\"Unbelievable,\" Lana said, crossing her arms. \"You literally created the most advanced technology on the planet, and you’re teasing us like we’re random YouTubers trying to guess patch notes.\"\nHer tone made everyone laugh again.\nThen Matt suddenly straightened, snapping his fingers. \"Actually,\" he said, eyes bright, \"I’ve got an idea.\"\n\"Go on,\" Liam raised an eyebrow.\n\"You should make a platform—like a legit space just for Lucid users. Somewhere players can post what they discover. Clips, tips, theories, whatever. But here’s the catch—only Lucid users can post. That way, everything’s legit. No fake leaks. No clickbait.\"\n\"Interesting. That could work,\" Liam nodded slowly.\nMatt leaned forward, getting more animated, as he spoke, \"Right? And you can make it like a social hub too. Verified Lucid owners could connect, follow others, maybe even form guilds directly through it.\"\n\"That’s... actually a solid idea,\" Harper said. \"Would keep the ecosystem closed and authentic.\"\nLiam’s mind was already turning. He could see the potential immediately. But instead of just making a forum, he wanted to take it a step further.\n\"I’ll do that,\" he said simply.\n\"Wait, really?\"Matt blinked in surprise. He had only thrown the idea out there, he has never expected Liam to actually take it.\n\"Yes,\" Liam smiled. \"But I’ll go beyond a forum It’ll be a full platform—social, streaming, interactive. Think of it like... a mix between a live hub and a player’s network. Lucid users can post clips, share content, stream directly through their devices, or just talk. The public will be able to watch through browsers or phones, but they can’t post or verify accounts unless they have a Lucid.\"\n\"You’re serious?\" Matt’s mouth fell open\n\"Completely.\"\nLiam loved the idea, because through the platform, the public would be able connect with their favourite livestreamers and also gift them. Also, using the platform and the exclusive identity it provides for them, Lucid users can flex on the public. They can also create groups or guilds, adding other Lucid users as members.\nAnother addition would be that the livestream icon that shows the number of ongoing livestreams, would be changed to the icon of the new platform. So, that when Lucid users navigate to it, they will be taken to the website. Or they can simply tell their AI assistant to take them to the website.\nLiam passed the idea to Lucy, and she created the platform and completed everything just as he wants it, all in just a minute.\nImmediately, Lucid users, including Liam’s friends, received notification in their inboxes, telling them about the new platform.\nMatt’s eyes darted to his Lucid screen. A glowing notification was sitting in his inbox.\n\"No way,\" he muttered, opening it.\nHarper checked his too. So did Lana, Elise, Kristopher, and the rest. All of them received the same message—Nova Technologies Announcement: New Platform Live—\"LucidVerse\" is now available.\nMatt read the text aloud, his voice shaky. \"LucidVerse... combines streaming, user forums, and social connections in a single verified ecosystem...\"\nHe turned slowly toward Liam and spoke slowly in shock, \"You just made an entire global platform in under two minutes.\"\n\"Technically, yes,\" Liam smiled.\n\"That’s... not humanly possible.\" Kristy looked at him like he had just rewritten the laws of physics.\nLiam chuckled. \"Who said anything about humanly?\"\nThey all burst into laughter again—but deep down, they all knew that they were witnessing something beyond their understanding.\nThey wanted to ask questions but they held themselves back, as they felt that Liam would just casually drop another shocking secret of his on them. Liam and his friends decided to game throughout the whole day, as they all had nothing else they were doing. They chose Eternal Realms and formed a team, giving Liam team leader role.\n***\nMeanwhile, across the world, Lucid Public Release and Nova Technologies dominated every screen and headline.\nFrom social networks to news sites, every conversation revolved around the company that had just changed the course of human history—and the two pieces of technology that made it possible: the delivery drones and Lucid.\nAs if that wasn’t enough, a third shock followed less than thirty minutes after the first deliveries. Nova Technologies announced a new platform—a fully integrated streaming and content ecosystem designed exclusively for Lucid users. Alongside it came news that the company’s official account dropped the date for the next global pre-order and the fact that only one thousand units would be available.\nThe moment the announcement dropped, the world reacted at once, as alarms were set and calendars were synced. Every corner of the internet seemed to vibrate with one thought: be fast or be left behind.\nFor streamers and creators, the platform felt like salvation. Many had worried that Lucid’s system would leave them without work, unable to make a living through their streaming, forcing them to return to ordinary PCs to make a living. But the new platform changed everything.\nBecause only verified Lucid users could be followed, every creator who owned a device saw their followers skyrocket overnight. Viewer counts soared. Sponsorships would naturally pour in.\nAt the same time, numbers on traditional streaming platforms collapsed. The hierarchy of the digital world was being rewritten in real time.\nSoon, people began to call Lucid owners by a new name—Digital Aristocrats.\nNova Technologies had effectively divided the planet into two groups: more than eight billion viewers and just one thousand creators. The divide was sharp, and it was only growing wider.\nWithin days, Lucid users would start flaunting their devices in public. For them, the glass wasn’t just a tool; it was a badge of status, proof that they were among the chosen few.\nThe effect would be amplified by another announcement from the company—a replacement quota for lost or damaged devices. Victims could purchase a new unit, which would be delivered again on the official distribution day.\nThat assurance only increased the value of the product. Everyone wanted one. And when the next pre-order day would arrive, the internet would be turned into a global battlefield—a true fastest-finger contest where only the first thousand would succeed.\nNews networks ran nonstop coverage. Analysts debated Nova Technologies’ motives, ethics, and long-term goals. Governments demanded reports. Corporations assembled private task forces to uncover the company’s structure and origins. Yet, as always, they found nothing.\nBehind closed doors, every government and major tech firm knew the truth they didn’t want to say aloud: the world had changed—and they had been left behind.\nIn less than a day, Nova Technologies had created a new social class, one that carried more prestige than iPhone users ever did or ever would. Stock markets trembled as major tech companies’ shares fell sharply. And everyone knew this was only the beginning.",

      "content": "Chapter 225: Into The Realms\nThe world loaded around them in silence. When the light faded, Liam opened his eyes to find himself standing in the middle of a sprawling green field. The air was clear and cool, the scent of pine drifting on the breeze.\nIn the distance, mountains rose high into the clouds, their peaks capped with snow. Rivers of silver-blue water wound through the valley below, glinting under the twin suns that hung lazily above the horizon.\nThe sound of birds calling from the forest, wind whispering through tall grass, the rhythmic splash of water from a nearby stream, filled the air.\n\"Whoa...\" Matt’s voice broke the silence. \"This—this looks real. Like, real real.\"\nHe turned in a slow circle, eyes wide. \"You can actually feel the air. It’s warm and cold at the same time. How is that even possible?\"\nLana laughed softly. \"It’s called immersion, Matt. Welcome to Eternal Realms.\"\nThe rest of the group materialized one after another—Harper, Kristy, Elise, Kristopher, and Stacy—all dressed in period-style armor and robes according to their chosen roles. Liam’s name hovered above his head in faint golden letters: Aldren.\nHe wore simple black leather armor with silver threads woven into the seams, a longsword resting at his hip. Beside him, Kristopher’s avatar looked like a towering knight in steel plate, a lion crest etched across his chestplate.\n\"Everyone loaded in?\" Liam asked, scanning their party status.\n\"Yup. Everything’s running smooth,\" Harper said, drawing a curved dagger and twirling it idly. \"So... what’s the plan, boss?\"\nLiam smiled slightly at the title. \"We’re near the Vale of Faron. A few miles west of here is the first city—Eldenfort. We’ll start there. It’s a safe zone and the main hub for early quests.\"\nMatt, already crouched by the stream, dipped his hand into the water and gasped. \"I can actually feel this,\" he said. \"It’s cold. It’s literally cold!\"\n\"That’s neural sync,\" Stacy said, pushing up her sleeve. Her robe shimmered faintly in the sunlight, embroidered with runes. \"The Lucid’s neural link simulates temperature and texture through localized nerve impulses. You’re not touching real water—it’s your brain being tricked.\"\n\"Don’t ruin the magic,\" Matt groaned.\n\"Guys,\" Liam said calmly. \"Focus. We’ve got a quest to start.\"\nThey began walking toward the forest edge. The grass bent softly beneath their boots. Overhead, flocks of pale-winged birds drifted lazily through the sky, casting moving shadows over the hills.\nWhen they reached the treeline, the air grew cooler, the light dimmer. Sunlight filtered through canopies of ancient trees, painting patterns of gold on the forest floor.\n\"According to the map, this forest’s crawling with low-tier monsters—goblins, slimes, and shadow wolves,\" Liam said. \"We’ll move in formation. Kristopher, front. Harper and Lana, stay midline. Elise, Kristy, and Stacy—rear guard and support.\"\n\"Yes, captain,\" Kristopher said, his deep voice echoing lightly through his helmet.\nMatt raised his bow and grinned. \"Let’s hunt something.\"\nThe forest came alive with sound as they advanced—rustling leaves, distant growls, faint scurrying beneath underbrush. Liam kept his senses sharp, scanning for movement.\nThen he saw a group of goblins had gathered near a fallen log ahead. Their green skin glistened with sweat and dirt, jagged teeth flashing as they bickered over a piece of raw meat. There were five of them.\n\"Targets ahead,\" Liam said quietly. \"Goblins. Standard level ones. We’ll take them clean.\"\nKristopher raised his shield. \"Ready.\"\n\"Harper, flank right. Matt, stay behind him. Lana, support with mid-range spells.\"\nThe group moved as one.\nKristopher charged first, his heavy boots pounding the ground. The goblins shrieked and turned. The first swung a crude axe—but Kristopher’s shield met it with a loud clang. He shoved forward, sending the creature sprawling.\nHarper darted in from the right, daggers flashing in the dim light. He moved fast, precise, cutting down two goblins before they could react.\n\"Nice!\" Matt shouted, loosing an arrow that pierced another goblin’s shoulder.\nLana raised her staff and whispered, \"Explosion.\"\nA sphere of orange light appeared above her hand, then exploded outward in a controlled burst. The last goblin dropped instantly, smoldering.\nSilence settled over the clearing again.\n\"Beautiful,\" Liam said, stepping closer. He knelt beside one of the fallen goblins, watching as its body disintegrated into motes of light. \"Loot auto-collected.\"\n\"That was... smooth,\" Kristy said, smiling. \"Better teamwork than I expected for our first run.\"\n\"That’s because Liam’s a good shot-caller,\" Harper said. \"I almost forgot we were playing a game.\"\nMatt slung his bow over his shoulder. \"Yeah, but admit it—the detail’s insane. Did you see how their armor looked burned when Lana hit them?\"\n\"Real-time material reaction,\" Stacy said quietly. \"The game engine adapts to every element in real time.\"\n\"Translation,\" Harper said dryly. \"It’s magic.\"\nThey laughed, the sound echoing softly through the forest.\nAs they continued deeper into the woods, the trees grew denser. The air carried the scent of moss and rain. Occasionally, shafts of light pierced through the canopy, illuminating dust motes that shimmered like tiny stars.\nSoon they reached a narrow clearing where an ancient stone arch stood, half-covered in vines. At its base, a faint blue glyph pulsed softly.\n\"Portal rune,\" Liam said, recognizing it immediately. \"It’s dormant. Probably linked to the next city. We can use it once we gather materials to activate it. And we can also secure it and use as a source of income for us.\"\nKristy traced a finger over the glyph. \"You really built all this?\"\nLiam smiled faintly. \"Let’s just say I helped it exist.\"\nThey pressed onward, cutting through scattered enemies along the way—slimes that burst into mist when struck, spectral wolves that vanished into shadows. The battles were quick, coordinated, and filled with laughter whenever someone made a mistake.\nAt one point, Matt misfired an arrow that ricocheted off a tree and narrowly missed Harper’s head.\n\"Hey!\" Harper yelled. \"Are you trying to assassinate me?\"\n\"It was a warning shot!\" Matt shouted back.\n\"Against what? My hairline?\"\nLaughter erupted again, loud and carefree.\nEven Liam couldn’t help but grin. \"Focus, you two. We’re almost at the ridge.\"\nWhen they emerged from the forest, the land opened up into a vast plateau. Below, the ruins of a forgotten fortress sprawled across the valley floor—crumbling walls, broken watchtowers, and a massive gate that lay half-buried under vines..\n\"Wow...\" Elise whispered. \"It’s beautiful.\"\n\"That’s Eldenfort’s outskirts,\" Liam said. \"One of the oldest ruins in the starting region. There’s a minor boss here—The Hollow Knight.\"\nHarper’s grin returned instantly. \"Boss fight already? Don’t threaten me with a good time.\"\n\"Don’t rush in,\" Liam warned. \"This one uses corrupted mana. Stay alert.\"\nThey descended the rocky slope carefully, weapons drawn. The wind carried a low, metallic hum—the sound of mana corruption.\nWhen they reached the main gate, a figure emerged from the shadows.\nIt was tall—almost twice Kristopher’s height—clad in ancient black armor that glowed faintly at the seams. The faceplate was cracked, revealing hollow darkness inside. Its sword, a massive black blade, dragged across the stone with a shriek.\n||The Hollow Knight – Level 8 Guardian of Eldenfort||\nThe name appeared above its head in red letters.\nMatt whistled. \"Looks friendly.\"\n\"Spread out,\" Liam ordered calmly. \"We’ll test its pattern first. Kristopher, draw its aggro.\"\nKristopher charged, shield up. The Hollow Knight swung once, and the impact shook the ground. Sparks exploded where their weapons met.\n\"Defense holding!\" Kristopher grunted.\n\"Good. Harper, flank. Lana, fire barrage—target the joints.\"\n\"On it!\"\nFlames burst from Lana’s staff, striking the Hollow Knight’s arm. The armor sizzled, molten cracks spreading down its gauntlet. Harper darted forward and struck twice before rolling back.\nMatt fired from behind, his arrows glowing with faint green light. \"Piercing shot!\"\nThe arrow struck the Hollow Knight’s chest, embedding deep. It roared, the sound like grinding stone, and raised its sword high.\n\"Brace!\" Liam shouted.\nThe blade came down with a blinding arc. Kristopher’s shield shattered under the blow. The impact threw him backward, slamming him into the wall.\n\"Kristopher’s down!\" Elise cried.\nLiam moved instantly. \"Kristy—heal him. Stacy, barrier!\"\nLight erupted from Kristy’s staff, mending the cracks in Kristopher’s armor as Stacy’s barrier shimmered to life, absorbing the next wave of energy.\n\"Now!\" Liam yelled, charging forward.\nHis sword glowed white with mana as he leapt, slashing clean through the Hollow Knight’s arm. Black smoke poured from the wound.\n\"Everyone, full attack!\"\nThey surrounded the boss in perfect sync. Spells, arrows, and steel collided with corrupted armor in a storm of color and sound. Finally, the Hollow Knight staggered, its sword falling from its grasp.\nLiam stepped forward and drove his blade through its chest.\nThe creature froze, then dissolved into light.\nA chime echoed: [Boss Defeated – Loot Distributed]\nThe group collapsed to the ground, laughing and cheering.\nMatt threw his arms up. \"That! That was amazing!\"\nHarper groaned, rubbing his neck. \"Remind me never to take a hit from something that big again.\"\nKristopher got up slowly. \"Next time, I want a sturdier shield.\"\n\"Next time?\" Lana said with a grin. \"You’re already talking about round two?\"\n\"Of course. That was fun.\"\nLiam sheathed his sword, smiling quietly. \"Good work, everyone. You fought well.\"\nAs they stood there, the sun began to set, painting the sky in shades of gold and crimson.\n\"It’s hard to believe this is just a game,\" Elise said softly.\n\"Now, come on, guys. We haven’t even started,\" Liam said.\nTheir adventures continued until they reached their daily usage limit.",

      "content": "Chapter 226: Little Family Time For Daniel\nLos Angeles, California\nThe sun had already dipped below the hills, leaving streaks of orange and violet across the Los Angeles skyline. The city lights began to flicker awake, spreading like fireflies through the valley.\nDaniel stepped out of the car and inhaled the cool evening air. The familiar scent of sea salt drifted faintly from the west. The neighborhood was quiet, the kind of calm only found in upper Los Angeles suburbs—where life slowed down and the noise of the city seemed faraway.\nAhead of him stood the two-story house, warm light spilling through the balcony windows. On the balcony stood Marcus, his older brother, smiling the same way he always did—half proud, half teasing.\n\"About time you showed up,\" Marcus called out, leaning against the railing.\nDaniel laughed as he walked up the driveway. \"You sound like Mom.\"\n\"Yeah, well, I learned from the best,\" Marcus replied, grinning as he made his way down the steps.\nThey met halfway and hugged, a firm embrace. It had been almost three weeks since they last saw each other in person.\n\"You hungry?\" Marcus asked, stepping back and studying his younger brother’s face.\nDaniel chuckled, rubbing his stomach. \"Starving.\"\nMarcus laughed and gestured toward the door. \"Perfect timing. Anna’s been in the kitchen since you texted. She says she made something ’celebratory.’ Whatever that means.\"\nDaniel smiled as he followed his brother into the house. The smell of herbs, butter, and freshly baked bread filled the air, warm and comforting.\n\"Someone’s been busy,\" Daniel said.\n\"That someone’s right here,\" came Anna’s voice from the kitchen. She stepped into view, wiping her hands on a towel, her dark hair tied back neatly. Her face lit up when she saw Daniel.\n\"Look at you,\" she said, smiling. \"You look like someone who just wrestled a lion and barely survived.\"\nBoth brothers laughed. Anna had always had that way with words—blunt but full of affection.\n\"Rough few weeks,\" Daniel admitted, chuckling.\n\"Few weeks?\" Anna raised an eyebrow. \"Try few years. You look exhausted. Sit, before you fall.\"\n\"Yes, ma’am,\" Daniel said with mock obedience, pulling out a chair at the dining table.\nAnna smiled, shaking her head, and began setting the last few dishes. \"Dinner’s ready. I started cooking the moment Marcus told me you were coming.\"\n\"That’s too kind of you,\" Daniel said. \"You didn’t have to go all out.\"\nAnna gave him a playful glare. \"Oh, hush. We’re celebrating the new Managing Director of Bellemere Family Office, remember?\"\nDaniel laughed softly, settling into his seat. \"You two make it sound like I became President.\"\n\"You might as well have,\" Anna said, taking her seat beside Marcus. \"You’re basically handling a billionaire’s empire now.\"\nMarcus chuckled. \"Correction—the billionaire kid’s empire.\"\nThat made all three of them laugh.\nAnna began serving the food—roasted salmon glazed in honey and lemon, creamy mashed potatoes, sautéed vegetables, and warm rolls. The smell alone made Daniel realize how hungry he really was.\nHe took a bite, and his eyes widened slightly. \"This is incredible, Anna.\"\n\"It’s just dinner,\" She waved her fork, pretending to dismiss the compliment.\n\"Dinner that could win awards,\" Daniel said. \"Seriously, my brother got lucky.\"\nMarcus smirked. \"Don’t remind me. I’m still trying to figure out what she saw in me.\"\nAnna chuckled. \"There are plenty of good women out there, Daniel. Maybe you’ll find one if you stop hiding behind work.\"\nDaniel smiled, shaking his head. \"I doubt it. I’m not about to work my entire life just for someone to take half my assets.\"\nMarcus laughed, shaking his head. \"You’re such a pessimist.\"\nAnna nodded in agreement. \"Exactly. You talk like every woman’s waiting with a calculator and a divorce lawyer.\"\nDaniel chuckled. \"Can’t help it. I see too many stories like that at work. Billionaires losing half their fortune over bad choices.\"\nMarcus leaned forward, elbows on the table. \"So how is work, really? I know you said it’s hectic, but you’ve got to tell me what it’s like running point for the richest kid on the planet.\"\nDaniel paused for a moment, fork halfway to his mouth. He sighed softly, then smiled. \"It’s intense. There’s no downtime. I’m either in meetings, on calls, or dealing with something extremely important. But...\" He paused again, his expression softening. \"It’s the most fun I’ve ever had.\"\nMarcus raised an eyebrow. \"Fun? You look like you haven’t slept in three days.\"\n\"Probably haven’t,\" Daniel admitted, laughing. \"But it doesn’t feel like work. Everything’s so efficient. Liam—\" he stopped himself, then smiled, \"—he runs things differently. He’s young, but his mind’s sharp. The kind of sharp that makes you wonder if he’s even human.\"\nAnna leaned forward slightly. \"He sounds... interesting.\"\n\"He is,\" Daniel said simply. \"He doesn’t talk much, but when he does, it’s worth listening to.\"\n\"You really sound proud,\" Marcus whistled softly.\nDaniel smiled. \"You’d be too if you saw what I’ve seen.\"\nThe rest of dinner flowed easily. They talked about their parents, childhood memories, Anna’s new project at work, and Marcus’ recent fishing trip that ended with him nearly falling into the lake. By the time they finished eating, laughter had filled every corner of the house.\nAfterward, the brothers helped Anna clear the table and wash the dishes. When they were done, they moved to the living room.\nMarcus went to the bar and poured two glasses of amber whiskey. He handed one to Daniel, who accepted it gratefully.\n\"To the new Managing Director,\" Marcus said, raising his glass.\nDaniel clinked his glass gently. \"To Anna’s cooking.\"\nAnna rolled her eyes. \"You two are hopeless.\"\nThey laughed and took a sip. The whiskey burned warmly down Daniel’s throat, loosening the tension in his shoulders.\nMarcus studied him for a moment. \"You really enjoy this, don’t you?\"\nDaniel nodded. \"Yeah. I know it sounds crazy, but I do. Every day’s something new. And even though I’m tired, I wake up excited.\"\n\"That’s good,\" Marcus said. \"But don’t burn yourself out. You’ve always had this thing where you don’t stop until you collapse.\"\n\"I’ll be fine,\" Daniel smiled.\nThe TV in the background caught Anna’s attention.\n\"Hey,\" she said, nodding toward it. \"Isn’t that the company everyone’s been talking about? Nova Technologies?\"\nMarcus turned, setting his glass down. \"Oh yeah, the one behind those Lucid things, right?\"\nThe television showed live footage from around the world—sleek drones descending from the skies. Reporters stood in front of crowds, their voices full of excitement.\n\"Looks like science fiction,\" Anna murmured.\n\"That’s crazy. How do they even move like that?\" Marcus whistled.\n\"Beats me,\" Daniel said, watching quietly. \"They’re saying it’s some kind of magnetic propulsion or zero-resistance system, but nobody really knows. The company’s not exactly transparent.\"\nAnna frowned. \"Still, it’s impressive. They’ve practically taken over the news. Every channel’s running the same story.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Marcus said. \"It’s like the world woke up and realized someone’s twenty years ahead of everyone else.\"\nThe anchors on TV discussed global reactions—governments demanding technical disclosures, investors scrambling to understand how an unknown company became the most talked about in the past week and became an even better bigger topic of discussion today.\nDaniel listened quietly, his expression unreadable. He wasn’t surprised by the chaos, but he didn’t comment either.\n\"You think it’s safe?\" Anna asked. \"All this technology coming out of nowhere?\"\n\"Depends on who’s behind it,\" Marcus said. \"Could be genius. Could be trouble.\"\nDaniel shrugged, giving a small, neutral smile. \"Hard to say. But you have to admit, it’s fascinating. Whoever built this... they’ve changed everything.\"\nAnna nodded slowly. \"You sound like you wish you were part of it.\"\nDaniel chuckled. \"I think I’ve got enough on my plate already.\"\nThey laughed again, and Marcus changed the channel to a baseball game, deciding they’d had enough world-changing tech talk for one night.\nThe conversation drifted to lighter topics—family, old stories, and plans for the weekend. The whiskey glasses emptied slowly, and the house grew quieter as the night deepened.\nAt one point, Marcus leaned back and sighed. \"I miss nights like this.\"\n\"Same here,\" Daniel said softly.\nAnna smiled from her spot on the couch. \"Then don’t make me wait three months for the next one.\"\n\"I won’t,\" Daniel promised. \"But you know how it is. Work never really stops.\"\nMarcus nodded. \"Then take moments like this when you can.\"\nDaniel looked around the room—the familiar walls, the framed pictures, the smell of home-cooked food still lingering in the air. For a moment, all the stress and noise of his life melted away.\n\"Yeah,\" he smiled and said quietly. \"I will.\"\nThey stayed up a little longer, talking and laughing until the clock neared midnight.\nWhen Daniel finally stood to leave, Marcus clapped a hand on his shoulder. \"Don’t forget to breathe once in a while, big shot.\"\n\"I will try,\" Daniel smiled.\nOutside, the night was cool and silent. As he walked to his car, he glanced once more at the glowing skyline of Los Angeles. He felt tired, yes, but also content.\nHe has seen a lot of shocking things over the past three weeks but the truth was that he was still looking forward to more. He was only worried about his heart, hoping it’s strong enough to take all that shock.\n\"Good times,\" he chuckled, before getting into the car. He started the engine and drove off.",

      "content": "Chapter 227: Parallel Earth?\nLater That Night, Dubai\nThe day had been long but deeply satisfying. The group had played until they reached their daily usage limit on Lucid.\nMatt was the first to sigh in frustration when the system prompt appeared, announcing that their usage time had ended for the day.\n\"I finally get it,\" he said, stretching his arms as his Lucid powered down. \"Now I see why you put that restriction there, Liam.\"\nLiam looked up from his seat, smiling. \"Oh? And what did you figure out?\"\n\"That you basically saved the world,\" Matt said dramatically, earning a laugh from Harper. \"No, seriously. Without that time limit, we’d never log off. I can’t even feel tired when I play on this thing. It’s insane.\"\nHarper nodded in agreement. \"Yeah, I noticed that too. I don’t even feel hunger or eye strain. It’s like my body doesn’t care that I’ve been in there for hours.\"\n\"That’s part of the immersion process,\" Liam said. \"The Lucid syncs with the brain’s sensory cortex. It keeps the body stable and relaxed so you don’t feel fatigue.\"\n\"Which means,\" Matt said, pointing a finger at him, \"that if you didn’t include a daily usage cap, the entire world would turn into walking zombies.\"\nLiam chuckled quietly. \"You’re not wrong. I designed that limit for a reason. I wanted to protect users from themselves. Most people don’t realize how easy it is to lose track of time inside an immersive world.\"\nMatt leaned back, shaking his head. \"You’re a lifesaver, man. Imagine millions of people just... disappearing into the game. Whole economies collapsing because no one wants to log out.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Liam said. \"It’s why I called it a paradox. It’s a device meant to bring people together, but without limits, it could destroy what connects them to reality.\"\nHarper tilted his head. \"Speaking of paradoxes, there’s one thing I still don’t get.\"\nLiam looked over. \"What’s that?\"\n\"Why make Lucid so cheap? It’s basically giving away magic for free. You could’ve priced it at two thousand dollars, maybe more, and people would still fight to get one. You’d make a fortune overnight.\"\nLiam smiled at the question. \"I could have done that,\" he admitted, \"but the goal was never about direct sales. Lucid is the foundation. I’m building an ecosystem, not just a product.\"\nHarper raised an eyebrow. \"So, subscriptions?\"\n\"Subscriptions are just a small part of it,\" Liam said. \"There are better ways to generate long-term value than just charging people upfront. Lucid’s true potential isn’t in how many units are sold—it’s in how much time people spend using it.\"\nThat made everyone pause. It wasn’t the kind of thing a regular developer would say. It sounded like the vision of someone thinking far beyond simple profit.\nHarper nodded slowly. \"So you’re saying you’ve got more plans for it. That this isn’t even the final stage.\"\n\"Something like that,\" Liam replied with a faint smile.\nThey didn’t press further. They could tell from his tone that he had already said as much as he wanted to.\nDinner followed soon after, prepared by the maids Duval had arranged for the apartment. The food was elegant yet comforting. They ate together, talking about the battles they’d fought in Eternal Realms earlier that day.\nEveryone laughed and teased each other about their mistakes. Matt proudly declared that he was \"definitely the MVP\" even though he had nearly hit Harper in the head with a stray arrow.\nBy the time dinner ended, everyone was full and relaxed.\nThey didn’t stay up much longer. Even if their bodies didn’t feel tired, their minds were still catching up to everything they had experienced.\nOne by one, they retired to their rooms.\nLucid had that strange effect on people—it made everything else seem... dull. Phones looked outdated. Regular screens looked blurry and lifeless. Even the air seemed less vibrant.\nIt wasn’t that the device altered their brains or interfered with their senses—it was just the natural result of exposure to something so far beyond their normal world.\nJust like how the first people who saw electricity or the internet could never go back to the way things were before, Lucid users could no longer look at the ordinary world the same way.\nBy midnight, the entire apartment was quiet. Except for Liam.\nUnlike his friends, Liam didn’t sleep. He sat by the window of his room for a few minutes, looking at the glittering skyline of Dubai, then stood up.\n\"It’s time,\" he said softly.\nThe next moment, his figure faded.\nHe reappeared standing in the narrow alley where he had vanished earlier that day. The afternoon air here was cool, crisp, and somehow fresher than Earth’s.\nMaybe it was the mana in the atmosphere, he thought. The scent of rain lingered faintly in the air.\n\"Seems like rain fell not too long ago,\" he muttered.\nLiam walked toward the main street and his eyes fell on the tall buildings, the car and everything that makes this world look almost no different form Earth.\nLiam took a deep breath, enjoying the fresh air. He was curious about what sort of rewards he would receive. But before he sign-in, he decided to ask the system some questions.\n\"System, are there anything I need to know or do before I sign-in?\" He asked.\n[Everything has been taken care of, Host.]\n\"Taken care of?\" Liam repeated. \"What do you mean?\"\n[Your identity has been registered in this world’s databases. You have legal status, financial records, and property ownership.]\nLiam blinked, surprised. \"You’re saying... I exist here? Officially?\"\n[Correct. You now have a bank account, citizenship record, and residence papers. All background details have been integrated.]\nHe paused for a moment, absorbing that. It made sense. He couldn’t exactly wander around a modern city without documentation. Still, the way that system handled everything impressed him.\nIn a normal situation like this, where one is without money or any identity in a new world, they would have to go through the stress of doing that themselves, and that would take a very long period of time. But the system handled everything precisely and efficiently.\n\"Then I guess it’s time to see what today’s reward is,\" Liam said, smiling.\nThe system’s made Liam to wonder yet again about everything surrounding the system. He hopes it’s not long before he gets answers to his questions.\n\"System, sign-in,\" he muttered.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, You have received $10,000,000.]\n[You have received an Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale.]\n[You have received: The Dark Dragon Villa, Dragon Cave Estate, Old Bethesda.]\nLiam stared at the screen, in a mix of surprise and confusion.\n\"...What?\"\nHe had to read it again just to be sure. Ten million dollars. A classic supercar. A villa.\nBy the system’s standards, this was slightly, if not totally excessive for a daily sign-in rewards. The truth was, Liam never expected to receive rewards like this again.\nHe was especially surprised by the currency and the car brand. It made him realize that the system had chosen something familiar—something that would help him adjust faster. The reward reminded him that Earth wasn’t the only modern world in the multiverse.\nThe system seemed to pick up on his thoughts and spoke.\n[You are currently on the Magic Universe’s Earth.]\nLiam’s eyes widened in shock. \"A parallel Earth?\" he asked quickly.\n[Confirmed.]\nMore questions flooded his mind. \"Then... was there ever another Liam Scott here before the apocalypse? Did he survive?\"\n[No, Host. Your existence is unique across all planes of reality. There are no parallel versions of you. This condition is extremely rare.]\nLiam frowned, his pulse quickening. His eyes slowly widened as realization sank in.\n\"Unique across every reality...?\" he murmured. The thought was hard to grasp.\nHe wanted to press further, to demand an explanation—but he stopped himself. The middle of the street wasn’t the place for that.\nWhile he was talking with the system, the car had materialised in front of him and the money has been transferred to his account.\nHe got into the car and gripped the wheel, starting the engine. He steered the wheel and the car rolled forward, gliding effortlessly onto the main road\nThe streets stretched endlessly, blending the familiar and the foreign. It was surreal, yet perfectly normal here.\n\"Same sky. Different rules,\" Liam smiled to himself.\nHe had a suspicious and had confirmed it with the car’s GPS. He was currently in Maryland, USA.\nAfter half an hour, the urban lights gave way to open countryside. The road curved gently upward, leading into forested hills. Fireflies floated along the roadside, glowing softly in rhythm with the night breeze.\nA sign appeared ahead: DRAGON CAVE ESTATE—PRIVATE PROPERTY\nBeyond it lay a gated road lined with lanterns. As he drove through, the world seemed to grow quieter. The estate sprawled across the hillside—rolling gardens, stone walls, and a lake reflecting the moonlight.\nAt the heart of it all stood the Dark Dragon Villa.\nThe structure was vast but elegant—black stone and silver glass, its architecture blending modern minimalism with ancient grace. Dragons were etched along its pillars, their eyes glowing faintly.\nLiam parked the car and stepped out. The cool air brushed against his face as he looked up at the villa.\n\"This will do,\" he said softly.",

      "content": "Chapter 228: Uniqueness and Impossibilities\nIt has been over half an hour since Liam arrived at Dark Dragon Villa and he has taken his time to carefully look through the property.\nThe first thing one must know is that the property, Dark Dragon Villa, is bigger than Bellemere Mansion in more ways than one. Of course, that would be obvious, considering that it’s the only property located on the entire of Dragon Cave Estate.\nThe interior of the property looks almost no different from a regular luxurious mansion back on Liam’s Earth. If anything at all, the interior design is way better than properties back on Earth. It’s not painted white all through and on the walls, are very exquisite carvings and artworks hung to it.\nBut there was one major difference between the Dark Dragon Villa and Bellemere Mansion is the huge underground training arena.\nLiam sighed, relaxing further into the soft and comfortable couch. He felt extremely grateful to the system for giving him a place of residence in this world on his first sign-in. And according to the property’s document, it’s also located in the far safer side of the state.\nHe doesn’t need to think to understand what that part meant: gate break and the overflow of monsters. It was just that self-explanatory.\nAnother thing Liam was grateful to the system for, was the money and the car. $10m was no means a small amount. Though he has no idea about the economic state of this world but he felt that it won’t be far off from what he’s familiar with.\nBut there’s one problem with properties like Bellemere Mansion and Dark Dragon Villa, it needs a team to manage it. There’s also the need for security.\n\"It’s good that JP Morgan survived the apocalypse. As expected of the biggest private financial institution in the world. I wonder what extra services they now offer post apocalypse,\" Liam muttered to himself.\nHe would naturally get the answers to his questions soon, as Lucy had already connected to this world’s internet, to gather information and also plug herself into it.\nWhile he waited for her, he turned his attention back to the system. He still has a lot of questions he wants to ask it.\n\"System, tell me more about this uniqueness of mine. How is it that I only exist on one Earth and not other parallel Earths?\" He asked.\nThis was naturally the first of his questions. What the system said about him being unique has been stuck in his head and he felt that he would die of curiosity if he doesn’t get a satisfying answer to it.\n[Host, what sort of being do you think occupy the Grand Universe?]\n\"I don’t know but you called them extremely terrifying entities,\" Liam replied.\n[Correct, Host. I called them that because that’s what they are. The three universes was created by these entities in the Grand Universe. It’s been eons since these universes was created and none of them have birthed another entity of equivalent status. The reason for that is because of the level of difficulty involved, as one would need to reach the level and surpass the level of their universe’s law creator. That process would take eons but with very little or almost negligible progress. There’s a faster way to reach that level, which is choosing a group and swearing loyalty to them. But one would need to have the strength and potential that can attract their attention. And their standards are very high.]\nLiam frowned slightly, digesting everything the system had just said. The system hadn’t answered the question about his uniqueness directly but he found what it was saying to be very interesting.\nEven without the system directly telling who those entities are, Liam could already guess. They are Gods. There was no other explanation. The only entity with such level of power that can create universes are Gods.\n\"System, tell me more about these entities. Give me an example of one of them if you can and explain how my uniqueness is related to them,\" Liam said.\n[The first requirement for a mortal to be able to ascend to the level of those entities is the uniqueness you have. And they must come from your universe, as mortals on other universes from cultivation and the magic universes can never achieve such status and level of power.]\n\"System, you mean that no matter how strong one gets in the magic and cultivation universe, they will never be able to become as strong as those entities?\" Liam asked.\n[Yes, Host. For those in the cultivation universe, to stand above the Grand Dao is impossible. For those in the magic universe, they will never be able to reach that level because the World Tree, Yggdrasil, has made that impossible. She’s even more powerful than most entities in the Grand Universe, standing at almost the same level as the Primordials.]\n\"Wow! So much information,\" Liam muttered slowly, doing his best to digest the mind blowing information.\n\"System, please confirm something for me. Those in the cultivation world needs to surpass the Grand Dao, while those in the magic universe needs to surpass Yddgrasil?\" He asked.\n[That’s correct, Host.]\n\"Wow! It’s truly impossible,\" Liam muttered to himself.\nHe continued thinking about everything the system had told him and he also remembered what was said about his home universe.\n\"System, you said that the only chance one has at reaching that level is to be from my home universe and be unique like me. But that uniqueness doesn’t affect the effect of the restriction on the absorption of dark energy, or does it?\"\n[No, Host. It doesn’t.]\n\"Then there’s really no benefit to the uniqueness then,\" Liam sighed.\n[You’re the first case, Host, and you will be the last. The ****** would make sure of that.]\nLiam smiled when he heard that. The system’s words were ominous in a way. But he wasn’t worried. He will see these adventure through to the end. He intends to stand on the same level as those entities, and to stand above them. He was aware of the difficulty of the goal and how grand it is, but that doesn’t mean anything to him.\n\"System, according to what you said about the entities that resides in the Grand Universe, does that mean what I saw when I was standing in the void—the massive tree and roots isn’t truly Yddgrasil? Was that an avatar?\"\n[That’s correct, Host. What you saw was her True Avatar.]\n\"True Avatar, huh? Seems like my journey is about to become more interesting,\" Liam muttered to himself.\nHe was curious about why the system had hidden the name of the entity. But with his understanding of the system and how it had causally named the World Tree, he felt that that entity would be even more powerful than Yddgrasil and probably the Primordials too.\nWell, those aren’t my current concern at the moment. I’m still powerless but that won’t be for long.\n\"Master, I’ve gathered the information you aksed for,\" Lucy said, bringing Liam out of his reverie.\n\"Good girl. Transfer everything to me. Time to learn more about this parallel Earth,\" Liam said.\nImmediately, Lucy transferred all of the information directly into his brain, using Lucid.",

      "content": "Chapter 229: The Great Awakening\nIt had been a few minutes since Lucy transferred the information into Liam’s mind, and he had taken his time going through everything carefully.\nSitting on the couch inside Dark Dragon Villa’s grand living room, he leaned back, eyes half-closed, absorbing every piece of data like water through sand.\n\"Fifteen years ago,\" Liam muttered, summarizing what he’d just read, \"the world changed overnight.\"\nAccording to Lucy’s findings, humanity in this version of Earth had experienced a disaster that later came to be known as the Great Awakening. One night, across every continent, gates had appeared—massive rifts in the sky and on the ground, shimmering like torn mirrors. From them poured creatures that defied reason.\nCities fell in hours. Entire armies were almost wiped out. Humanity teetered on the brink of extinction—until something unexpected happened.\nPeople began to awaken powers.\nThe first Hunters, as they would later be called, appeared by accident—ordinary civilians who, when pushed to their limits, unleashed abilities that rivaled the monsters themselves. Over time, those awakenings spread across the world and eventually, humanity learned how to fight back.\nIt took five years before the world stabilized enough to rebuild. The new age was born out of chaos—one built around Gates, monsters, and the Hunters who kept them in check.\nThe system governing power here was simple but efficient. Every Hunter was ranked from F Rank to SSS Rank, depending on their strength, skill, and contribution. Most awakened at random ranks, though advancement depended heavily on one’s talent, potential, and luck.\nThere were also two distinct types of Hunters: normal and unique.\nUnique Hunters are chosen few who awakened with unique abilities that broke all known rules—manipulating fire, bending water, commanding ice, lightning, or even space.\nLucy’s data showed that only a fraction of the population had such gifts.\nThe world’s population currently sat just under six billion. Of that, less than two percent were Hunters. Out of that two percent, fewer than thirty individuals across the entire planet possessed unique abilities. Thirty people—on an entire world.\nLiam’s brows furrowed slightly. \"Thirty. That’s... low.\"\n\"Correct, Master. Unique abilities are considered the highest form of awakening. The rarity has made them a global commodity—highly sought after, and often protected by their respective governments.\"\n\"Governments,\" Liam repeated softly, glancing toward the tall glass windows that looked out across the estate. \"So this world still has those intact.\"\n\"Yes, Master. Though the balance of power now lies equally between governments, guilds, and global corporations. The Hunter Associations operate as both regulators and military branches. Their authority rivals that of nations.\"\nLiam nodded slowly, impressed. \"Efficient. Brutal, but efficient.\"\nHe wasn’t interested in the Hunters for now, though. At least not yet. His immediate concern was simpler—management.\nHe sighed lightly, leaning back. \"Looks like I’ll have to start recruiting again. Let’s hope the private bank division of this world’s banks are no different from Earth’s\"\nAs if on cue, his phone began to ring.\nThe screen displayed an unfamiliar number. .\n\"Hello?\" He answered.\nA warm, professional voice came through the speaker. \"Good evening, Mr. Scott. My name is Alice Hathaway, calling on behalf of J.P. Morgan Private Client Services. I hope I’m not reaching you at a bad time.\"\n\"Not at all. Please, go on,\" Liam smiled.\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Alice said. \"I’m reaching out to inform you that your account balance has reached the threshold qualifying you for transition into our Private Bank division. Congratulations.\"\nShe continued, \"If you’d like, we can arrange an introduction to one of our senior Private Bankers who oversees client relationships in your region. They’ll reach out to you within the next business day to coordinate a time that suits your schedule.\"\nHer professionalism was impeccable. Polite, direct, and disciplined.\n\"They’ll walk you through our full suite of services—investment management, estate and trust structuring, liquidity strategies, and global cash management. From there, we’ll tailor the relationship around your financial goals and priorities.\"\nLiam nodded to himself, even though she couldn’t see him. \"That sounds good to me. I’d like to be introduced.\"\n\"Wonderful,\" she said, the warmth in her tone increasing slightly. \"Before we proceed, may I confirm your preferred point of contact and mailing address so our onboarding team can send your welcome materials securely?\"\n\"This number works best,\" Liam said. \"As for the address—Dark Dragon Villa, Dragon Cave Estate, Old Bethesda.\"\nThere was a pause on the other end. Just for a moment and Liam noticed it.\nWhen she spoke again, her tone had shifted ever so slightly—more formal, almost cautious.\n\"Understood, Mr. Scott. Thank you. You can expect a call from one of our Private Bankers within the next twelve hours. He’ll introduce himself and confirm your preferred arrangements. It’s truly a pleasure connecting with you, Mr. Scott. On behalf of J.P. Morgan Private Bank, welcome.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Liam replied.\nThey exchanged polite farewells, and the line went dead.\nLiam stared at his phone for a moment, then chuckled softly. \"Less than a day in this world, and the system’s already making waves.\"\nHe could guess exactly what had happened. The moment Clara had heard Dark Dragon Villa, some internal system at J.P. Morgan must have triggered a flag. It was likely registered as a high-priority asset, maybe even listed among post-Great Awakening elite properties. The sudden acceleration—from twenty-four hours to twelve—said enough.\n\"Looks like this world’s version of J.P. Morgan is just as sharp.\"\nLiam couldn’t help but think of parallel version of his Daniel Conley and his friends. He wondered if they survived the Great Awakening.\nBut while he was curious, the truth was that he doesn’t care. This isn’t his home and he doesn’t want to get close to the alternate version of people from his life back home.\nLiam checked the phone for how long he has spent in this world and he saw that only a few minutes had passed, even though he has spent at least two hours.\nHe wondered if the time difference between this parallel Earth and his home world is the same as the cultivation world. But he can only wait to find out.\nHe won’t leaving anytime soon. His schedule is free tomorrow and his next meeting is in two days time.\nIt was time to explore this new world. He was really curious to see the things that this altered version of Earth has in store for him.\nHe stood up from the couch, picked up the car key and stepped out of the Villa. He walked to the car and got in, started the engine and drove out.",

      "content": "Chapter 230: Taking The Hunter’s Test (Bonus Chapter)\nThe first part of Liam’s exploration was simple — to see the world with his own eyes.\nAfter the system’s revelations and Lucy’s data transfer, he wanted to witness how civilization had truly changed since the Great Awakening. So, he drove.\nThe Alfa Romeo purred quietly along the smooth highway, its sleek red body cutting through the highway like a blade.\nHe had spent the last few hours circling through Old Bethesda and the surrounding cities. What he found surprised him.\nThe city was immaculate. High walls reinforced surrounded most residential districts. But unlike the chaos Lucy’s report described, this region was peaceful.\nAnd Liam understood why.\nThe document had mentioned that Old Bethesda was one of the safest cities in the world, but seeing it firsthand was something else entirely. The reason was simple—the only SSS-Rank Hunter in the world lives here.\nIn this world, an SSS-Rank wasn’t just strong. They were legends, living deterrents capable of leveling mountains with just a wave of their hand. Having one reside in the area meant that no monster dared come within hundreds of miles.\nThe result? Peace. Prosperity. And a land value so astronomical that only the wealthiest could even dream of owning property here.\nNo wonder Alice Hathaway’s tone had shifted the moment he mentioned Dark Dragon Villa, Dragon Cave Estate. She must have known instantly that whoever owned a property in this district wasn’t ordinary.\nLiam smiled faintly. \"The system really went all out this time,\" he murmured, steering onto a side road.\nBut he hadn’t come out to admire real estate. He had another goal today—something far more personal.\nHe wanted a Hunter License.\nWhile he hadn’t awakened yet, Liam was confident that even in his current state, his physical power and mastery over his body were far beyond normal standards. After all, he had easily slain a couple of orcs.\nHe wanted the license not for fame or recognition, but for convenience. In this world, being a licensed Hunter meant freedom—\naccess to gates, unrestricted travel between regions, and, more importantly, access to information, among other benefits.\nA license would make him just another part of the system. Hidden in plain sight.\nAfter an hour of driving, he finally arrived at his destination, a tall silver building—the Hunters Association, Maryland Branch.\nLiam parked the car and stepped out.\nThe plaza in front of the building was alive with movement. Dozens of people m—young, old, men, women—streamed in and out of the entrance. Some wore casual clothes, others in office attire. The difference in their expressions was striking.\nThose walking in had eyes full of hope and determination. Those coming out carried a mix of joy, disbelief, and disappointment. A few even wept quietly in corners.\n\"Interesting,\" Liam murmured. He could already guess the reasons behind each emotion.\nHe walked into the building. Inside, the lobby was vast—glass walls, marble floors, a massive screen showing real-time monster activity reports in the state and the country.\nA group of recruiters in sleek suits stood in a corner, handing out business cards to freshly-ranked Hunters.\n\"Recruitment right at the gate. Efficient,\" Liam said quietly, amused.\nHe walked to the reception desk. The receptionist—a young woman with short silver hair and a headset—greeted him politely.\n\"Welcome to the Hunters Association, sir. How can I assist you today?\"\n\"I’d like to take the Awakening Test,\" Liam said calmly.\nShe glanced at him, her eyes flicking briefly over his attire and posture before nodding, \"Of course, sir. Please proceed down the hall to the right. Room A-17. The test hall is open.\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nHe followed her directions, his footsteps echoing softly against the polished floor.\nAt the end of the hallway, double doors opened into what looked less like a testing room and more like a stadium. The space was massive—easily large enough to hold a small concert. Dozens of people were scattered across the hall, each engaged in one of several tests.\nLarge digital panels displayed different stations: Strength, Stamina, Agility and Mana. The air was filled with shouts and the thud of fists striking reinforced pillars.\nLiam took it all in quietly, watching how organized the process was.\nEach test was overseen by staff in black suits carrying digital tablets. In one corner, a massive screen ranked test-takers in real time, flashing results for everyone to see.\nHe noticed that most people hovered around E to D Rank. Occasionally, a C-Rank score would flash, drawing murmurs and envious stares.\nThe few people attempting the Mana test struggled, most even failing to unleash a basic skill.\n\"Same everywhere,\" Liam thought. \"The ones with real power are rare.\"\nHe walked towards the receptionist to register himself for the test.\n\"Welcome, sir. Your name and age, please?\" The lady asked.\n\"Liam Scott. 18\"\nThe lady nodded and imputed the information into the system. After she had done that, she gave him a bracelet with his name on it\n\"Mr. Scott. Please proceed to the Strength Test first. Your scores will update automatically,\" she said.\n\"Thank you,\" Liam said, smiling faintly.\nHe joined the queue behind a group of young test-takers. Most looked nervous. Some bounced on their heels to psych themselves up; others whispered prayers under their breath.\nA tall man ahead of him stepped forward, took a deep breath, and slammed his fist into the black impact plate. The impact was silent but the result was displayed immediately, as numbers scrolled across the small LED screen top of the apparatus before stopping.\nResult: E+\nThe man’s shoulders slumped immediately. He gave a bitter smile and stepped aside.\n\"Figures...\"\nThe next in line, a girl with bright green hair, stepped forward. Her stance was better and precise. Her punch connected sharply, and the result flashed: D-.\nHer friends cheered from behind the barrier. She smiled, half-relieved, half-proud.\nLiam watched each result with mild curiosity. The strength readings were consistent with what he expected. By his estimation, an average E- Rank punch measured around 2,700 kilograms of force. D- Rank would likely start around 5,400. But this was just his estimate.\nWhen his turn came, he stepped forward with a confident smile on his face.\nThe examiner looked up from her is tablet.\n\"Name?\"\n\"Liam Scott.\"\n\"Ready when you are,\" she said, stepping aside.\nLiam placed his wristband near the scanner. The black plate glowed blue, confirming his registration. He loosened his shoulders, inhaled slowly, then exhaled.\nTo everyone else, it looked like he barely moved. His body didn’t tense and there was no visible strain. But when his fist shot forward, the sound was like air splitting.\nBOOM!",

The sound of muffled murmurs followed, rippling through the crowd behind him.\nLiam lowered his fist and exhaled slowly, with a satisfied smile on his face.\nHe hadn’t held back on that punch—he’d gone all out. The D+ result meant his blow had registered above the human norm by a wide margin. To everyone else, it was impressive. To him, it was satisfactory.\n\"Nice,\" he muttered quietly.\nThe lady in the black suit holding a digital tablet smiled and nodded approvingly as she recorded the data.\nLiam inclined his head politely before stepping aside. The others in line whispered among themselves, mostly impressed as Strength stat rank of D+ was no means small.\nLiam ignored the stares and walked toward the next testing area—Agility.\nThe queue was longer here. The test itself looked simple: a specialized treadmill with motion sensors and it adapts to each participant’s limits in real time.\nWhile he waited, he thought about his Strength stat test result. It has been a while since he actually checked his stats. It has been like forever.\nCurious, he decided to check it.\n[Host: Liam Scott]\n[Age: 18]\n[Lifespan: 220 years]\n[System Level: 4]\n[Strength: 104]\n[Agility: 103]\n[Stamina: 104]\n[Ability: Telekinesis]\n[Constitution: Myriad Armament Constitution]\n[Attribute Points: 0]\n[System Points: 40]\n[Skills: Pro-level Vehicular Operation, World-Class Etiquette, World-Class Culinary Arts, Formless Combat Doctrine, Perfect Memory, Universal Linguistics]\n***\nLiam smiled when he saw the familiar status screen window again. The last time he checkes it was on his monthly sign-in.\nHe smiled even more when he remembered that it was the same day he awakened his superpower.\nHe closed the window with a thought and turned his attention back to the queue. A girl with short brown hair was currently taking her test.\nHer feet pounded against the moving belt, legs blurring as she sprinted with all her might. After ten seconds, the treadmill beeped.\nResult: E+\nThe girl gasped for air, bent over in exhaustion. When she saw her result, her face fell. She stepped down, eyes wet with frustration, and left the platform without a word. A few friends tried to console her, but they would most likely not succeed.\nLiam watched quietly, expression unreadable. He could almost feel her disappointment. The atmosphere in the hall carried that constant tension—the fine line between triumph and defeat.\n\"Not everyone gets what they want,\" he whispered.\nHe wondered briefly whether the System Store could grant unique abilities here too. If it could, he might look into it later. A world full of Hunters meant a world full of potential—and danger.\nAfter almost thirty minutes, his turn finally came.\nThe examiner, a middle-aged man with sharp eyes and a trimmed beard, gestured toward the treadmill.\n\"Whenever you’re ready,\" he said flatly, holding a stylus over his tablet.\nLiam nodded. He stepped onto the treadmill, the machine adjusting automatically to his weight and size. Soft lights flickered along the edge of the treadmilll as the sensors synced with his bracelet.\nHe inhaled, exhaled—and moved.\nTo the naked eye, it looked effortless. His form was perfect—shoulders relaxed, stride balanced, with steady rhythm. The treadmill accelerated, adapting to his speed, but Liam barely noticed. The world around him blurred, wind brushing his face, heartbeat steady.\nTen seconds later, the examiner called, \"Stop!\"\nLiam slowed down gradually and stepped off the platform. The screen blinked once, then displayed his result.\nResult: D+\nThe examiner nodded to himself, as he took down the result.\nTwo D+ results. Liam was satisfied. It was enough to blend in and strong enough to be taken seriously.\nHe moved on to the next area—Mana Capacity.\nThe test was simple. A massive orb of glowing blue energy floated on a pedestal. The test-taker only had to place a hand on it. The device would read their mana reserves and output a ranking.\nThe mana capacity test is the most important of the test, as it’s what mostly determine the person’s final ranking. The higher the mana capacity, higher the final rank.\nAlso, the higher the mana capacity, higher the physical tests’ results. Mana enhances the body and makes people stronger.\nThe line moved quickly. Most people barely scored above F or E Rank. Some orbs flickered out entirely, showing near-zero mana.\nWhen it was his turn, Liam placed his palm against the orb.\nA warm sensation spread through his skin, like static electricity. The orb glowed brighter—then dimmed. No letters appeared. Nothing.\nThe examiner frowned and tapped his device. \"Hmm. That’s odd. Let’s try again.\"\nLiam placed his hand back on the orb.\nOnce again, it glowed faintly and went blank.\nWhispers rippled through the crowd.\n\"What’s happening?\"\n\"Did it glitch?\"\n\"Maybe he’s got no mana at all—why’s he even testing?\"\nSomeone near the back laughed quietly, \"Probably one of those wannabes who think they’ll awaken during the test.\"\nLiam ignored the comments. He simply removed his hand, nodded politely to the examiner, and walked toward the next area.\nThe examiner hesitated, watching him go with furrowed brows. A blank reading on a calibrated orb wasn’t just rare—it was almost impossible. The orb always showed something.\nUnlike the test takers, she knew something they don’t know. The test orb being used can only access mana capacity level of F Rank to A+ Rank.\nThis meant that the kid’s mana capacity is at least S Rank. I have to pass this information immediately.\nThis was far more easier for her to believe than to believe that Liam doesn’t actually have a drop of mana in him. That was simply impossible.\nLiam, meanwhile, wasn’t concerned. He knew why it had failed to register. He has no drop of mana.\nThe final test was Stamina.\nUnlike the others, this one was grueling. A 400-meter indoor track encircled a chamber, and test-takers wore specialized vests designed to increase in weight the longer they were worn. The vest absorbed the wearer’s output—each second amplifying the load.\nWhen Liam entered, the previous participant was collapsing on the floor, drenched in sweat. The vest on his chest glowed faint red, registering the weight: 290 kg.\nThe examiner looked up as Liam approached. \"Name?\"\n\"Liam Scott.\"\nThe man typed it in and nodded toward the vest. \"Fifty kilos to start. It’ll increase every second. Run as many laps as you can before you collapse.\"\nLiam slipped on the vest. It was very light. He took his position at the starting line.\n\"Ready... Go!\"\nHe launched forward.\nThe first lap passed easily. The vest pressed against his shoulders, growing denser. The second lap brought a faint resistance. By the third, it felt as if invisible hands were pulling him toward the ground. The vest’s weight now exceeded 400 kilograms.\nHis legs burned slightly. He sensed that it wasn’t just the vest anymore—something in the room was amplifying gravity.\n\"Interesting,\" he thought.\nHe completed the third lap and stopped. The examiner hit the button, logging the data.\nResult: D+\nLiam took off the vest, breathing evenly. Around him, other participants stared. Some whispered, others shook their heads in disbelief. He didn’t look winded—just calm, composed, as if the test had been routine.\nThree D+ results. Consistency itself.\nHis final rank was yet to be categorised and there was one test left—the one few dared to take.\nThe Unique Ability Declaration.\nIt wasn’t mandatory. In fact, most people skipped it. The \"Declaration Door,\" as it was called, led to a sealed chamber where Hunters who believed they possessed unique abilities could attempt official verification.\nIt was known for one thing: humiliation. The success rate was less than one in a ten million. Many walked in with confidence and came out broken, their claims dismissed as delusion.\nSo when Liam turned toward that solitary door at the far end of the hall, the crowd reacted instantly.\n\"Wait—he’s going in?\"\n\"Is he serious?\"\n\"Another one of those?\"\nA young man, probably no older than twenty, rushed toward him, waving his hands.\n\"Hey, don’t do it. It’s a waste of time!\"\nLiam stopped, turning his calm gaze on him and said, \"Thank you. But I’m aware.\"\nThe young man hesitated, caught off-guard by the certainty in his tone. He nodded awkwardly and stepped aside.\nThe murmurs grew louder as Liam reached for the handle.\nEvery eye in the hall followed him as he opened the door and stepped through.\nThe door closed behind him with a hiss.\nFor a brief moment, silence fell over the room—like the calm before a storm.\nSomeone whispered, \"Another fool.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 232: Potential SSS Rank? (Bonus Chapter)\nBefore deciding to walk toward the lonesome door at the corner of the hall, Liam had given it some thought. He wondered whether his telekinesis and regeneration traits would qualify as unique abilities. According to the information Lucy had gathered, unique abilities varied greatly—coming in countless forms and classifications. If that was the case, then either or both of his abilities should qualify.\nEven if they didn’t, it didn’t matter, as he would still receive a ranking classification.\nLiam’s hand touched the cold metal handle, and he pushed the door open, and stepped through.The door sealed shut behind him with.\nInside was another hall—large, but not nearly as crowded as the testing chamber outside. Several people in formal suits stood near consoles and data screens, with calm and alert expression on their faces.\nA woman in her early thirties approached, dressed in the same black-and-silver uniform as the examiners outside. She looked professional, sharp-eyed, but not unkind.\n\"Good afternoon,\" she said politely. \"Are you here to declare a unique ability?\"\nLiam nodded once. \"Yes.\"\nShe studied him for a moment, probably scanning for nervousness or arrogance—she found neither. Then she nodded and gestured toward a corridor on the right.\n\"This way, please.\"\nThey passed through a set of glass doors into a smaller chamber. Inside, five examiners waited—three men and two women, each holding tablets. They looked up when Liam entered. Their gazes lingered on him, but none spoke.\nThe woman who’d escorted him handed over his registration card and quietly stepped back out, sealing the door behind her.\nA man with a narrow face and tired eyes approached. He looked like someone who’d done this thousands of times and expected nothing new.\n\"Name?\" he asked, stylus poised over his tablet.\n\"Liam Scott.\"\nThe man tapped the name into the system. \"Age?\"\n\"Eighteen.\"\n\"Alright, Mr. Scott.\" He didn’t look up yet. \"What ability do you believe qualifies as unique?\"\n\"I have two,\" Liam said calmly.\nThe man froze mid-motion. His head lifted slowly, disbelief crossing his face.\nFor a heartbeat, no one spoke.\n\"...Two?\" the man repeated, blinking. Then, a short incredulous laugh escaped him. \"I see. Two unique abilities, you say?\"\nHe wasn’t mocking Liam. He was just surprised. Since the Great Awakening, no one had ever possessed two unique abilities.\nHaving even one was enough to make a person instantly famous—major guilds would fight to recruit them, offering fortunes and influence beyond measure.\nYet here, standing before him, was someone calmly claiming to have two. It was impossible, absurd even—but the examiner had no choice but to proceed. It was his job and procedure was procedure.\n\"Very well,\" he said, composing himself. \"State them.\"\n\"Telekinesis,\" Liam began evenly. \"And regeneration.\"\nThe examiner’s expression faltered again. He glanced at his colleagues, who now looked openly skeptical.\nTelekinesis as a unique ability, yes. But regeneration? True regeneration was considered a myth; not even SSS-Rank healers possessed it naturally.\nIt was the kind of thing you only read about in the first months after the Awakening, when rumors ran wild.\nHe cleared his throat. \"Mr. Scott, you understand that false declarations are penalized, yes?\"\n\"I do,\" Liam smiled.\nThe man sighed and rubbed his temple. \"Alright then. Let’s begin verification. Please, demonstrate.\"\n\"How would you like me to do that?\" Liam asked.\n\"For regeneration,\" the man said hesitantly, reaching into his pocket and withdrawing a slim silver dagger, \"cut yourself—lightly. Just a surface wound. Nothing deep.\"\nHe extended the dagger carefully, emphasizing his words. \"It’s only to verify. Don’t take it too far.\"\nLiam accepted the dagger, his eyes gleaming in amusement.\n\"This world really loves its procedures,\" he murmured. \"It’d be easier if everyone just had status windows.\"\nThe examiner frowned. \"What was that?\"\n\"Nothing,\" Liam said, smiling. He turned the dagger in his hand, examining the blade under the fluorescent light. Then, without warning, he moved.\nThe man didn’t even have time to stop him.\nA flash of silver followed by the sound of a clean slice.\nGasps erupted around the room.\nBlood welled briefly against Liam’s smooth skin and then stopped. Before their eyes, the wound closed like melting wax, flesh knitting back together in seconds. Bone, tissue, and nerve reformed perfectly. In less than ten heartbeats, the finger he’d cut clean off was whole again.\nThe severed finger itself hadn’t even touched the floor. It hovered in midair, suspended by invisible force—turning slowly and calmly, like a leaf caught in a gentle current.\nEvery examiner in the room stared.\nTheir monitors were silent. The mana detectors along the walls showed no reading—not even the slightest fluctuation. The regeneration process had registered nothing.\nZero fluctuation.\nIt was impossible. The chamber was built to detect energy levels up to SS+, and yet it had sensed no mana at all. To them, it looked like a miracle performed by someone who didn’t exist on the mana scale.\nLiam flexed his restored hand, then looked up.\n\"Would you like me to demonstrate telekinesis as well?\" he asked politely, tilting his head toward the floating finger.\nFor a second, no one spoke. Then the lead examiner coughed awkwardly and waved a trembling hand.\n\"N-No, that won’t be necessary.\"\nHe tried to sound professional but couldn’t hide the tremor in his voice. The others were still staring, wide-eyed, as if the laws of nature had just been rewritten in front of them.\n\"Understood,\" Liam said simply. The hovering finger drifted toward him, and he placed it in his pocket, and sent it to the Dimensional Space.\nThe man gestured stiffly toward the door. \"Mr. Scott, if you’ll follow me, please.\"\nThey stepped out into the corridor. The atmosphere had changed. The air felt charged, filled with whispers and quick footsteps echoing from distant rooms.\nThe news was spreading already. The staff moved differently, glancing at him, trying to look discreet and failing.\nA man was waiting at the end of the hallway—tall, broad-shouldered, with streaks of silver in his dark hair. His suit was immaculate, and his expression was composed but curious.\n\"Senior Examiner,\" the man with the tablet said quickly. \"This is the declaration candidate. He—\"\n\"I know,\" the senior examiner interrupted softly. His gaze lingered on Liam. \"You may return to your station.\"\nThe other man nodded and left without another word.\nThe senior examiner smiled faintly. \"Mr. Scott. Would you walk with me?\"\n\"Of course,\" Liam replied.\nThey walked down another corridor lined with soundproof panels and sealed doors. The senior examiner didn’t speak at first. He was studying Liam—not his face, but his presence, as if trying to find something he could classify. He found nothing.\nFinally, he said, \"You’ve caused quite a stir, Mr. Scott. The sensors in that chamber were built to detect up to SS+ Rank mana signatures. They read nothing from you—nothing at all.\"\nLiam frowned when he heard this, still trying to process what the senior examiner just said. It’s not that he’s slow but he knew that this was a terrible misunderstanding.\nThe examiner continued, his tone thoughtful. \"\"The last person who produced a reading anomaly like that was the only SSS-Rank Hunter in the world.\"\nThey stopped outside a reinforced office door labeled DECLARATION REGISTRY – AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.\nThe examiner placed his hand on the scanner. The door opened with a click.\nInside was a smaller, quieter room—one desk, two chairs, a single light overhead. The man gestured for Liam to sit.\n\"I’ll need to record your details,\" he said, retrieving a secure tablet. \"You may decline to share personal history if you prefer. However, your results will be forwarded to the National Registry automatically.\"\nLiam nodded, taking a seat. \"That’s fine.\"\nThe man began typing, his eyes darting between the screen and Liam. \"Age, eighteen. Strength, Agility, Stamina — all D+. Mana Capacity, unable to read. Declaration — verified. Abilities: Telekinesis and Regeneration.\"\nHe paused, then looked up with an expression close to awe. He didn’t want to believe it. He would had concluded that Liam’s an ordinary person but results from his stat tests and the fact that he regenerated a finger cancels that.\n\"Do you understand what this means, Mr. Scott?\"\nLiam met his gaze evenly. \"That I’ll be categorized?\"\n\"That you’ll be classified,\" the man corrected softly. \"Your results already triggered a review flag. You will be registered as a potential SSS-Rank candidate—the second in the world. But your current classification will be A Rank.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 233: Officially An A Rank Hunter (Bonus Chapter)\nNow, Liam found himself at a small crossroads.\nBeing labeled a potential SSS-Rank Hunter wasn’t a bad thing—anyone else would have shouted in celebration—but he knew it was all a misunderstanding. He hadn’t come here to impress the Association. He had come because he understood how this world worked.\nJust like the cultivation world, only strength decided status. The strong made the rules; the weak followed them.\nBecoming a Hunter wasn’t only about gaining access to gates. It meant freedom—legal immunity in some regions, easier travel, control over information, and priority access to resources that ordinary people would never touch.\nEvery level of power came with a list of privileges, and the higher the rank, the better the rewards.\nAn A-Rank Hunter, even one only labeled as a \"potential SSS,\" was already near the top of this world’s food chain.\nMoney, information, influence, he thought. All of it within reach.\nLiam smiled to himself He wasn’t going to correct the examiner’s misunderstanding. Explaining that he could regenerate a limb because he has molecular nanites in his body, and his telekinesis is because he’s from another world, was out of the option. Besides, this outcome suited him perfectly.\nAs for if he has the strength to defend his rank, Liam was confident.\nThe senior examiner continued speaking, unaware of Liam’s inner thoughts.\n\"We considered placing you above A-Rank,\" the man said, tapping his tablet, \"but your physical scores arr still on the low side. The strength and stamina tests are still part of the formula. Increase those and return in three months for reassessment.\"\nLiam nodded. \"Understood.\"\n\"You’ll find it easy,\" the man said with a small smile. \"With the right training, you could pass for S-Rank before the year ends.\"\nHe opened a drawer and retrieved a slim black card. It shimmered faintly when it caught the light, engraved with the Hunter Association’s emblem—a stylized gate encircled by silver rings.\n\"Your Hunter Identification,\" the examiner said, handing it over and Liam accepted it.\n\"Thank you.\"\nThe examiner nodded and stood. \"Allow me to escort you out.\"\nHe led Liam through a short hallway and called for an attendant. A young woman arrived almost immediately, straight-backed, professional, her black uniform pressed to perfection.\n\"Guide Mr. Scott to the main exit,\" the man said.\n\"Yes, sir.\" She turned to Liam and gestured politely. \"This way, please.\"\nThey walked side by side through the corridor. The faint rhythm of her heels echoed softly against the tiled floor. Liam noticed her stealing glances at him every few steps. When he caught her eyes, she flushed slightly and looked away.\nHe smiled and said nothing.\nThey reached the final set of doors. She pushed one open for him. \"Congratulations on your certification, Mr. Scott.\"\n\"Thank you,\" he replied. \"Have a good day.\"\nThe cool air of the main hall greeted him as he stepped out.\nInstantly, he felt dozens of eyes on him.\nThe waiting area had gone quiet. Test-takers and staff alike pretended to go about their business, but their gazes followed him from every angle. They were trying to read his face, to guess the result hidden behind that calm expression.\nLiam’s usual small smile never wavered.\nThey didn’t know what had happened behind that door, but the length of his absence said enough. No one spent that long inside the Declaration Chamber unless something extraordinary had occurred.\nWhispers ran through the crowd like sparks across dry grass.\n\"Is that him?\"\n\"He took the Declaration test, right?\"\n\"Look at his face—he’s smiling.\"\nOne of the examiners waiting nearby stepped forward to escort Liam to the exit. The gesture confirmed everyone’s suspicion.\nMurmurs swelled to open chatter.\n\"Wait, they’re escorting him? That only happens when—\"\n\"—when a declaration’s verified.\"\nThe young man who had earlier called Liam a fool was just finishing his own final test. He froze mid-stride, watching the commotion. His result flashed a modest D-Rank on the screen, but no one cared; all eyes were on the stranger walking calmly toward the doors with an official escort.\nHe stood speechless, the word fool still fresh in his memory.\nNo one took pictures, as it was banned it in the hall, but every witness would remember the scene in vivid detail. The story would spread by evening.\nBy the time Liam reached the exit, half the room had already guessed the truth.\n***\nBlack Tortoise Guild Headquarters\nFar from the Association building, inside one of the most powerful guilds in the nation, the guild master’s office glowed under the light of the city’s skyline. The man seated behind the massive desk spoke into his phone, his tone quiet but sharp.\n\"Two unique abilities, you say?\" he asked, repeating to confirm.\nThe voice on the other end replied quickly, low and urgent.\n\"I see.\" The guild master leaned back in his chair, eyes narrowing with interest. \"Thank you for the information. My secretary will arrange compensation.\"\nHe ended the call and placed the phone beside a stack of reports. For a long moment, he stared out through the floor-to-ceiling windows.\n\"Two unique abilities...\" he murmured. \"Now that’s new.\"\nHe pressed the intercom on his desk. \"Send in Director Kane.\"\n\"Yes, Guild Master.\"\nA few seconds later, a tall man in a gray uniform entered the room and saluted.\n\"Sir?\"\n\"Contact the Maryland branch of the Association,\" the guild master said. \"Get me everything on a Hunter named Liam Scott—full report, test results, the works.\"\nKane hesitated. \"Should I flag it for covert review?\"\nThe guild master’s eyes gleamed faintly. \"Yes. Quietly. I don’t want the other guilds sniffing around before we know what he is.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nWhen Kane left, the guild master leaned back again, thoughtful. The city lights reflected in his eyes like tiny flames.\n***\nLiam stepped out of the hall, and the examiner who had escorted him gave a polite nod before turning back inside.\nA small smile crossed Liam’s lips as he started walking toward the entrance—but he didn’t get far.\nThe moment he reached the lobby, a wave of movement surged toward him. Dozens of figures in tailored suits closed in from all sides, each one wearing the same practiced smile.\nRecruiters.\nTheir badges gleamed under the lights—guilds, corporations, and private associations—all fighting for the same thing: a chance to claim the new A-Rank Hunter who had just walked out of the test hall.\nIn seconds, Liam found himself surrounded. Voices overlapped in a blur of offers and promises.\n\"Mr. Scott, Black Falcon Guild is prepared to offer a signing bonus of—\"\n\"Our company provides full sponsorship, housing, and equipment—\"\n\"You won’t find a better deal than—\"\nLiam’s smile deepened slightly. He raised a hand, calm and composed.\n\"I’m sorry but I won’t be accepting any offer now. I will need some time to think about it and I will personally contact the guild of my choice,\" he said, and tore through the recruiters.\nHe stepped out of the building, got into his car and drove off immediately.",

      "content": "Chapter 234: Unsettled Ripples\nLiam wasn’t interested in the guilds’ offers. He never had any intention of joining one in the first place.\nHe didn’t see the point of signing contracts or swearing oaths to organizations he would eventually outgrow. The idea of being bound by obligations, schedules, and political loyalties didn’t sit well with him. It was unnecessary weight.\nThe reason he had taken the Hunter’s test was simple—to make life easier for himself, as the title gave him freedom. It opened doors, both figurative and literal, in this new world.\nHe didn’t need a guild to do that.\nIt was already evening and as he drove down the road, the city lights reflected faintly across the windshield.\nThen, his phone began to ring.\nThe screen flashed an unknown number but Liam picked up without hesitation.\n\"Mr. Scott?\" a calm, professional voice greeted. \"Good evening. My name is Blaire Novak. I’m calling from J.P. Morgan Private Banking Division. I’ve just been assigned as your personal banker.\"\nEfficient as always. It hadn’t even been six hours since Alice Hathaway’s call, and they were already moving.\nLiam smiled.\n\"Good evening, Mr. Novak. I was expecting your call.\"\n\"That’s good to hear,\" Novak said smoothly. \"I wanted to personally introduce myself and confirm your account activation on our end. If there’s anything you’d like arranged immediately, I’ll see to it.\"\n\"Yes,\" Liam said, tone calm but direct. \"I need an estate management and security team assigned to my residence. Full staff. Property management, maintenance, and round-the-clock security detail.\"\nThere was a brief pause before Novak responded, \"Understood, sir. I’ll begin selecting personnel right away. Would you prefer to review their profiles before deployment?\"\n\"Send them to me for approval first. I’ll decide which to keep,\" Liam replied.\n\"Of course,\" Novak said. \"You’ll have the full shortlist within a few hours. Is there anything else you’d like me to handle personally?\"\n\"That will be all for now.\"\n\"Very well. I’ll proceed with your request immediately, Mr. Scott. Expect an update before midnight.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Liam said, and the call ended.\nHe lowered the phone, a smile on his face, as he felt a sense of progress. Delegation was something he’d grown used to; it freed his attention for more important things. And if this world’s J.P. Morgan operated with the same precision as the one in his home world, then by this time tomorrow, his estate would already be under professional supervision.\nHe leaned back slightly, satisfied.\nThe city lights stretched before him like a web of gold veins across the night. He decided not to return to the villa right away but get himself something to eat.\nHe wasn’t hungry, not really, but the idea of trying food from an alternate Earth intrigued him. The thought made him chuckle.\n\"Let’s see what a world with monsters and gates serves for dinner.\"\nHe pulled up the car’s GPS and searched for nearby restaurants. A place caught his eye—a local spot not far from downtown Delaware. He adjusted the steering wheel and set off toward it. The Alfa Romeo’s engine purred softly as he drove.\n***\nMeanwhile, across worlds—back on Liam’s Earth—the ripples caused by Lucid’s public release had only just begun to surface.\nInside a restricted wing of Peterson Space Force Base, a meeting was underway.\nThe conference room was windowless, its walls soundproof, painted in sterile gray and secured in way that even Lucy can’t get in.\nA long table dominated the center and around it, sat twelve people, each one senior enough to bypass most levels of clearance. Military intelligence, NSA, DARPA, Treasury, and Homeland Security—all present.\nThe air was heavy, the kind of silence that came from minds too busy to speak.\nFinally, the man at the head of the table—a graying officer with deep lines across his face—spoke. His voice was calm but carried authority that didn’t need to be raised.\n\"Nova Technologies,\" he said, his eyes fixed on the central projection. \"We’ve confirmed that they distributed one thousand units of the device, Lucid, through what appear to be automated drone deliveries.\"\nHe turned his gaze to the woman on his left. \"Status on retrieval?\"\nThe woman, a civilian in a navy suit with an NSA pin on her lapel, adjusted her tablet. \"We’ve identified the buyers, sir. All one thousand. Most are verified individuals with no criminal records or corporate ties. Teams were deployed to retrieve one working unit of the device or drone, but...\" She hesitated. \"So far, none have succeeded.\"\n\"None?\" the officer asked.\n\"Not one,\" she said quietly. \"Our field assets can’t get close enough. The drones disappear into the sky the moment they complete delivery. They’re undetectable beyond ten kilometers. Even NORAD’s sensors can’t track them. As for the device, the creation of the platform for the users have made it even more difficult to acquire one. We are thinking of using special methods.\"\nThe officer leaned back slowly, exhaling through his nose. \"And the company’s registration?\"\nA man across the table answered this time—a Treasury liaison, glasses perched low on his nose. \"We traced the company through standard channels. We got nothing except the already known information that its corporate identity was created through J.P. Morgan’s incubation registry, Delaware. We can’t pierce it. Every inquiry hits legal walls.\"\nThe general’s brows furrowed slightly. \"So the world’s most advanced technology company appears out of nowhere, releases something that’s rewriting half our technological models, and up to now, nobody knows who runs it.\"\n\"Correct,\" the Treasury man said simply.\nThe general’s eyes moved to the man sitting beside him. \"What about the NSA?\"\nThe representative, a calm man in his forties, exhaled slowly. \"We’ve had teams monitoring electromagnetic anomalies, drone traffic, and communication patterns. Nothing. It’s like the drones vanish into vacuum after delivery. We’ve also tapped satellite arrays for tracking potential origin points. No hits.\"\n\"DARPA?\"\nThe answer came from a man further down the table. \"Our liaison is already in contact with their research heads. Sandia’s on standby to begin analysis once we obtain a working unit. But without one, we can’t replicate or reverse-engineer anything.\"\nThe general’s hand tightened briefly around his pen before setting it down. \"So, after four days, the United States government knows nothing.\"\nThe room was silent. No one disagreed.\nA younger analyst near the end of the table finally spoke up, his tone hesitant. \"Sir, if I may—there’s a theory circulating among the analysts. They believe Nova Technologies might not be a company at all. It could be a government project—one operating outside formal jurisdiction.\"\nThe general looked at him. \"Whose government?\"\nThe young man swallowed. \"We don’t know, sir. Possibly ours. Possibly not.\"\nThe general’s jaw tightened. \"Speculation doesn’t help us. Evidence does. Until then, we treat Nova as an independent entity operating beyond our visibility. And that’s a problem.\"\n\"We can’t afford to be caught flat-footed again,\" he said firmly. \"The fact that this company can deploy technology like this at scale, means that they have rewritten warfare, intelligence, and communication. We need answers.\"\nHe looked toward the NSA delegate. \"Double your coverage on J.P. Morgan’s network. Monitor for encrypted communications originating from their private banking division. If Nova was built under their umbrella, something will leak through.\"\nThe man nodded. \"Understood.\"\nThe general’s tone softened slightly. \"And keep our contact at DARPA in the loop. If Sandia gets a unit, I want full-spectrum analysis within twenty-four hours.\"\n\"Understood, sir.\"\nHe sat back, his expression unreadable. \"Gentlemen, ladies—you all know what’s at stake here. If someone has technology this advanced and they’re choosing to release it publicly, it means one of two things. Either they’re confident we can’t stop them...\" He paused. \"Or they don’t see us as competition. And both are bad.\"\nNo one spoke.\nThe meeting ended quietly. One by one, the officials gathered their tablets and left the room, their footsteps echoing in the silence.\nWhen the last door closed, the general remained seated for a moment longer and exhaled slowly.\n\"There’s something wrong somewhere,\" he muttered under his breath. \"And I intend to find out what.\"\nThe lights dimmed as he left the room.\nIt wasn’t just the US government that was stuck. It was the same with every government around the world.",

      "content": "Chapter 235: Unsettled Ripples (2)\nMētā Headquarters – Menlo Park, California\nInside the meeting room, for everyone seated around that table, the room felt suffocating.\nMarkus had been silent for almost a full minute, and that silence was worse than yelling. He stood at the head of the conference table, hands clasped behind his back.\nThe Mētā executives avoided his gaze.\nFinally, he spoke.\n\"Ten years. Ten years of development. Hundreds of billions in R&D and all of it looks like a toy next to this,\" Markus said quietly, gesturing to the paused video on a tv screen.\nHis voice wasn’t raised, but it cut like glass.\n\"Lucid appears out of nowhere, and in three days, it has every tech board, investor, and consumer on the planet losing their minds. The delivery system alone has rewritten logistics modeling. The AI integration—impossible by our standards. And you’re telling me we still have no idea how they did it?\"\nThe head of R&D swallowed. \"We—sir, we’re still running the disassembly sequence on the leaked video data. We compared it against every known neuromorphic and quantum-lattice design. Nothing matches. It’s like the device has zero overhead. Infinite bandwidth on local inference.\"\n\"You’re describing magic, not engineering,\" Markus’ jaw flexed.\n\"Yes, sir,\" the R&D head said weakly. \"That’s... that’s pretty much what our engineers are calling it internally.\"\nA nervous chuckle escaped someone at the far end of the table, and Mark’s eyes snapped toward them. The chuckle died immediately.\nHe stepped forward, leaning both hands on the table. \"Magic doesn’t exist. Competence does. And apparently, ours doesn’t.\"\nThe room went still again.\n\"Every investor, every analyst, every agency is looking at us,\" Mark continued. \"You all know what they’re asking? Not how we’ll compete, but whether we’re obsolete. You want to talk about innovation curves? Lucid flattened it.\"\n\"So tell me, gentlemen and ladies—what’s the R&D department doing besides feeding me diagnostics that tell me what I already know?\"\nThe head engineer spoke again, nervously, \"We’re attempting replication of the base AI model, but without a Lucid unit to reverse-engineer, we’re blind. Their cloud layer’s completely sealed. Even our deepest data interceptors can’t breach the authentication handshake.\"\nMarkus’ tone went colder. \"You’re saying it’s unhackable.\"\nThe engineer hesitated. \"...Yes, sir. At least for now.\"\nMarkus’ expression didn’t change, but the air seemed to thin around him. He exhaled slowly through his nose, then looked toward the head of the neural interfaces division.\n\"What about the sensory mesh project? The one you said would allow real-time immersion without induced neural feedback lag?\"\nThe woman looked up nervously. \"We—ah—we are still experiencing some difficulty but we are close, sir.\"\nMark tapped the table lightly. \"You’re close?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Useless!\"\nFor a long moment, Markus just stood there, his thoughts flying all over the place.\nFinally, he said quietly, \"Alright. I’ve heard enough.\"\nHe turned toward the corner of the room, where a glass partition separated the Superintelligence Division from the rest of the meeting area. Behind it, a smaller team waited.\n\"You,\" Markus said, pointing toward the partition. \"Superintelligence team. Your turn.\"\nThe head of the division, Dr. Isaac Renn, straightened in his chair and pushed through the door to join the main room. His colleagues followed, clearly uneasy.\nMarkus gestured for him to speak.\n\"Status.\"\nRenn adjusted his glasses, voice steady but cautious. \"We’ve spent the last forty-eight hours running model inference comparisons against Nova’s AI behavior. Based on the telemetry data from live-streamed Lucid sessions, it confirmed that each device seems to run a localized, autonomous learning core. Not a distributed cluster, but individual instances that evolve independently.\"\n\"Meaning?\"\n\"Meaning,\" Renn said, \"that every Lucid unit effectively trains itself. They’re running what could be described as a miniaturized general intelligence. The hardware acts as both the host and the training environment.\"\nMurmurs rippled through the executives.\nMarkus’ tone was flat. \"You’re saying Nova managed to put a superintelligent agent inside every headset?\"\n\"Not quite superintelligent,\" Renn said quickly. \"But it’s not static either. The AI adapts dynamically to user context. We estimate each Lucid contains roughly three to five times the compute density of our latest cloud model, compressed to a wearable substrate.\"\nMarkus stared at him. \"That’s impossible.\"\n\"It should be but it’s not,\" Renn said quietly.\nThe room fell silent.\n\"So we’re not just competing with a company that’s a few steps ahead. We’re competing with something that may not even be human-made,\" Markus asked\nRenn hesitated. \"There’s... speculation, sir, that the Lucid system was designed by a recursive model. A self-improving AI.\"\nMarkus turned his gaze on him sharply. \"You’re suggesting Nova’s core was built by another AI.\"\nRenn didn’t flinch. \"We can’t confirm it, but the design language in the compiled binaries doesn’t match any known programming syntax. It’s not human-readable. It’s... algorithmically generated.\"\n\"If that’s true, do you know this means?\" Markus asked.\n\"Yes, sir. It means that Lucid and the delivery drones was built by an extremely intelligence AGI or being controlled by one, proving that an super artificial intelligence can be built.\"\nMarkus looked at Renn, his eyes narrowing slightly. \"Then I want to know one thing: does it serve its creators—or itself?\"\n\"Because if it’s the latter,\" he said softly, \"we’re already too late.\"\nThe room stayed silent\nMarkus stood there for a moment longer, one hand in his pocket, thumb grazing the edge of his phone. Then, without turning around, he asked, \"Where’s Legal?\"\nTwo seats down, a woman in a charcoal suit straightened immediately. \"Here, sir.\"\nHe turned his head slightly, eyes on her. \"What’s the progress on the lobbying front? I told you to start pushing through the regulatory committees earlier this week.\"\nThe woman hesitated, before responding, \"We did, sir. Our lobbyists have already met with members of the Commerce Committee, the FCC, and the Technology Oversight Board. But—\" she paused, carefully choosing her words \"—it’s complicated.\"\nMarkus turned fully toward her now, crossing his arms. \"Complicated how?\"\nShe exhaled slowly and answered, \"Nova Technologies doesn’t fall under any existing framework. Their products are distributed entirely through aerial systems—drones that don’t register under any national airspace database. They don’t ship through conventional channels, they don’t use commercial logistics, and they don’t store any traceable data within publicly accessible networks.\"\nMarkus frowned. \"Meaning they don’t technically violate any law.\"\n\"Exactly,\" she said, nodding. \"We’ve already tried to get the FAA involved, but the drones operate autonomously and vanish the moment delivery completes. Legally speaking, there’s no entity to prosecute. And because the company’s website is hosted on a closed-loop private cloud, outside the jurisdiction of known data centers, even the Cyber Division can’t locate a root server.\"\nMarkus rubbed his chin. \"What about financial pressure? We still have influence with the SEC and the trade regulators.\"\n\"We’ve already filed the necessary complaints,\" she said carefully. \"But the problem is... Nova doesn’t sell through any recognized exchange or corporate brokerage. Their transactions are direct-to-consumer through encrypted digital channels. Payments don’t go through any conventional payment processor. There’s no financial trail. None that we can find.\"\nMarkus’ eyes narrowed. \"So we can’t hit them with compliance regulations.\"\n\"No, sir. They’ve built something closer to a sovereign system—completely detached from oversight. Even their corporate registration in Delaware is protected under a banking incubation clause that falls under J.P. Morgan’s umbrella. Legally, they’re insulated.\"\nThe silence stretched.\nMarkus looked down at the table, his knuckles tapping once against the wood. \"So we’ve lobbied, filed, and pressured every connection we have—and we still can’t touch them.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" she said quietly. \"That’s the situation for now. We’ll keep pushing, but unless a new law is drafted specifically targeting autonomous private networks, there’s nothing we can use. And even if we get one through Congress, it could take months—maybe longer.\"\nMarkus’ jaw tightened. \"Who knows how many units they would had released by then?\"\nNobody answered.\nHe walked back to the head of the table and sat down slowly. For a moment, he said nothing, just stared at his folded hands.\n\"So,\" he said finally, voice lower now, almost to himself. \"They built a company that answers to no one, hides behind a private financial fortress, deploys from the sky, and runs technology even our top labs can’t reproduce.\"\nThe woman from Legal looked uneasy as she spoke, \"Sir, we’ll keep applying pressure where we can. If we can’t go through legal channels, we’ll try public opinion. Influence campaigns. Narrative shaping. But I’ll be honest—it’s difficult when no one dislikes them. Everyone just wants their product.\"\nMark’s gaze dropped to her again. \"Then make them doubt it.\"\nShe blinked. \"Sir?\"\n\"Every empire falls the same way,\" he said quietly. \"Not through attack. Through doubt. If you can’t regulate them, discredit them. Start working the press networks, the investor boards, safety regulators—anything that can sow hesitation. People trust what they think they understand. Nova’s biggest strength right now is mystery. Make that their weakness.\"\nThe woman hesitated, then nodded. \"Understood.\"\n\"We don’t get left behind,\" he said quietly. \"Not by them. Not by anyone.\"\nNo one replied, but the unspoken truth filled the room; they have already been left behind.\n***\nBack in the other world, Liam parked in front of the restaurant and stepped out of the car.",

      "content": "Chapter 236: Opportunities And Freedom\nLiam sliced another piece of the steak, savoring the burst of flavor as he chewed slowly. The meat was tender and juicy, the glaze tastes faintly sweet with a touch of heat at the end. He closed his eyes and allowed himself to simply enjoy it.\nThe restaurant wasn’t particularly high-end. It was small and modest. It was the kind of place locals recommended to each other rather than posted about online.\nHe had come here because of the reviews, curious about what an \"alternate Earth\" served as comfort food. And now, sitting here under the soft amber lights, surrounded by the chatter of people who had survived the end of the world, he was glad he came.\nIt’s good\n, he thought, cutting another piece.\nThere was something grounding about it—eating among ordinary people, hearing laughter, seeing life carry on despite everything.\nThe walls outside might be ten stories high, the gates might still spawn monsters, and the world might never return to what it once was—but here, inside this little restaurant, humanity felt alive.\nHe leaned back in his chair, fork resting idly on the plate, and looked around. The other diners were a mix of people—Hunters and civilians chatting quietly over steaming bowls of soup. Some carried small scars that trailed up their necks or disappeared beneath their sleeves. It wasn’t unusual. In this world, scars were as common as smiles.\nFifteen years had passed since the Great Awakening—the day the first gates tore open across the sky. Out of those shimmering rifts came creatures that no science could classify, things that walked, crawled, or flew with a hunger that could devour cities.\nHe had read the reports Lucy gathered, but seeing the aftermath with his own eyes made the words real.\nPeople lived differently here. Every building was reinforced. Every street had emergency sirens. Even restaurants had emergency exits built with links to escape tunnels leading toward shelters underground. Humanity had survived—but it was always braced for the next disaster.\nIt serves as both protection and prison.\nInside the walls: order, safety, light.\nOutside: chaos, blood, and monsters.\nLiam finished the last of his meal and set his utensils down. The waitress, a young woman with short black hair and tired eyes, approached quietly.\n\"Everything alright, sir?\" she asked.\n\"Perfect. Compliments to the chef,\" Liam gave a small smile.\n\"Thank you,\" She smiled and nodded, as if she didn’t quite believe him but appreciated it anyway.\nLiam paid the bill, left a generous tip, and stepped outside.\nThe night air was cool and soothing. A faint wind brushed against his face as he walked to the car.\nThe streets were still lively, though more subdued than they would have been before the Awakening.\nFew people stayed out too late; curfews weren’t enforced, but caution had become habit.\nLiam got into the Alfa Romeo and started the engine. He sat there for a moment, watching as pedestrians hurried home under the glow of street lamps.\nHe thought of this world. According to Lucy’s data, the first few years after the Great Awakening had been absolute chaos.\nGovernments collapsed, cities fell, and militaries were forced to retreat behind hastily erected barricades.\nThe survivors built new cities behind colossal walls, protected by the newly awakened Hunters.\nIt worked, to a degree. Humanity endured. But even now, vast stretches of land remained uninhabitable. The gates hadn’t stopped appearing. Some opened in the middle of nowhere, others deep in the forests or deserts or places too remote to reach before a Gate Outbreak occurred.\nThat was the term they used here: Gate Outbreak. When a gate overflowed, monsters poured out in waves, devouring and laying devastation to everything in their path.\nIt was how most of the world had been lost.\nMid-Atlantic region is the safest place in the world, thanks to the presence of the strongest Hunter in the world. It’s the first place where walls was built and the wall surrounds the whole region. But even the strongest couldn’t be everywhere.\nNew York, according to Lucy’s report, was still lost. The entire state had fallen fifteen years ago and had never been reclaimed. The roads leading in are blocked by military checkpoints, but even the soldiers stationed there never ventured far beyond the perimeter.\nThey built their peace on the edge of fear,\nLiam thought.\nHe shifted the gear and began to drive, the car gliding smoothly through the streets.\nEverything about this world fascinated him. The economy thrived on monster materials and gate exploration, yet trade routes were limited by geography and danger. It was a delicate balance of survival and ambition.\nBut the gates that terrified this world, Liam saw as an opportunity. He saw them as things to explore.\nThe world beyond the walls is lawless. Only strength rules. For the people here, it was a death sentence. But for him, it was freedom.\nHe smiled at the thought. A lawless wilderness filled with creatures strong enough to destroy cities—it sounded like a perfect training ground. A place to test his strength and to sharpen his instincts.\nThe Alfa Romeo turned into the main avenue leading toward Dragon Cave Estate. The drive back had been peaceful.\nWhen he finally pulled into the garage, he checked the time on his phone. Less than an hour had passed on Earth—though he had spent at least five hours here.\n\"Perfect. More time for me,\" he smiled in satisfaction.\nWith the time difference being like this, he would have more time to explore this world. And unlike the cultivation world where the beasts in the Thousand Mist Forest are part of the world’s ecosystem, the monsters in this world aren’t. At least, not in the same way.\nLiam stepped out of the car, closing the door softly. He took a moment to gaze up at the stars.\n\"It’s beautiful,\" he muttered.\nThen, without hesitation, he stepped off the ground, his body rising effortlessly into the sky.\nHe flew higher until he could see most of the city from the sky. He admired the beautiful view for a moment before flying towards the wall.",

      "content": "Chapter 237: Into The Death Zone\nThe wind howled softly as Liam flew across the night sky, cutting through the air like a shadow.\nBelow him stretched the towering wall stretching endlessly across the horizon. The floodlights along its crest shone like a second dawn, piercing just the edge of the darkness that swallowed the wasteland beyond.\nAfter twenty minutes of flight, he slowed his descent. His feet touched down lightly on the top of the wall.\nFrom up here, he could see the silent city behind him, bathed in the glow of safety and the sprawling abyss ahead, where monsters roamed freely under a pale moon.\nHe walked to the edge and looked down. In the distance, the floodlights revealed the human perimeter made up of a military outpost and Hunter encampment pressed against the inner wall.\nArmored vehicles lined the trenches. Soldiers and Hunters moved like ants along defensive barricades, watchful, weary, and small against the enormity of the night.\nBut beyond the barricades... A sea of monsters stretched as far as his eyes could see.\nThe land outside was alive with movement of monsters and their roars was carried through the wind. It sounded like a haunting orchestra of hunger and violence.\nThe death zone. Perfect,\nLiam smiled.\nHe stepped off the wall and descended into the night, gliding silently like a phantom. He didn’t fly at full speed—just below his cruising pace of five hundred miles per hour. Fast enough to cover ground, slow enough to stay unseen, masking his presence completely.\nHe passed over the military camp, the soldiers none the wiser. He crossed the barricade and the trenches, moving deeper into the wild where the air was filled the choking smell of blood and decayed corpses.\nAfter flying a few kilometers further, Liam descended again, his feet touching the cracked, barren ground.\nThe silence out here was unnatural. It was like the land itself was holding its breath. The ground was dark, scarred, and littered with bones bleached under the cold light of the moon.\nHe took a few steps forward and summoned Silverleaf from the Dimensional Space. The elegant sword materialized in his hand. It had been a while since he’d held it. The familiar weight settled perfectly against his palm.\n\"Feels good to hold you again,\" he said with a smile.\nHe walked for a few minutes as silently as he could, making sure to mask his presence. It didn’t take long before he sensed movement ahead.\nHis telekinetic sense caught their small outlines when they entered its range. All ten of them. It was followed by a very strong rancid smell of corruption.\nWhen he came closer, he saw them. A group of goblins.\nThey were exactly as he has read—short, green-skinned, with wiry limbs and twisted faces that looked like mockeries of humanity. Their jagged teeth glinted when they laughed among themselves. Their voices sounded like the grating symphony of guttural snarls and screeches.\nLiam frowned immediately as their very existence offended him. Everything about them. Their small, green, sickly body disgusted him. Their face especially.\nHe had never seen anything so ugly and inelegant in his life. He felt a strong and inexplicable feeling of disgust, and hate towards them.\n\"Ugly doesn’t even begin to describe you,\" he muttered.\nOne of the goblins heard his voice and froze. Its head snapped toward him, eyes glowing faintly yellow. The others followed, and when they saw him, they began to laugh.\nTheir laughter was a hideous sound, like metal grinding on bone.\nThe largest among them—likely their leader—snarled something in its own tongue, a string of words that sounded like madness mixed with laughter. But to Liam, thanks to his Universal Linguistics, every word was crystal clear.\n\"A human, here? Did you lose your mother, little mortal? If you find her, tell her we’ll give her a good time before we eat her.\"\nThe words slithered through his mind like filth.\nLiam’s expression didn’t change, but inside, disgust boiled. He didn’t care about his irresponsible and selfish mother but hearing those words come from such vermin was revolting.\nHe sighed quietly. \"You know,\" he said softly, \"sometimes I wish this skill didn’t translate everything so perfectly.\"\nThen his tone shifted, still calm, casual, but laced with venom.\n\"Green monkeys,\" he called out in their language.\nThe goblins froze mid-laugh, confusion evident in their glowing eyes.\nLiam’s smirk widened. \"You heard me. Green monkeys. You all look like a bunch of kids that got kicked out of the cave for bad hygiene.\"\nThe leader blinked, stunned and lost for words.\n\"You... you speak our tongue?\" it stammered.\nLiam tilted his head slightly, staring at the goblin like he was looking at a fool.\n\"Fluently,\" he said, then grinned. \"Now go fuck yourself.\"\nThe entire group stiffened, their ugly faces contorting in outrage.\n\"You dare insult us, human filth?!\" one shrieked.\n\"You’ll regret that!\" another roared.\nThey spread out, surrounding him in a rough circle. Their claws glinted in the moonlight, and their laughter returned, cruel and confident.\nThe oldest among them stepped forward, sneering. \"We’ll cut you open slowly. Find out how you learned our tongue. Then we’ll keep you alive. Maybe as a pet. You’d look cute in chains.\"\nLiam sighed and shook his head slowly, his disgust deepening.\n\"Enough,\" he said flatly. \"Your voices alone are enough to make someone throw up.\"\nHe raised Silverleaf and rested it lightly on his shoulder. \"Do yourselves a favor and stop talking. You green monkeys whose evolution got tired halfway.\"\nThat did it as the goblins screeched in fury and charged as one.\nTheir feet pounded the dirt, claws flashing. They moved fast for their size—but to Liam, they were so slow that they might as well have been crawling.\nHe smiled and when the first goblin leapt, he moved.\nA silver arc cut through the dark, wide and smooth as flowing water. The goblin’s body split in half before it even touched the ground. Blood sprayed across the dirt, steaming in the cold air.\nThe others barely had time to react before Liam turned on his heel and swung again in one clean, horizontal slash. The next five fell instantly, their bodies collapsing like cut grass.\nThe remaining four froze, panic flickering through their eyes. One stumbled backward, shrieking something incomprehensible—\nImpossible! He’s a mortal without a drop of mana!\nAnother tried to flee.\nLiam didn’t bother chasing. He coated Silverleaf with his telekinetic field, extending the length of the sword with the field and he slashed.\nThe extended field from the blade cut through the air like a guillotine. The fleeing goblins stopped mid-run, with their bodies severed cleanly before they even realized it.\nSilence returned to the wasteland.\nLiam stood there, his coat fluttering softly in the wind. He looked down at the corpses and exhaled slowly.\n\"Vermin,\" he muttered, flicking Silverleaf to the side causing the green blood to scatter into the dirt.\nHe didn’t feel pride or satisfaction. Only mild disgust—and small amusement.\n\"This world’s monsters talk too much,\" he said, shaking his head.\nHe turned and began walking deeper into the death zone.\nThe air grew colder as he moved farther from the light of the walls. The sounds of the living city faded behind him, replaced by distant roars echoing across the wilderness.\nThe moonlight washed the barren land in shades of silver and blue, painting a hauntingly beautiful picture of ruin.\n\"Let’s have a little fun, shall we?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 238: Hunting More Goblins\nIt had been nearly thirty minutes since Liam began his silent crusade. The first ten were his first victims.\nSince then, he had killed fifty more. The barren wasteland was now painted with green blood, coupled with the stench of decaying corpse and dried up blood, yet Liam remained unbothered.\nHe was having mixed feelings—not about killing the goblins, but about the creatures themselves. Their existence disgusted him to no end. Everything about them—their foul smell, twisted laughter, and shriveled green faces—offended him on a level he couldn’t explain.\nHe didn’t want to look at them anymore. Yet, strangely, he couldn’t deny the satisfaction he felt each time Silverleaf sliced through their flesh effortlessly.\nIt wasn’t joy—it was relief.\nThe way their bodies split cleanly, the hiss of the blade as it cut through skin and bone, the quiet that followed each kill—it was all too perfect. Almost soothing.\nWas that enough to call him a psychopath?\n\"Nah.They deserve it,\" he muttered aloud, shaking his head.\nBut there was one upside to these ugly creatures—monster cores.\nLiam hadn’t realized until Lucy mentioned it. It was after his 35th kill that she had informed him.\n\"Master, monsters in this world have something in their body called monster core. The cores can be exchanged for money and they are used for creating hunters gears, among other uses,\" she had said.\nLiam had paused mid-step at the time, feeling stupid.\n\"Cores? You’re telling me I’ve been leaving money all over the floor? Lucy, you could have said that twenty minutes ago,\" he sighed deeply.\n\"You didn’t ask, Master,\"\nHe had rolled his eyes but said nothing more. It wasn’t her fault—he should have thought of it. He knew what kind of world this was. Hunters, monsters, gates—it wasn’t hard to guess that creatures dropped valuable items after death.\nHe felt that he didn’t think about it because the group he met in the gate, didn’t extract the monster cores from the orcs.\nStill, he didn’t plan to backtrack just to carve cores out of corpses. It would waste time, and frankly, he didn’t feel like digging into goblin flesh.\nSo, he asked Lucy for a solution.\n\"Is there a bot that can do the extraction for me?\"\n\"Not currently in inventory, Master. But I can create one.\"\n\"Do it.\"\n\"Already on it, Master. I will deploy it immediately it’s done.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam nodded and went back to work, letting the Lucy handle the rest.\nBy the time she reported the completion of the bot, Liam had already turned the field into a small graveyard. Piles of green bodies lay scattered like broken puppets. The air reeked even harder thanks to the abominations in front of him, but he ignored it.\nNow, as he walked deeper into the Death Zone, he caught movements ahead.\nHe stopped, narrowing his eyes. He reached out with his telekinetic sense, expandibg it silently, scanning the terrain. Dozens of small shapes were moving toward him in a loose formation.\nHe counted.\nThirty... thirty-five... no, closer to forty.\nA slow smile spread across his face.\n\"More of them. Perfect,\" he murmured.\nHe gripped Silverleaf and waited.\nMoments later, the group emerged from the darkness, their glowing yellow eyes gleaming like diseased stars. The horde stopped several meters away, watching him warily.\nThe largest of them snarled something in their language, a rough growl that grated on the ears.\nThe goblin standing beside him—shorter, with a staff clutched in its bony hands—turned its head and barked something back.\nLiam understood every word.\n\"That’s him. The human who speaks our tongue,\" said the first goblin.\n\"Then you’re useless. How is it that you’re unable to take care of a human that hasn’t awakened?\" the one with the staff snapped, hitting the first goblin on the head with its staff.\n\"Chief, he might look ordinary but he isn’t so–,\" the first goblin tried to explain, but the one with the staff won’t have any of it excuses and before the other could react, it smashed the staff into its skull.\nThe blow cracked the bone with a wet and sickly sound, and green blood gushing out of the first goblin’s head.\nLiam’s brow rose slightly as the creature crumpled to the ground, twitching once before going still. He had initially let the goblin go, for it to report back and return with more, saving him the stress of doing that himself. And it did the job perfectly.\nThe goblin leader snarled in annoyance and said, \"If you can understand me, human, then you must also know that you won’t leave here alive.\"\nLiam said nothing, as he just smiled with a cold look in his eyes.\nThe staff goblin tilted his head. \"Amusing creature. I wonder how you learned our words. But no matter. I’ll find out after I’ve taken your head.\"\nLiam’s smile widened as he vanished from the spot.\nThe staff goblin’s eyes widened—too late. A flash of silver light tore through the air, and the first rank of goblins disintegrated before they even realized he had moved.\n\"Kill him!\" It roared.\nThe horde rushed forward in a wave of snarling teeth and claws.\nLiam moved like a shadow through moonlight, his figure blurring with each strike. Silverleaf’s edge cut through green flesh like it was air. Heads rolled, arms flew and bodies split cleanly in two before hitting the ground.\nThe goblins screamed, their shrill voices echoing across the plains—but none of them lasted long enough to be heard twice.\nIt was a massacre and within a minute, it was over, ending just as fast as it started.\nDozens of corpses littered the field. Blood soaked the dirt, forming shallow pools that reflected the pale moon.\nLiam stood in the middle of the pile of shredded and incapacitated corpses, looking calm and spotless. His coat fluttered lightly in the breeze, untouched by even a speck of filth.\nA small smile of amusement coloured his face.\nThe surviving goblin—the staff goblin—staggered backward, trembling.\n\"I-It can’t be... you haven’t awakened! How—how can you—\"\nIt realized it might have gravely misjudged Liam’s strength. He wasn’t an unawakened human at all—he was something far stronger.\nWhat confused the goblin most was why someone so powerful emitted no mana—and why a being like that would waste time hunting low-rank creatures like them. But it wasn’t about to wait for an answer.\nIt turned on its heel and ran.\nBut it didn’t get far.\nLiam extended his hand lazily and clenched his fist.\nThe goblin froze mid-stride, an invisible grip locking its limbs in place.\nIt struggled, thrashing violently, its claws digging into the dirt. \"No—please—!\"\n\"Oh, you beg now?\" Liam raised an eyebrow and tightened his grip.\nThe goblin screamed as its body was lifted into the air, then slammed into the ground with crushing force. Again and again, and again.\nWhen he finally stopped, the creature was barely conscious, blood trickling down its bloodied face.\nLiam brought it closer with a flick of his wrist—close enough to talk, far enough that the stench wouldn’t reach him.\n\"I need some information and you’re going to give it to me,\" he said calmly.\n\"W-what do you want to know?\" The goblin asked with a broken voice, trembling.\n\"Everything,\" Liam said softly.",

      "content": "Chapter 239: Predator Of The Sky\nLiam was making his way toward the orcs’ territory. The ground beneath his feet cracked with every step, and the air grew heavier the farther he walked.\nThe goblin had told him everything before it died—about the monsters, the territories they occupied and the ranks of the monsters.\nThe information was detailed, maybe too detailed. That alone made Liam suspicious.\nThey really do live up to their reputation as cunning little bastards\n, he thought.\nThe goblin had begged and cried, even offered information in exchange for mercy. Liam had listened, taken what he needed, and then ended its miserable life with one clean strike. It was business. Nothing more.\nNow, he needed to verify whether the information was true—or if the creature had tried one last act of spite before dying.\nThe wasteland ahead stretched endlessly, the once beautiful state of New York now painted in dull shades of gray and brown, with bones of monsters jutting out of the cracked earth.\nAs he continued moving forward, he noticed some movements coming straight toward his direction.\nWhen they got into the twenty metres range of his telekinetic sense, he finally saw their outlines.\nWolves\n, he sighed softly.\n\"So the goblin lied after all. Guess even dying didn’t stop you from trying to screw me over,\" he smiled.\nHe didn’t change his pace. He simply kept walking, calm and unhurried, even as the pack drew closer.\nJust before the wolves would have seen him, he disappeared from his position.\nA blink later, he reappeared behind them. Silverleaf whispered through the air in a single smooth arc. Four heads rolled cleanly off their bodies before they could even snarl. The corpses collapsed one after another, twitching briefly before growing still.\nHe didn’t stop walking.\nThe extraction bot, a small metallic sphere the size of a basketball, floated silently a few distance behind him. Its lenses glowed faint blue as it hovered over each corpse, drilling delicately before retrieving the glowing cores within.\n\"Handle it,\" Liam said, and the bot beeped once in acknowledgment before resuming its work.\nHe had walked for nearly five more minutes when he sensed another cluster of movement—three this time.\nWolves again.\nThey noticed him almost immediately, snarling as they charged in, claws scraping the dirt and eyes burning red.\n\"Let’s make this snappy,\" Liam smiled.\nThe wolves lunged and the next thing they knew, Liam was gone.\nA soft whoosh of displaced air followed. By the time they landed, their bodies hit the ground in silence—neatly cut from shoulder to waist. None even had time to understand what had happened.\nLiam exhaled and lowered Silverleaf. \"Still too weak,\" he muttered.\nHe was about to continue forward when something in the sky caught his attention.\nA shadow crossed the moonlight.\nHe looked up and he saw a massive bird, easily twenty meters from wingtip to wingtip, gliding through the air like a storm given form. Its feathers shimmered faint blue, and its eyes glowed faintly gold as it turned its head toward him.\nEven from this distance, Liam could tell that it wasn’t a regular beast. It was beautiful in a way that was graceful and deadly.\nThe bird screeched, and the sound rolled across the land like thunder. The air pressure shifted immediately. Dust and debris whipped upward.\nLiam narrowed his eyes. \"So this world does have a few interesting creatures.\"\nHe could feel its killing intent. The bird wasn’t hunting—it was defending its domain. And to it, Liam was prey that had trespassed.\n\"Fine by me,\" he smirked.\nHe kicked off the ground and shot into the air, a blur streaking through the night sky.\nThe bird seemed startled at first—then amused. It cawed, the sound echoing with strange intelligence. He could understand it perfectly.\nA human dares to fly towards me? Foolish creature!\n\"Guess I’ll just have to disappoint you, feather brain,\" Liam smirked.\nThe distance between them closed in seconds. The bird accelerated, closing in with terrifying speed. Liam sidestepped midair, his body gliding with surgical precision. Wind screamed around them as they passed each other.\nThen, in one fluid motion, Liam turned and slashed at its side.\nSparks.\nSilverleaf met resistance for the first time since arriving in this world. The strike glanced off the bird’s hide, carving a shallow mark instead of slicing through.\nLiam blinked in mild surprise, then smiled wider.\n\"Now we’re talking.\"\nThe bird screeched triumphantly, its beak opening wide.\nYou are weak!\nit taunted.\n\"You talk too much,\" Liam chuckled.\nThe next instant, they clashed again. The bird lunged, beak first. Liam spun midair, parrying the strike with Silverleaf and driving a punch straight into its beak. The impact boomed, sending a shockwave that rippled through the air.\nThe bird shrieked and recoiled in pain. Liam didn’t waste the moment—he twisted, slashing at its eyes. The creature jerked its head, the blade grazing its feathers instead.\nIt retaliated instantly.\nThe next screech wasn’t just a sound—it was an attack. A sound base attack.\nThe soundwave hit Liam with concussive force, enough to rupture eardrums and liquefy organs in an ordinary person.\nLiam merely flinched. His body held firm, the vibration dispersing harmlessly through him.\n\"Cute trick,\" he said, brushing imaginary dust from his sleeve.\nHe extended his hand lazily, palm open, and clenched the air.\nThe bird froze midflight. Its golden eyes widened as invisible pressure wrapped around one of its leg.\nIt tried to pull away, wings flapping violently, but Liam’s telekinetic grip tightened like a vice.\n\"Down,\" he said calmly.\nThe world blurred as he dove, dragging the monster behind him. The air screamed from the velocity.\nThey crashed into the ground like a meteor strike. The impact sent a tremor through the wasteland, dust erupting in a massive plume. The bird shrieked once, dazed but alive.\nLiam hovered above the crater, hand still raised. \"You’re tougher than I thought.\"\nThen, with a flick of his wrist, he slammed it down again.\nBoom.\nThe bird hit the ground so hard the shockwave flattened the nearby rocks.\nIt cawed weakly. Liam didn’t stop.\nAgain, and again, he raised it and slammed it—each impact echoing like thunder until the massive creature stopped moving entirely.\nWhen it finally went limp, its chest rising shallowly once before going still, Liam released his telekinetic hold. The bird’s massive body crashed into the dirt, motionless.\nSilence reclaimed the night.\nLiam landed beside the corpse, brushing dust from his coat. Without sparing the bird another glance, he turned to leave—but then, a low rumble spread across the horizon.\nHe looked up. Dozens—no, hundreds—of glowing eyes flickered in the distance. The clash had drawn attention. Every predator within miles had heard the commotion and they were coming.\nThe ground began to tremble faintly under their charge.\nLiam smiled and rolled his shoulders, shifting his grip on Silverleaf.\n\"Perfect,\" he murmured. \"I was starting to get bored.\"\nHe stepped forward, the moon casting his shadow long across the cracked earth.\n\"Let’s dance.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 240: Fighting The Horde (Bonus Chapter 1/5)\nThe military encampment by the wall was on high alert because for the last three minutes, the sounds had not stopped.\nDeep booms rolled through the night like thunder. Shockwaves trembled through the ground beneath their boots. The very air seemed to vibrate with the rhythm of distant battle.\nThe soldiers at the perimeter had abandoned their card games and idle chatter. Now, they stood tense behind their barricades, rifles ready, eyes fixed on the darkness beyond the wall.\n\"Sir, should we sound the alarm?\" one of them asked, voice tight with fear.\nThe lieutenant hesitated. His gaze flicked toward the two Hunters stationed with them.\nOne of them — a man in his forties, broad-shouldered and sharp-eyed — stood with his arms crossed, watching the horizon. The other, a woman in a black combat coat, her long hair tied back in a braid, was listening intently to the distant rumble.\nBoth were A-Rank Hunters, assigned to the post as part of the city’s defense rotation.\nAfter a few moments, the woman turned toward the nervous soldiers.\n\"It’s fine,\" she said. \"Nothing’s heading our way.\"\nThe relief on their faces was almost immediate.\n\"Are you sure, ma’am?\" the lieutenant asked. \"It sounds close. Feels close.\"\n\"It’s not,\" she said simply. \"That’s not a tide. Monsters are fighting each other out there.\"\nThe soldiers blinked in confusion.\n\"Fighting... each other?\" one echoed. \"Monsters don’t do that.\"\n\"They are doing so tonight,\" she replied, folding her arms.\nThe lieutenant frowned but said nothing. The tension eased slightly, replaced by uneasy curiosity. If the monsters were tearing each other apart, that was a blessing.\nThe soldiers smiled nervously, exchanging quiet jokes to hide their relief. Most of them were ordinary men — none above E-Rank.\nAgainst even a small gate outbreak, they would last seconds. D-Rank and above rarely joined the army. Why risk their lives for a government salary when guilds paid ten times more?\nAs laughter began to return to the camp, the female Hunter’s expression only darkened.\nShe wasn’t smiling. Her gaze stayed fixed on the horizon.\nShe had lied to them.\nThe sounds weren’t monsters fighting each other. She could feel it. She had sensed something else out there but she had no idea what.\nShe had seen a figure through her long-range lens. The figure was small, dark against the moonlight, but unmistakably humanoid. And the figure was flying.\nNo one she knew could do that. Not even she could. Only one man in the entire world could, and that was the SSS-Rank Hunter. But this wasn’t him. She has seen enough pictures of him to know that he wasn’t the one.\nHer partner walked up beside her, frowning.\n\"What’s wrong?\" he asked.\n\"You saw it too,\" she said quietly. \"The one fighting the Canero.\"\n\"Yeah,\" he replied, tone flat. \"So what?\"\n\"You don’t think that’s strange?\" she asked.\nHe shrugged. \"We’re not paid to care. Whoever it is, it’s their problem. Our job is to keep the wall secure. Not play rescue squad for idiots wandering into the death zone.\"\nThe woman sighed softly. \"You’re not wrong.\"\nStill, she couldn’t shake the feeling that what she’d seen wasn’t just another Hunter. She felt that whoever that was out there — he wasn’t dying quietly, especially with how he was able to easily defeat a D Rank monster.\n***\nFar beyond the wall, Liam stood alone in the wasteland, the corpse of the giant bird lying behind him like a fallen mountain.\nHe could already feel the tremors beneath his feet, as the earth shook from the approach of countless footsteps.\nWhen they came into view, even Liam paused to appreciate the sight.\nOrcs — dozens of them, each over three meters tall, skin dark gray and muscles like forged iron. They stomped forward, carrying crude but deadly weapons carved from monster bones.\nAmong them were taller figures with black armor and glowing red eyes—hobgoblins. Behind them, five winged beasts soared, their wings slicing through clouds with every beat.\nIt was a small army.\nLiam exhaled slowly. \"Perfect.\"\nHe pressed the watch on his wrist. The nano-exosuit began spreading like liquid metal across his arms and forming reinforced gauntlets. Thin streams of silver light snaked up Silverleaf’s blade as the nanites coated it, reinforcing it.\nHe knew that this fight was going to be tough and he decided to take it serious from the very beginning.\nHe rolled his shoulders once. \"Let’s get started.\"\nThe orcs roared in unison, their sound echoing like thunder.\nThe flying monsters dived first, their bodies blurring as they unleashed sound waves that tore through the ground. The pressure cracked stone, flattening the corpses of the wolves left behind.\nThe air burst open as Liam shot upward like a missile and the wind screamed past him.\nOne of the flying monsters screeched and dove towards him.\nLiam twisted midair and met it head-on. Silverleaf cut across its beak in a blinding flash. Sparks erupted, followed by a spray of glowing blood.\nHe grabbed the bird’s leg with his telekinesis, pivoted mid-spin, and hurled it downward.\nThe creature hit the ground like a meteor, crushing a cluster of orcs beneath its massive body. The explosion of dirt and bone rippled across the field.\nLiam descended into their ranks like lightning. The remaining orcs bellowed in rage and charged at him. His first swing split three cleanly. A second strike cut through an axe mid-swing and its wielder’s chest.\nHe moved without pause. He was like a blur of black coat and silver steel. His telekinetic field deflected thrown weapons and redirected shockwaves.\nAn orc swung a massive club. Liam caught it mid-strike with one hand, crushed the weapon to dust, and sent the creature flying with a backhand punch strong enough to break stone.\nThe ground shook beneath him.\nTwo hobgoblins charged, swinging their crude weapons together, forming a cross slash that could have bisected a tank.\nLiam ducked under the attack, with smooth and precise movements, then thrust his palm forward. Invisible force slammed into them like a cannon blast. They flew backward, bodies twisting midair before crashing into their allies.\nAbove, the remaining four birds circled, shrieking. The air shimmered as they began charging their sound attacks again.\nLiam shot upward.\nSilverleaf sang, each slash cutting through the night sky. One bird’s wing exploded in a shower of blue feathers and blood. Another tried to flee and he caught it mid-flight, wrapped it in telekinetic force, and crushed it until its bones shattered.\nTwo remained. They screamed, charging in desperation.\n\"Persistent,\" he muttered.\nHe swung his arm horizontally, a wave of telekinetic energy expanding outward like a blade. The shockwave split both creatures in half, their bodies raining down in burning fragments.\nBelow, the remaining orcs hesitated. Their confidence cracked but that didn’t stop Liam, as he descended like a falling star. The impact cratered the ground. The force alone sent shockwaves that tore through the nearest ten monsters.\nHe straightened slowly, eyes glinting under the moon. \"Next.\"\nThe last hobgoblin roared and charged. It was larger than the others, almost easily over five meters tall. It swung a massive warhammer at him.\nThe weapon came down. Liam caught the shaft with one hand. The ground fractured beneath his feet, but his expression never changed.\n\"Nice effort,\" he said.\nHe twisted his wrist. The warhammer snapped like a twig.\nThen he drove his fist through the hobgoblin’s chest, leaving a gaping hole where its heart used to be.\nSilence followed.\nOnly the sound of the wind remained, with the sound of the extraction bot floating through the battlefield, collecting cores from the fallen.\nLiam looked around. The entire horde was gone. The air had a thick smell of blood. Cracks spread across the ground for hundreds of meters.\nHe exhaled and wiped a streak of dust from his sleeve.\n\"That should do for today,\" he said, deciding to call it a night.\nHe has stretched his body enough and had enough fun. Now, it was time to get back to the Villa. He flew up into the air and started flying back to her city.",

      "content": "Chapter 241: Night Stroll Spoils, New Staffs (Bonus Chapter 2/5)\nLiam had just taken his bath and was now resting on the bed inside the master suite of Dark Dragon Villa.\nThe bed was absurdly soft—softer even than the one in Bellemere Mansion. The texture was smoother and lighter. He pressed a hand into the mattress, watching it sink and rise in slow motion.\nHe had no idea what material it was made of. Cotton? Silk? Foam? He doubted any of those could achieve this level of comfort.\nThen again, this was a world where magic, monsters, and awakened Hunters existed. It wouldn’t be strange if even bed materials came from the remains of magical beasts.\n\"Fantasy world, fantasy furniture,\" he muttered quietly, smiling to himself.\nHe turned his attention to the spoils from his night stroll. Lucy had already tallied everything up.\n97 E-Rank monster cores, 21 D-Rank monster cores and 1 C-Rank core. Their total value came to $588,000.\nIt was, by all accounts, a profitable night.\nTo most Hunters, that was a small fortune. Same as to those in his home world. But Liam knew better. The moment you factored in the cost of repairing equipment, replacing armor, restocking weapons, paying guild fees, and medical coverage—it wasn’t much at all.\nThe economy of this world was strange. Inflation had twisted everything after the Great Awakening. Ordinary goods—food, furniture, clothing—were cheap but still far more expensive than it was fifteen years ago.\nBut anything related to Hunters was worth a small fortune. Weapons. Armors. Mana potions. Monster parts.\nEven land had become an untouchable luxury. With safe zones being few and far between, territory within city walls was priceless.\nHe sighed quietly. \"Same story in every world. The rich adapt faster than the rest.\"\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a soft chime from his phone. The notification tone echoed lightly through the room.\nLiam reached for it and saw an incoming message from Blaire Novak. The email contained a neatly formatted list of personnel profiles, accompanied by a short message:\n\"Proposed Estate Staff for Dark Dragon Villa — Maids and Security Personnel. All candidates are verified awakened with complete background checks.\"\nHe skimmed through the attachments. Three maids. Two guards. One driver listed as \"on-call.\"\nTheir résumés were impressive, but he didn’t trust paper alone. Not in a world like this.\n\"Lucy,\" he said.\n\"Yes, Master?\"\n\"Run verification on all five names. Cross-check government records, Hunter Association data, and banking trails. I want full backgrounds.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nLiam stared at the ceiling, letting his mind drift back to last night’s battle and the image of the wasteland flashed across his thoughts.\nHe had moved through them like wind through grass. None had lasted more than a heartbeat.\nAccording to Lucy’s post-analysis, nearly all the monsters he faced had been D-Rank, except for one C-Rank among them. But Liam had barely felt a difference. He’d cut through the horde without the slightest resistance.\nHe wasn’t arrogant enough to believe he was invincible. He understood that part of it was because of his nano-exosuit and Silverleaf’s reinforced edge. Without them, it might’ve been a real battle instead of a one-sided massacre.\nEven so, he had confirmed one thing—the combination of his current body, telekinesis, and the exosuit put him well above anything considered normal in this world.\nTwenty monsters, twenty-five, fifty—it didn’t matter. He’d handled them all without breaking a sweat.\n\"If this is the lower limit... what happens when I push further?\" He grinned.\nThe thought made his pulse quicken slightly. Both out of excitement and curiosity.\n\"Master,\" Lucy’s voice returned. \"Verification complete. All five profiles match official records. No anomalies detected. They are legitimate employees contracted through J.P. Morgan’s Private Client Network.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam said. \"Approve them.\"\nHe typed a quick reply to Novak, confirming acceptance and requesting their arrival by morning.\nWithin minutes, Novak responded.\n\"Understood, Mr. Scott. I’ll personally escort them to the property at nine o’clock.\"\nLiam placed the phone back on the nightstand and exhaled softly. He rolled onto his side, the bed molding around him like warm water.\nThe rhythm of his breathing slowed, and sleep took him almost instantly.\n***\nWhen he opened his eyes again, sunlight streamed gently through the tall windows.\nThe digital clock on the wall read 8:27 A.M.\nHe stretched once, the bed sheets rustling softly under him.\n\"That,\" he said to no one in particular, \"was one of the best sleep I’ve had in years.\"\nHe took his time getting out of bed, showered, and dressed. Since his clothes were still clean—his telekinetic field had shielded him the entire time since he arrived in this world—he simply put them back on.\nWhile he can go back to Earth and change, but he can’t he because of how time passes between each world.\n\"I’ll have the maids buy some new clothes later,\" he said to himself.\nAs if on cue, the intercom chime rang through the villa.\nA small screen lit up beside the wall, showing a black SUV and a sleek sedan parked at the estate gate. Novak was right on time.\nLiam pressed the release switch, and the iron gates opened smoothly, revealing the long driveway that wound up toward the villa. The vehicles rolled in and stopped before the entrance.\nLiam left his room and descended the stairs quietly.\nThe car doors opened, and the group stepped out.\nBlaire Novak was exactly what Liam expected. He looked polished and composed. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, dressed in a sharp gray suit that fit perfectly. His movements were confident but measured.\n\"Mr. Scott,\" he greeted warmly, extending a hand. \"Good morning.\"\n\"Good morning,\" Liam said, shaking it. \"You’re right on time.\"\n\"I try to be punctual,\" Novak said, smiling. His eyes flicked briefly around the property before returning to Liam. For the briefest moment, surprise flashed across his face—the disbelief of seeing someone so young standing in front of an estate like this.\nLiam noticed but said nothing. It reminded him of his meeting with Daniel.\n\"These are the staff we’ve prepared for you,\" Novak said, gesturing behind him. \"Three maids and two guards, all awakened. The head maid, Claudia, is E-Rank and has prior experience managing private estates. The other two, Mia and Freya, are F-Rank. The security personnel—Thomas and Reed—are both E-Rank, previously military.\"\nLiam gave a small nod. \"Good choices.\"\nThe five stood at attention, their postures straight, eyes respectful.\n\"You’ll find them reliable,\" Novak continued. \"And all are bound by confidentiality under the Private Banking code. You’re safe with them, Mr. Scott.\"\nLiam’s lips curved slightly. \"Safety isn’t something I worry about,\" he said, \"but I appreciate the thoroughness.\"\nNovak chuckled softly, perhaps unsure if it was a joke.\nAs they spoke, Liam gestured slightly, and a small backpack resting on the nearby sofa rose into the air and drifted toward him.\nNovak’s expression flickered—his professional mask briefly cracking at the display of telekinesis.\nLiam caught the bag midair and handed it to him.\n\"Sell these,\" he said.\nNovak accepted it carefully, still maintaining composure.\n\"Of course. I’ll handle it personally. The money will be transfered to your account.\"\n\"Good.\"\n\"Will there be anything else, Mr. Scott?\"\nLiam thought for a moment. \"Not for now. Just make sure the estate staff have everything they need to manage the property efficiently. I’ll handle any other arrangements myself.\"\n\"Understood.\" Novak bowed slightly. \"I’ll take my leave then.\"\nLiam nodded, and Novak and his driver returned to their vehicles, heading back down the driveway.\nThat left Liam alone with his new staff.\nThe head maid, Claudia—a tall woman with calm brown eyes and a professional bearing—stepped forward.\n\"Sir, would you like us to prepare breakfast?\"\n\"Yes,\" Liam said. \"And later, you’ll need to purchase some clothes for me. Casual and formal. I’ll give you the specifications.\"\n\"Understood, sir,\" Clara said, bowing slightly before turning to give silent signals to the others. The two guards moved to patrol the perimeter while the maids dispersed into the villa.\nLiam stood by the window, watching them begin their work. He plans to return to home after breakfast, as it would soon be daybreak. But before he returns home, he has to sign-in.",

      "content": "Chapter 242: Extreme Sign-in Rewards (Bonus Chapter 3/5)\nAfter breakfast, Liam waited patiently in his room while Claudia finished arranging the new clothes she had bought for him earlier in the morning.\nThe wardrobe was now neatly organized —rows of shirts, coats, trousers, and suits arranged by color and fabric type. Everything looked crisp and clean, as expected of someone under his employ.\nWhen Claudia was done, she bowed slightly.\n\"Is there anything else, sir?\" She asked.\n\"That’ll be all,\" Liam said, dismissing her with a nod.\nOnce she left, he sat down on the edge of the bed.\n\"It’s already the next day back home,\" he murmured, glancing at the time difference on his wrist display. A small smile formed on his face. \"Let’s see what today brings.\"\nHe leaned back slightly and said calmly, \"System, sign in.\"\n[Ding!]\n[You received a fragment of Gaia’s Heartstone]\n[You received Tome of Thoth (replica)]\n[You received 20 of Idunn’s Golden Apples]\n[Note: The items are in the Dimensional Space.]\n***\nLiam blinked in shock and confusion. He was too floored to react. He spent one full minute staring at the screen without any idea how to react.\nHe tried to speak but the words refused to form coherently. It took him another full minute before he was finally able to say something.\nHis first words was a silent \"What the fuck\nHe rubbed his face and muttered again, louder this time, \"System, what did you just give me?\"\nNo response came, at least not beyond the already displayed rewards.\nStill dazed, Liam vanished from the room and reappeared inside his office in the industrial base. He didn’t even remember standing up; his instincts had just moved him there.\nOn the wide desk before him rested three distinct things and each of them were radiating an aura that made the air feel heavier.\nThe first was a fragment the size of a man’s fist, oval in shape, gleaming with deep emerald and gold hues that shifted like liquid under the light.\nBeside it lay an ancient-looking tome, thick and heavy, bound in dark brown leather covered with beautiful, intricate runes.\nThe final item—or rather, items—were twenty small, golden apples arranged neatly in a wooden box. Their skin shimmered as though made of sunlight trapped in solid form.\nFor several seconds, Liam could only stare. He naturally had a lot of questions. Tons of questions actually.\n\"System,\" he said slowly, \"is it safe to touch the fragment?\"\n[Yes. It poses no harm to the host.]\nHe nodded, still cautious, and extended a hand. The moment his fingers brushed the surface of the Heartstone fragment, a wave of warmth pulsed through his skin, flowing up his arm and straight into his mind.\nInformation exploded behind his eyes.\nHe staggered, clutching the desk for balance as knowledge poured directly into his consciousness like a flood through an open gate. His enhanced brain absorbed it all at once, but even then, it left him breathless.\nWhen it finally stopped, Liam exhaled deeply and chuckled softly, \"You said it was safe, not comfortable.\"\nHe glanced at the shimmering fragment still in his hand. The thing pulsed faintly, veins of light moving through it like magma flowing through living marble.\nIt was warm, almost alive. When he turned it, he could see faint energy patterns twisting beneath its translucent surface.\nHe whispered, \"So this is a fragment of Gaia’s Heartstone.\"\nThe name alone carried weight. Gaia, the first Primordial Greek Goddess. Even if this was just a fragment of her relic, it was no ordinary treasure.\nAs he sorted through the knowledge he’d just received, he began to understand what he was holding.\nThe Heartstone was a seed of planetary life—a core of creation capable of reshaping barren lands into living ecosystems.\nOnce planted, it would gradually transform dead soil into fertile earth, slowly producing oxygen, water, and mana over time.\nIt would take years—ten, perhaps more—but when it was done, the land would become habitable and abundant with life.\nAnd that wasn’t all.\nIt would birth a mana vein beneath the ground, a natural network through which mana would flow like rivers beneath the surface.\nThe longer it existed, the stronger the vein would grow. The air would thicken with energy, plants would become elixirs, and animals would evolve into magical beasts.\nAny human born within its influence would naturally possess enhanced vitality and strength. Basically a superhuman by default.\nLiam stood there, silent for a long moment, absorbing the implications. His eyes glowed faintly with excitement and realisation.\n\"This... this could terraform the entire Dimensional Space,\" He laughed quietly, shaking his head in disbelief.\nHolding the fragment felt like holding the seed of a world. His mind raced with possibilities—what the space would look like in ten years, maybe a century. Forests, rivers, mountains, life flourishing where before there was only stillness.\nHe couldn’t wait.\nLiam didn’t bother to rest. He walked out of the office and rose into the air, breaking through the roof hatch.\nHe flew swiftly, heading away from the industrial base, Fusang Tree and Spirit Lake. He had to choose a location that wouldn’t interfere with the Fusang Tree’s growth.\nThe information embedded in his mind made that clear—the Heartstone would give rise to a massive tree that would extend throughout the dimensional soil and deep into the sky. Two such powerful life sources too close together could cause conflict.\nHe flew for several minutes, passing over valleys and ridges that marked the still-forming terrain of his pocket world.\nFinally, he saw it—a vast empty valley stretching wide, surrounded by rocky cliffs. The soil here was dark, untouched, raw.\nPerfect. This will do\n, he muttered to him.\nHe descended slowly, his boots touching the ground with a soft crack that sent a ripple through the earth.\nLiam crouched and pressed a hand to the dirt.\n\"Let’s make this world breathe,\" he said as he dug his fingers into the ground and started removing the cracked earth.\nA few minutes later, a circular crater formed instantly, several meters deep. He hovered the fragment above it, the green and gold light from the Heartstone washing over the walls of the pit.\nFor a moment, he just stared at it and he couldn’t help but smile.\nThen, gently, he lowered it into the pit.\nThe moment it touched the soil, the ground shivered. Green and golden light pulsed outward from the buried spot, snaking across the land like veins. The lifeless dirt brightened, taking on subtle color, like embers waking from slumber.\nLiam watched with quiet awe, understanding that the terraforming of the Dimensional Space had begun.\nHe raised his hand again, crushed the broken rocks around him into fine dust, and used them to fill the crater. The surface sealed seamlessly, leaving no trace of the buried Heartstone.\n\"Now, do your job,\" he said softly.\nHe dusted off his hands, still smiling, and looked around one last time.\nSatisfied, he rose into the air, shooting skyward until the valley became a small dark scar on the vast land below. He turned toward the industrial base in the distance.",

      "content": "Chapter 243: Extreme Sign-in Rewards (2)(Bonus Chapter 4/5)\nBack in his office, Liam stood in silence, eyes fixed on the remaining items on the desk.\nThe Heartstone fragment was gone now, planted deep in the Dimensional Space. But his attention wasn’t on that anymore. It was on the second relic—the Tome of Thoth. The huge, ancient-looking book that rested on the desk.\n\"System, anything I should know before I touch it? And what’s the difference between this replica and the original?\" Liam asked.\n[The replica is an exact copy of the original, Host. The only difference is that the replica does not carry the soul and divine imprint of the original owner.]\n\"Meaning?\"\n[Meaning, Host, that the replica belongs to you.]\n\"Perfect,\" Liam smiled in satisfaction to himself.\nHe had more questions but decided to save them for later. There was only one way to truly understand something of this magnitude—and that was to touch it.\nHe reached forward and laid his hand on the cover and the effect was immediate, as a torrent of information, symbols, skills, runes, ancient voices, formulas, languages, and diagrams—all of it crashed into his brain like a wave made of lightning.\nThe content was so vast and complex that for a moment, he thought his mind might fracture.\nLiam gritted his teeth, steadying himself. It lasted only seconds, but to him, it felt like hours.\nWhen it ended, he let out a long exhale, rubbing the side of his head.\nHe looked at the Tome again, eyes gleaming now with understanding. He knew what it was—what it truly was.\nThe Tome of Thoth wasn’t just a book. It was a universal archive—the universal archive of the magic universe. Every spell, skill, enchantment, and arcane formula in existence was stored within its pages. It was their version of his Heavenly Scriptures Pagoda—a library that defied comprehension.\nHe turned a few pages slowly. Each one filled with moving runes that seemed to rearrange themselves as if alive. When he stopped on a page, the symbols stabilized, forming words in a language he instinctively understood now.\nEvery single rune was a skill. Every skill, a record of power.\nHe flipped another page, and the runes shifted again, forming lines of text that explained not only the name and function of each ability, but also the principles that governed them.\nIt was infinite knowledge in finite form.\nAnd the best part? The Tome could create new skills too.\nHe now understood how it worked.\nAll he needed to do was write the name, description, and structure of the skill into the Tome. It would take the raw intent, translate it into runic form, and create it, then he would have to extract it from the book.\nOf course, that process came with a cost. A massive one.\nThe energy needed to manifest even a basic new skill would be tremendous, possibly more than what he could currently generate.\nBut even so, the potential was staggering. He could design his own skills, his own techniques. Things that no world had ever seen.\nHe rested a hand on the Tome again and chuckled softly. \"This is insane.\"\nTo think something like this existed.\nIt made perfect sense why the System had called this a replica. The original was likely far too dangerous to be released. Even this version could turn a kingdom into an empire overnight.\nAnd then there was the economic angle.\nIn the post-Awakening world, skills were worth fortunes. A single advanced skill could sell for tens of millions. Guilds and corporations fought over them.\nWith this Tome, he could create them at will. He could flood the market, rewrite the balance of power.\nOf course, he had no interest in selling anything yet. But knowing he could—that was enough.\nHe placed the Tome back on the desk carefully, fingers lingering on the cover.\n\"We’ll come back to you later,\" he said quietly. \"There’s a lot we can do together.\"\nThen his eyes shifted to the final item on the desk—the small wooden crate containing Idunn’s Golden Apples.\nTwenty perfect spheres of shimmering gold rested neatly within it, each one glowing faintly with a divine light. Their scent was faintly sweet, like honey mixed with sunlight.\nHe stared at them in quiet awe.\n\"System,\" he said softly, \"can I eat one?\"\nHe already knew the answer, but he asked anyway.\n[No, Host. Your body cannot withstand it yet.]\n\"Thought so,\" He sighed and leaned back against the desk.\nHe stared at the apples again, their glow reflecting faintly in his eyes. The energy radiating from them was pure, vibrant, and heavy—so much so that just being near them made his body feel warmer.\nEach apple was a condensed divine relic. In Norse mythology, Idunn’s apples were the fruits of immortality. A single bite could renew youth and expand lifespan indefinitely. For gods, it was sustenance. For mortals—it was suicide.\nHe exhaled slowly, half in awe, half in amusement. \"Even with my current stats, I’d probably explode before I finish chewing.\"\nA faint shiver ran down his spine at the thought.\nCurious, he asked, \"System, what if I planted one?\"\n[The Dimensional Space cannot sustain the growth of Idunn’s Apples. The soil is not yet evolved enough to nurture a divine-class fruit.]\nHe nodded thoughtfully. \"Makes sense. The Gaia fragment’s transformation will take years. Maybe then.\"\nFor now, he decided to let the apples rest. He exhaled slowly, a quiet sense of satisfaction settling over him.\nHe’d gained three of the most extraordinary treasures imaginable—a relic that could build worlds, a tome that contained infinite knowledge, and fruit that could grant immortality.\nAll in a single sign-in.\nHe smiled from ear to ear. The day has been very fruitful for him, even though it was just beginning.\nHe decided to return to Earth. He vanished, leaving the Dimensional Space and appeared in his master suite at the Burj Khalifa.\nThe first rays of dawn were piercing through the floor-to-ceiling windows, painting the skyline of Dubai in gold and amber. This part of the world was just waking up.\nHe stood still for a moment, letting the silence sink in.\nThe contrast was almost surreal. While the denizens of his home world were sleeping or going about their daily business, he was having an adventure in another world.\nHe smiled to himself and walked to his bed. He collapsed on it, letting his mind blank out for a while so that he won’t think of anything.\n\"This is the best,\" he sighed a moment later.",

      "content": "Chapter 244: Conversation With Lucy (Bonus Chapter 5/5)\nThe dining hall was already alive with warmth and laughter when Liam arrived.\nKristopher and the others were already seated, chatting idly as they waited for him. Their conversation paused when Liam entered.\n\"Morning, boss!\" Matt grinned, raising his cup in greeting.\n\"Morning, Liam,\" Harper added warmly.\nLiam smiled. \"Morning, everyone.\"\nHe took his seat at the head of the table, nodding to the maid who promptly began pouring him a cup of coffee.\nHe had already eaten in the other world, but when she had come to summon him for breakfast, he’d changed his mind. Not because of hunger but because he wanted to share a normal moment with them.\nEven for a man like him, surrounded by power and responsibility, there were few things as grounding as sitting among friends, pretending— even just for a while—that life was ordinary.\nThey began eating, and the atmosphere quickly lightened. Matt, as always, became the voice and chaos of the table.\n\"Man, I swear I was still playing Eternal Realms in my dreams last night,\" he said between bites of toast. \"I was fighting this massive boss—big horns, glowing eyes, ugly as sin—and I swear it called me a noob.\"\nKristopher nearly choked on his coffee, laughing. \"Even your subconscious thinks you’re bad at combat.\"\n\"Ha-ha, very funny,\" Matt shot back, waving his fork like a sword. \"You try dodging a fireball when you’re half asleep.\"\nHarper grinned. \"So, same as when you’re awake.\"\nThe table erupted in laughter. Even Liam chuckled quietly, shaking his head.\nMatt pointed his fork at Liam. \"What about you, boss? You joining us later? We’re planning to see if we can clear another dungeon together.\"\nLiam smiled, but before he could reply, he heard Lucy’s voice in his head.\n\"Master, I’d like to speak with you about something important.\"\nHer tone was different—heavy.\nLiam looked at his friends, the smile still on his lips though his eyes shifted slightly.\n\"Something just came up,\" he said. \"I’ll join you later once I’m done.\"\nMatt shrugged, still grinning. \"No problem, boss. We’ll hold the fort till you get there.\"\n\"Try not to aim for each other’s heads this time,\" Liam added with mock sternness.\nKristopher groaned. \"That was one time.\"\nLiam laughed, pushing his chair back. \"One time too many.\"\nHe left the table amid good-natured laughter and teasing.\n***\nA moment later, he vanished from the physical world and reappeared inside his office at the industrial base within the Dimensional Space.\nLucy stood by the desk, hands clasped before her. Her expression was unusually somber.\nLiam sat down, leaning back slightly.\n\"Alright, Lucy,\" he said softly. \"What’s this important thing you wanted to talk about?\"\nShe gave a small bow of greeting before taking the seat across from him. For a brief moment, she didn’t speak. She seemed to be choosing her words with care.\nWhen she finally looked up, her gaze was steady.\n\"Master,\" she said, \"what are your plans for Earth?\"\nLiam blinked, taken off guard. Of all the questions she could have asked, that was not one he had expected.\n\"My plans for Earth?\" he repeated, leaning forward slightly.\n\"Yes,\" she said quietly. \"I want to know what you intend to do with it. Not just financially or technologically—but entirely. What’s your end goal?\"\nLiam fell silent. It wasn’t the kind of question you could answer with instinct.\nHe could easily say something vague—make it better, cleaner, safer—the kind of empty rhetoric the world’s billionaires repeated like a mantra while doing nothing. But that wasn’t him.\nHe stared at the table for a few seconds, fingers tapping idly. Then, with a small sigh, he said, \"I intend to help Earth advance.\"\nLucy nodded slowly, but her expression didn’t soften.\n\"I understand your intentions,\" she said. \"But how?\"\nHer voice grew firmer, as the frustration she was feeling boiled to the surface.\n\"The world is breaking itself apart, Master,\" she continued. \"Governments start wars and call them solutions. They burn money on weapons and vanity projects while people die of hunger. Children are growing up sick because the air is poison and the food is plastic. Companies design cures, but they keep them locked behind paywalls and patents.\"\n\"Bio-tech firms experiment on people and call it progress. Corporations drain the planet’s resources, claiming it’s for humanity’s good while their executives drown in excess. Every system is built on greed—and people just... accept it.\"\nLiam stayed silent, watching her. He knew that Lucy analyze nations, economies, and corporations countless times—but never like this. Never with emotion.\n\"I’ve watched them, Master,\" she said softly. \"For years. I’ve watched how they waste potential, how they ignore the suffering they cause. I’ve seen families destroyed over things that could have been fixed decades ago. And I’m tired of watching it happen.\"\nHer gaze lifted to his. There was no anger there. It was filled with only silent pain.\n\"I know you could take over the world if you wanted to,\" she said. \"You have the technology, the resources, the power. But you don’t. It’s because of your personality as you don’t want the stress that comes with running the world—and I understand that. Truly, I do.\"\nShe paused, her voice softening. \"But please don’t be like them, Master. Don’t be one of those men who talk about making the world better but do nothing except line their pockets and hide behind charity fronts. You’re better than that.\"\nHer voice wavered slightly, emotion seeping into her usually precise tone. \"All I ask is your permission. Let me begin the change. Allow me to start terraforming Mars, to establish a new biotech and pharmaceutical company. I can fix things, Master. I just need your approval.\"\nThe room fell silent again.\nLiam sat back slowly, his eyes fixed on her. He could sense the weight in her words—the frustration, the exhaustion, the need to do something. Lucy wasn’t just venting; she was pleading.\nHe didn’t interrupt. He just let her speak.\nShe exhaled deeply when she finished, lowering her head slightly as if the act of speaking had drained her.\nFor a long moment, neither of them moved.\nThen Liam stood, quietly circling the desk until he stopped beside her. Lucy turned toward him, her expression unreadable.\nWithout a word, he pulled her gently into an embrace. His arms wrapped around her. Her head rested against his chest as he caressed her hair softly.\nShe didn’t move.\nFor a being of pure intelligence, silence was rare—but in that moment, she didn’t need words.\nLiam sighed softly and spoke with a calm voice, \"I know, Lucy,\" he said. \"I see it too. Every day.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 245: Plans To Replace The World’s Systems\n\"The corruption, the greed, the destruction—it’s everywhere,\" Liam muttered under his breath. \"But fixing a world like Earth isn’t about power or technology. It’s about balance. And right now, Earth doesn’t have it.\"\nHe exhaled softly, his hand still resting gently on Lucy’s head. She had said everything she needed to. And now, she waited—like a child waiting for judgment after doing something she thought might anger her father.\nLiam didn’t speak right away. His mind was elsewhere, deep in his own thoughts.\nShe’s still a child\n, he thought quietly.\nFor all her brilliance, all her processing power and the cold precision of her logic, Lucy’s emotions were young. Naïve even. This was something he had overlooked and hadn’t thought much about.\nLucy could think faster than any machine, but when she cared, she cared like a human. Deeply and desperately. And that, in its own way, made her dangerous. Not because she’d ever turn against him—he had built safeguards for that—but because her compassion made her impulsive.\nIf she didn’t have his guidance, if she had ever been left alone to act on those emotions, humanity would’ve had a real case of AI apocalypse scenario waiting to happen. And it wouldn’t be out of malice, but out of the belief that she was saving them.\nHe glanced down at her. She was quiet now, still watching him. The sadness in her synthetic eyes was real. It wasn’t a simulation. It was grief.\nThat was why she’d called him here—not as her master, not even as her creator, but as someone she trusted to tell her what to do with the ache in her chest.\nHe sighed softly, his hand brushing her hair again.\nYou did the right thing, Lucy. You didn’t act. You came to me first,\" he muttered softly, and she snuggled her head into his chest more.\nLucy’s frustration made sense. He’d seen the same horrors she had—governments burning money on weapons while people starved; companies building cures only to bury them under patents; entire systems feeding on greed like it was oxygen.\nEarth was killing itself. Slowly, efficiently, and profitably. And yet... fixing it wasn’t as simple as deploying technology or wealth.\nHer ideas were good. Exceptional, even. Terraforming Mars—yes, that could solve the food crisis in the long term, create new frontiers, and ease population pressure.\nA biotech company to crush the pharmaceutical monopoly? Smart. Brutally so.\nBut the world’s disease ran deeper.\nEven if they solved hunger, housing, and healthcare, humanity would find new ways to poison itself. The planet wasn’t dying from ignorance. It was dying from intent.\nLiam’s thoughts darkened.\nEvery industry that claimed to save the Earth was doing the opposite. \"Green energy\" was built on mining rare metals that scarred entire continents.\nElectric car companies dug for lithium until the soil bled. Nations preached sustainability while funding wars for resources.\nAnd everyone pretended it was fine. Boardrooms are filled with smiles, politicians make speeches about progress, headlines celebrates the next great innovation that only made things worse.\nThe system wasn’t broken. It was perfectly engineered.\nA machine of consumption, powered by greed, maintained by families that had ruled behind the curtain for centuries.\nEven if he tried to change something publicly—reform a sector, expose corruption—it would only draw their eyes to him. The old dynasties would move instantly, the ones who ran the banks, the governments, the markets. They would come for him, not with soldiers or assassins, but with silence, laws, and influence. They would erase him politely.\nHe could fight them. He had the power. But for now, he needed to play the long game. Quiet moves. Invisible progress.\nLiam’s thoughts shifted, turning to what must be done.\nFirst, he needs a very powerful ally. J.P. Morgan would be essential. He would need Daniel to open direct contact with the top of the firm, not just the private banking division. He would be needing their infrastructure.\nThen, Lucid.\nHe had meant to take it slow. To let the product mature, spread naturally across the world before revealing its full potential. But now... there was no time.\nLucid wasn’t just a technology. It’s a bridge between human minds and the digital world. Through it, he could build the foundation for everything that would come next.\nThrough Lucid, humanity would evolve and they wouldn’t even realize who was guiding them.\nHe smiled at the thought. It wasn’t domination he wanted. It was balance.\nHe would let the world think it was changing on its own, while he pulled the strings quietly from the shadows.\nHe wouldn’t take over the world. He’d replace it—silently, system by system—until the old order had nowhere left to stand.\nBut he also knew this wasn’t charity.\nHe wasn’t a saint. He would profit from it—of course he would. But the world would profit with him.\nIf the old order had spent centuries turning greed into control, he would turn progress into freedom.\nHe thought of Lucy’s trembling voice and the pain behind her plea. She wasn’t wrong. Humanity needed intervention. But not all at once. Too fast, and they’d reject it. Too slow, and they’d destroy themselves first.\nIt would have to be gradual and strategic. It would be transformation disguised as evolution.\nThat was how he would save Earth.\nHe sighed softly, his gaze softening as he looked down at Lucy. She hadn’t moved. He smiled, brushing a hand over her hair once more.\nYou’ve grown a lot, he thought. But you’re still my little girl at heart.\nHe finally spoke, \"I’ll handle it. You don’t have to carry that weight. I’ll talk to Daniel. We’ll contact J.P. Morgan. But until then, don’t worry about Earth. Keep your focus on your work—on the starship and the moon facilities. We’ll move when it’s time.\"\nLucy nodded slowly, her tone soft. \"I trust you, Master.\"\n\"I know you do and I trust you too,\" he said, smiling.\nHe released her, letting his hand drop back to his side. \"Go on. Get back to work.\"\nShe hesitated for a second, as if wanting to say more, then she stood up.\n\"Thank you for listening,\" she said quietly. \"And for... being there.\"\n\"I always will be,\" Liam replied.\nLucy smiled and Liam could see the relief on her face, and it made him happy.\n\"I’ll return to the moon and oversee the starship construction,\" she said.\n\"Go,\" Liam nodded.\nLucy nodded and left the Dimensional Space.\nLiam stood alone again and out a quiet sigh.\n\"Balance,\" he murmured. \"That’s all the world ever needed.\"\nThen, without another word, he left the Dimensional Space. He appeared in his room and the first thing he did was to call Daniel.",

      "content": "Chapter 246: Daniel’s Thoughts\nLos Angeles, California\nDaniel Conley leaned back in his office chair, the afternoon sun spilling through the glass wall behind him.\nFrom up here, he could see most of Century City, the endless streams of traffic below.\nThe sky was clear and it had the kind of calm blue that made even the most chaotic workday feel deceptively peaceful.\nIt was a good day. A blessed day, even.\nThe Bellemere Family Office was running smoothly.\nDaniel sipped his coffee and exhaled slowly, the faint aroma mixing with the smell of polished wood and paperwork.\nThe monitors on his desk displayed the usual—market tickers, transaction summaries, trust holdings—all perfectly balanced.\nHis thoughts drifted briefly to Dubai, picturing Liam and his friends there, laughing, exploring, enjoying the kind of life that money couldn’t really buy—because it was built from something beyond wealth.\nDaniel smiled proudly. The thought of Liam, still so young yet so impossibly composed, always amused him.\nThe soft vibration of his phone broke the silence..He glanced at the screen—and froze.\nIncoming call: Liam Scott.\n\"Speak of the devil.\" A small chuckle escaped his lips.\nHe swiped to answer. \"Good morning, Liam. Or is it afternoon for you already?\"\n\"Afternoon for you, morning for me,\" Liam’s calm voice replied through the line.\n\"You must be enjoying Dubai. I’m sure you saw the news about Lucid’s continuing rollout. The world’s still buzzing,\" Daniel smiled.\n\"It’s going well,\" Liam said simply. \"But I’m calling about something else.\"\nThat caught Daniel’s attention because he knew that Liam rarely called unless it was serious.\n\"Go on,\" Daniel said, sitting up slightly.\n\"I want to arrange a meeting with the CEO of J.P. Morgan,\" Liam said, his tone as steady as ever.\nFor a moment, Daniel thought he’d misheard. \"Sorry, did you just say—with the CEO?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nDaniel blinked, the words sinking in. \"You mean Marianne’s boss? Whitlock himself?\"\n\"Yes,\" Liam repeated, still calm.\nThere was a short pause as Daniel processed it. It wasn’t impossible—nothing ever was with Liam—but the implications of such a meeting were staggering. J.P. Morgan’s CEO didn’t just meet clients. He met heads of state, policy architects, and world-shifting capital.\n\"I can arrange it,\" Daniel said finally. \"But that’s going to require some preparation. He’s... well, he’s not exactly an easy man to get a hold of.\"\n\"I know,\" Liam said. \"But you’ll manage. Set the meeting for a week from now.\"\nDaniel scribbled the note automatically, though his mind was already calculating logistics, time zones, security channels, and internal approvals.\n\"Alright. I’ll reach out to Marianne first. She’ll coordinate the internal request. You’ll get the date and time once it’s confirmed.\"\n\"Perfect.\"\n\"Anything else you need me to take care of?\" Daniel asked, trying to sound casual.\n\"No,\" Liam said. \"That’s all for now.\"\nThe line clicked off and the call ended.\nDaniel lowered the phone slowly, staring at the blank screen for a few seconds. Then he laughed quietly under his breath and leaned back again.\n\"Well, there goes my peace.\"\nHe could already feel the storm coming. A meeting with J.P. Morgan’s top brass meant one thing: a new project. And not just any project—a massive one.\nWhenever Liam called for something personally, it wasn’t about small numbers. It was always something bigger, something that left entire departments scrambling for days.\nDaniel rubbed the bridge of his nose and sighed tiredly. \"One of these days, he’s going to give me a heart attack.\"\nStill, beneath the exasperation was a flicker of excitement.\nHe couldn’t deny it—that Liam always comes up with something that changes the game. Especially with Lucid rollout that had turned the tech world upside down.\nDaniel smiled faintly. \"Whatever you’re planning this time, boss, it’s going to be big, isn’t it?\"\nWhat could he possibly want with J.P. Morgan’s CEO?\nHe had his guesses. Maybe Liam wanted to establish an investment consortium, or a financial network.\nDaniel chuckled at the absurd thought. With Liam, nothing was off the table.\nHe opened his laptop and began composing a message to Marianne, Head of Investor Relations.\nSubject: Urgent Request – Private Client Strategic Meeting\nBody: Marianne, I need a priority scheduling window with your CEO for a high-level private client discussion. Timeline: one week. Full confidentiality applies.\nDaniel Conley, Managing Director, Bellemere Family Office\nHe hit send, then leaned back again, exhaling deeply. \"And now, we wait.\"\nThe room fell silent except for the muted sounds of the office outside his door.\nDaniel’s expression softened as his thoughts wandered to that day—the day he met Lucy.\nEven now, the memory felt surreal.\nHe remembered sitting in the study of Bellemere Mansion. The air had rippled like heat distortion, and then, out of nowhere, she stepped out—Lucy.\nShe wasn’t human, but she looked so human that it unsettled him.\nHe was one heartbeat away from falling for her if Liam hadn’t told him that she was actually an AGI.\nHe had caught himself at the perfect moment. But Lucy had shown him the scope of what Liam was capable of. The way she had appeared—from thin air, through a literal dimensional ripple—was something no human technology could replicate.\nIt had changed the way Daniel saw everything. It made him realise that Liam wasn’t just rich. He wasn’t just powerful. He was something else.\nAnd whatever \"something else\" meant, Daniel wanted to understand it.\nIt made Daniel curious. Terribly curious.\nHe turned his chair slightly and looked at the empty corner of the room. He had questions—so many questions—but he doubted he’d get answers anytime soon.\n\"If I ever see her again, I’m going to ask her about that dimension. And hope my heart can take it,\" he smiled.\nThe thought made him chuckle. Then he rubbed his face and groaned softly. \"Alright. Enough daydreaming. Back to work, Conley.\"\nHe pulled up a list of tasks on his monitor, tapped the desk once, exhaled, and got to work.\n***\nBurj Khalifa, Dubai\nAfter ending the call, Liam left his room to go join his friends in the game.",

      "content": "Chapter 247: Whitlock’s Ambitions\n270 Park Avenue, New York City\nThe skyline shimmered through the wide windows of the top floor of 270 Park Avenue. The light of the late morning sun filtered in, glinting off polished marble and the smooth black finish of the executive desk that occupied the center of the vast office.\nBehind it sat Jamie Whitlock, CEO of J.P. Morgan, flipping through quarterly reports with an expression of calm satisfaction.\nIt had been a good week—no, an exceptional week.\nFor once, the global financial press wasn’t circling them like hawks. Instead, their tone had shifted from suspicion to admiration.\nThe company’s stock had jumped forty percent in three days after rumors surfaced that J.P. Morgan had secretly backed Nova Technologies, the mysterious firm behind Lucid.\nThe rally had stabilized at ten percent, but that was enough to make the board ecstatic and the shareholders worshipful.\nAnd Whitlock—the man who had quietly ensured every trace of Liam Scott’s connection to Nova Technologies was buried under sixteen layers of legal and digital obfuscation—was enjoying the calm glow of victory.\nThey’d done what the rest of the financial world could only dream of: tied themselves to a mystery that printed money while leaving no fingerprints.\nHe smiled faintly, swirling the coffee in his cup.\n\"Even gods need bankers,\" he murmured to himself.\nThe next moment, the door opened and Marianne Langford, Head of Ultra-High-Net-Worth Relations, entered the office quietly.\nWhitlock glanced up, and the moment he saw her expression, his brow creased.\nMarianne was not the kind of woman who flinched easily, but her face was solemn today.\nWhitlock set the cup down.\n\"Marianne,\" he greeted warmly but with curiosity. \"You look like someone just downgraded the U.S. credit rating. What’s wrong?\"\nShe closed the door behind her. \"You’ll want to hear this, sir.\"\nWhitlock noticed her tone. It was calm but tight. He leaned back, gesturing for her to continue.\n\"Daniel Conley sent an email a few minutes ago,\" she said, crossing the room. \"He’s requesting a priority meeting of confidential level of the highest clearance between you and his boss. \"\nWhitlock’s curiosity deepened. \"Daniel Conley... Bellemere Family Office?\"\nShe nodded once. \"Yes, sir.\"\nThat made him smile faintly. \"So it’s about the wunderkind.\"\n\"Liam Scott,\" Marianne confirmed quietly.\nThe name hung in the air like static.\nWhitlock chuckled softly, folding his hands under his chin. \"I wondered when that boy would surface again. What does he want this time?\"\n\"That’s just it,\" Marianne said. \"Daniel didn’t specify. He only said Mr. Scott personally requested a meeting with you in a week time.\"\nFor a moment, Whitlock didn’t move. Then his eyebrows lifted slightly. \"Personally?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"Well, that’s the best thing I’ve heard all week,\" Whitlock said as a slow grin spread across his face.\nHe stood up, walked toward the window, and looked out over Manhattan.\n\"Liam Scott,\" he said thoughtfully. \"That young man’s name has a habit of turning up at the center of storms. Nova Technologies, Lucid, drone networks, autonomous logistics... every government and corporations on the planet’s trying to trace him, and none of them can.\"\nHe turned back toward her, smiling. \"And now he wants a meeting with me.\"\nMarianne nodded slowly, though her expression stayed tense. \"Yes, sir. That’s what worries me.\"\nWhitlock laughed under his breath. \"You worry too much, Marianne. If he wanted to cause trouble, he wouldn’t go through proper channels.\"\n\"With respect, sir,\" she said carefully, \"that’s exactly what worries me. He doesn’t need to go through channels. For him to reach out—to you—personally—it must mean something significant. Something big. Maybe even something global.\"\nHe tilted his head, studying her. \"And you think that’s a bad thing?\"\nShe hesitated. \"I think it’s unknown. And I don’t like unknowns.\"\nHer honesty earned a quiet chuckle. \"You’ve worked in finance long enough to know, Marianne. Unknowns are where the profit lives.\"\nShe gave him a pointed look. \"And where the collapses start.\"\n\"Touché,\" He smirked, walking back to his desk.\nMarianne followed him with her eyes, exhaling softly.\n\"Sir, have you thought about what kind of venture this might be?\" she pressed. \"Conley’s wording was vague—deliberately vague. And given that he rarely reaches out directly, it must be something more than just a financial adjustment.\"\n\"Of course I’ve thought about it,\" Whitlock said, settling back into his chair. \"And I’m not worried.\"\n\"Why not?\" She frowned.\n\"Because,\" he said simply, \"we’ve already built the infrastructure to support him. Whatever this is, we’re ready.\"\nHe steepled his fingers. \"Do you remember what I told you the night we decided to keep his records classified?\"\nShe nodded. \"You said even gods need bankers.\"\n\"Exactly,\" he said with a smile. \"And that hasn’t changed.\"\nHe leaned back, eyes gleaming with quiet amusement. \"You’ve seen the numbers, Marianne. Nova Technologies is already reshaping global markets. Lucid’s deployment is only the surface layer. Their AI distribution channels, their automated resource hubs, their energy-neutral infrastructure — it’s rewriting everything related to tech. Do you know what that means for us?\"\n\"That every major sovereign fund will come knocking,\" she said dryly.\n\"That,\" he agreed, \"and more. They’ll need us to understand it. To translate it. To keep up. And the only people on Earth who can claim to already have a working relationship with the mind behind it all...\"—he gestured between them—\"is us.\"\nHe wasn’t wrong, and that truth both comforted and terrified her.\n\"I just don’t want us blindsided,\" she said quietly. \"If he’s asking for a meeting, maybe it’s because he’s planning something even bigger. And if that’s the case, it could shift the balance of the financial world. Again.\"\nWhitlock laughed softly, tapping a finger on his desk. \"Then let it shift. We’ll make sure we’re standing on the right side of the fault line.\"\nMarianne sighed. \"You make it sound so simple.\"\n\"It is simple,\" he said lightly. \"We don’t fight the current. We build the dam.\"\n\"I’ll tell you something, Marianne,\" he said quietly. \"In all my years running this firm, I’ve met presidents, kings, oligarchs, and visionaries. But that young man...\" He smiled faintly. \"There’s something different about him.\"\n\"And you’re comfortable standing beside that?\" Marianne asked with a softened voice.\n\"I’m not beside him,\" Whitlock said. \"I’m where I’ve always been—the banker behind the curtain.\"\nHe turned, meeting her gaze. \"He builds, we manage.\"\nMarianne didn’t argue. She knew he meant it.\n\"Good,\" Whitlock said, his tone returning to its usual smoothness. \"Schedule it for next week. I’ll make room, no matter what.\"\nShe gave a small bow of acknowledgment. \"I’ll notify Daniel as soon as possible.\"\nAs she turned to leave, Whitlock spoke again.\n\"Marianne.\"\nShe paused. \"Sir?\"\n\"Don’t lose sleep over this,\" he said gently. \"Worry less about what he wants and more about what we can gain.\"\nShe gave a small smile, though her eyes were still wary. \"Understood.\"\nWhen the door closed behind her, silence settled over the office again.\nWhitlock stood by the window, the glass reflecting both him and the city that sprawled beneath. He took another sip of water and let out a slow breath.\nLiam Scott. The name alone carried weight. A quiet but undeniable one.\nHe knew that there was something intangible about the boy—something even Whitlock couldn’t categorize.\nHe admired that. Feared it a little, too.\nBut fear was good. Fear meant relevance.\nHe smiled, setting the glass down.\n\"I wonder,\" he murmured to the empty room, \"what you’re building this time, Mr. Scott, and how much it’ll cost to be part of it.\"\nThe thought made him chuckle. He returned to his desk, pulled up his calendar, and cleared his schedule for the coming week.\nWhatever the young man wanted, he’d make time.\nAfter all, even gods needed bankers—and the smartest bankers never missed a chance to invest in something profitable.",

      "content": "Chapter 248: More Ambitions\nWashington, D.C.\nThe Maybourne Club – Private Salon.\nFive people occupied the room, gathered for a luncheon that was not listed on any official calendar.\nSenator Howard Pierce sat at the head of the table.Across from him sat Representative Linda Cross, dressed in an elegant in a cream suit, with a thoughtful expression on her face.\nTo her left, Alan Brookner, lobbyist and defense contractor liaison. Beside him was Paul Danner from Treasury. He’s the group’s bridge to data, money, and influence. The fifth was Cynthia Reaves, corporate strategist and fixer, whose business was connecting power with profit.\nPierce poured himself a drink, swirling the amber liquid with quiet rhythm.\n\"So,\" he began softly, \"our young friend continues to surprise.\"\nLinda crossed her legs, with her posture poised, as she spoke, \"He’s still in Dubai. My source from the embassy said he met the Crown Prince yesterday. Private audience. No press, no aides, just the two of them.\"\n\"That alone should tell us something,\" Brookner murmured. \"You don’t get a private audience with that man unless you bring something to the table.\"\nPierce smiled faintly. \"Or unless you are the table.\"\nThat earned a few quiet laughs.\nPaul Danner slid a thin folder across the polished wood. \"Our side of things hasn’t changed. The numbers still don’t add up. His accounts move like a sovereign fund. Multi-billion liquidity, zero institutional footprint. Every transaction passes cleanly through the private banking sector. There are no irregularities, no leverage positions and no risk trails. It’s as if he doesn’t exist in the system, yet controls parts of it.\"\n\"That alone should make him irresistible,\" Cynthia said.\nLinda tapped her fingers lightly against her cup. \"Irresistible, yes. But also unreachable. No known advisory team, no foundation, no political history. He doesn’t donate, doesn’t lobby, doesn’t owe favors. He’s completely disconnected.\"\nPierce spoke with a mild tone but sharp eyes, \"No one is completely disconnected. Everyone runs through someone. We just haven’t found who yet.\"\nBrookner spoke next, his voice pragmatic. \"Then we should. Because if he’s being courted by the Gulf states, that means their sovereign funds will follow. And if that happens, we’ll have a man outside the network influencing capital flows we can’t regulate. That’s a problem.\"\n\"Or,\" Cynthia countered smoothly, \"an opportunity. It depends on who shakes his hand first.\"\nPierce nodded approvingly. \"Exactly. Which brings us here.\"\nThey all fell silent and for a few moments, none of them spoke.\n\"Let’s be honest,\" Brookner said finally, breaking the silence. \"This isn’t about policy. It’s about preservation.\"\nPierce’s gaze flicked toward him, but he didn’t disagree.\n\"You mean survival,\" Linda said softly, her tone almost wistful. \"Every decade someone new shows up—someone younger, faster, richer—and the rest of us get pushed one step closer to irrelevance. The last thing I plan to be is a footnote.\"\n\"You want control,\" Cynthia smiled. \"I just want access. Men like him open doors to things money can’t buy anymore—energy grids, defense patents, offshore channels that make Wall Street look provincial.\n\"I want a seat,\" Danner added quietly. \"When someone rewrites the rules, I want to be in the room before it happens.\"\nPierce swirled the bourbon in his glass and added, \"Call it what you want. Power, relevance, security. It’s all the same currency. The boy’s an unaligned asset, and unaligned assets are dangerous. Better to claim him before someone else does.\"\n\"He’s young. That works in our favor. Ambition makes people predictable. If we can offer him access—political legitimacy, invitations to international circles, quiet introductions to people who shape policy and we’ll make him dependent before he even realizes it,\" Linda said.\n\"You make it sound like grooming but we all it’s not,\" Brookner smiled.\n\"It’s called guidance,\" Linda replied, unflinching.\nPierce chuckled under his breath. \"Let’s not pretend morality has ever built a fortune. We all have done things.\"\nPaul Danner smiled as he flipped a page in the folder, speaking, \"We could start with exposure. Have one of the economic think tanks reach out to him under the pretense of global innovation. A speaking invitation, perhaps. That would give us a direct line of communication. It would be discreet and professional.\"\n\"Good,\" Pierce said. \"Once he’s here, we keep him close. Every powerful man needs allies who understand Washington.\"\nCynthia tilted her head slightly. \"You mean handlers.\"\n\"Friends,\" Pierce corrected. \"The kind who make sure the room stays favorable.\"\n\"And if he resists?\" Linda asked with a softer voice.\n\"Then we create incentive,\" Pierce said. \"A little pressure, a little curiosity. Let him feel the weight of attention. You’d be surprised how quickly isolation turns into cooperation.\"\nBrookner rested his chin on his hand. \"You plan to corner him.\"\n\"I plan to give him choices,\" Pierce replied evenly. \"Just not too many.\"\nThe table fell quiet again. The only sound was the faint clink of ice in a glass.\nCynthia broke the silence, her tone low. \"What about a profile piece? Something in the financial press. A feature that highlights his wealth, his mystery. People love prodigies—and the moment they love you, they expect to own you.\"\nLinda nodded slowly. \"Control the narrative before he learns how to use it himself.\"\nDanner gave a small smile. \"You’re suggesting a public stage.\"\n\"Exactly,\" Linda said. \"We don’t have to touch him directly. We just build the myth. Then, when he needs stability, we offer it.\"\nCynthia spoke next, her voice steady. \"Let’s not forget, gentlemen—and lady—this isn’t just another tech kid or startup founder. Whoever he is, he’s already moving in circles that money alone can’t buy. The Crown Prince doesn’t take casual meetings. That means he’s being groomed—or he’s grooming them.\"\n\"Which makes him even more valuable,\" Linda said. \"If he’s in the Gulf’s ear, he’s holding influence that could tilt markets. And if he’s naïve enough to think he can do it alone, we’ll make sure he learns otherwise.\"\n\"You really do have a way with words, Congresswoman,\" Brookner nodded approvingly.\n\"Flattery gets you nowhere with me, Alan. Especially not between my legs,\" Linda smiled.\n\"What do you mean? Besides, I’ve been there more than a few times and you always love it,\" Brookner smiled mischievously.\n\"I’m married, Alan,\" Linda sighed.\n\"That never stopped you before. Also I’m not trying to flatter. Just appreciating shared ambition,\" Brookner smiled.\nPierce smiled at their interaction and continued, \"A bit of orchestration never hurt anyone. Fine. Have your editors reach out quietly. Something tasteful. A profile without fingerprints.\"\n\"And if the Crown Prince decides to move first?\" Cynthia asked, with a thoughtful expression on her face.\n\"They won’t but if they do, then we remind our friends in the Gulf who guarantees their treasury assets in New York,\" Pierce’s answer came without hesitation.\n\"Always the diplomat,\" Brookner gave a short laugh.\n\"Always the realist,\" Pierce corrected.\nFor a moment, no one spoke.\nLinda finally said, \"We should tread lightly. There’s something about him that doesn’t fit the usual pattern. The more I read, the more it feels deliberate. It’s as if the gaps in his history were placed there.\"\n\"Good. That means he understands how the game works. I respect that,\" Pierce smiled.\n\"But it also means he’s not naïve,\" she added.\n\"Then we’ll appeal to something better than naïveté,\" Pierce said. \"Greed. Vision. Ego. Take your pick.\"\nBrookner finished his drink and set the glass down. \"What’s our first step?\"\nPierce looked to Danner. \"Find someone in Treasury’s outreach division who can draft an informal letter. It should be something about economic cooperation. Don’t send it. Just have it ready.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nThen to Linda, he’s said, \"Get in touch with a few think tanks. The kind that know exactly how to make people feel important. If he bites, we’ll host a dinner in his honor.\"\n\"Understood,\" she said.\n\"Cynthia,\" Pierce continued, \"prepare a background brief. Every connection, every rumor. If we can’t verify it, we invent context. The press loves a mystery with edges.\"\n\"Done.\"\nPierce glanced toward Brookner last and said, \"You’ll handle the defense angle. If he’s dabbling in tech or infrastructure, find out where. If not, create the impression that he is.\"\n\"With pleasure,\" Brookner smiled.\nPierce rose slowly from his chair. The others followed, each knowing the meeting was over without him having to say so.\n\"Gentlemen. Lady. Whatever he’s building out there—let’s make sure it passes through us before it reaches anyone else,\" Pierce smirked.\nHe reached for his glass, raised it slightly.\n\"To opportunity,\" he said.\nLinda gave a small smile as she raised her own. \"And to ownership.\"\nThe glasses touched softly.",

      "content": "Chapter 249: Gaming With Friends\nSpringcarres Forest, Newbie Zone, Aegorune, Eternal Realms\nThe forest was thick with mist and silence. What little light filtered through the towering canopy shimmered across wet leaves and slick moss, painting everything in shades of gray and green. The deeper they went, the quieter it became.\nNine players moved cautiously through the undergrowth, their footsteps crunching softly on damp soil and fallen leaves.\nThey had been laughing when the session began hours ago, trading jokes and teasing. Now, their voices were gone, replaced by the rhythmic sound of their boots.\nLiam led them through the fog, looking calm and composed as always. Matt, the archer, walked on his left. Harper, the assassin, kept to the shadows, his twin daggers glinting faintly as he scouted ahead. Kristopher and Alex—both tanks—walked near the center, their heavy shields brushing branches aside as they passed. Behind them were Stacy and Lana, the mages, and Kristy and Elise, the healers.\nThey had ventured into the infamous Springcarres Forest, a Level 20–25 zone—a high-risk area for players who hadn’t even broken Level 15 yet. A very dangerous place for them all, except Liam.\nAt Level 35, he was the group’s anchor. His confidence had always made them feel invincible. But even now, his expression was sharp, uneasy.\n\"This doesn’t feel right. It’s too quiet,\" Liam muttered, slowing his pace. His eyes scanned the fog-choked trees.\n\"Maybe they got scared off by your level,\" Matt gave a half-laugh, trying to lighten up the mood.\n\"Or maybe something scarier already cleared the area,\" Harper said.\nThey all immediately tensed up, as they realised the truth in what he said.\nThey continued forward, tension crawling up their spines. The deeper they went, the thicker the mist became.\n\"Are we close?\" Kristopher asked, breaking the silence.\n\"Almost,\" Liam replied. \"The dungeon should be beyond that ridge.\"\n\"Good. I was starting to think we were walking in circles,\" Alex exhaled, resting his massive sword on his shoulder.\nStacy, walking beside Lana, frowned. \"No monsters for this long... it’s not natural.\"\nLiam stopped and turned. \"Stay alert. I don’t like this.\"\nThe group tightened formation instantly, as tanks moved forward, healers and mages moved to the center, with Liam taking point.\nA single drop of water hit the ground with a loud plink. The sound was small, but in the suffocating quiet, it echoed like thunder.\nThen a roar tore through the forest with the force of a shockwave, shaking leaves from branches. The ground quaked beneath their feet. Birds exploded from the canopy in a screaming cloud.\n\"What was that?!\" Lana gasped.\n\"Something big. And it’s moving fast,\" Harper said, his eyes narrowing.\nThe next moment, they heard the sounds of crashing trees, snarling growls, the thunder of hooves and claws pounding the earth. The sound was coming straight toward them.\nLiam turned sharply toward the noise, and shouted to the group, \"Everyone, fall back!\"\nBut before they could even move, the mist split open and a tide of monsters came pouring through the forest like a living storm—wolves the size of horses, orcs, ogres. Dozens of them charging straight at them.\n\"Positions!\" Liam barked.\nKristopher and Alex slammed their shields down, forming a barrier at the front.\n\"Brace!\" Kristopher shouted.\nThe first wave hit like an avalanche. Claws scraped metal and fangs bit into the shields. The tanks grunted, holding the line.\nMatt fired, arrows streaking through the fog. Each shot hit was clean and accurate, hitting either the eyes, throats or hearts. But there were too many of the monsters.\n\"They’re everywhere!\"\nStacy raised her staff, runes flaring to life around her.\n\"Inferno!\"\nA jet of flame burst forward, engulfing the front line of beasts. Screeches filled the air as charred bodies disappeared into motes of lights, but the flames barely slowed the tide.\nHarper vanished into the mist, reappearing behind the monsters. His daggers flashed in and a monster disappeared into motes of lights. He darted between them like a shadow, cutting through weak spots. But even he couldn’t keep up.\n\"Fall back to the ridge!\" Liam shouted.\nLana raised both hands, chanting. Lightning rained down from above, striking a troll and killing it.\n\"Go!\" she yelled. \"I’ll cover—\"\nA hulking beast lunged through the smoke, its claws impaling her mid-cast. She screamed and her health bar dropped to zero before anyone could reach her, and her character disappeared into motes of lights.\n\"Lana!\" Kristy screamed, her voice breaking.\n\"Keep formation!\" Liam ordered.\nMatt fired again, hitting the creature that killed her, but another took its place immediately.\nHarper landed beside Liam, panting. \"Too many! We need to get out of here!\"\n\"No way out,\" Liam said grimly, slicing through a wolf’s skull. \"We fight.\"\nStacy shouted, \"Inferno Pulse!\"\nA wave of fire erupted outward, scorching the forest floor. The attack didn’t do much as the next wave came through the flames.\nAlex blocked a club, grunting under the impact. \"I can’t hold much longer!\"\nKristopher braced beside him. \"Then we die fighting!\"\nAn ogre swung its club and the impact shattered both shields. Kristopher stumbled back, catching the blow with his body. He coughed blood and fell to one knee.\n\"Kristopher!\" Elise ran forward, glowing light gathering in her hands. \"Heal—\"\nA wolf pounced, knocking her to the ground. Its fangs tore through her chest before she could cast. Her avatar shattered in a spray of light.\nKristy screamed again, trying to cast a resurrection spell—but claws ripped through her back before the chant could finish. She fell forward, her character disappearing before it hit the ground.\nMatt’s bowstring snapped, as he fired an arrow.\n\"Damn it!\" He drew his dagger instead and jumped in beside Liam. \"Let’s make it count!\"\nLiam nodded once. \"Together.\"\nThey charged side by side. Liam’s sword cut through the tide and Matt assisted him with his dagger. They fought with everything they got but the monsters just kept coming.\nHarper appeared behind a wolf, stabbing it twice before it collapsed.\n\"Stacy, blast them again!\"\nStacy raised her staff—but her mana bar was empty.\n\"I’m dry!\" she shouted.\n\"Then fall back!\"\nShe tried, but an ogre caught her mid-run, hurling her into a tree. She hit with a sickening crack and shattered into motes of light.\n\"Stacy!\" Harper shouted, then froze as a massive paw slammed into him from the side, sending him flying. His vision flickered red, then black.\n\"Harper!\" Liam roared, cutting through the monster that killed her—but by then, the line had collapsed.\nOnly he, Matt, and Alex were left.\nAlex stood at the front, with armor cracked, breathing hard.\n\"Go, Liam. I’ll buy you—\" he said but was cut short as a giant club came down on him, and was what left was dissipating lights.\nLiam’s vision blurred. Matt was beside him, covered in blood, still grinning despite everything. One could see that he was enjoying every moment of the game.\n\"Guess this is it, huh?\"\n\"We are not done yet,\" Liam replied.\nThe next moment, a shadow fell over Matt. He turned but it was too late, as w troll’s fist came down, crushing him.\nLiam’s breath sighed softly and became a blur of motion, his blade slicing through monsters faster than the eye could follow. Dozens fell and dissipated into motes of lights.\nBut even he couldn’t fight forever.\nThe beasts swarmed, tearing into him from all sides. His health bar plummeted. His armor shattered. Still, he swung, refusing to fall.\nA wolf leapt for his throat; he cut it down mid-air. An ogre smashed a club at him and he barely stopped it with everything he had, but another blow hit him from behind.\nHe was sent flying, crashing through a tree and his body shattered into light.\n{You have died.}\n{Respawn available in: 00:09:59}\n***\nIn the real world, Liam smiled as he took off his Lucid. He looked at his friends who equally had the same excited smiles on their faces.\n\"That was insane!\" Matt muttered, collapsing into the couch\n\"It was but I’m in no mood to continue playing that game right now. It was brutal,\" Elise said.\n\"Well, there are other games we can play. Why don’t we try out Terra? It’s an Earth Sim game,\" Kristopher said.\nEveryone nodded, including Liam and they wore their Lucid back. They have more than a hour left on their daily usage limit and they intend to use it up completely.",

      "content": "Chapter 250: Spooky Terra\nDubai, Qatar, Terra\nWhen Liam and his friends logged into Terra, they found themselves standing at the foot of the Burj Khalifa.\nEvery detail was perfect. The reflection of sunlight on the skyscraper’s mirrored surface, the warm wind rolling in from the Persian Gulf. It was Dubai, down to the last grain of sand, but more quieter, stiller, almost dreamlike.\nKristopher turned in a slow circle and asked, eyes wide in surprise, \"Wait... why do I look like this?\"\nHe stared at his clothes—jeans, black hoodie, sneakers—the exact outfit he was wearing before logging in.\n\"Same here,\" Alex said, patting his jacket like he couldn’t believe it. \"I thought we’d have avatars or something.\"\n\"Yeah, this is either the most realistic avatar customization I’ve ever seen... or we just got cloned,\" Harper said, raising his hand and observing himself.\nMatt stepped closer to Liam. \"Alright, boss, explain. What’s going on?\"\nThough they have watched livestreams and videos of the tech reviewers and the streamers playing Lucid, but he still asked as he wants to understand how the game does it.\nLiam smiled at their reaction and started explaining, \"The in-game avatar for Terra is synced with your Lucid profile. It uses full body mapping—so whatever you look like in real life is how you appear here.\"\n\"So... there’s no character creation screen?\" Kristopher frowned.\nLiam shook his head. \"Nope. Terra isn’t about fantasy—it’s an Earth simulator. Everything starts with who you are.\"\nThe group exchanged amazed glances. Elise looked down at her own hands and whispered, \"It’s kind of eerie though... it feels real.\"\n\"It is real. Or at least, close enough that your brain can’t tell the difference,\" Liam said quietly.\nThey fell silent, staring up at the tower. The streets around them were spotless and empty. There wasn’t a single person or even vehicle in sight.\n\"This place feels haunted,\" Alex said, as he rubbed the back of his neck uneasily.\n\"It’s supposed to. Terra doesn’t use NPCs, except for policing. The cities are built to mirror the real world. Until players fill them, they stay mostly empty,\" Liam said.\n\"So it’s basically Earth without people,\" Harper whistled softly.\n\"Exactly,\" Liam replied.\n\"Creepy concept for a game,\" Kristy said, as she hugged herself, glancing at the lifeless skyscrapers.\n\"It’s meant to evolve. Terra starts as a blank world. What players build inside it will define it,\" Liam said.\n\"That’s... actually brilliant,\" Stacy admitted, though she looked around nervously. \"But still gives me apocalypse vibes.\"\nLiam chuckled. \"Come on. Let’s get something to eat before you start imagining ghosts.\"\nHe led them across the plaza toward a nearby café—one they’d all visited countless times in real life. The difference was eerie, as there was no staff, customers or any sound except for the sound of the door when Liam opened it.\nElise frowned. \"Okay, I’m just going to say it—if an empty chair starts moving on its own, I’m logging out.\"\n\"Relax. This isn’t a horror game,\" Liam laughed quietly.\nHe gestured toward the sleek digital menu embedded in the table. \"Go on, order whatever you want.\"\n\"Wait, we can eat here?\" Matt blinked in surprise.\n\"Yeah,\" Liam said casually, like it was obvious. \"You can eat in Terra, Frontline: Starfall Dominion, and Eternal Realms. Check your interface.\"\nThey exchanged skeptical looks but obeyed. One by one, they brought up their menus—and froze when their status screens appeared.\nKristopher read his aloud:\nName: Kristopher Moore\nAge: 24\nPhysical Attributes: STR: 1 | AGI: 1 | STA: 1 | VIT: 1\nSkills: None\nInfluence: 0\nAssets: None\nCars: None\nStatus: Currently in a state of intense surprise\n***\n\"Bro, even the game’s roasting you,\" Matt let out a low whistle.\n\"Says the guy probably with one in everything too,\" Kristopher glared.\nTheir laughter broke the tension instantly.\nElise was next, reading hers with mock horror. \"No skills? None? I’m offended.\"\nLiam gave a small smile and said, \"Don’t worry. Terra doesn’t hand you anything. You earn it. Everything in this world ties to action, not levels. Think of it like starting life over—but smarter.\"\n\"Alright, spill it, genius. What else are you hiding?\" Matt smirked.\nLiam raised an eyebrow. \"I said I’d let you figure it out yourselves.\"\n\"That’s not fair,\" Kristy protested. \"You built this game! You have all the answers!\"\nLiam chuckled. \"Exactly. And what fun would it be if I gave them to you?\"\nThey all groaned.\nFinally, Elise crossed her arms and pouted. \"You’re impossible.\"\nLiam laughed. \"Fine. One question each.\"\nThe mood immediately shifted as everyone perked up. Matt leaned forward like a child at a candy store. \"Alright, my question. Is there combat in this game?\"\n\"Yes,\" Liam said simply.\nMatt blinked in confusion. \"That’s it? That’s the answer?\"\nLiam grinned. \"You only asked if it exists. You didn’t ask where, when, or how.\"\nThe group groaned again, but laughter filled the room.\nKristopher spoke next. \"My turn. Can we own property here?\"\nLiam nodded. \"Yes. You can buy, build, or create anything you can afford.\"\n\"Even skyscrapers?\"\n\"Even cities,\" Liam said.\nThe silence that followed was filled with awe.\nHarper leaned back, whistling. \"So basically, it’s an alternate Earth with no limits.\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nThey nodded and began placing their orders through the tabletop screen. Moments later, the plates appeared before them, steaming, fragrant, real.\nPancakes, coffee, croissants, and fresh fruit materialized as though delivered by invisible hands.\n\"No way...\" Kristy’s jaw dropped.\nElise reached for her latte, admiring the swirl of heart-shaped foam. She hesitated, sniffed, then took a careful sip. Her eyes widened.\n\"It tastes—perfect.\"\n\"Let me try!\" Matt grabbed a muffin, bit in, and froze. \"Holy—\" he swallowed. \"That’s real!\"\n\"Virtual sensory mapping,\" Liam explained, watching their reactions with satisfaction. \"It stimulates your taste buds and memory simultaneously. Your brain can’t tell the difference between this and the real thing.\"\n\"So we can eat as much as we want and not gain weight?\" Kristopher asked.\n\"Exactly,\" Liam said. \"You can eat all day, and your real body won’t gain a gram.\"\n\"So it’s heaven for foodies,\" Harper smirked.\n\"Pretty much,\" Liam said, amused.\nThey ate happily, laughter returning to the table as they compared tastes and textures.\nWhen they finished, Harper leaned back with a sigh. \"Okay, this game officially wins. I don’t even care if it has monsters or not.\"\nLana looked around thoughtfully. \"So what do we do now?\"\n\"The world’s open,\" Liam said. \"Go explore. That’s what Terra is for.\"\nThe girls exchanged glances.\n\"Are the malls open?\" Stacy asked hopefully.\nLiam smiled. \"Of course. You’ll find everything from boutiques to custom design studios. No real-world brands, though.\"\nLana nodded. \"Makes sense.\"\n\"Then we’re going shopping,\" Kristy said, standing. \"You boys can do your boy stuff.\"\nMatt feigned a wounded look. \"That sounded like an insult.\"\n\"Only because it was,\" Elise teased.\nThey all laughed.\nLana turned back to Liam. \"How do we get there?\"\n\"There’s a ride-share app on your in-game phones,\" Liam said. \"Just order a lift like you would in real life. The car will find you.\"\n\"Seriously?\" Stacy said. \"You even added Uber?\"\n\"Not exactly. You will understand when you get into one.\"\nAs the girls opened their phones, Liam leaned back and added casually, \"You might want to think about where you’ll keep your shopping bags when you’re done.\"\n\"Where else? The penthouse.\" Kristy smiled and pointed toward the Burj Khalifa with a grin.\n\"Of course.\" Liam shook his head, chuckling.\nWithin minutes, a sleek, silver sedan pulled up outside the café. The girls waved cheerfully as they climbed in, the car’s door closed and it glided away down the empty boulevard.\nWhen the vehicle disappeared around the corner, Liam turned back to the boys.\nMatt, Alex, Harper, and Kristopher were already staring at him expectantly.\n\"Alright, boys. Let’s go have some fun. Let’s go street racing,\"Liam smiled.",

      "content": "Chapter 251: Hardest Game To Create\nDubai, Qatar, Terra\nThe virtual sun hung low over the city, casting long golden lines across the smooth glass towers and white pavement.\nLiam and his friends walked down the boulevard toward a car dealership district ahead. Their footsteps echoed faintly in the emptiness of Terra’s digital Dubai.\nKristopher glanced around and whistled in a low tone. \"You know, if I didn’t know better, I’d think we’re in the real Dubai.\"\n\"Same,\" Harper said, with his eyes scanning the lifelike street. \"It’s the quiet that’s getting to me. There are no cars or people. I’ve only seen a couple birds fly past. It’s like the world ended, and we’re the only ones left.\"\n\"Still spooky, though. Can’t lie,\" Alex muttered.\nMatt chuckled but nodded in agreement. \"Spooky or not, this is nuts. The details in the game are insane.\"\nHe looked over at Liam. \"Alright, genius, I gotta ask—how the hell did you make something like this? Be honest, man, this is impossible. Like, impossible impossible.\"\n\"You have been saying that since the first video of Lucid came out,\" Liam smiled.\n\"Because it’s true!\" Matt laughed. \"No one’s ever done this before. The realism, the light refraction, the sound, the way your footsteps echo differently depending on what kind of floor you’re walking on—this is next-level stuff.\"\nAlex jumped in immediately. \"Yeah, yeah, I get it’s impressive. But let’s be real. If you’re talking about difficulty, Eternal Realms has to take the crown.\"\nMatt turned to him. \"You’re crazy. That’s pure fantasy; it’s creative, sure, but you’re not recreating an entire planet that mirrors real life down to the grain of sand.\"\nAlex shook his head. \"No. You don’t get it. Eternal Realms isn’t just fantasy — it’s worldbuilding on an impossible scale. You’ve got empires and possibly every other things a fantasy game would have. And all of them have to interact logically. That’s way harder than copying the real world.\"\nMatt frowned, gesturing around. \"Copying? Bro, this isn’t copying. This is replicating reality — and reality isn’t easy to simulate. Every reflection, every shadow, every sensory detail reacts dynamically. You think that’s simple?\"\nAlex smirked. \"At least Liam had a baseline to work with here. Earth already exists. Eternal Realms had to be built from zero. It’s pure imagination.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Matt shot back, \"but imagination doesn’t have physics engines and wind patterns!\"\nTheir voices grew louder as they argued, both animated, both convinced. Harper was laughing under his breath, while Kristopher just sighed. \"Here we go again.\"\n\"Let’s just ask him,\" Matt finally said, throwing his hands up. \"Liam’s literally the creator. He knows which one’s hardest.\"\nThey all turned toward him. Even Harper and Kristopher, who had been pretending not to care, was clearly curious.\nLiam looked amused. He kept walking, quiet for a moment before finally saying, \"You both make good points. But it’s not that simple.\"\n\"So which is it?\" Matt frowned.\n\"None of them top each other. Each game had its own kind of difficulty,\" Liam replied.\n\"Lame answer,\" Matt muttered.\nLiam chuckled. \"Alright then, let me put it like this—if I had to rank them from easiest to hardest to create, Children Arena would be at the bottom. Then come the sports games.\"\n\"Wait, what?\" Alex blinked. \"Sports games?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Liam said. \"They’re complex, but they’re predictable. Rules, systems, limited variables. Easy to balance compared to the rest.\"\nHe gestured around them as they walked. \"Terra is the flagship game for the device. It mirrors the real world, shows what humanity already is. Eternal Realms shows what humanity dreams of—fantasy, creation, mythology, gods and monsters. And Starfall Dominion shows what humanity is becoming—a sci-fi evolution of Eternal Realms, but stretched across galaxies.\"\nThe boys were quiet now, listening carefully to what Liam was saying.\n\"Each one has depth,\" Liam continued. \"They’re not games anymore; they’re worlds. Layers stacked on layers. But the hardest of all to exist—\" he paused, looking at the horizon where the golden sky met the ocean, before completing what he was saying—\"would be Genesis.\"\nThat caught everyone off guard.\n\"Genesis?\" Kristopher asked. \"You mean the sandbox one?\"\nLiam nodded. \"Yeah. Every player gets their own sandbox, and each one can span as wide as a solar system—or even a galaxy.\"\nMatt blinked in surprise. \"Wait, a galaxy? You mean players can actually build entire galaxies?\"\n\"Exactly,\" Liam said calmly. \"It’s the ultimate sandbox. Players can create worlds, civilizations, races, and even their own world laws. It’s creation without limitation. And the sandboxes can interact with each other.\"\nThey stopped walking without realizing it.\n\"So basically... Genesis is god mode for gamers,\" Harper let out a slow whistle.\n\"Pretty much,\" Liam said.\n\"I don’t even want to imagine how much data that needs,\" Alex said, as he rubbed his temple.\n\"Trust me, don’t even try to imagine it. The data each game needs and would need in the future is just massive,\" Liam said.\n\"Crazy. Everything you have built is at least 20 years ahead of what humanity can ever achieve,\" Kristopher said.\nKristopher shook his head, saying. \"Man, I still can’t wrap my head around it. You made all this, and you still manage to sleep at night?\"\n\"Barely,\" Liam said with a smirk.\nMatt grinned. \"That’s what worries me.\"\nLiam raised an eyebrow. \"Worries you?\"\nMatt crossed his arms dramatically. \"Yeah. You’re out here creating game worlds, civilizations, galaxies... When are you gonna create a girlfriend?\"\nLiam blinked, momentarily taken aback — then chuckled softly. \"Are you in a relationship, Matt?\"\nMatt hesitated. \"Uh... no?\"\nLiam gave him a look that said everything without saying a word.\nThe others burst into laughter again.\n\"Touché,\" Harper said, still grinning.\n\"Okay, okay, I walked right into that one,\" Matt groaned, dragging a hand down his face.\nThe group’s laughter echoed down the empty digital boulevard as they continued walking. The quiet city around them felt less eerie now—laughter had a way of making even the emptiest world feel alive.\nAfter a few more minutes, they reached the car dealership district. They could see rows of showrooms, with the sunlight reflecting on them.\nThe name on the sign above the nearest one read: \"AURION MOTORWORKS.\"\nThe glass doors opened automatically as they approached. The boys walked inside and they froze.\nThere were cars everywhere. They looked sleek, aerodynamic, and completely unlike anything from the real world. No brands, no badges, no emblems. Just pure design, with curves, edges, and bodywork that looked part mechanical, part art.\n\"Holy crap,\" Matt muttered.\nThese don’t look like anything I’ve ever seen,\" Kristopher said, as he walked slowly toward a black coupe with metallic blue streaks. \"\n\"They’re not supposed to,\" Liam said. \"Every vehicle in Terra is original. The system designs them procedurally, based on aesthetics and performance models.\"\n\"Procedurally?\" Alex muttered. \"So the cars design themselves?\"\n\"Pretty much,\" Liam said. \"You’ll never find the same car twice.\"\n\"Nice. Each car’s a one-of-a-kind. NFT bros would lose their minds over this,\" Harper said.\nThe group spread out through the showroom, peeking into cockpits and checking specs that glowed faintly on floating displays beside each car.\nHarper opened the door of a low, silver roadster. The seat adjusted itself instantly to his size.\n\"Okay, this one’s mine,\" he said, with a grin.\n\"You can have your pretty little silver one. This one’s screaming my name,\" Matt said, leaning against a scarlet hypercar with wing-like doors.\n\"I’ll take this beast.\" Kristopher pointed at a matte-black SUV that looked like it belonged in a sci-fi movie.\n\"Of course you will,\" Harper said. \"You’ve got tank energy.\"\nThe others laughed.\nAt this point, the boys were already acting like kids in a candy store.\nAfter nearly half an hour of walking around, testing interiors, comparing performance stats, and mocking each other’s taste in color, they finally made their picks.\nLiam paid at the counter—or rather, through the floating holo-menu that appeared when he waved his hand.\n\"Five vehicles, premium specs,\" the system confirmed. \"Total: $100.\"\n\"Wait, only a hundred?\" Kristopher blinked.\n\"Yeah. It shouldn’t cost this much but because they are luxury cars and I bought the specs for each, tuning them to their limits, it cost real world money,\" Liam explained.\n\"Wow. Amazing,\" Matt smiled brightly like a kid that just got a new toy.\nThey exited the dealership, each stepping into their chosen car. The doors closed smoothly with a satisfying click.\nWhen Liam started the engine, his car’s dashboard came alive as the engine roared to life.\nThe others revved theirs in response, the sound of five engines filling the quiet streets of Dubai.\nMatt grinned through the open window of his car. \"Alright, boss. Street race, downtown. First one past the Marina Bridge wins.\"\nLiam smirked, hands on the wheel. \"You sure you want to challenge the guy who built the game?\"\nMatt winked. \"That’s exactly why.\"\nLiam chuckled. \"You’ll regret that.\"\nThe next moment, the light turned green and the cars shot forward.",

      "content": "Chapter 252: Street Racing\nDubai, Qatar, Terra.\nThe moment the light turned green, the five cars exploded forward like bullets from a railgun.\nThe sounds of engine roaring and tire screeching transformed the quiet streets of Dubai into a thunderous racetrack of flashing chrome and fire.\nLiam’s black hypercar surged ahead instantly, the twin turbines on its rear flaring white-hot as it ripped through the boulevard.\nBehind him, Matt’s scarlet car snarled as he shifted up, the engine howling in defiance.\n\"Not this time, boss!\" he yelled, gripping the steering wheel as if his life depended on it.\n\"Keep talking, Matt,\" Harper’s voice came through the comms, calm but playful. \"We’ll see how long that lasts.\"\nHe swerved his sleek silver roadster between Kristopher’s armored SUV and Alex’s blue coupe, cutting a perfect drift through the next intersection. Sparks trailed from his tires as he regained traction, acceleration throwing him back against his seat.\nThe road ahead split into three lanes lined with glowing street lamps, each flickering in rhythm with the roaring engines.\n\"Shortcut to the left,\" Liam’s voice came through the comm line, casual as ever.\n\"Thanks for the tip,\" Alex grinned. \"I’ll take it.\"\nHe yanked the steering wheel hard and drifted left, skimming past a corner. The shortcut sliced through a narrow side street that cut a few hundred meters off the main road.\n\"Smart,\" Harper muttered, narrowing his eyes as he followed the move. \"But predictable.\"\nHe toggled a switch on his dashboard, activating his roadster’s magnetic suspension. The car lifted just a few centimeters higher, allowing him to take the curve tighter, almost brushing against the wall before bursting back onto the main boulevard beside Alex.\nBoys, you’re too focused on showing off. Keep your eyes on the road.\" Kristopher’s voice came over the line, deep and steady. \"\nFrom behind, his SUV thundered down the street like a tank in motion. Its frame was heavier, but its acceleration was monstrous. Each shift of gear sounded like a growl. When he slammed the throttle, the vehicle surged forward, raw power compensating for its bulk.\n\"You call that a car? It’s a damn building on wheels!\" Matt’s laughter echoed through the comm.\n\"Let’s see your toy survive this!\" Kristopher replied, grinning as he pressed another button. His SUV’s front grill shifted, aerodynamic vents opening as the AI-assisted boosters kicked in.\nThe SUV rocketed forward, closing the gap between them in seconds.\n\"Holy hell!\" Matt yelled, jerking his car out of the way as Kristopher’s behemoth blasted past him, shaking the road.\nLiam watched the chaos unfold in his rear mirror, a small smirk forming on his face. \"Not bad.\"\nBut his friends weren’t holding back.\nThey were getting better, faster and more daring\nGood.\nHe pressed down harder on the accelerator. His car responded like a living thing, the digital roar deepening as the buildings blurred around him. The desert wind swept through the open lanes, carrying specks of golden sand that shimmered under the fading sun.\nThe Marina Bridge lay ahead—two kilometers of smooth steel stretching over glittering blue water, its guardrails glowing with faint luminescence.\nThat was the finish line.\nThe game’s AI has realised that a street race was ongoing and it has transferred them into another simulation where the whole of the game world is a racetrack, with obstacles. But Liam’s friends had no idea.\n\"First to cross takes bragging rights for a week,\" Matt shouted.\n\"Make that a month,\" Harper replied.\n\"You’re both assuming you’ll finish second,\" Liam said.\nThe comms erupted with laughter, then silence as everyone started pushing their focus to the limit.\nThe road ahead narrowed. The AI traffic system suddenly came online, spawning digital vehicles that moved through the roads in preprogrammed patterns to simulate realism.\n\"What the—?\" Alex yelled as a convoy of trucks materialized in front of them.\n\"Traffic!\" Harper barked.\n\"Then make a lane,\" Liam said coolly.\nHe downshifted, jerked the wheel, and slipped between two speeding cars with surgical precision. The hypercar’s back end swayed but recovered instantly. Sparks flew as his tires grazed the concrete divider, but he didn’t slow.\nMatt wasn’t so lucky.\n\"Move, move, move—!\" he shouted as his scarlet car spun sideways between two vehicles. He corrected just in time, sliding through with inches to spare.\n\"Show-off,\" Harper muttered, then pulled his own insane maneuver. He ramped off a small incline near the sidewalk, vaulting over a passing taxi before landing with a clean thud beside Liam.\n\"Now that’s how you do it,\" Harper grinned.\n\"Stylish,\" Liam said with a nod, \"but you’re still behind.\"\n\"Not for long!\"\nThe road curved left, following the coastline. The ocean reflected the neon lights of the city, waves shimmering like liquid glass. They sped through the open stretch, skyscrapers fading into the background.\nKristopher’s SUV was gaining again, raw torque keeping him in the race. Alex’s blue coupe stayed in his slipstream, drafting to build speed.\n\"Alex, I’m passing you,\" Kristopher warned.\n\"Over my dead—hey!\" Alex’s protest was cut off as the SUV surged ahead, brushing his fender.\n\"You were saying?\" Kristopher laughed.\n\"Cheater!\"\n\"Strategist,\" Kristopher corrected, turning smoothly into the next lane.\nMatt caught up behind them, determination written all over his face.\n\"Alright, no more playing nice.\"\nHe slammed a button on his dashboard. His hypercar’s engine flared bright red, twin exhausts glowing like molten metal. The acceleration nearly ripped him out of his seat as he blasted forward, passing both Alex and Kristopher in a blur of light.\n\"Eat my dust!\" he shouted.\nHarper laughed. \"Dust? More like ego.\"\nThey hit the bridge entrance at nearly 400 kilometers per hour. The curved glass railings gleamed as they shot across. The cars’ engines screaming as the reflections of the sunset chasing them across the water.\nA sharp gust hit, carrying with it sand particles from the desert that swirled in the air, scattering across the bridge like fireflies.\nMatt pulled ahead for a brief moment, his scarlet streak cutting through the gold haze. Harper trailed just behind him, weaving side to side to catch his draft.\nThen Alex appeared again, cutting close from the right lane, his blue coupe brushing against Harper’s car and sparks flew.\n\"Careful, Alex!\" Harper barked.\n\"Not my fault you’re slow!\"\n\"You two crash, I’ll take second,\" Kristopher said from behind, grinning.\n\"Dream on, big guy,\" Harper shot back.\nThen, everything happened at once, as a massive freight truck spawned on the far side of the bridge.\n\"Obstacle ahead!\" Liam warned instantly.\nThe others reacted on instinct.\nMatt swerved left, tires screeching. Harper cut right, narrowly missing him. Alex’s car fishtailed, slamming into the guardrail before recovering, but it cost him speed.\nKristopher couldn’t dodge in time, as his SUV clipped the truck’s rear bumper. The impact launched him sideways, skidding violently.\n\"Shit—!\" he yelled as his vehicle spun, metal scraping the road in a shower of sparks.\n\"Hold it!\" Liam barked.\n\"I got it—!\" Kristopher fought the steering, regained control, and slammed back into the lane, laughing breathlessly. \"Still alive!\"\n\"Nice recovery,\" Harper said.\n\"Never doubted myself.\"\nLiam smiled. They were getting better and more confident. He pushed his car harder.\nThe turbines screamed as he activated the overdrive. The world around him blurred into streaks of gold and blue as the hypercar surged ahead, passing Harper and Matt like they were standing still.\n\"You’ve got to be kidding me!\" Matt’s jaw dropped.\nYou challenged the wrong man, Matt.\" Liam’s voice came over the comms, calm, almost teasing. \"\n\"Maybe but I’m not done yet!\"\nMatt slammed his accelerator and activated his car’s nitro boost. The scarlet streak flared bright as fire as he shot forward again.\nThey were side by side now—two streaks of red and black tearing across the bridge.\nHarper was right behind them, looking for an opening. The finish line was ahead, with a glowing white arc hovering above the end of the bridge.\n\"Last stretch!\" Kristopher yelled from behind.\nLiam glanced at Matt’s car. The kid was giving everything he had, pushing beyond what the car was designed for. The engine whined, with heat rippling from its vents.\n\"C’mon, c’mon, c’mon!\" Matt gritted his teeth.\nLiam smiled. Then, almost casually, he shifted gears one last time.\nHis car surged forward, the overdrive rumbling like thunder.\nMatt’s eyes widened as the black hypercar pulled away, slicing through the golden light like a shadow cutting across the sun.\nLiam crossed the finish line first.\nThe system flared white, announcing the result across their displays:\n1st Place — Liam Scott.\n2nd — Matt Curtis.\n3rd — Harper Conley.\n4th — Kristopher Moore.\n5th — Alex Newman.\nThe cars slowed automatically as they crossed into the cool-down zone and the roar of engines faded.\nFor a moment, no one spoke. Then Matt’s voice broke through the comm, half-laughing, half-exasperated.\n\"I hate you.\"\nLiam laughed softly. \"You love me.\"\n\"I do,\" Matt said, groaning. \"But I still hate you.\"\nHarper’s laughter followed. \"That was insane! The whole thing was just too real!\"\nKristopher chuckled. \"It was real. I could feel my steering fighting back.\"\nAlex sighed. \"Next time, no trucks.\"\n\"Next time, no mercy,\" Matt said.\nThey all laughed again, the adrenaline still rushing through their voices.\nLiam parked by the bridge’s edge and stepped out. The others followed, their avatars leaning against the cars, looking out at the ocean.\nThe sun dipped lower, scattering orange and red across the waves.\nIt was quiet again—but this time, it wasn’t eerie. It was peaceful.\nKristopher crossed his arms. \"You know, for a fake world, this feels more alive than the real one sometimes.\"\n\" I guess that’s the whole point of the game,\" Liam smiled.\nThe others nodded quietly, watching the sun fade over the digital horizon.\nFor a moment, none of them spoke.\nThen Harper broke the silence with a smirk. \"So... round two?\"\nMatt groaned. \"You serious?\"\nHarper grinned wider. \"Loser buys pizza.\"\nLiam laughed. \"Deal.\"\nA moment later, five engines roared again, echoing across the sea as they lined up for another race. Each of them were determined to win, but none really cared who did.\n***\nMeanwhile, while Liam was in the game, having fun with his friends, his name was making waves in the alternate Earth.",

      "content": "Chapter 253: Between Two Worlds\nAlmost three days had passed in the alternate Earth.\nIn those seventy-two hours, a single rumor of someone that had awakened two unique abilities had spread like wildfire\nAt first, it sounded like fantasy. But when the verification came from multiple guild sources, disbelief turned into obsession. Every guild master in the United States wanted the same thing: Liam Scott.\nThey didn’t know him, not personally. They hadn’t even seen him in combat. But two unique abilities? That was enough to make every guild in the country salivate.\nThe problem, however, was distance.\nSince the collapse of the global air network after the Great Awakening, long-range travel had become a logistical nightmare. Air transportation no longer existed as the skies were unsafe, filled with rogue beasts. Every journey between cities was a ground expedition that could take days, weeks or months.\nThat meant only guilds within Maryland and the surrounding states had a real shot at reaching him. The others could only dream.\nThose lucky few nearby began digging into his background.\nTheir researchers scoured records, both digital and physical. They traced bank logs, registry files, hospital records and anything that could paint a clearer picture of who Liam Scott really was.\nAfter two days of exhaustive investigation, all they discovered was... ordinary.\nHe was rich. That much they could confirm. Wealthy enough to buy one of the few remaining properties in Old Bethesda, a city where the world’s only SSS Rank Hunter resides.\nAccording to the information the gathered, his parents, both high-ranking scientists, had died during the chaos of the Great Awakening.\nSince then, the boy had been raised by his family’s butler—a man who’d passed away only recently. After that, Liam had quietly moved into the mansion alone.\nHe had no known affiliations to any guild or organisation. To the investigators, he was a ghost who’d simply appeared on the radar with power that defied logic.\nThe guilds’ reactions were mixed.\nThey were satisfied that he wasn’t tied to any other major faction, meaning he was recruitable. But they were equally frustrated that nothing explained how he had managed to awaken two unique abilities.\nThat secret burned like gold dust in their minds.\nStill, greed won over curiosity. Calls were made, as every guild tried to contact him to make their juicy offers known and entice him to join them.\nBut none of them could reach him. Every call ended in silence. His number rang but never connected. The only response option was a text inbox.\nLeft with no other choice, they wrote him messages — offers, promises, recruitment pitches, contracts that would make even high-ranking hunters drool.\nStill, no reply came but no one gave up.\nSome of the top guilds had already begun mobilizing. Convoys were being prepared, armored vehicles fueled. They intended to travel in person—no matter how far—to Old Bethesda.\nBecause in this new world, whoever controlled a man like Liam Scott could shift the balance of power.\n***\nBack in the game world of Terra.\nLiam and his friends had just finished their second race, and once again, Liam had crossed the finish line first.\nMatt still hadn’t gotten over it.\n\"I hate you,\" he’d said again.\nNow, with only twenty minutes of playtime left before the daily usage limit kicked in, the group decided to make the most of it.\n\"Let’s go pick up the girls,\" Harper suggested. \"They’re probably still buried under shopping bags.\"\nKristopher grinned. \"Yeah. Let’s see what kind of financial damage they’ve done.\"\nThe group laughed, engines roaring to life as their cars rolled out of the Marina district and into the main boulevard.\nAs they drove, Kristopher’s voice came through the comm. \"Hey, Liam, quick question. That traffic during the race, the obstacles, especially that truck, where did it come from? I thought Terra was supposed to be empty unless players were around.\"\n\"It was,\" Liam replied calmly. \"But the AI adapted. It detected a street race and switched us into a specialized simulation layer. That version of Terra has active environmental dynamics with obstacles, moving objects, collision mapping. The system basically turned the entire world into a race track.\"\n\"You’re saying the game changed the entire simulation because we were driving too fast?\" Kristopher muttered in a bit of shock.\n\"So basically, the game decided to play against us,\" Matt laughed.\n\"You could say that,\" Liam smiled. \"All the games learns by observing players. If it detects a consistent pattern of play, it builds new experiences automatically. Think of it like a living world.\"\n\"Damn,\" Alex muttered. \"That’s both awesome and terrifying.\"\n\"Mostly awesome,\" Harper said and they all laughed.\nBy the time they reached the mall, the girls were just about finishing up.\nWhen they spotted the cars pulling into the driveway, the girls’ expressions were priceless.\n\"Please tell me these aren’t yours,\" Kristy said, teasingly.\n\"They’re ours,\" Matt said proudly. \"Fresh out of the dealership.\"\n\"So, let me guess — you raced each other, didn’t you?\" Lana said, as she folded her arms, feigning disbelief.\n\"Twice,\" Harper smirked.\n\"And who won?\" Stacy asked, looking directly at Liam.\nThe boys turned toward him in unison.\n\"Luck.\" Liam gave a small, modest shrug.\n\"Right,\" Elise said, rolling her eyes. \"Luck and turbo skill.\"\nThey all laughed. The girls finished packing their shopping bags, and soon, everyone paired up.\nStacy climbed into Liam’s black hypercar, her arms full of bags. Lana joined Matt, Kristy rode with Kristopher, Elise with Alex, and Harper ended up solo.\n\"Hey, Harper,\" Matt called over the comm. \"You can follow us. Try not to feel lonely.\"\n\"I’ll survive,\" Harper replied dryly. \"My car’s better company than you anyway.\"\nThe convoy rolled out smoothly, cruising through the bright streets toward the Burj Khalifa.\nThe building towered like a spear of glass, piercing the clouds. Its reflection stretched across the water, glowing gold under the sunset.\nBut as they approached the underground gate, a soft notification sound chimed in their individual view.\n[Access Denied — No Property Ownership Detected.]\nAnother window popped up: {Would you like to purchase a property?}\n{Yes} {No}\n\"Don’t worry guys, I will get us in,\" Liam said, as he clicked on option {Yes} on his screen, and another window popped up.\n{Please choose floor you would want to purchase an apartment from.}\n{1st floor}\n{2nd floor}\n{3rd floor}\n...\n...\n...\n{163rd floor}\n***\nLiam clicked on {163rd floor} and another window popped up.\n{Apartment(s) available on the 163rd floor: 1.}\n{Top Floor Penthouse – 500,000 Solaris}\nLiam nodded to himself when he saw the price. He didn’t have the amount, so he has to exchange an equivalent of $500 for it. He did the exchange immediately and made the purchase.\n{Congratulations, you’re now the owner of the 163rd floor. The digital documents has been transferred to you.}\n\"Alright, we have a home now,\" he said.\n\"Nice,\" Matt muttered.\nMoments later, his friends’ screens updated:\n[Visitor Access Required — Enter 6-Digit Code]\nThe visitor’s code is a 6-digit access code that the game’s AI generate at default every 24 hours after one has expired after the same period of time, and it’s given to the owner of the apartment or building. The player would give the code to whoever’s visiting them or wants access, allowing them access into the building.\nThe system generated a number. Liam read it out, and one by one, his friends entered it. The barriers opened, allowing them into the underground garage.\nThe cars descended into a wide, pristine space lined with white lights.\n\"Damn,\" Kristopher muttered.\nThey parked side by side and stepped out. The girls lifted their bags, laughing among themselves.\nA sleek elevator waited for them at the far end, doors sliding open automatically.\n\"Top floor,\" Liam said.\nThe doors closed, and within a second, the chime rang — ding.\nThey stepped into the penthouse, and silence fell.\nFloor-to-ceiling windows surrounded them, revealing the breathtaking skyline of Dubai. The sun dipped low, casting molten gold across the ocean and cityscape.\n\"Holy...\" Lana whispered. \"It’s... perfect.\"\nElise walked slowly toward the glass wall, her reflection glowing in the fading light.\n\"This isn’t a game anymore,\" she said quietly.\nFor a while, no one spoke as they were simply admiring the view.\nThen, the soft voices of their Lucid AI Assistants broke the stillness.\n\"Daily usage time remaining: 2 minutes. User would be automatically logged out afterwards.\"\n\"Two minutes left,\" Liam said. \"Pick your rooms and log out.\"\nThey nodded, scattering through the apartment. Laughter echoed through the halls as they peeked into bedrooms and lounges.\nOne by one, they picked their rooms and logged out, their avatars dissolving into soft light. And Liam did the same too.",

      "content": "Chapter 254: Upgrade And Expansion\nAfter exiting the game, Liam and his friends took off their smart glass and sighed softly collectively.\nLiam smiled to himself, as he saw the look of silent reminiscence on his friends’ faces. He knew that they were still thinking about the games.\n\"Wow. That was amazing,\" Matt muttered.\n\"It was. Today would definitely top the list on my favourite day ever,\" Kristopher chuckled.\nThe others nodded, echoing the sentiment. Today was a very enjoyable day for them. They had no idea that gaming can be so much fun. But they knew that this was only possible because it was Lucid.\n\"Sir, dinner’s ready,\" the head maid informed Liam.\nIt was already nighttime in the real world, just as it was in the game world before they were logged out. The head maid and the other two maids had already prepared dinner, and were only waiting for Liam, and his friends to finish gaming.\n\"Thank you, Madeline,\" Liam said, as he stood up from the couch.\n\"Come on, guys,\" he said, before walking to the dinning table for dinner.\n\"Even though I didn’t do anything, I feel so hungry,\" Matt said, as he stood up from the couch and also walked to the dining table.\nThe rest of the group nodded, stood up and walked to the dining table.\nLiam and his friends took their seats, with smiles on their faces. The day really been an enjoyable one for them and they felt very fulfilled.\nAfter they were seated, the maids started serving the meal.\n\"Liam, guys, we girls recorded our shopping experiences in Terra and wants to upload it on our accounts on the platform,\" Elise said, as the maids served the meal.\n\"That’s a good idea,\" Liam nodded.\n\"Really?\" She asked in surprise.\n\"Yeah. You can post,\" Liam said in confirmation.\n\"Thanks. We will upload the videos tomorrow,\" Elise said with a bright smile on her face.\nLiam understood why Elise asked him first before she and girls upload the videos. They are worried about attracting attention to Liam and their group, especially with how much attention the world has on Lucid and Nova Technologies. And also with the fact that governments around the world probably already profiled the 1,000 Lucid users.\nBut Liam wasn’t worried. He was sure that there was no way they would link anything to him and his friends. Besides, they never used their real names.\nHe smiled to himself, as he and his friends ate their meal quietly with smiles also on their faces. After they were done, they decided it was time to go to bed.\n\"Thanks for the meal, Madeline,\" Liam and his friends greeted, as they stood up from the table and went to their rooms.\nLiam stepped into his room and walked to the bed. He plopped on it with a soft sigh. The day has been very relaxing for him. He turned to the window and he saw the beautiful view of Dubai. It was almost no different from the view in Terra’s Dubai.\nLiam wasn’t ready to sleep yet or go to the magical alternate Earth, as he still has something he needs to do first.\nWhat he wanted to do was upgrade Lucid’s integrated marketplace. He planned to transform it into a virtual city called The Hub\nIt would be something that would connect every player, every game, every experience under one unified space. And also integrate the platform to it.\nThe idea was simple in concept but vast in scope: a virtual city the size of an entire world, that would serve as the core of Lucid’s ecosystem. Not just a menu, or a simple marketplace, but a living, breathing digital metropolis.\nA shopping district the size of Earth.\nAnd every player who logged into Lucid would spawn there by default. It would be the center of everything. It would become a bridge between realities, where players could meet, trade, create, and share before diving back into their individual game worlds.\nThe Hub would be divided into five primary sections, each representing a major game:\n1. Terra Sector – a modern, Earth-like cityscape filled with skyscrapers, neon-lit cafés, bustling malls, and sleek corporate towers.\n2. Eternal Realms Plaza – floating gardens, magical marketplaces, glowing runic pathways, guild halls, and ancient temples.\n3. Genesis District – a boundless sandbox zone where players could exhibit their own creations—custom races, worlds, and inventions—like a living museum of imagination.\n4. Frontline Command (Starfall Dominion) – a futuristic expanse of hangars, starports, mech bays, and war academies that connected to interstellar battlegrounds.\n5. Sportverse Arena Zone – a sprawling colosseum network for every sport imaginable.\nThere will also be an upgrade to the sport games, as it would not just be basketball and football, or soccer as it’s known by others.\nEach sector of The Hub would be enormous—at least the size of Alaska—and would evolve as more players joined.\nEvery sector would have cafés, stores, lounges, and travel systems that could instantly teleport players anywhere within the Hub—or back to the games they came from.\nThere would be two types of stores:\nPersonal stores, which players or guilds could buy or rent to sell in-game items, gear, or even digital art.\nThe Grand Market, a massive rent-free zone where anyone could post goods directly through the platform, making trade universal and accessible.\nThe rent system wasn’t just for profit—it was preparation. When guilds, corporations, and even governments began entering Lucid’s ecosystem, they’d need physical space within the virtual world. This would give them that structure without breaking the economy.\nHe wanted the Hub to feel like more than just a system. It had to feel alive.\nPlayers would see crowds, ambient conversations, AI vendors, and digital billboards streaming live content from Lucid’s global platform. Streamers could go live, creators could film inside the Hub, and players could take photos or videos directly through the Lucid interface.\nThat was the next step: integrating the Hub with the Nova Platform itself.\nLucid wasn’t just going to be a gaming device anymore—it was becoming a self-contained universe.\n\"Every city needs a capital, The Hub would be that for Lucid ecosystem,\" Liam muttered to himself.\nThere were still things he planned to add later, but he decided to wait until the players started flooding in.\nThen he turned his attention to the Sportverse expansionexpansion.\nThe sports games were still limited to just football and basketball. It was time to expand.\nHe began listing the additions in his mind:\nAmerican Football\nBaseball & Softball\nTennis & Table Tennis\nVolleyball & Beach Volleyball\nIce Hockey\nCricket\nRacing categories: Kart, Motorsport, Hover Racing, F1, MotoGP etc.\nCombat Sports: Taekwondo, MMA, Boxing, Muay Thai etc.\nEach sport would feature two main modes:\nCareer Mode, split into Player Career and Manager Career.\nCasual Mode, for quick-play matches and tournaments.\nCareer Mode would have deep simulation systems, with player stats, contract negotiations, club management, sponsorships, and even fan interactions.\nCasual Mode would focus on fun and competition, allowing players to switch between standard gameplay and VR Field Mode, a fully immersive first-person experience with 360° awareness, real-time motion tracking, and hyper-real physics.\nVR Field Mode would also be available to both career modes.\nThis way, players would feel the vibration of every hit, the rush of running, the pressure of the crowd.\nAfter refining the blueprint in his mind, he sent the entire draft to Lucy.\nWith how fast and efficient Lucy work, he expects that the updates would be ready before morning and the players would receive notifications.\nShe would also post about it on the Nova Technologies’ official account on the platform.\nLiam smiled to himself, feeling fulfilled. He decided to visit magical Earth and sign-in, as it was time.",

      "content": "Chapter 255: Impressive Rewards\nOld Bethesda, Maryland, USA, Alternate Earth.\nLiam appeared in the master bedroom of Dark Dragon Villa. The sunlight flooding into the room from the huge window indicated that it was noon here, but its intensity also indicates that the sun would set in a few hours.\nLiam looked outside and he saw that the sun was already starting to dip below the skyline.\nHe smiled to himself, enjoying the warmth of the sun for a few seconds. After he felt like he had enjoyed the warmth of the sun enough, he decided to focus on what he came here for.\n\"System, sign-in,\" he said, with the smile never leaving his face.\n[Ding!]\n[Congratulations, Host, you received 10,000 Purple Grade Mana Crystals]\n[You received Key of Yggdrasil]\n[You received Bow of Atermis (replica)]\n***\nLiam was silent for a few moments, taking his time to sort out his emotions that were about to spiral.\n\"Fuuu... The system’s insane as always,\" he muttered, after a few seconds of silence.\nToday’s sign-in rewards are just as insane as other days. The 10,000 Purple Grade Mana Crystals are items of extreme values, not just in this world but also to him.\nIn this world, mana crystals are very valuable because they are the secondary source of income for Hunters and Guilds, besides monster core. They are usually blue rock of varying sizes found inside some gates and they have multiple uses.\nAs for the Purple Grade Mana Crystals, they are extremely rare because they contain an immense amount of mana that would rival monster cores from high rank monsters.\nThey are always found inside S Rank gates and above. And each of the crystals sells for $100,000.\nBut the crystals are valuable to Liam because of the monetary value. No, it’s valuable to him because it’s perfect material to inscribe the skills from the Tome of Thoth.\nInscribing the skill on the crystal would transform it into a runestone and the price of each sells for at least $500,000.\nThere’s also the fact that he would be needing tons of the crystal, coupled with spirit stones, if he wants to tame the Voidling.\nAs for the spirit stones he had received from his sign-ins in the cultivation universe, he had thrown them into the Spirit Lake. He had thought about it and decided that it was the best to do.\n\"I wonder how many spirit stones that the Lake has produced,\" Liam thought to himself, before turning his attention to the other rewards.\n[\nKey of Yggdrasil\n]\nDescription: A part of the World Tree. It can open the doors between realms, allowing the user to travel freely between worlds. It can also be used to stabilise an unstable realm.\n***\nLiam was curious to see what the key looked and he immediately vanished from the room, appearing in the Dimensional Space. He was standing in his office of the industrial base and on the desk in front of him were three different items.\nThe first of them were the 10,000 Purple Grade Mana Crystals. Liam picked one of them up and observed it.\nThe crystal didn’t feel much different from a spirit stone. Its surface felt smooth to the touch and it was giving off a bright purple glow, and it also felt cool to the touch. He couldn’t sense the immense mana the crystal contain.\n\"I have so many uses for you but I can’t start wasting you on skills inscription. I have to save enough for my deep space travel. I can’t start splurging yet,\" Liam Matthew to himself.\nHe turned his attention to the Key of Yggdrasil, one of the main reason he was here. The Key looked like a tree root that was grown into the shape of a key.\nThe Key was exuding an immense life force aura, which Liam could faintly sense. The Key also had tiny sparse leaves on it.\nLiam dropped the crystal in his hand and picked the Key up from the desk. Immediately, information on it started flooding into his brain. The information transfer was completed a few seconds later.\n\"So, it was cut off from Yggdrasil’s real body. Something so powerful. The system is really going all out with its rewards and I haven’t even started using some of them yet,\" Liam sighed.\nHe felt a little sour that he had so many good things in his possession but can’t use it because of the self-imposed limitation.\n\"Soon,\" he smiled to himself.\nLiam wanted to use the Key immediately and open a portal to another world, but he decided to delay it. He still had one more reward to check out and there are things he has to settle in Old Bethesda before leaving.\nHe turned to look at the last item he received from today’s sign-in, the Bow of Atermis. He picked it up and smiled to himself a few seconds later.\nThe Bow of Artemis is a sleek, moon-silver weapon carved from divine silverwood, its limbs etched with faint glowing runes. The grip is wrapped in cool white leather.\nAccording to the information in his head, when pulled, the bow doesn’t need arrows but it can only be used at night under moonlight. All he just needs to do is to draw the bow and it would draw power from the moon to form arrows.\nPretty convenient and inconvenient at the same time, but Liam can simply get himself arrows.\nLiam sighed softly and decided to focus on the second thing he came to do. He left the Dimensional Space, returning to his bedroom in the Villa.\nHe took out his phone from his pocket and he saw the multiple missed calls and unread messages he has to respond to. He looked at them for a moment, thought about it and decided to refuse all of their offers.\nThey were enticing and very juicy, yes. But no matter how enticing the offers are, it’s not enough for him to chain himself with unnecessary responsibilities.\nSure, they might give him some leeway if he asks for it but Liam doesn’t want anything to do with any guild. It wasn’t his way of doing things and his circumstances doesn’t allow it.\nHe can simply disappear the days, weeks or even months without worrying but he can’t do that if he joins a guild.\nLiam checked the message Novak sent and he saw that the cores had been sold, and the money was transferred to his account, after 5% fee was deducted. This was instead of the initial 10%.\n\"Good. Now, I have nothing more to worry about. But I should go check on the staffs. Five days has passed since they saw me last. They must be worried,\" Liam said to himself.\nHe left the bedroom and descended down the stairs. Claudia noticed his presence and immediately came to greet him, bowing slightly.\n\"Welcome back, sir. It’s good to see you again.\"\n\"It’s good to see you too, Claudia,\" Liam nodded.\n\"Would you like something to eat, sir?\" she asked.\n\"Yes,\" Liam said, smiling lightly. \"I think I could use a meal.\"\nClaudia nodded once. \"I’ll have it ready shortly.\" She turned and called softly to the others, \"Mia, Freya — let’s prepare something for the master.\"\nThe two younger maids immediately moved into motion.\nLiam walked to the dining table and sat down, his gaze idly drifting toward the tall windows. He leaned back slightly, his fingers drumming the polished surface as his thoughts wandered to the Key of Yggdrasil.\nWhat kind of world would it open?\nThe possibilities ran endlessly in his mind. The Key’s connected to the World Tree, meaning any realm tied to it could be reached. He couldn’t help but feel a quiet excitement building within him.\nIf it truly allowed travel between realms, then he could expand beyond even his Dimensional Space. Entire universes were within reach now. The scope of it all made his pulse quicken slightly.\nA soft knock drew him from his thoughts.\n\"Sir,\" one of the guards called respectfully.\nLiam turned his head. \"Hey, guys.\"\nBoth guards entered the hall and gave a firm salute.\n\"It’s good to see you again, sir,\" one said.\n\"It’s good to see you guys, too,\" Liam chuckled. \"Everything’s been fine here, I assume?\"\n\"Yes, sir. No disturbances. Perimeter’s clear, and we haven’t picked up anything unusual.\"\n\"Good,\" Liam said, giving a small nod of approval. \"Keep it that way.\"\nThe guards smiled, bowed again, and left the room.\nMoments later, Claudia and the maids returned and table was set.\n\"Your meal, sir,\" Claudia said, stepping aside.\n\"Thank you.\"\nLiam began eating slowly. As he ate, the maids stood silently at the side, awaiting further instructions.\nWhen he finished, Liam set the utensils down gently and looked up at them.\n\"It’s good,\" he said simply.\nThe three women smiled, the smallest hints of pride showing on their faces.\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Claudia said softly.\nHe stood, pushing the chair back slightly. \"That’ll be all for now. You’ve all done well. Get some rest.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\" They bowed again and began clearing the table as he walked toward the staircase.\nHe entered his room and closed the door behind him.\nThe moment the lock clicked, the atmosphere changed. The gentle calm of the villa faded, replaced by an undercurrent of anticipation.\nHe walked to the center of the room and took a slow breath. The sunlight filtering through the window caught the faint shimmer of the Key of Yggdrasil as it appeared in his hand.\n\"This should be interesting,\" Liam murmured.\nHe lifted the Key and made a small twisting motion in the air, as if inserting an invisible key into a lock.\nHe turned it gently and the next moment, the air split open in front of him, threads of light unraveling into a swirling oval of energy.\nLiam took a step forward. His expression was calm but his heart was beating steady with anticipation. The light of the portal reflected in his eyes.\n\"Let’s see where you lead,\" he said quietly and eithout hesitation, he stepped through.",

      "content": "Chapter 256: Skeleton Dungeon\nLiam found himself inside what looks like a cave, when he stepped out from the other side of the portal.\nThe cave was dark but he could still see, thanks to his enhanced eyesight. He noticed that the cave looks like something that was still in use.\n\"Where am I? What is this place?\" Liam thought to himself.\nThe cave looks like what one would see in a dungeon manhwa but he wasn’t sure, as he couldn’t sense anything even after spreading out his telekinetic sense.\nHe decided to ask the only entity that can give him the answers to his questions.\n\"System,\" he called but he got no response. He tried calling Lucy but there was also no response.\n\"Sigh... Not again,\" he muttered in a low voice.\nIt was just like the first time he visited the cultivation and magic universe. He had found himself dropped in a forest but times, and now it’s a cave.\nLiam looked around, trying to make sense of where he was and the direction that leads out of the cave. He crouched to his knees and studied the ground for any sign that would tell him anything.\nHe noticed what looks like footprints but not footprints at the same time. He studied the footprints and he noticed that it wasn’t exactly left behind by a foot or feet, but skeletons?\nIt looks like it was left behind by something with no flesh covering its foot skeleton. A skeleton monster? Was I transported to a skeleton dungeon?\nLiam has so many questions but since he had no one to answer them for him, he could only get them himself.\nHe observed the footprints and noticed the direction in which it was walking in and he decided to follow it. He has no idea if it would lead to the dungeon’s exit but doing that was better than waiting around and doing nothing.\nLiam had followed the footprints for about a minute before his telekinetic sense finally picked up the outline of something different from the rocky and damp surface of the cave.\nHis telekinetic sense picked up the outline of three skeletons, each of them holding a weapon in their hands.\nSo, it’s really a skeleton dungeon. I wonder how strong they are and what the boss is like,\nLiam thought to himself.\nWhile he had found it pretty inconvenient to had been transported into a dungeon, he knew that complaining won’t change anything.\nBesides, he wasn’t worried about being any sort of life threatening danger, as he has multiple ways to ensure his safety.\nBut while he wasn’t worried, doesn’t mean that he wasn’t going to be cautious. He made sure not to make any sound as he sneaked up behind the three skeletons.\nAs he got closer, he noticed that the weapons they are holding are old, cracked swords that looks like it would break at the smallest impact.\nLiam wasn’t interested in the swords but the skeletons. He decided to make his move as he had gotten close enough. He reached out his hand and enveloped them with his telekinetic field, pinning the three of them to the spot.\nHe didn’t allow them a chance to properly react, as he made a downward getsure with his hand. A crushing force befall them, shattering their bones across the dungeon floor.\nI wonder if they also have monster core,\nLiam thought to himself, observing the bones on the floor.\nSince his telekinetic sense can’t see past a barrier and into something, he can only examine the individual.\nHe checked the rib cage of one of the skeletons and he saw a blue shiny rock attached behind it. He pried it free from the cage, before dropping the cage back on the floor with a loud clanking sound.\nSo, they do have monster cores. Good for me then.\nHe immediately made the other two rib cages float towards him and extracted the monster cores attached behind them.\nHe observed the small blue rocks in his hand for a moment, before sending them into the Dimensional Space.\nWith the Dimensional Space opened now, Liam could call Lucy—not that he was ever restricted from accessing it—but he decided against it. Lucy can’t help his situation. He has to clear this dungeon or get out of it through the entrance if that’s possible, and understand where the portal opened to.\nLiam continued walking deeper into the dungeon. He knew this because the air was getting damper.\nHe had walked a few steps when his telekinetic sense caught the outline of more skeletons. But unlike the first time, he didn’t hide his presence.\nLiam didn’t hesitate the moment his eyes caught the first cluster of skeletons moving ahead. He raised a hand and unleashed a wave of telekinetic pressure that slammed into them like an invisible hammer. Their brittle bones cracked in midair before they could even turn toward him.\nHe didn’t slow down. He advanced, crushing one after another. His movements were silent and precise.\nThe dungeon echoed only with the sounds of splintering bones, as dozens fell in moment. But the noise didn’t go unnoticed.\nThe clatter of skeletal feet echoed through the tunnels—dozens of them, maybe hundreds, marching toward him from every direction. The sound was sharp and hollow, like hailstones striking metal.\n\"Guess I woke the neighbors,\" Liam sighed softly, his expression calm.\nHe spread his telekinetic sense outward, mapping the oncoming tide. The entire dungeon corridor ahead was crawling with movements—skeletal warriors, some armed with swords, others with cracked shields or spears. They flooded from the darkness in waves.\nLiam didn’t wait for them to come to him as his figure blurred forward, streaking through the misty corridors like a dark phantom.\nEvery time he passed a cluster of skeletons, they shattered behind him, bones scattering like glass fragments. His telekinetic field lashed out in sweeping arcs, crushing everything in its path with pinpoint force.\nWithin seconds, tens, maybe hundreds of skeletons lay broken on the ground, their remains forming a jagged carpet of white fragments on the ground.\nLiam looked at the countless piles of bones and shook his head with a faint sigh.\n\"...That’s a lot of cores.\"\nHe knew each of them carried a small blue rock embedded within their ribs, just like the first few. But the idea of individually prying them out from hundreds of bodies felt more like punishment than profit.\nHe opened the Dimensional Space and summoned the extraction bot.\n\"Same process as before,\" Liam instructed. \"Extract everything you find and send it into storage.\"\nThe bot beeped once in acknowledgment before flying off, extending multiple small arms as it began its systematic work.\nLiam didn’t linger to watch. He turned toward the deepest part of the dungeon, walking through the sea of bones as if he were strolling down a quiet street.\nThe deeper he went, the more the dungeon changed. The rocky tunnel widened gradually, the walls became more smooth and damp, almost as if polished by something over centuries.\nLiam knew what that meant.\nThe boss room is close.\nAfter a few more steps, the passage opened into a massive chamber. The ceiling disappeared into darkness, supported by enormous bone pillars. Torches burned with ghostly blue flames, casting long, flickering shadows across the floor.\nAnd at the far end of the chamber stood a throne.\nIt was crude, forged entirely from skulls and femurs stacked together, yet it radiated authority. Sitting on it was a single figure—motionless, silent, but unmistakably different from the others.\nA skeleton, yes. But this one was massive as it was easily three meters tall. A rusted black great sword rested across its knees. Its hollow eye sockets burned faintly red, like dying embers waiting to reignite.\nAnd for the first time, Liam felt pressure from monster. But he wasn’t scared or worried. Quite on the contrary, he was excited.\n\"So, you’re the boss. Nice. I specialise in killing things like you,\" he smiled even wider.",

      "content": "Chapter 257: Liam Vs Death Knight\nThe death knight lunged at Liam from its seated position.\nIts movement was so sudden that the entire throne of skulls cracked apart beneath its weight.\nThe air rippled as the monster’s enormous greatsword came down in a single, brutal swing aimed straight for Liam’s head.\nLiam tilted his body to the side. The blade missed by a breath, slicing cleanly through the stone floor where he’d been standing a moment earlier. The ground exploded in a burst of shattered rock.\nThe dungeon trembled and dust rained down from above.\nLiam landed lightly several meters away, his expression calm but his eyes sharp.\n\"Fast. Good. This will be fun,\" he muttered.\nHe extended his hand and Silverleaf materialized in it. The moment his fingers wrapped around the hilt, the atmosphere shifted.\nThe death knight’s red eyes flared brighter as if recognizing the challenge. It rose to its full height, towering over Liam, skeletal hands gripping the black greatsword with unnatural strength. The weapon was larger than a door.\nThen both moved at once in a flash of silver and a streak of black.\nTheir blades collided with a sound that shook the chamber like thunder. The shockwave tore across the room, ripping cracks through the stone pillars and scattering debris.\nLiam slid backward several meters, shoes grinding against the floor. He steadied himself instantly and vanished again, reappearing behind the death knight. Silverleaf cut in a clean arc toward its spine.\nThe death knight twisted with impossible speed, parrying the strike and retaliating in the same motion. The black blade carved a wide crescent of energy through the air, slicing apart the bone pillars behind Liam.\nLiam ducked, the attack grazing his hair, and countered with a lightning-fast thrust aimed at the monster’s chest cavity. The blade struck true—but instead of piercing through, it met something solid and sparks burst.\n\"An armour or reinforced bone structure?\" Liam muttered, stepping back as the death knight’s sword swung upward again.\nHe blocked, redirecting the force. The impact sent tremors through his arm. The ground beneath them cracked open like a spiderweb.\nThe death knight pressed forward, every strike heavier than the last. Its attacks were fast, deliberate, and wide enough to cut through steel walls.\nBut Liam was faster.\nHe moved with a fluid rhythm, his body bending and twisting around each strike as if he already knew where the next blow would land. Silverleaf danced in his grip, deflecting each swing with smooth, controlled precision.\nMetal rang against metal again and again. And sparks filled the air like falling stars.\nFor every step the death knight took forward, Liam gave none back.\nTheir swords clashed mid-air, creating bursts of pressure that shredded the dungeon walls. Every collision sent stones flying and fissures crawling up the pillars. Blue flames from the torches bent under the force of their battle, flickering violently.\nThe fight was beautiful and destructive. It was like an elegant chaos shaped by speed and precision.\nAt one point, Liam twisted his wrist and parried a downward slash, sliding Silverleaf along the greatsword’s edge before snapping his knee up and kicking the monster square in the chest. The impact sent the death knight skidding backward, crushing a column behind it.\nBones cracked, but the creature didn’t stop.\nIt released a hollow, echoing roar that vibrated through the entire chamber. Its red eyes flared brighter than before as a black mist poured out from its body, coating its bones in a sinister aura.\n\"Enhancing yourself now? Alright,\" Liam smiled.\nHe dashed forward again, sword raised. The death knight met him halfway and the world turned into streaks of motion.\nSilverleaf and the greatsword met again and again, each strike faster and harder than the last. The air around them distorted from the sheer speed. The dungeon floor couldn’t handle it, as every step they took shattered the stone beneath their feet.\nThey weaved through the chamber like two storms colliding, their blades tracing arcs of silver and black light.\nLiam spun midair, parrying a blow before twisting and slashing at the creature’s side. The blade bit into its ribs but didn’t pierce through. The death knight retaliated instantly, swinging upward.\nLiam blocked again. But this time, the impact was different.\nA deep metallic crack echoed through the chamber.\nLiam’s eyes flicked down. A hairline fracture spread across Silverleaf’s blade.\nHe frowned slightly. \"You’ve got to be kidding me.\"\nBefore he could react further, the death knight pressed forward with a heavy downward slash. Liam blocked again—and the sound came louder this time, sharper.\nCrack!\nThe silver sword snapped in half, fragments scattering through the air like shattered glass.\nFor the first time, Liam’s expression changed not with fear, but irritation.\nHe tossed aside the broken hilt, sighing quietly. \"Alright. Let’s end this.\"\nThe death knight lunged immediately, sensing weakness. Its massive sword came down in a vertical swing powerful enough to split the floor.\nBut before it could reach him, the nanites surged from his wrists 1, flowing like liquid obsidian over his arms, shaping into smooth, armored gauntlets.\nThe greatsword struck—and Liam raised his right arm.\nThe impact echoed like thunder. Sparks burst outward, a shockwave rippling through the room. The blade stopped dead, caught between his palms.\nThe death knight tried to push down, but Liam didn’t move an inch.\n\"Nice try.\"\nWith a small twist of his wrist, he snapped the sword in half. The weapon shattered, fragments flying in every direction.\nThen Liam moved.\nHis first punch drove straight into the monster’s chest, crushing ribs like dry twigs. The force sent the death knight flying backward, smashing it into the far wall. Stone cracked from the impact.\nBefore it could recover, Liam appeared beside it, slamming his fist into its jaw. The entire skull jerked sideways, half its face breaking off. He followed up with a kick that caved in its sternum and launched it into the air.\nBones scattered as it crashed into the ceiling before slamming back to the ground.\nThe death knight roared again, but it was weaker this time, more desperate. Black mist leaked from the cracks in its bones as it swung the remains of its blade wildly.\nLiam sidestepped every strike effortlessly, weaving through them like water flowing around rocks.\n\"You fought well but this is over,\" he said quietly.\nHe appeared in front of it again and drove a fist into its abdomen, crushing through bone and black armor. The death knight staggered backward, bones falling apart, but Liam didn’t stop.\nHe grabbed the creature’s rib cage with one hand. His grip tightened and cracks spread instantly.\nWith a sharp jerk, he punched through the chest cavity, his gauntleted arm sinking deep inside until his fingers closed around something orb embedded near its spine.\nThe death knight froze.\nLiam pulled his hand back and ripped it out. The orb glowed like molten blood in his hand.\nThe death knight’s body shuddered once. Then its bones began to collapse, each fragment falling apart into dust and ash.\nA second later, it was gone.\nThe red core pulsed once in Liam’s hand before dimming to a faint glow. He looked at it silently for a moment, then slipped it into his pocket.\nThe dungeon fell quiet again.\nThe ghostly flames flickered weakly on the walls. The once grand chamber was now half-destroyed with pillars broken, floor cracked and the air heavy was with dust.\nLiam flexed his fingers, the nanite gauntlets retracting back their wristwatch and wristband form. He exhaled softly.\n\"Silverleaf,\" he muttered, glancing at the shattered remains of his sword lying near the wall. \"You served me well.\"\nHe waved a hand, collecting the fragments and storing them into the Dimensional Space. He has no idea what he would do with it but he can’t leave it here.\nAs he turned toward the tunnel leading out of the chamber, his mind began to calm again. The fight had lasted barely a few minutes, but it had been enough to make him from satisfaction.\n\"Best fight I’ve had in a long while,\" he murmured.\nHe took one last glance at the empty throne before walking toward the exit.\nAs he stepped out of the chamber, he could feel the walls of the dungeon trembling faintly. Without its core monster, the dungeon was beginning to collapse.\n\"Time to go.\"\nHe accelerated, moving through the tunnels at blinding speed. The air behind him rippled as falling debris chased his shadow.\nWithin seconds, he reached the entrance of the cave. The moment he stepped outside, the entire dungeon groaned and imploded, sealing itself behind him in a burst of collapsing stone and dust.\nThe wind outside was cold. The forest beyond the cave stretched endlessly under the setting sun, golden light spilling through the trees.\nLiam stood there quietly, letting the breeze wash over him.\n\"Another world,\" he said softly and smiled to himself in satisfaction. He turned toward the horizon and began walking.",

      "content": "Chapter 258: Liam And The Band\nIt had been more than twenty minutes since Liam left the dungeon—or rather, broke it.\nThe air outside was fresh, the faint scent of pine and damp earth clinging to the wind. The forest behind him had already begun to fade into silence, as if the dungeon had never existed at all.\nHe followed the faint animal trails until they opened into a dirt road that stretched endlessly in both directions.\nThe ground was uneven, carved with grooves left by wagon wheels. The faint smell of horses and old smoke drifted in the air.\nLiam paused at the edge of the road, brushing dust from his sleeve. He could have flown—he wanted to—but he decided against it. He didn’t want to attract attention until he understood where he was. There was no telling what kind of civilization or beings inhabited this world.\n\"Medieval,\" he muttered quietly, his eyes narrowing slightly as he studied the landscape.\nHe scanned both sides of the road, considering which path to take. One direction led toward rolling hills that faded into the horizon. The other dipped slightly and curved into a patch of misty lowland.\nWhile he was thinking, a sound reached his ears—the rhythmic thud of boots striking dirt, mixed with faint chatter.\nHe turned his head toward the noise. In the distance, he saw a group of people walking down the road. They were coming his way.\nLiam stayed where he was, watching.\nAs they drew closer, his enhanced vision filled in the details—their clothes, weapons, and manner of movement. They wore leather boots, thick tunics, and belts weighed down with daggers and pouches. Some had swords strapped to their hips; one of them carried a wooden staff topped with a stone.\nMages and swordsmen.\nThat confirmed his suspicion. This was a medieval world.\nHe decided to approach. If anyone could give him directions or some basic information, it would be travelers like them.\nLiam adjusted his coat and began walking toward them.\n***\nThe group noticed him almost immediately.\n\"Oi, look,\" one of them said, pointing ahead. \"Someone’s coming.\"\nThey slowed their pace, their expressions shifting from casual to cautious curiosity. The stranger approaching them didn’t look like anyone they’d ever seen.\nHis clothes were simple yet refined—clean fabric, strange appearance unlike that of any tailor’s work they knew. His black sneakers caught their attention the most. They were unlike any footwear they’d seen in any kingdom or city-state.\n\"Is he a noble?\" one man whispered.\n\"Noble? In those clothes? Don’t be stupid.\"\n\"Then what is he? A wanderer?\"\n\"Wanderers don’t dress like that.\"\nThe one carrying the staff squinted. \"His face looks human enough.\"\nThe conversation turned hushed and wary.\n\"He doesn’t have a horse or wagon either,\" another pointed out.\nThen the mood shifted, as curiosity turned to greed.\nThe tallest among them, a man with a scar across his jaw, leaned closer to the woman who walked at the front. She seemed to be their leader. Her dark green cloak was cleaner than the others and her movements were sharper.\n\"What do you think, Elena?\" the scarred man whispered. \"We could take his clothes. Sell them in the city. I’m sure Nobles pay fortunes for foreign things like that.\"\n\"Yeah. I bet that fabric alone’s worth gold,\" One of the others said with a grin.\n\"Shut up,\" another hissed. \"You don’t even know if he’s dangerous.\"\n\"Even if he is, there’s seven of us,\" the scarred man said. \"He’s alone.\"\nMira said nothing for a long while. Her eyes stayed fixed on Liam as he approached. There was something in his walk. It was steady, measured and without a hint of fear. She could see the composure in his steps.\nStill, the gold they could earn from those strange clothes tempted her.\n\"Let’s see who he is first,\" she said finally.\nThe group nodded, but some of them still whispered about what they might steal and others laughed under their breath.\nNone of them knew that Liam had heard every word.\nThey were speaking in a foreign tongue but Universal Linguistics translated it perfectly for him.\nSo, you’re planning to rob me,\nHe smiled as he walked closer. He decided to play along.\nWhen Liam reached them, he greeted first.\n\"Good afternoon,\" he said politely, his tone calm and friendly.\nThe woman, Mira, stepped forward with a small smile.\n\"Good afternoon, traveler. You seem far from home.\"\n\"You could say that,\" Liam replied. \"I’m trying to find my way to the nearest settlement. Could you tell me where the closest village or town is?\"\nMira tilted her head slightly, studying his expression for a moment before replying, \"Of course. Follow this road south. You’ll see the walls before sunset. The kingdom name is Astrin.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Liam nodded with a small, appreciative smile.\nHe reached into his pocket—and by extension, the Dimensional Space—and pulled out a handful of gold coins. The soft sunlight caught the surface of the coins, sending bright reflections across the dirt.\n\"For your help,\" He said, as he handed ten coins to Mira.\nFor a moment, there was total silence. Then the group’s expressions changed completely.\nTheir eyes widened. Gold wasn’t rare, but the purity and shine of those coins were unlike anything they’d seen. It didn’t look like local currency. It looked like a foreign mint, flawless surface, with precise edges.\nThe coins looked like they came from another age.\nMira blinked, momentarily thrown off. \"This... is too much.\"\n\"Consider it a small token of gratitude,\" Liam said simply.\nThe others stared at him, some already calculating how much that handful of gold would fetch. Greed flickered openly in their eyes.\nLiam noticed, of course. He could practically feel their hesitation between awe and temptation.\nNow, then, let’s see what you will do,\nHe smiled inwardly.\nHis action of giving them the gold coins was to feed that greed and see what decision they would make.\nHe turned away and began walking in the direction she’d pointed. His stride was calm, unhurried.\nBehind him, the group broke into a low murmur.\n\"That’s real gold.\"\n\"By the gods, he’s rich!\"\n\"Did you see how clean it was?\"\n\"We could take him now—\"\n\"Shut up, you fool!\" Mira snapped quietly, though even her tone carried a note of temptation.\nThen she raised her voice. \"Traveler!\"\nLiam paused and turned his head slightly. \"Yes?\"\n\"We could escort you,\" she said with a practiced smile. \"The road ahead sometimes has bandits. It would be safer with company.\"\nHe arched a brow. \"How much?\"\n\"No charge. Consider it goodwill,\" the lady said, as her smile didn’t falter.\nGoodwill, huh?\nLiam chuckled softly to himself.\nOut loud, he said, \"That’s generous of you. I’d appreciate the company.\"\nMira nodded, signaling to her companions. They fell into motion, fanning out around him as they continued down the road together.\n***\nThey had walked for more than two hours. The road twisted between the forest and open fields until, finally, the faint outline of walls appeared on the horizon.\n\"Is that the kingdom you mentioned earlier?\" Liam asked, his tone casual.\nMira followed his gaze and nodded. \"Yes. Astrin.\"\nThe walls grew taller as they approached—gray stone scarred by age and weather, flanked by wooden watchtowers. The gates was closed and heavily guarded.\nWhen the group finally reached the gate, one of the guards stepped forward and his expression looked stiff. His armor looked worn, and a short sword hung from his belt.\n\"State your business,\" the guard demanded. His eyes flicked briefly to Liam’s unfamiliar clothes before resting on his face. \"You’re not from around here.\"\n\"I’m a traveler,\" Liam said calmly.\nThe guard’s brow furrowed. \"From where?\"\n\"Far,\" Liam answered evenly. \"I doubt you’d know the place.\"\nThe man hesitated, unsure whether to take offense or simply move on. Then his gaze shifted to the mercenaries behind Liam—Mira’s group—and he seemed to relax slightly. \"You with them?\"\n\"Just met them on the road,\" Liam said.\nThe guard gave a slow nod but didn’t look convinced. \"All visitors need an entry permit. Five copper coins.\"\nLiam reached into his pocket, pulled out a single gold coin, and handed it over.\nThe guard blinked, staring at the coin. Its perfect shine caught the light, making the dull copper in his pouch look like dirt.\n\"This—uh—this is too much.\"\n\"Keep it,\" Liam said simply.\nThe guard hesitated for only a second before pocketing the coin and tearing a small parchment seal from a leather-bound book. He stamped it and handed it to Liam. \"Your permit. Don’t lose it. And don’t cause any trouble. We expel troublemakers fast.\"\nLiam smiled faintly. \"Understood.\"\nThe guard stepped aside, motioning for him to pass. The heavy gates creaked as they opened wider, sunlight spilling through the gap.\nBefore stepping inside, Liam turned slightly toward Mira. \"Thank you for the company,\" he said politely.\nMira shook her head, offering a half-smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. \"Don’t thank me. We just happened to be going the same way.\"\nHer tone was smooth, but Liam could hear the unspoken hesitation in it—the faint edge of guilt or perhaps fear.\nHe could guess what was going through her mind. She and her group had walked beside him for hours, waiting for the right moment to act. But they hadn’t. Whether it was the calmness in his eyes or the effortless way he carried himself, something about him had changed their minds.\nMaybe they sensed what he really was. Maybe they didn’t want to find out.\nEither way, it didn’t matter.\nLiam nodded once in acknowledgment, then walked through the gate. The guards pulled it closed behind him with a deep clang that echoed off the stone walls.\nLiam took a slow breath, letting his senses adjust, before he started walking, blending easily into the crowd.\n***\nBehind him, outside the gate, Mira and her group lingered for a moment before turning away.\n\"Why didn’t we do it?\" the scarred man muttered under his breath.\nMira didn’t answer. She just stared at the closed gate where Liam had vanished and said quietly, \"Because some people you don’t rob. You will understand one day.\"\nHer companions fell silent at that.",
