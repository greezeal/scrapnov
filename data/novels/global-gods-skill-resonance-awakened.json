      "content": "Chapter 1 - Ch 1 : Healthy Start\nSunny's eyes fluttered open, greeted by the disorienting sight of himself floating in the vast expanse of space.\nBefore him, a vibrant blue orb, completely submerged in water, shimmered. \"Where am I? Woah, how can I talk in space?\" he mused, a wave of surprise washing over him as he realized he could both breathe and speak in the vacuum.\nJust as his thoughts began to wander, a sudden voice jolted him back to reality.\n[Global notification!]\n[Welcome Players to the Multiverse of Gods.]ᴛhis ᴜpdated by\n[You have your base planet where you are the God, where you can control everything.]\n[Please check your Status to see your God-Talent.]\nSunny's face froze for a second before a chuckle escaped his lips. \"A God-Talent, huh? Let's see. Status!\"\nA translucent, blue system panel materialized before him, a projection of digital information.\n[God Name: unnamed]\n[Planet Name: unnamed]\n[LifeForms: 0]\n[Talent: Skill-Resonance (SSS-Grade)]\n[Faith: 10]\n[Please enter Your God Name...]\n\"Hey system! I want to check my talent first,\" Sunny interjected, his gaze fixed on the coveted SSS-grade rating.\nAs a self-proclaimed shut-in novel reader, he knew SSS-grade signified the absolute pinnacle of power.\nAnother panel flickered into view, offering a detailed breakdown of his unique ability.\n[Talent Name: Skill-Resonance]\n[Grade: SSS]\n[Description: Can copy any talent or skill of any life-form in your territory at the end of every 100 planetary years.]\nSunny gasped, his eyes widening as he absorbed the description.\nHe'd expected an extraordinary SSS-grade talent, but witnessing its potential firsthand was an entirely different experience. \"Once every 100 years is pretty long,\" he murmured, his gaze drifting towards his water-filled planet.\nAs a newly ascended god, he possessed an inherent awareness of every inch of his world, and there were currently no life forms to be found.\n\"There are no life forms on this planet. Doesn't that mean my talent is useless at the start and only becomes powerful as life forms emerge?\" he pondered aloud. \"But forming life takes millions of years, and even more for them to evolve.\nThis really is a useless talent in the beginning.\" Despite the initial setback, Sunny didn't lose heart.\nHe understood the immense power his talent held if he played his cards right as a god.\n\"So, what name should I choose for my God name?\" Sunny pondered for a moment.\n\"Cosmos,\" he declared, a name chosen to evoke the universe, order, and immense scale.\n[God name (Cosmos) selected]\n[Please name your planet...]\n\"Veridia,\" Sunny announced, envisioning a world teeming with lush greenery.\nThe name, derived from \"verdant,\" echoed vibrant life, continuous growth, and rich biodiversity.\n[Planet name (Veridia) selected]\n[Please wait 9 min 34 sec for the opening of your world]\n\"Let's see what else there is to explore,\" Sunny thought, turning his attention back to the system panel.\nHe noticed two additional options: \"God Chat\" and \"Transaction Space.\"\nClicking on \"God Chat\" revealed a bustling panel, thousands of messages scrolling by every second.\n\"Alice, are you also transmigrated here? If you see this message, PM me!\"\n\"Tom, if you see this message, PM me!\"\nMany individuals were desperately searching for loved ones, and some were even finding them amidst the chaos.\nSunny, an orphan since childhood on the \"Blue Planet,\" had no one to seek out, so he closed the chat panel.\n\"It'll take them a while to come back to their senses.\nLet's check the Transaction Space then.\" He clicked the \"Transaction Space\" button, only to be met with another message.\n[Transaction Space will be available after opening of the world]\n[Time Left: 5 min 3 sec]\nFinding nothing else to explore for now, Sunny's gaze drifted back to the bustling chat panel.\n\"Hah! I've become a God now, but my planet is barren, like Mars, with nothing but red soil and tiny ice patches here and there.\"\n\"Upstairs, that's still a good start! My planet is filled with nothing but sand. How can it evolve life forms? Any bigshots with knowledge of bi-life, please help me!\"\n\"I don't think anyone will tell you how to form life. What I'm thinking is, life forms take millions of years to form, even in good life-supporting conditions. What will we do until then? Chat idly?\"\n\"Upstairs, according to my knowledge from different novels, it's possible that the time flow on the planet will be many times faster than our time.\"\n\"We'll know about all that later. But did you guys know I got an S-grade talent?\" A message from a player named Kairos momentarily halted the flood of chat messages, causing a flurry of inquiries about his talent description.\n\"Hello, bigshot! Can you share what talent you got? I have an F-grade talent which increases the percentage of developing blacksmiths in my life forms.\"\n\"Hehe, check this screenshot,\" Kairos typed, attaching an image.\nSunny opened the screenshot, revealing the talent description:\n[Talent Name: Time Accelerate x10]\n[Grade: S]\n[Description: In your territory, the time flow is 10 times more than others.]\n\"Holy moly! Are we even playing the same game? What is this luck? Bigshot, do you need a maid?\"\n\"Upstairs, are you a girl? Can I PM you?\"\nSunny frowned as he looked at Kairos's talent. \"System, are you sure my talent is SSS-grade? Can I get this S-grade talent instead of mine?\" He sighed.\nHe knew his talent was powerful, but a 10x time flow seemed far more balanced and could accelerate his world's progress tenfold.\n\"Sigh! Looking at my water world, I guess I still have a healthy start compared to others,\" Sunny mused, gazing out at his nascent planet.",

      "content": "Chapter 2 - Ch 2 : The First Seed\nThe countdown timer, once a relentless march, finally blinked out of existence.\nA soft chime resonated through the void around Sunny, followed by another global notification.\n[Global notification!]\n[Your world, Veridia, is now open!]\n[Transaction Space is now available!]\nSunny knew there was nothing immediately visible on his world for the time being; it remained a vast, serene blue sphere, its landmasses currently hidden beneath the endless expanse of water.\nSo, he diverted his attention to the \"Transaction Space\" button, which, previously greyed out, now glowed with a vibrant green.\nA surge of anticipation, mixed with a healthy dose of trepidation, surged through him. This was it.\nThe moment he could finally begin shaping his world, moving beyond mere observation.\nHe clicked the \"Transaction Space\" button. The panel shifted, revealing a new interface with two prominent options: \"System Transaction\" and \"Trading Platform.\" Sunny, ever the pragmatist, decided to explore the \"System Transaction\" first.\nWithin this section, only a single item was available, starkly presented against the blue projection.\n[Item name: Basic Knowledge of Life]\n[Grade: E]\n[Description: Can help gods with the understanding of the knowledge of life for forming life.]\n[Cost: 5 Faith Points]\nSunny's eyes widened at the price. Five Faith points.\nHalf of his starting capital, gone in an instant. \"I really envy those who already have the knowledge of bio-life,\" he muttered, thinking of the desperate pleas in the God Chat.\nYet, despite the hefty cost, he didn't hesitate.\nHe was acutely aware of his shortcomings; theoretical study and complex biological processes were definitely not his strongest suit. This was an investment in his own capability.\nHe pressed the \"Buy\" button.\n[Confirm purchase: Basic Knowledge of Life for 5 Faith Points?]\n[Current Faith: 10 -> Remaining Faith: 5]\n\"Confirm.\"\nA small, ethereal scroll, glowing with a soft, cerebral light, materialized before him.\nIt didn't feel solid, but rather like condensed information.\n[Basic Knowledge of Life is placed in system space.]\n[Do you want to absorb this item?]\n[Yes/No]\nSunny pressed \"Yes.\" The scroll dissolved, and an immediate, overwhelming torrent of information flooded his mind.\nIt wasn't just data; it was understanding. Concepts that had once been abstract scientific terms from distant school lessons now clicked into place with startling clarity.\nHe understood Abiogenesis – the intricate dance of inorganic molecules under primordial conditions, energized by lightning and volcanic heat, slowly forming the building blocks of life.\nHe grasped the concept of simple organic molecules polymerizing into complex chains, the elegant simplicity of self-replication as a fundamental characteristic, and the critical conditions required for different organisms to thrive – the need for liquid water, an energy source, specific chemical elements, and a stable environment.\nIt was as if a vast, complex biological textbook had been downloaded directly into his consciousness, not as dry facts, but as intuitive comprehension.\nHe could almost see the amino acids linking, the lipid membranes forming, the first RNA strands replicating.\n\"Woah,\" Sunny breathed, the sheer volume of knowledge making his head spin for a moment before settling into a comfortable, integrated awareness.\nHe now possessed the fundamental principles of life creation and evolution. This was far more valuable than just a seed packet.The source of thɪs content is ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nThis was the instruction manual.\nHe looked at his status panel again.\n[God Name: Cosmos]\n[Planet Name: Veridia]\n[LifeForms: 0]\n[Talent: Skill-Resonance (SSS-Grade)]\n[Faith: 5]\nHis Faith was halved, but his understanding of the task ahead had multiplied exponentially.\nHe now knew how to approach creating life, not just that he needed to.\nWith this newfound wisdom, he opened the \"God Chat.\" The messages were still flowing, but the tone had shifted from frantic searches to a mix of excitement, frustration, and strategic discussion.\n\"Anyone else get a desert planet? Seriously, how am I supposed to grow anything here?\"\n\"My planet has active volcanoes everywhere! At least there's geothermal energy, I guess?\"\n\"Got a frozen ice ball. Think I need to melt it first. Any tips on increasing planetary temperature?\"\n\"To the guy with the ice ball, try focusing your divine energy. It costs Faith, but it's faster than waiting for a sun to do its job!\"\n\"My F-grade talent lets me summon rocks. So far, I've just made a lot of gravel.\"\n\"Haha, at least you can build something! I got 'Slothful Growth' – everything on my planet evolves 0.5x slower. Kill me now.\"\nSunny scrolled to the end of the chat, finding a fresh batch of messages.\nVulcan: \"Guys, any tips how I can form life in a lava-filled planet?\"\nKitsune: \"You can PM me, I can help you.\"\nSunny, armed with his newly acquired \"Basic Knowledge of Life,\" instantly recognized the challenge Vulcan faced and the potential for manipulation. \"Is he helping him or scamming him?\" Sunny mused, a flicker of suspicion in his mind.\nHe knew that forming life on a lava planet would require a very specific, chemosynthetic approach, or massive terraforming – knowledge that wasn't immediately intuitive.\nOthers in the chat seemed to share his skepticism, though perhaps for different reasons.\nVulcan: \"Thanks bigshot, the knowledge you provided is vast. It will surely help me.\"\nKitsune: \"Pleasure is all mine, brother.\"\nAnother God: \"Brother Vulcan, how much you paid for the information? Or was it free?\"\nVulcan: \"How can this profound knowledge be free of cost. I bought it using 7 Faith Points.\"\nA cascade of mocking replies followed.\nStupid: \"Stupid\"\n\"+1\"\n\"+2\"\n... \"+123456\"\n\"You should have bought Basic Knowledge of Life instead of getting scammed.\" Typed another God.\nIn front of his planet, a burly man with bulging muscles, dressed in farming attire, frowned. This was Vulcan.\nHe immediately opened his own transaction space, his eyes scanning the \"System Transaction\" tab. There, clear as day, was the \"Basic Knowledge of Life\" for 5 Faith.\n\"Damn you, Kitsune!\" Vulcan roared, clutching his hands tightly, his face reddening with a mixture of anger and self-reproach.\nSunny watched the drama unfold with a detached amusement. It confirmed his initial suspicion.\nThe \"Trading Platform\" was clearly a place where gods could exchange resources and knowledge, but also where the cunning could prey on the naive.\nHis 5 Faith investment in \"Basic Knowledge of Life\" suddenly felt like an even smarter move.\nWith this newfound wisdom, Sunny re-opened the \"System Transaction\" space, but found no other items available for purchase at his current Faith level.\nThe scroll he had just absorbed was the only item within his reach. He closed the transaction panel, his gaze returning to his vast, watery world.\nNow, it was time to apply his knowledge. He had the understanding of abiogenesis, the conditions for life, and the principles of self-replication.\nHe didn't need a pre-made seed packet. He was a god. He could build it.\nHe focused on Veridia, feeling its immense liquid mass, the dissolved minerals, the faint warmth from its core, the light filtering through the upper layers.\nWith his mind, guided by the intricate knowledge now embedded within him, he began to subtly manipulate the very fabric of his world.\nHe envisioned the primordial soup, the lightning strikes, the hydrothermal vents – not as physical objects he needed to create, but as processes he could initiate on a microscopic, chemical level.\nHe concentrated, a faint glow emanating from his ethereal form as he channeled his remaining Faith.\nHe directed the energy, not in a grand, visible spectacle, but in a precise, microscopic dance.\nHe stimulated the formation of complex organic molecules in the sunlit surface waters, encouraged the self-assembly of lipid membranes, and provided the subtle energetic nudges for the first self-replicating RNA strands to emerge.\nIt was like conducting an invisible orchestra of atoms and energy.\n[Divine Action: Primordial Spark Initiated. Cost: 5 Faith Points.]\n[Current Faith: 5 -> Remaining Faith: 0]\nFor a moment, nothing happened.\nThen, a single, microscopic flicker of green light appeared deep within Veridia's sunlit waters.\nIt was incredibly subtle, visible only to his divine sight, but it was there.\nThe first spark. Life. A single, self-replicating organism, the simplest form of algae, had begun its existence, not from a purchased packet, but from his direct, knowledgeable, and now Faith-depleted intervention.\nA profound sense of accomplishment washed over him. He, Cosmos, had created life. It wasn't grand, it wasn't complex, but it was the beginning.\nHe checked his status again.\n[God Name: Cosmos]\n[Planet Name: Veridia]\n[LifeForms: 1]\n[Talent: Skill-Resonance (SSS-Grade)]\n[Faith: 0]\n\"One,\" he chuckled, a sense of quiet triumph filling him. It was a humble start, but a start nonetheless.\nNow, the waiting game truly began, but this time, he understood the rules of the game far better.\nHis Faith was now at zero. He needed a way to generate more. Faith, he realized, was likely generated by the life forms on his planet, perhaps through their sheer existence, their evolution, or eventually, their worship.\nMore life, more Faith. It was a positive feedback loop, but a slow one, especially with only a single life form.\nHe spent the next few \"hours\" simply observing. He tried to nudge the single algae, to encourage faster multiplication, but found his remaining 0 Faith was insufficient for any meaningful direct intervention beyond the initial spark.\nHe needed to let nature take its course, for now.\n\"System, what is the time flow ratio of Veridia to my perception?\"\n[Veridia Time Flow: 10000 hours (planetary) = 1 hour (god)]\nSunny blinked. \"So, 10,000 hours on Veridia pass for every hour I perceive,\" he murmured, quickly calculating. \"That means 100 planetary years for Skill-Resonance to activate is roughly 876,000 hours divided by 10,000 hours per hour, which is 87.6 hours of my perception.\nThat's about 3.65 days.\"\nIt was still a waiting game, but a far more manageable one than a literal century.\nThis was a crucial piece of information. He wouldn't be waiting around for eons in his own time.\nHe could actively oversee Veridia's evolution, even if it was a slow burn.\nHe focused on the single microscopic algae, watching it divide, then divide again.\nSlowly, imperceptibly, the numbers began to climb.\n\"This is truly a healthy start,\" Sunny said, a small smile gracing his lips.\nHis planet was water, clean and ready, with its hidden landmasses awaiting future revelation.\nHe had the most basic life, directly willed into existence. And he had a talent that, while dormant, promised ultimate power.\nThe race was on, and while he might be starting slow, Cosmos had a long game in mind.\nThe first seed had been planted. Now, he just had to wait for it to grow. And grow. And eventually, evolve.",

      "content": "Chapter 3 - Ch 3 : The Weight of Eons\nSunny frowned, a subtle discord rippling through his cosmic awareness. Something felt off—the algae, though proliferating, weren't evolving at the expected dizzying pace, not with a 10,000x time acceleration for his world.\nHe had envisioned rapid, explosive diversification, a biological kaleidoscope unfolding before his divine eyes. Instead, it was... leisurely.\n\"System, why isn't time flowing at 10,000x speed?\" he queried, a hint of impatience in his mental tone.\n[Time is flowing at 10,000x speed.]\n[As a god, your consciousness synchronizes with the observed world. Your perception is also accelerated to match.]\nA slow, dawning comprehension spread across Sunny's cosmic consciousness, chilling him with its implications.\n\"So that's why my algae were not evolving 10,000 times faster,\" he murmured, the realization settling like stardust.\n\"But slowly dividing, in what felt like real-time.\" The System's logic, once explained, was elegantly simple, yet profoundly disorienting.\nTo truly observe a world, to immerse oneself in its temporal flow, required a commensurate acceleration of one's own perception.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nHis divine brain, a magnificent instrument, had simply synchronized with the accelerated reality he was witnessing.\nHe had been, in essence, living those millennia alongside his nascent ecosystems, experiencing their slow, deliberate march through evolution at their pace, not his own.\nThe sheer, unfathomable scale of time, compressed and then expanded, left a subtle ache in his awareness.\nIt was a peculiar burden of godhood: the ability to witness eons unfold in what felt like moments, only to discover those 'moments' were, to his own perception, just as long as the eons themselves.\nThe rapid division of the algae, though numerically astounding, had felt like watching a time-lapse film play at normal speed, each frame meticulously observed.\nWith a mental command, Sunny disengaged from direct observation, pulling back his consciousness.\nThe shimmering, accelerated view of his burgeoning world receded, replaced by the familiar, stable interface of the God Cosmos, and the more conventional flow of his own existence.\nA deep sigh escaped him, though as a being of pure consciousness, it was more a mental exhalation.\nHe opened the God Chat, seeking a distraction and perhaps some commiseration.\nThe chaotic stream of messages was a familiar sight, but their content had shifted from initial bewilderment to a mix of despair and cautious optimism.\n\"I am dying here. I used up all my faith to form an algae. But it died.\" The message was from a user named 'Despair'. Sunny felt a pang of sympathy; a similar fate could have befallen him.\n\"Upstairs I have only 10 algae for now I will trade with you once I have more.\" Another message from 'Hopeful_God'.\n\"He doesn't have faith points. What can he even trade with?\" 'Pragmatist' chimed in, highlighting the grim reality of a bankrupt God.\n\"God of no lifeforms haha,\" mocked 'Joker', perhaps a tad too gleefully.\n\"You can wait for the lifeform to develop themselves. It will be slow but with 10,000x time it is possible,\" offered 'Strategist', referencing the standard time acceleration, oblivious to Sunny's recent, disorienting revelation about perceived time.\nSunny was joyful that his algae hadn't died; otherwise, he would have been utterly broken.\nThe thought of losing his entire starting investment made him wince.\nJust as he was scrolling through the chat, a powerful, invigorating sensation surged through him.\nIt was subtle at first, then intensified, a warm, flowing energy. He refocused on Veridia.\nThousands upon thousands of his algae were no longer just passively floating; some were actively moving, engulfing weaker, less efficient kin.\nIt was an invisible war of the microscopic, a brutal, elegant dance of natural selection playing out in the vast oceanic canvas.\nHe knew what this new sensation was. \"Faith!\" Sunny exclaimed, his mental voice reverberating with newfound vigor.\n\"Status!\"\nA fresh panel materialized, updated with astonishing numbers.\n[God name: Cosmos]\n[Planet: Veridia]\n[Lifeforms: 15,334,566]\n[Talent: Skill-Resonance (SSS-grade)]\n[Faith points: 0.0023124]\nSunny blinked, then reread the \"Lifeforms\" count. \"15 million?!\" he murmured, a genuine surprise.\nThe slow perception was deceptive; his world had been teeming with life while he mused in the chat.\nThe initial trickle of Faith, though small, was a testament to this burgeoning population.\n\"System, how does my faith increase?\" he immediately asked. The decimal points suggested a continuous, subtle generation, but he needed clarity.\n[Faith can be increased using prayers of wise race or death of any lifeforms according to their intelligence and strength.]\n\"System, what is a wise race?\" Sunny pressed, a new goal forming in his mind.\n[A wise race possesses the capacity for complex thought, self-awareness, and the ability to formulate abstract concepts such as belief, worship, and reverence. Their prayers, when directed towards a deity, generate significant faith.]\nSunny nodded slowly. So, the tiny 0.0023124 Faith was likely from the sheer number of algae living and dying, a constant, low-level churn.\nTrue, substantial Faith, the kind that would unlock major divine interventions, would come from sentient beings. That was the long game.\n\"Should I intervene to increase the evolution?\" he pondered, gazing at the microscopic world of Veridia.\nBut then he saw his Faith points, still in that minuscule decimal, and sighed. \"Let's wait for few minutes to increase my faith points somewhat.\" He needed a buffer.\nSunny again opened the God Chat to pass the time, hoping for more insight or simply entertainment.\nKairos: \"Do you guys want to see something?\"\n\"What are you boasting about this time Kairos?\" 'Skeptic' shot back.\n\"I want to see what the bigshot is boasting,\" added 'Curious_God'.\n\"+1\"...\"+12345.\" A predictable flood of agreement followed.\n\"See this,\" Kairos typed, attaching an image.\nSunny opened the image and felt a jolt of astonishment.\nIt was a clear depiction of Kairos's lifeforms: not algae, not even simple multicellular organisms, but something far more complex.\nA chitinous exoskeleton, segmented body, multiple legs – an Arthropod. A beetle-like insect, scuttling across what looked like mossy ground.\n\"10 times faster then others is truly terrifying. I am evolving my algae and he is boasting about his Arthropods,\" Sunny muttered, a mix of admiration and envy swirling within him.\nKairos's S-grade talent, \"Time Accelerate x10,\" was proving to be incredibly powerful in the early game.\nThe chat exploded with reactions:\n\"My algae died and here the bigshot has already evolved his lifeforms to Arthropods.\"\n\"I want to hug the bigshot's thighs.\"\n\"I want to have monkeys for bigshot.\" The desperation and sycophancy were palpable.\nSunny closed the chat after a few more minutes, a fresh resolve hardening his divine will.\nHe wasn't Kairos, but he had his own path.\nHe checked his faith points again, the decimals now replaced by whole numbers. The sheer scale of life on Veridia was generating Faith faster than he had initially realized, especially now that evolution was truly kicking in and more complex algae were consuming weaker ones.\nThe algae populations were already above 1 billion, a testament to their incredibly efficient reproduction in a suitable environment.\nAnd his faith points stood at a healthy 16.1526153. This was it.\n\"Now I can intervene to increase the evolution!\" Sunny grinned, a surge of divine power flowing through him.\nHe wouldn't directly force evolution, but he could create the conditions for it.\nHe used 4 Faith points to subtly decrease the available resources for the algae.\nNot to a starvation point, which would decimate them, but just enough to spike the competition for survival.\nThis gentle pressure would act as a powerful evolutionary accelerator, pushing the fittest to adapt and thrive.\nIt was a delicate balance: too little competition would stagnate growth, too much would cause mass extinction.\nNext, with a powerful mental push, he used another 6 Faith points to evaporate the vast, obscuring layers of water in strategic areas. Slowly, majestically, landmasses began to emerge from the depths of Veridia. Continents, islands, mountain ranges – not perfectly formed, but nascent land.\nThis would open up entirely new ecological niches, forcing the evolving life forms to adapt to a terrestrial environment.\nThe drowning landscape, once a uniform blue, was now revealing its hidden topography.\nThe remaining 5 Faith points he kept as an emergency reserve. If the lifeforms somehow vanished or stalled disastrously, he would need them.\nSunny then sat back quietly, observing the profound changes wrought by his will.\nThe newly exposed landmasses steamed under the nascent sun, slowly drying, preparing for the arrival of life.\nThe vast, billion-strong algae population, now stressed by resource scarcity, was already showing subtle signs of further diversification, adapting to new pressures. He began to think about the next steps.\nThe first seed had grown, and now, the true complexity of a living world was ready to unfold.",

      "content": "Chapter 4 - Ch 4 : Misfortune\nIt had just been half an hour since Veridia's grand opening.\nIn the terms of the world itself, that translated to approximately 208 days, a significant stretch of time for burgeoning life.\nSunny grimaced as he considered the disparity. \"I really envy Kairos for this talent of his,\" he muttered to himself.\n\"In his world, 2,000 days would have already passed.\nWith divine intervention, the evolution and faith points will surely increase wildly.\" The sheer temporal advantage felt insurmountable.\nYet, on Veridia, a quiet drama was unfolding beneath the waves.\nThe sprawling, vibrant algae populations faced their first existential crisis.\nThe huge threat of predatory algae had pushed their less adaptable kin to the brink of extinction.\nBut evolution, ever resourceful, sparked a miraculous defense.\nAlgae that could harness light, others that utilized dissolved soil nutrients, and those uniquely adapted to the specific conditions of the nascent sea united.\nIn a monumental leap, they formed the first multicellular algae in the world of Veridia.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n[Congratulations God Cosmos for the first multicellular life in your world!]\nSunny grinned at the notification, a surge of triumph washing over him.\nThis was progress, tangible and significant. \"It's just a matter of time until I also gain arthropods,\" he chuckled, thinking of Kairos's boasting. \"About an hour, I guess.\"\nHis internal clock, still calibrated to his own perception, estimated the time until a similar evolutionary leap.\nHe checked his status panel. His faith points had stabilized and were now at a respectable 10 in total.\nDeciding to capitalize on this surge, Sunny made two swift interventions.\nHe used 2 faith points to subtly decrease the resources in the sea, intensifying the evolutionary pressure on the now multicellular aquatic life.\nThen, with a more significant expenditure, he channeled 4 faith points to increase the nutrient availability on the newly exposed landmasses.\nHis goal was clear: to entice the microcellular algae, and soon the nascent multicellular forms, to venture onto land and evolve into early fungi or plants, charting a path toward terrestrial life.\nWith his divine work set in motion for the immediate future, Sunny disengaged from direct observation of Veridia and opened the God Chat.\n\"Sigh! I am truly bored. I can't just look at the algae growing; it was fascinating at first, but now it is just the same thing again and again,\" typed a God named 'Black Tongue', echoing a sentiment many must have felt after the initial novelty wore off.\nJust then, a chilling System notification rang worldwide, appearing simultaneously for all the Gods.\n[Global Notification]\n[All Gods! Every day there will be one major misfortune on your world.]\n[It can be plagues, disasters, and many other mystic misfortunes.]\n[And death due to Misfortune will not provide any faith points.]\n[Players can use their Faith points to prevent the misfortune.]\n[Be ready, Gods!]\nThe chat exploded in a torrent of furious messages.\n\"Curse you, Black Tongue!\" typed a God, followed by countless others echoing the sentiment, blaming the bored deity for tempting fate.\n\"Stop it, guys! I think this is added to prevent idle Gods which doesn't have any lifeforms,\" offered a more pragmatic voice.\n\"I agree with the god upstairs,\" another chimed in, offering a philosophical, albeit unsettling, explanation. \"According to the conservation of energy, we all transported from Blue Star will require a lot of energy.\nAnd making us God, which means a near-immortal existence, will also require a lot of energy. This energy will be gained back using the misfortune, either through the death or the paid fee from the Gods.\"\n\"Doesn't that mean we are just livestock? To farm faith points or energy?\" a voice of despair questioned.\n\"Upstairs, what were you in the Blue Planet? You were probably also a livestock there. For me, it is a new life; instead of dying of hunger there, I would like to live like a God here.\" The blunt, almost brutal realism of this last message silenced the chat. The implication, that their previous lives were no less a form of \"livestock,\" struck a deep, uncomfortable chord.\nBut the silence was soon broken by a familiar, desperate plea. \"Bigshots, you forgot about humble me. I still had a chance gaining life forms by waiting. But now, a day will mean about 27 years (planetary), and without divine intervention, it will not be enough to evolve a life form. How will I tackle misfortune?\" The irony was sharp; how could a misfortune affect a world devoid of life?\n\"What misfortune can you even face? You don't have a lifeform, so what can plague and disasters even do?\" a God retorted, highlighting the chilling reality of having nothing to lose. The chat again went back to silent, a profound, existential quiet.\nSunny chuckled darkly, a detached amusement at the irony playing out. The misfortune notification was a brutal twist, adding a new layer of challenge and urgency to their godhood.\nHe then noticed the number of active Gods in the chat: just about 300,000. \"System, why, instead of 8 billion population of Blue Planet, are only 300,000 here?\" he queried, the discrepancy striking him.\n[In this Universe there are only 300,000 Gods. And the Other Gods are in Different Universe.]\nSunny's eyes widened, a cold certainty settling in his divine awareness. \"Doesn't that mean the Gods will eventually clash with each other to expand and control their whole universe?\" Sunny surmised, a grim realization dawning.\nHe had been dimly aware of this potential issue from the start, a subtle undercurrent in the \"Multiverse of Gods\" title, but the immediate, all-consuming task of evolving life had pushed such grand, interstellar conflicts to the back of his mind.\nNow, with the universe clarified as a finite, shared space, the true long-term game had just begun.\nSurvival wasn't just about evolving his world; it was about preparing for inevitable, divine warfare.",

      "content": "Chapter 5 - Ch 5 : The Green Tide and Whispers of Divine Hierarchy\nAs the first hour of God-time drew to a close, a happy, almost incredulous smile spread across Sunny's face.\nIt wasn't the kind of wide, boisterous grin he might have worn on the Blue Planet, but a subtle, deeply satisfying acknowledgment of his divine success.\nThe reason? The astonishing emergence of life on the newly revealed landmasses of Veridia.\nDue to the immense amount of resources he had channeled into these nascent continents, the microscopic pioneers — mosses and lichens, mere specks in the grand scheme — were no longer content with their humble forms.\nThey were evolving, rapidly and visibly, transforming into a diverse array of terrestrial flora: rudimentary plants, simple shrubs, and even the beginnings of bushes.\nThe formerly barren, steaming rock was slowly but surely taking on a verdant hue, a testament to his focused divine will and the inherent adaptability of life itself.\n\"Even with divine intervention, I didn't think it was possible to evolve lifeforms to such an extent so quickly,\" Sunny surmised, genuine surprise lacing his thoughts.\nThe speed of development felt almost unnatural, defying his prior expectations of slow, eons-long progression.\nHe decided to ask the System about it, a direct inquiry to the omnipresent interface.\n\"Hey System! Why is evolution so swift in this world?\"\n[The Evolution rate for first 7 Godly days is 1000% fast.]\nThis succinct statement instantly dispelled all doubts in Sunny's mind. A 1000% (or 10x) acceleration in the baseline evolutionary rate for the initial seven Godly days was an incredible boon.\nIt meant that his water world, despite its humble beginnings, was undergoing a hyper-accelerated developmental phase, a cosmic head start that compensated for his initial lack of diverse lifeforms or a time-accelerating talent like Kairos's.\nBut a new thought quickly surfaced: why was this crucial information not yet rampant in the God Chat? \"Those blabbers and boasters will not remain silent in chat if they knew about this,\" he mused, a flicker of suspicion joining his satisfaction.\nWas this hidden knowledge, or was something else at play?New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nHe opened the Chat panel, scrolling through the usual mix of complaints and minor boasts.\nAfter a few minutes, one message, typed by a God named 'Curiosity', caught his eye.\n\"Hey guys! I asked the System about the time of my misfortune and it said it can be anytime in this day. Do you understand what it means?\"\n\"Bullshit! System doesn't answer any of the question. It is unreliable,\" retorted one God, immediately dismissing the claim.\n\"I agree,\" another chimed in. \"I just asked for the how much is the time acceleration and it didn't answer me. Unreliable++.\"\n\"Wait a minute! Does that mean we have different systems? Because mine answers sometimes too,\" a third God interjected, sparking a wave of confused questions.\n\"Let's analyze, guys! What is the thing which can be different since before the opening of the world?\" typed the God named 'Strategist', attempting to bring order to the chaos.\nMany theories, ranging from starting planet types to initial faith points, began to flood the comments.\n\"Guys, wait!\" Strategist typed again, his next message coming swiftly. \"According to me, the answer is talent.\"\nThis theory made the whole chat fall silent. It was a simple, yet profound, insight that had eluded most.\nStrategist, sensing his advantage, began to clear their doubts. \"Hey Curiosity, what grade is your talent? And two brother below him, what is yours?\"\n\"B-Grade,\" Curiosity typed, confirming his talent level.\n\"F-Grade,\" replied 'Brother 1'.\n\"No Talent,\" came the stark, almost melancholic admission from 'Brother 2'.\nThe chat came to silence again, a different kind of quiet this time, heavy with the weight of implied hierarchy.\n\"No talent? Haha. If I were in your place, I would have buried myself instead of chatting here,\" typed 'Joker', ever present to mock the less fortunate Gods.\nSunny noticed this God, a constant presence who seemed to relish every chance to make fun of poor or struggling deities.\n\"According to me, the higher the Talent, the higher the authority to ask the question from system,\" Strategist continued, undeterred by Joker's barb. \"For example, I have an S-Grade talent, but when I asked the System why there are only 300,000 Gods in this Chat, the System didn't answer. If anyone has talent higher than S, can you confirm my doubts and ask System this question?\"\n\"Woah! Another S-grade talent,\" typed one God, awe in their digital voice.\n\"Bigshot, can you explain your talent to us poor Gods?\" a chorus of voices pleaded.\n\"+1,\" \"+2,\" \"...+231322.\" The request quickly garnered hundreds of thousands of upvotes, a clear indication of the collective desperation for knowledge and advantage.\n\"Look then,\" Strategist typed, attaching an image.\nSunny curiously opened the image, and his face subtly distorted in a mixture of anger and disbelief.\n[Talent name: Children of Wisdom]\n[Grade: S]\n[Detail: All the lifeforms born in your territory will have 5 times the wisdom.]\n\"System, why are all the S-talent stronger than my SSS-Grade talent?\" Sunny complained silently, a mental shout of frustration.\nHis \"Skill-Resonance\" was powerful, but situational and with a long cooldown.\nThese S-grades seemed to offer immediate, constant, and far-reaching advantages.\nThe System, however, chose to ignore him, maintaining its stoic silence.\nThe revelation from Strategist broke every other God in the chat.\n\"Crying ;-;. Why is the gap so big?\" typed one God, expressing the universal sentiment of unfairness.\n\"I don't think it is that great of a talent,\" said a God named 'Brutal', perhaps trying to downplay its significance.\n\"You don't understand,\" another God typed, countering Brutal. \"While your algae is developing slowly, his algae will find different ways to evolve and survive with the help of that wisdom.\"\nSunny's thoughts echoed this sentiment, but he saw an even more terrifying aspect.\n\"They don't understand the real threat of this talent,\" he thought.\n\"While it is terrifying in the start, where the lifeforms will evolve and survive easily, it will become truly Godly when the wise races start developing.\" A wise race, according to the System, possessed complex thought and the capacity for belief.\nImagine such a race with five times the normal wisdom.\n\"One genius will take 50 years to develop something, but one genius with wisdom x 5 can do it in 1 or 2 years. Isn't it more terrifying than Kairos's talent?\" Sunny wondered, the implications of such accelerated intellectual development sending a chill down his divine spine.\nThis 'Children of Wisdom' talent wasn't just about faster evolution; it was about compressed history, rapidly advancing his future towards sentience, technology, and formidable power.",

      "content": "Chapter 6 - Ch 6 : The Subtle Plunge and the Genetic Hunt\nAs the two-hour mark of God-time approached, a quiet sense of satisfaction settled over Sunny.\nHis divine interventions had paid off handsomely. Veridia, once a vast blue marble, was now a vibrant tapestry of life.\nGreenery adorned every newly exposed landmass, a testament to the rapid proliferation of the mosses, lichens, and the burgeoning forms of plants, shrubs, and bushes.\nIn the aquatic realm, the multicellular algae had continued their relentless evolution. Small, rudimentary fish-like creatures now darted through the water, their primitive eyes scanning for sustenance.\nSome of these early aquatic inhabitants had even developed rudimentary outer shells, a nascent defense against the emerging predators in the primordial soup.\n\"Even with divine intervention, I didn't think it was possible to evolve lifeforms to such an extent in just two Godly hours,\" Sunny mused, a genuine awe in his cosmic consciousness.\nThe 1000% faster evolution rate for the first 7 Godly days was truly a cheat code, accelerating eons of natural selection into a blink of his divine eye.\nHaving become a God, Sunny found himself with an abundance of \"time\" on his hands.\nHe had developed a new routine: leisurely observing the intricate dance of life on Veridia, monitoring his steadily climbing Faith points, and occasionally dipping into the chaotic, yet strangely comforting, stream of the God Chat.\nIt was during one of these routine checks, he found an anomaly.\n\"The faith points stopped increasing?\" Sunny exclaimed in surprise, his mental voice echoing in the void.\nHis habit of checking his Faith points every few minutes had ingrained their rapid, almost rhythmic increase into his awareness.\nBefore, they had been surging, gaining roughly 1 Faith point every 2 minutes or so, a steady climb that had brought his current total to a comfortable 27.14 Faith points.\nBut now, the counter was stagnant. Utterly, unnervingly still.\n\"System, why are my Faith points not increasing?\" Sunny demanded, a flicker of unease turning into a grim premonition. There was no reply, only the vast silence of the cosmic void.\n\"Is this a misfortune?\" Sunny grimaced. The global notification from before had warned of daily misfortunes, and this sudden halt in Faith generation, coupled with the System's silence, felt like a direct hit.\nHe had mentally prepared for grand, cataclysmic events – earthquakes, tsunamis, meteor showers – and had even mentally rehearsed solutions for each. But this was different, insidious.\nHe immediately began observing his world with heightened intensity, searching for any potential sign of the misfortune.\nHis gaze swept across the verdant landmasses and plunged into the depths of the oceans.\nThe dwindling number of lifeforms, though not yet catastrophic, was a clear indicator of a problem.\nA huge loss of lifeforms would mean a huge loss of potential Faith, a blow he couldn't afford.\nIt took approximately 1 month of planetary time (which, given the 10,000x time flow, was still just a few minutes of Sunny's perceived time) for him to pinpoint the root cause of this silent catastrophe.\nIt wasn't overtly dramatic, but it was relentless.\nThe vast colonies of algae, the very foundation of his aquatic ecosystem, were dying.\nThey were not being consumed by predators, nor were they suffering from a lack of light or nutrients.\nTheir demise was slow, pervasive, and utterly baffling at first glance.\nThe reason for their death, once he meticulously traced the subtle indicators, was horrifyingly simple: \"Oxygen Depletion,\" Sunny grimaced.\nThe massive, unchecked proliferation of life, particularly the rapidly growing multicellular algae and the new fish-like creatures, had consumed oxygen faster than it could be replenished.\nThe balance of his primordial world had been tipped.\nHis \"Basic Knowledge of Life,\" the ethereal scroll he had absorbed, now proved invaluable.\nIt contained not just theoretical understanding, but practical applications for planetary management.Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nIt outlined ways to increase oxygen levels in a planet.\nOne method was direct divine intervention: he could use his divine power to break water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, then combine the oxygen atoms to form breathable O2, and finally dissolve this oxygen directly into the seawater.\nThis was a powerful, immediate solution, but it came with a steep price.\nSuch a grand-scale manipulation would consume more than one-third of his current 27.14 Faith points, leaving him dangerously low for future misfortunes.\nThe second way was to use the evolution of lifeforms themselves to create organisms that could effectively produce oxygen.\nWhile the newly evolved plants and bushes on land were contributing, they were not the primary oxygen producers.\nSunny knew from his memories of the Blue Planet that even there, only about 29% of oxygen was formed by land plants and trees; the vast majority came from the oceans. Relying solely on land plants for this crisis was not a viable long-term solution.\nSunny's preference was clear: he wanted to take the second, evolutionary path, to save his precious Faith points.\nBut he also understood that evolution was not simple. One misstep, one incorrect nudge, could lead to failed evolution, mass extinction, and the complete collapse of his nascent ecosystems.\nThe risk was immense.\nHe weighed his options, the silent, dying world of Veridia pressing down on his cosmic consciousness.\nHe needed a solution that was both effective and sustainable, one that addressed the immediate crisis while building resilience for the future.\nHe decided on a hybrid approach, a path that combined both options while conserving Faith points and simultaneously accelerating the evolution of oxygen-producing organisms.\nHis plan was simple in concept, complex in execution: spend a moderate amount of Faith (he mentally targeted 4-6 points) to selectively boost the oxygen-producing efficiency of specific algae types, and to accelerate the evolution of more oxygen-efficient traits across his aquatic lifeforms.\nThis was cheaper than direct oxygenation, but it would take time – planetary time – risking more lifeforms if the problem persisted.\nBut Sunny was resolute. He was sure about the risks.\nHe estimated that a few hundred million of his lifeforms, a significant number but a small fraction of his billions-strong population, would be lost at most.\nA calculated sacrifice for long-term stability.\nThe \"Basic Knowledge of Life\" had provided him with key notes about genetic code and the ability to influence it through divine power (Faith).\nHowever, Sunny, despite his newfound divine comprehension, was not a geneticist.\nHe didn't possess an intuitive understanding of every specific gene sequence.\nHis only option was a painstaking process of hit and trial.\nHe plunged his consciousness back into Veridia, focusing on the microscopic world of algae.\nHe began to channel his Faith, a subtle, warm energy flowing from him.\nHe would mentally \"touch\" a specific genetic sequence within an algae cell, observe the minute changes, and then repeat the process, millions of times over, across countless individual organisms.\nIt was like blindly searching for a single, crucial switch in a vast, complex control panel, relying on the subtle feedback from the System and the dying organisms themselves.\nHe was looking for the genetic trigger that would make them hyper-efficient at photosynthesis, at breaking down CO2 and releasing O2.\nThe process was tedious, demanding immense focus and draining his mental energy even as it consumed Faith.\nHe spent what felt like an eternity, patiently, meticulously, trying one genetic permutation after another.\nThe dying algae were a constant, grim reminder of the urgency.\nAfter 3 planetary days of this relentless, divine genetic hunt – days that felt like hours of intense concentration to Sunny – he finally felt a distinct shift.\nA surge of recognition, a clear, undeniable feedback from the System. He had found it.\nThe specific genetic code responsible for supercharging oxygen production in one of the algae strains.\nHe had identified the key. Now, the real work of accelerating its spread and impact could begin.\nThe immediate crisis wasn't over, but the path to recovery had just been illuminated.",

      "content": "Chapter 7 - Ch 7 : The Breath of Veridia and new items\nNow that Sunny had successfully identified the specific genetic code required to combat the oxygen depletion, he needed to implement the solution.\nHe had a lead, a divine blueprint for enhanced photosynthesis; now he had to make it reality.\nChannelling his remaining divine energy, Sunny focused his will on the Veridia ecosystem.\nHe didn't simply inject oxygen; that would be a temporary fix.\nInstead, he channeled 6 Faith points into actively spreading and reinforcing the identified genetic code within the algae population.\nThis was an Evolutionary Nudge, a subtle but profound manipulation of the genetic destiny of his aquatic life.\nSunny's divine power worked as a catalyst, accelerating the rate at which these specific, hyper-efficient algae reproduced and outcompeted their weaker kin.\nHe was prioritizing the \"fittest\" organisms and ensuring their survival.\nThis would not solve the misfortune immediately; the enhanced algae needed time to propagate and increase their population effectively.\nBut it guaranteed that oxygen production would eventually surge, restoring balance to Veridia's atmosphere.\nWith the process set in motion, Sunny pulled back from direct observation.\nThe biological recovery would take time, even with the accelerated evolution.\nHe needed to wait approximately 5 Godly minutes, which translated to roughly one month in planetary time.\nHe opened the God Chat, seeking distraction and perhaps insights into the wider multiverse.\nThe chat was a chaotic mix of fear and boasts, centered primarily on the newly introduced misfortunes.\n\"Am I that unlucky to face the misfortune this early?\" typed one God, echoing a shared sense of anxiety.\n\"I haven't experienced any misfortune yet and my faith points are increasing rapidly. Already have 12 faith points,\" boasted another God, oblivious to the fact that his luck might be running out.\n\"I am scared, I have only 6 faith points. I don't know what my misfortune will be,\" typed a third, a visceral fear in his words.\n\"Those who are facing their misfortune, can you explain what type of misfortune did you face?\" typed a God trying to get some information.\n\"Who would be stupid enough to share this info?\" Sunny sighed, observing the response.\nHe knew that in the long run, conflicts would be inevitable.\nYet, he also believed that sharing basic information could prevent unnecessary suffering and potentially lead to stronger alliances.\n\"Peace can be an option, but many Gods will still have conflict,\" Sunny mused. \"Even if the Gods don't fight, the wise lifeforms will surely brew some conflict.\"\nAs he pondered this, a surprising shift occurred in the chat.\nAbout a dozen Gods began openly explaining their misfortunes, some even asking for advice on how to solve their predicaments.\nSunny glanced at the descriptions. Most of the misfortunes were typical disasters: tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or sudden droughts.\nNo one had disclosed a misfortune similar to Sunny's subtle, ecological crisis.\nIt was as if they were hiding the information, unwilling to reveal weaknesses beyond the obvious natural disasters.\nSunny closed the chat panel and glanced at Veridia.\nHis Faith points were increasing, a good sign, but not as fast as before.\nHe could see that the lifeforms were still dying very quickly. \"The problem is not solved yet,\" Sunny surmised, his understanding of Veridia's situation sharpening.\nThe Faith points were coming from algae that were dying a natural death , not from the misfortune being cleared.\nHe waited, trusting the evolutionary process he had initiated.\nAfter 5 Godly minutes of this anxious observation, the long-awaited notification rang in Sunny's mind.Follow current novels on ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\n[Congratulation God Cosmos for clearing your first misfortune]\n\"Only work and no Gifts,\" Sunny thought, a pang of frustration stirring within him.\nHe was acutely aware of these types of challenges from reading hundreds of novels— you complete a difficult task and expect a tangible reward, only to receive a standard notification.\nHe had risked his Faith and put in the mental effort; a simple \"Congratulations\" felt inadequate.\nAs if to reply to his thoughts, another System notification rang, a pleasant chime that immediately captured his attention.\n[New items have been added to the System Shop]\n\"Now that's something good,\" Sunny thought, his frustration replaced by anticipation. \"Open System Shop.\"\nThe translucent panel materialized before him. The shop, previously featuring only the Basic Knowledge of Life, now had five new items.\nSystem Shop Update\n[Atmosphere Kit (E-Grade): Provides basic atmospheric elements essential for diverse life beyond simple aquatic forms. Useful for barren or highly specialized planets.\nCost: 5 Faith]\n[Mineral Seed Vein (D-Grade): Introduces concentrated deposits of common minerals into a chosen landmass. Essential for future geological processes, early technology, or specific lifeforms.\nCost: 10 Faith]\n[Climate Stabilizer (C-Grade): Reduces extreme weather fluctuations or moderates planetary temperature swings. Useful for harsh environments.\nCost: 20 Faith]\n[Basic Hydrological Cycle (D-Grade): Establishes or enhances a planet's water cycle, promoting rain, rivers, and diverse water bodies on land.\nCost: 20 Faith]\n[Microbial Diversity Pack (C-Grade): Introduces a range of beneficial microbial life (e.g., nitrogen-fixing bacteria, decomposers) to accelerate early ecosystem development and nutrient cycling.\nCost: 20 Faith]\nSunny studied the new offerings. The Atmosphere Kit and Mineral Seed Vein were clearly aimed at Gods with barren, Mars-like planets, or those wanting to accelerate technological development.\nThe Climate Stabilizer was useful but less critical for Veridia, which already had a relatively moderate environment.\nThe Basic Hydrological Cycle and Microbial Diversity Pack, however, caught his attention.\nWhile Veridia was a water world, the Hydrological Cycle would accelerate the formation of freshwater rivers and lakes on the emerging landmasses, providing new biomes for evolution.\nThe Microbial Diversity Pack was also invaluable; decomposers and nutrient cyclers were essential for creating healthy soil on the land, a necessary step for the developing plants and bushes.\n\"These are valuable additions,\" Sunny thought. He was still low on Faith after his recent expenditures, but his efforts to address the oxygen depletion were now paying off.\nHis enhanced algae were beginning to thrive, and his Faith points were slowly starting to rise again.\nHe closed the System Shop panel. The crisis was averted, and new tools were available.\nSunny knew that the next misfortune was only a day away, but for now, Veridia was breathing again.",

He opened the System Shop, his gaze lingering on the new items.\nThe Microbial Diversity Pack was tempting, a proactive shield against unforeseen biological threats.\nBut his eyes were drawn to a different item, one that promised to accelerate the expansion of his terrestrial ecosystems.\n[Basic Hydrological Cycle (D-Grade): Establishes or enhances a planet's water cycle, promoting rain, rivers, and diverse water bodies on land.\nCost: 20 Faith]\nThe landmasses were a vast, untapped potential.\nWhile some plants had already colonized them, they were still desolate compared to the teeming oceans.\nA proper hydrological cycle would create a network of rivers and freshwater lakes, carving out diverse biomes and providing new evolutionary pathways for life to explore.\nIt was a strategic choice to invest in the land, a move that would set the stage for more complex life forms down the line.\nSunny settled into a quiet vigil, watching his world and his Faith counter.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nAs the minutes of his perceived time passed, his Faith points ticked upwards, each one a testament to a life lived and died in his thriving world.\nHe had started the hour with 20-ish Faith, and now it was steadily approaching the 20 mark again.\nHe needed to reach that threshold to make his desired purchase.\nWhile waiting, he spent the time studying the God Chat, absorbing every piece of information he could.\n\"Anyone want lizards?\" typed Kairos, with an attached image of a sleek, agile creature, unmistakably a lizard. It was far more complex than any lifeform Sunny had on land.\n\"Bigshot is boasting again,\" typed another God, praising Kairos. The familiar sycophancy that followed Kairos's every boast filled the chat.\n\"Bigshot! Can you trade one pair of lizards in trading platform?\" typed another God, trying his luck.\n\"Some Gods are trading fruits in the trading space for 1 faith point,\" typed a more practical God, relaying information that immediately piqued Sunny's interest.\n\"As a God, we naturally don't need to eat anything. Why waste 1 faith point?\" chimed another God, downplaying the importance of such items for their divine forms.\nSunny quietly closed the Chat panel and opened the Trading Platform.\nIt was just as the name suggested: a vast, ethereal marketplace where Gods could trade through barter or straight-up buy using Faith points.\nSunny scanned the listings. Most of them were algae of different kinds with varying quantities.\nHe didn't need algae; his world was teeming with them.\nHe even briefly considered selling some, but decided against it, not wanting to reveal his specific ecosystem's strengths or needs.\nHis gaze finally settled on something intriguing: a fruit with an apple-like shape but a vibrant yellow color.\nThere were 100 of them listed, for 1 Faith point each.\n\"What an easy way to earn Faith points,\" Sunny grinned.\nHe immediately understood the market. It was a clever way for some Gods to generate Faith by cultivating these basic 'food' items. He bought the fruit to see if he can get some seed from it.\nHe scrolled for a while longer, but found nothing else that interested him at his current Faith level.\nHe closed the trading platform and glanced at his Faith points.\n[Faith points: 24]\n\"Finally\" Sunny exclaimed and opened the System shop to Buy the Basic Hydrological Cycle (D-Grade).\n\"Purchase Basic Hydrological Cycle,\" he commanded.\n[Confirm purchase: Basic Hydrological Cycle for 20 Faith Points?]\n\"Confirm.\"\n[Current Faith: 24 -> Remaining Faith: 4]\nA surge of divine knowledge flowed into Sunny, not just about water, but about the fundamental forces that govern it.\nHe focused his will on Veridia. Beneath the surface, the planet's core began to stir, a slow, gentle hum that wasn't a precursor to disaster, but to creation.\nA small portion of Veridia's ocean water was drawn into the atmosphere, forming the first true clouds.\nOver the exposed land, these clouds condensed and released their precious cargo as rain.\nThe rainfall was light at first, then steady, carving out small channels in the soil.\nOver time, these channels deepened, becoming rivulets that fed into nascent streams, and eventually, into winding rivers.\nFreshwater lakes began to form in low-lying valleys.\nThe formerly uniform land was now a mosaic of biomes, with moist riverbanks, serene lake shores, and lush valleys providing fertile ground for new life.\nThe terrestrial evolution, already accelerated, was now supercharged.\nSunny leaned back, his remaining Faith a mere sliver, but his satisfaction was immeasurable.\nHe had successfully navigated a misfortune and made a major investment in his world's future. He had come a long way in just two and a half hours.",

      "content": "Chapter 9 - Ch 9 : Dawn of a New Age\nSunny held the vibrant yellow fruit he had purchased from the Trading Platform.\nHe bit into it, finding its taste surprisingly sweet and pure, far better than any fruit he remembered from the Blue Planet. \"Well, what did I expect?\" Sunny mused to himself, savoring the moment slowly. \"These fruits, unlike Blue Planet's, aren't made using chemicals or produced in pollution.\"\nJust then, as he finished the last bite, he noticed a single, small seed nestled within the fruit's core.\nHis eyes widened slightly, a spark of divine inspiration. \"A single seed?\nIt's enough under 10,000x time and 10x evolution rate,\" Sunny thought, already formulating a plan.\nHe used a fraction of his Faith points to carefully bury the seed in a fertile location on his nascent land, planting the potential for a new species.\nHe didn't dwell on it, maintaining his pragmatic divine approach. \"If it grows, it's good; if it doesn't, it doesn't matter.\"\nHe was now waiting for his Faith points to reach 20+ again so that he could purchase The Microbial Diversity Pack (C-Grade), an essential safeguard against future biological misfortunes and a vital component for a healthy, resilient ecosystem.\nTime ticked by slowly for the Gods in their ethereal realms, but for their planets, driven by cosmic energies, it was an entirely different thing.\nDays, weeks, and even months of planetary evolution could unfold in what felt like mere moments to a deity.\nAs Sunny patiently observed Veridia's steady growth and his Faith's gradual replenishment, the cosmic channels of the God Chat offered a constant, chaotic, yet often informative glimpse into the diverse lives, and challenges, of his fellow nascent deities.\nIn one particular sector of the universe, a burly man, his face framed by a full beard and his muscles bulging like a seasoned bodybuilder, wore an unkind smile that rarely touched his eyes.\nHis planet was a swirling inferno, a landscape of raw power with no trace of blue oceans or green forests; only molten lava and towering volcanoes dominated.\nYet, in these lakes of superheated rock, countless small, fiery-red fish-like creatures flowed and shimmered like exotic koi in water.\nThe forms of these beings were sometimes solid, sometimes ethereal, the very living spirits of the fire element.\n\"Just wait, Kitsune, I will tear you to shreds,\" growled the speaker, a voice rumbling with the deep, vengeful fury of magma flows. This was Vulcan, a God consumed by a deep, burning enmity for Kitsune.\nHe had been thoroughly scammed by her early on in the competition.\nHe might have accepted the loss, blaming his own foolishness, if Kitsune had at least provided him with accurate information.\nBut the data she had supplied was outright false, a deliberate deception.\nIt was only thanks to his unique, inherent talent, a divine gift of the forge and elemental command, that he was able to form these incredibly resilient fire spirits in the first place, allowing him to claw back from the brink of total failure.\nHis grudge festered, a constant, smoldering fuel for his divine will, shaping his very existence.\nIn another distant corner of the universe, a handsome young man, with spectacles perched thoughtfully on his nose, meticulously observed his planet.\nIt was a vibrant world, filled with lush greenery and shimmering expanses of water, bearing a striking resemblance to the long-lost Blue Planet.\n\"Finally,\" he exclaimed, a quiet, almost intellectual satisfaction in his voice, as he watched his first arthropod slowly scuttle across the verdant land.\nThis was the God previously noted for his sharp insight into the System's inherent hierarchy, Strategist.\nThough no God with a talent greater than S-grade had yet explicitly replied to his earlier comments about talent tiers, he remained absolutely certain that Gods with SS and SSS-grade talents existed, their true powers and identities hidden from the general, boisterous chat.\n\"It is not as fast as Kairos, but it will surely be better than others. Just wait, my wisdom will surely surpass you,\" Strategist murmured, his gaze fixed on a creature that strongly resembled an iridescent beetle, already displaying a surprising, almost intuitive ingenuity in navigating its complex environment. His confidence was quiet, intellectual, a stark contrast to the bombastic declarations of Kairos.\nHe believed in the power of calculated evolution, not just brute acceleration.\nOn yet another distinct planet, a fat, otaku-looking man screamed in exasperation at some primitive algae.\n\"Why are you building yourself a house? Just do your job and evolve, please!\" he pleaded, pulling at his unkempt hair with both hands.\nHis unique talent, B-Grade Builder, inherently made 30% of his lifeforms naturally adept at construction.\nThe unintended, often maddening, side effect was that even the most primitive algae in his world were obsessed with forming intricate, if utterly useless, structures.\nThis was Bastion, a God perpetually frustrated by the unpredictable and often counterproductive manifestations of his own divine blessing.\nFrom a place beyond the sight of the squabbling, boasting, and trading Gods, a figure of profound majesty sat enthroned.\nThis man was seated upon a celestial throne, not merely crafted from rock or wood, but intricately woven from a shimmering cosmic alloy.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nIt was interlaced with the fossilized remains of extinct, mythical beasts—a colossal dragon's skull here, the magnificent, hooved foot of a Qilin there.\nEach bone was not merely a relic, but a monument to a life passed under his watch, a testament to his future dominion over all creation and decay.\nHis very presence radiated an ineffable divine glow, a transcendent charm that far surpassed mortal beauty and remained utterly unmatched by any other deity.\nHis every movement was imbued with a quiet grace and a boundless power that seemed to ripple through the very fabric of space.\nHe was currently looking at Veridia from his seat in the cosmic void, a slow, profound, and knowing grin spreading across his face.\nThe passage of time for him was a blur, a mere footnote to his vast, unfolding eternity.\n\"Finally,\" he declared, his voice a low, resonant chord that vibrated through the cosmic fabric, a decree that marked a momentous turning point for his world. \"A mammal.\"\nHe was none other than our Sunny, destined to be known across the multiverse as God Cosmos, and the first grand step of his ambitious design had just been triumphantly completed.\n\"This throne is good for style,\" Sunny said, a flicker of satisfaction passing through his divine form as he placed his hands upon its sculpted handrest.\nIt was an ethereal construct, a product of countless experiments performed in his rare moments of divine leisure, where the boundaries of creation seemed to dissolve into pure will.\nHe understood now that he could use his boundless imagination to instantly manifest anything he desired, crafting objects of any material without any cost—a truly limitless canvas.\nHowever, he also noted the crucial caveat: if he lost direct contact with the object, it would simply vanish, dissolving back into the primordial cosmic energy from which it was formed.\n\"But this is not the most important thing,\" Sunny exclaimed, his gaze fixed upon a rat-like creature scurrying on four legs, its long tail twitching as it navigated the newly complex terrain of Veridia.\nIt was small, primitive, yet undeniably a mammal.\n\"In five hours? Even Kairos took more than two hours for his arthropods to reach their level of complexity.\nIf we look at this perspective, it would have taken me twenty hours,\" Sunny mused, genuinely surprised by the unprecedented acceleration in his world's evolution.\nThis remarkable speed wasn't solely due to Veridia's inherent evolutionary drive; it was a direct consequence of Sunny's relentless, focused divine intervention.\nIn these crucial two and half Godly hours (which had passed since his clearance of last misfortune), he hadn't been sitting idly by.\nHe had swiftly accumulated enough Faith to purchase the Microbial Diversity Pack (C-Grade), introducing a wide variety of beneficial microbial lifeforms into Veridia.\nThis influx of unseen life had dramatically accelerated early ecosystem development and nutrient cycling, creating a super-fertile ground for rapid and complex evolution.\nBeyond that, he had continually channeled his Faith to enhance countless genetic codes, subtly nudging organisms towards new forms, encouraging the development of legs, tails, ears, and rudimentary noses – the very traits defining this nascent mammal.\nHe was actively sculpting evolution, rather than merely observing it.\nYet, he understood his limitations. He couldn't simply use his divine power to transform these primitive mammals into humans or even human-like beings for two profound reasons.\nFirst, the Faith cost was astronomical. To accelerate and guide the intricate genetic pathways from a primitive mammal to a sapient, human-like form would demand more than 10,000 Faith points, an amount that would take him approximately 10 Godly days or even more to accumulate.\nSecond, his current knowledge of genetics, while divinely enhanced, was not absolute.\nTo pinpoint and manipulate each specific gene, to weave the intricate tapestry of a highly complex species, would require immense time and concentrated effort.\nEven guiding the evolution of this first mammal to its current rat-like form had consumed two and a half Godly hours of his absolute, concentrated presence within Veridia.\n\"Three years of hard work finally paid off,\" Sunny sighed, a touch of weariness in his divine form, even as satisfaction swelled within him.\nThough for him it had been just a few intense Godly hours of focused creation, in Veridian planetary time, a staggering three years had already unfolded, culminating in this single, incredible achievement.",

      "content": "Chapter 10 - Ch 10 : Resolve\nSunny observed the rat-like mammal as it scurried across Veridia's burgeoning landscape.\nIt was the planet's first mammal, thriving amidst an abundance of resources and, crucially, an absence of predators.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nThis perfect environment ensured the rat's survival, minimizing any immediate threats to its existence. Sunny felt a surge of triumph, a quiet victory in the vastness of creation.\nHe materialized his celestial throne in the vacuum of space, the cosmic alloy humming with latent power beneath his touch.\nIt had been an entire year since he had last truly engaged with the God Chat panel.\nThe last year, in his perception of divine time, had been almost entirely consumed by the intricate and demanding process of developing the complex genetic code necessary to evolve a mammal.\nAs he opened the chat, a flurry of notifications and new messages cascaded across his vision.\n\"Hey guys, I have a discovery to show,\" declared one God, with an attached video that immediately seized the attention of the cosmic community.\nEvery other conversation ceased as Gods paused their divine duties, their essences focusing on the shared screen. Sunny, too, opened the video, his curiosity piqued.\nThe video displayed a microscopic world. Within it, a tiny, translucent microorganism darted frantically, clearly fleeing from another, larger microorganism that pursued it relentlessly.\nSunny recognized the phenomenon; similar predatory-prey dynamics, though on a much grander scale, were already playing out in the primordial seas of Veridia.\nBut the next motion in the video left Sunny in a daze, a ripple of astonishment crossing his divine awareness. The running, almost flowing, creature suddenly emitted a brilliant spark from its body.\nThis bolt of energy struck its pursuer, instantly incapacitating it. In a shocking reversal, the predator became the prey.\n\"Lightning? Is it a pre-evolution of an eel?\" Sunny mused, his mind racing through biological possibilities. \"But this creature is too small to generate that much energy.\"\nHe dismissed the idea of a simple bio-electric discharge; the raw power in the spark seemed to defy the creature's minuscule size.\nAcross the universe, many of the System's resident experts in biological life were already furiously theorizing about this inexplicable phenomenon.\nEven though there were 300,000 Gods in this vast universe, only a small fraction possessed a deep understanding of complex biological processes.\nIf it weren't for the basic knowledge of life provided by the System upon ascension, many of them wouldn't have been able to form even a single, simple lifeform.\nSunny, too, began surmising in his mind, exploring every rational scientific explanation. But each pathway led to a dead end.\nThe only conclusion that made any logical sense to his mortal-trained mind was \"Magic.\"\n\"If it is really magic, then why aren't my lifeforms using it? I even have a rat now,\" Sunny exclaimed internally, a hint of frustration touching his divine thoughts.\nHe was, however, oblivious to a startling fact: in the last 15 Godly minutes (which equated to approximately 208 planetary days on Veridia), that single rat had already spawned over 5,000 children, and its descendants had grown to a size larger than a lion.\nAfter more than an hour of intense theorizing, every single God engaged in the discussion arrived at a singular, shared conclusion, one that echoed Sunny's own private thought: \"Magic.\"\nSince ancient times, it was the primary nature of humans to label any unexplainable phenomenon as \"supernatural.\"\nThe vast, impersonal System had just confirmed that some worlds were simply imbued with something beyond the scientific laws they understood.\nAfter the posting of that astounding video, many Gods, driven by curiosity and a competitive urge, began frantically searching for similar phenomena on their own worlds.\nSome Gods, already grappling with impending misfortunes, found themselves too busy fending off destruction to pay much heed.\nMany others, it turned out, were already aware of this \"magic\" in their worlds but had chosen to remain silent in the chat, guarding their unique advantage.\nThe remaining Gods were akin to Sunny, meticulously aware of every single detail about their worlds, and thus didn't need to check; they knew whether magic existed or not.\nThe discussion continued heatedly in the God chat, a storm of speculation.\n\"Why have some Gods noticed this phenomenon while others haven't?\" asked one particularly perplexed deity. Under this comment, countless replies and theories immediately flooded in.\nMany talked about \"wrong evolution,\" others posited \"gene deficiencies,\" but Sunny, though silent, had his own answer forming—an answer he was not yet ready to fully acknowledge.\nAfter another hour of passionate, almost frantic discussion, Strategist, ever the pragmatic intellectual, came to a simple, elegant solution to definitively find the answer.\n\"Brothers, I have similar microorganisms in my world,\" Strategist typed, his words cutting through the chaotic debate. \"We can use the trading platform to trade it into a world where there are no such creatures.\nIf it can use that power in that world, it will mean that that world inherently has magic. But if it didn't...\" Strategist didn't need to finish his sentence; the implications were clear. He immediately opened a trade, offering a sample of his 'magical' microorganism.\nAfter half an hour of diligent experimentation in various worlds, every God who participated in the test was forced to acknowledge the truth: some worlds possessed magic, while others did not.\nSunny was dazed for a minute, the revelation hitting him with the force of a cosmic wave, before he snapped back to his senses. As a lifelong lover of fantasy novels, he had been ecstatic after witnessing that initial video.\nHe had held a fervent hope that his life forms could perform magic, that his world would give rise to powerful mages – mages who could uproot mountains with a single spell.\nAnd though he himself could use Faith points to manifest such colossal power, the crushing reality was that his lifeforms, lacking that inherent magical spark, could not.\nUnless, he realized with a pang, he could develop his civilization to the interstellar age and somehow find a world where magic was inherently available, a world imbued with \"mana.\"\nAll his previous, hopeful ideas regarding magic came to a halt.\nMany other Gods whose worlds were similarly devoid of mana were undoubtedly thinking the same thing. Their only recourse, their only way to not fall irrevocably behind the \"magic world\" Gods, was technology.\nIt was a path similar to how humanity had advanced on the Blue Planet.\n\"So what if they can't use magic?\" Sunny resolved himself, a newfound determination hardening his divine will. \"I, as their God, will help them reach what we, in the Blue Planet, were never able to.\"\nHe drifted his gaze back to Veridia, refocusing his boundless attention on his own world. It had been two Godly hours since he had last checked on its general progress, his attention consumed by the cosmic chat and his strategic planning.\nThe change was astounding. The descendants of the initial rat-like creatures had become much grander, more majestic.\nThey had further diversified, splitting into distinct species of carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores.\nThey were now as large as elephants, stomping across the evolving terrestrial biomes.\nGiven enough resources, Sunny was certain they could evolve into creatures resembling dinosaurs.\nMany other types of primitive mammals had also evolved in the interim, flourishing in the varied habitats created by the hydrological cycle.\nHis divine vision covered all of Veridia, its intricate ecosystems as clear to him as the back of his hand.\n\"A gorilla?\" Sunny grinned, a broad, triumphant smile. He was witnessing the wonders of hyper-accelerated evolution, directly molded by his interventions. He was certain it was only a matter of hours until the most primitive of human-like ancestors began to emerge on his planet.",

      "content": "Chapter 11 - Ch 11 : The Genesis of Wisdom and the Two Factions\nSunny's focus was absolute, his divine will meticulously channeled into the very fabric of life on Veridia.\nHe was using every available Faith point to enhance the genetic code of his burgeoning mammalian population.\nHis goal was crystalline clear: to develop a wise being, a creature capable of higher thought and complex problem-solving.\nThis wasn't merely about accelerating evolution; it was about guiding it with precision.\nHe was not saving any Faith points, for the next pre-ordained misfortune was still a distant concern.\nHis current expenditures were a strategic investment.\nThe emergence of a wise species, he knew, would act as a powerful multiplier, dramatically increasing his Faith point generation.\nIt was the ultimate foundation for Veridia's future prosperity.\nHours bled into days in the accelerated time of Veridia, while for Sunny, it was a relentless, focused drive.\nHe was consumed by his research into genetic codes, meticulously balancing resource management with the pursuit of the fastest possible evolution rate.\nMany times, some of his nascent species, pushed to their evolutionary limits, teetered on the brink of extinction.\nBut Sunny, with swift and precise divine intervention, saved them through targeted genetic modifications, ensuring their survival and incorporating new, beneficial traits into their lineage.\nThrough these continuous modifications, many animals gained astonishing hearing capabilities, perceiving sounds far beyond the range of their ancestors.\nOthers developed eyes that far surpassed any creature back on Blue Planet, granting them unparalleled vision in their diverse environments.\nHe also kept a close eye on the God Chat, hoping for vital information or new insights, but for extended periods, no truly important data was exchanged.\nIt had now been 20 hours since the initial opening of his world.\nDue to the sheer number of organisms teeming across Veridia's expanding ecosystems, his Faith points were increasing at an astonishing, almost overwhelming, rate.\n\"I can't even imagine how much Faith Kairos and Strategist must have accumulated by now,\" Sunny pondered, a flicker of competitive curiosity crossing his mind.\nHe wasn't entirely sure about Kairos; if he truly possessed an astronomical amount of Faith or had already birthed a wise species like humans, he would undoubtedly be boasting in the Chat like a madman, his ego filling the cosmic void. Sunny felt less certainty about Strategist.\nFirstly, his world possessed mana, an inherent advantage. Secondly, his Talent, \"Children of Wisdom,\" seemed almost overwhelmingly powerful, a direct conduit to sapience.\nSunny was acutely aware of the profound uses of wisdom in a species because, according to the System's fundamental laws, the Faith generated was directly linked to the intelligence and strength of a world's lifeforms.\n\"This speed is not enough,\" Sunny grimaced, a rare frown marring his serene divine expression. \"I don't know how many of these experts are still hidden, silently pulling ahead.\" The thought fueled his drive even further.\nSunny shifted his gaze, focusing his divine perception on a specific creature on Veridia. It was a human-looking being, roaming the dense jungles, its movements agile, almost monkey-like.\nIts body was largely devoid of hair, save for a sparse covering on its face and head. It walked on two legs, though with a distinct, hunched back.\nThese were the most primitive of humans, the very dawn of sapience on Veridia. Sunny was going to allow them to roam freely for approximately one hour of God-time, giving them the crucial opportunity to begin hunting and surviving in the wild.\nThis period of natural selection was necessary to etch the fundamental instincts of survival deep into their DNA.Thɪs ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nIf they were evolved too rashly, without first confronting the harsh realities of the wilderness, they would simply perish from hunger or predation, unable to adapt.\nEven though he had been constantly working on the genetic codes of his organisms for 12 continuous Godly hours (a staggering 13 and a half planetary years on Veridia), his Faith points had never dipped below 50.\nThis remarkable sustained level was due to the simple fact that Faith was generating far faster than it was being depleted by his interventions.\nHe also maintained a vigilant watch on the Trading Platform, looking for any potential trades that might offer unique advantages. However, all the products available were items he was not lacking.\nHis planet now bore an abundance of fruits, so he no longer needed to purchase them. The only thing that truly caught his eye on the Trading Space was a \"Fire Spirit\", oddly shaped like a monkey.\nIt was listed at a price of 100 Faith, a sum Sunny could certainly afford. But the fundamental problem quickly became apparent: this fire spirit explicitly required a world imbued with mana.\nReluctantly, he closed the Trading Shop, the tantalizing glimpse of elemental power just out of his reach.\nThrough the ongoing God Chat, he gleaned other crucial pieces of information.\nThe System Shop, it seemed, would only display new products once a God had successfully solved a misfortune.\nFurthermore, those products would be tailored specifically to the condition of one's world; worlds with mana would receive different items than those without.\nWorlds with different climates would also see unique offerings.\nThe Gods were now, subtly but distinctly, dividing into two major factions: one composed of Gods with mana worlds, and the other, Gods with mana-less worlds. Each faction, convinced of its own inherent superiority, passionately explained why their world was destined for greatness.\nSunny, however, was not the type to engage in idle group chatting or pointless debates.\nHe was rigorously enhancing his knowledge by manifesting creatures in his private God space, similar to those he had on Veridia, and meticulously experimenting on them.\nThis method, fortunately, didn't require the use of his precious Faith points, as manifesting in the God space was entirely free of cost.\nThe effects of this continuous manifestation and experimentation were clear: his understanding of genes and genetic codes was increasing minute by minute at an alarming pace.\nHis knowledge in this complex field now far surpassed that of many experts back on the Blue Planet.\nHe knew, with absolute certainty, that merely sitting idly by would not make his lifeforms evolve faster; only true talent, relentless observation, and tireless hard work could achieve that.",

      "content": "Chapter 12 - Ch 12 : Mana Stone, God of Manifestations\nAs Sunny meticulously experimented with the primitive humans he had made using manifestation in his personal God Space, his focus was absolute.\nThe intricate dance of genetic code, the precise manipulation of nascent biological systems—this was his domain.\nThe omnipresent God Chat panel was still open, a constant stream of divine chatter.\nIt had been distracting at first, but now, Sunny had mastered the art of multitasking, allowing the endless stream of comments to flow past his divine awareness without disturbing his profound concentration.\nSuddenly, a particular set of messages pierced through the background hum.\n\"I swear! If I find this person, I am going to punch him hard,\" typed one God, their digital fury palpable across the cosmic network.\n\"What happened, brother?\" typed another God, unable to contain their curiosity.\n\"Someone just listed 100 mana stones for 1 Faith point each in the trading platform!\" the first God retorted, the virtual exclamation points conveying a profound sense of injustice.\n\"That is what trading is all about,\" chimed another God, clearly amused by the outburst.\n\"Check the description of that trade first!\" the first God snapped back.\nThe chat went abruptly silent. Every God, it seemed, paused their cosmic endeavors and opened the trading platform. Even Sunny, engrossed as he was in his genetic research, stopped his experimentation.\nHe wasn't particularly interested in the drama of the description, but the mention of mana stones—a tangible piece of the magic he couldn't directly wield—was profoundly enticing.\nSunny navigated to the listing. There, he saw a stone shimmering with an inner light, radiating an undeniable sense of arcane energy as he observed it.\n\"So this is a mana stone,\" Sunny mused, a flicker of excitement igniting his divine essence. Without hesitation, he initiated a trade, acquiring a single stone for 1 Faith point.\nHe was about to close the trading platform, his curiosity satisfied, but then his gaze lingered for a moment, glancing at the description.\nHis eyes twitched, a ripple of divine amusement and mild annoyance passing through him, as he read the brazen words:\n\"For the fools who can't have the taste of magic.\"\nSunny abruptly closed the trading platform, a wry smile touching his lips. The taunt, while childish, had solidified his resolve.\nNow that he possessed a mana stone, he was eager to see what this conduit of raw magical energy could change within his primitive humans.\nHe immediately began manifesting new subjects in his God Space: a succession of primitive humans from his world, alongside an inexhaustible supply of the glowing mana stones.\nThe true marvel of manifestation in God Space was twofold:\nfirst, it was entirely free of cost, allowing for limitless experimentation without depleting his vital Faith.\nSecondly, and perhaps more importantly, the more he practiced, the better his control over manifestation became.\nHe no longer even needed to maintain physical contact with the manifested objects for them to retain their form; he could conjure and dismiss them infinitely, with perfect clarity.\nSunny began his first, direct experiment: he attempted to infuse the mana from the mana stone directly into the primitive human's body.\nAs he channeled the shimmering essence into the manifested form, the results were horrific.\nThe primitive human began to convulse violently, vomiting forth its internal contents, before suddenly bursting into grotesque shreds, scattering pieces and blood across the void of his God Space.\nIt was a gruesome, yet informative, sight. This was precisely why Sunny never conducted such volatile experiments directly on the living primitive humans thriving on Veridia.\nHe had already witnessed similar explosive failures countless times on rats, gorillas, cats, and other creatures during his prior genetic research.\nSunny dismissed the shattered manifestation with a thought and conjured a new primitive human. He noted in his mind, with divine precision, that direct, forceful infusion of mana into a biological body was a dead end.\nSo, he changed his approach. This time, he started to infuse the mana very slowly, carefully modulating the flow to the precise limit where the body could handle the ethereal load without catastrophic failure.\nSlowly and painstakingly, the primitive human began to digest that mana. Its body, rather than convulsing, subtly transformed.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nIt became more robust, imbued with an unfamiliar vigor and raw energy.\nSunny was already aware of this specific use of mana; many boastful Gods in the chat often gloated about the incredible strength and resilience of their mana-infused life forms.\nNext, Sunny initiated an experiment with a different method. He manifested a new primitive human and began to induce the mana into its system through breathing.\nWhy breathing but not direct infusion into the body?\nThis was because, although Sunny could now accurately channel mana into a body without difficulty, for the primitive humans themselves, direct infusion was an agonizingly painful process. A creature would simply never choose it.\nTo further test his hypothesis on mana absorption and resilience, Sunny manifested a fully grown elephant, a creature with an inherently sturdy, massive body. He began to infuse mana into it, slowly at first, then with increasing volume.\nThe key observation was profound: the elephant could handle significantly more mana than the human, and its body was visibly becoming more and more robust, its hide thickening, its muscles rippling with new power.\nSunny dismissed the elephant, satisfied. His theory was correct: animals, with their simpler metabolisms and often greater physical resilience, could indeed handle mana infused directly into their bodies, turning it into raw physical enhancement.\nHe then returned his focus to the primitive human he was observing, the one slowly infusing mana through breathing. Sunny meticulously guided the mana, making it circulate through every vein and each minute body part.\nEach region where mana circulated became subtly sturdier than before, its tissues imbued with a low-level, continuous fortification.\n\"So that's how mana works,\" Sunny exclaimed, a flash of profound understanding illuminating his divine mind. He wasn't so arrogant as to believe he had conceptualized all of this himself.\nHe had gleaned these foundational ideas from the countless fantasy novels he had devoured back on the Blue Planet and from the endless, often boastful, discussions in the God Chat.\n\"But how can I make it perform magic?\" Sunny pondered, facing a new, frustrating barrier. He knew he couldn't use manifestation for this particular leap.\nPerforming true magic, as per his novel-acquired knowledge and the subtle hints from the System, would require a soul, a spiritual core that his manifested constructs inherently lacked.\n\"Should I start human trials?\" Sunny thought, the gravity of using actual Veridian lifeforms for such dangerous experimentation weighing on him.\nBut just then, a notification, as melodious as heavenly maidens singing in a celestial choir, resonated directly in Sunny's ethereal ear, piercing through his thoughts with an unmistakable brilliance.\n[Global Notification!]\n[Congratulations God Cosmos for gaining the unique title \"God of Manifestations\"]\nThis resounding Global Notification instantly silenced all activity.\nGods who were idly chatting ceased their conversations.\nThose who were valiantly facing their latest misfortune paused their divine interventions, their struggles momentarily forgotten.\nEven the most secluded Gods, who were meticulously leading their lifeforms towards steady, unhurried evolution, stopped in their tracks, their attention forcibly drawn to this singular, universe-spanning announcement.\nSunny's secret experiments, conducted in the solitude of his God Space, had unexpectedly garnered cosmic recognition.",

      "content": "Chapter 13 - Ch 13 : Dire need of Mana stones\nThe Global Notification announcing the unique title for God Cosmos had sent ripples of genuine awe, thinly veiled envy, and clear attempts to curry favor through the God Chat.\nFor the time being, the enigmatic God Cosmos had squarely captured the divine community's focus.\n\"Oh my System! A unique title already? God Cosmos must truly be blessed!\"\n\"The System acknowledges supreme talent! To gain a title like 'God of Manifestations' so early... truly awe-inspiring!\"\n\"Such power must be incredible! God Cosmos is clearly destined for greatness. We can all learn from such a profound deity!\"\n\"Manifestations! The possibilities for creation are boundless! I wonder if God Cosmos would ever deign to share a fraction of their divine wisdom with us lesser Gods?\"\n\"Who is this magnificent God Cosmos? I must seek their guidance! This is precisely the kind of divine prowess that will lead us all forward!\"\n\"A unique title implies unique power. It's truly a privilege to witness such a monumental achievement. Congratulations, God Cosmos!\"\n\"Can you share us how you achieved this?\" a God typed, a direct question that made Sunny raise an eyebrow.\nThis God was clearly attempting to extract invaluable information for free. Sunny, ever pragmatic and possessing the cautious nature of a former shut-in, was not so naive as to carelessly empower potential future rivals.\nYet, he understood the true meaning of \"unique\" in the System's context: even if other Gods attempted manifestation for all eternity, they could not gain this particular title.\nArmed with this knowledge, and with a slight hesitation, he began to type his first message in the God chat.\nCosmos: \"In your private space, if you imagine the thing you want to manifest, those things will come to existence.\"\nIt was a short, concise message, typical of someone with limited experience in casual communication. Sunny had no prior experience in public forums or messaging others, so his reply was direct and to the point.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nThe effect was immediate.\nVulcan: \"It works! Thanks, God! There are still Gods who are not profiteers like a certain vixen.\" His words, laced with clear disdain, were unmistakably aimed at Kitsune.\nKitsune: \"Don't blame others for your dumbness,\" Kitsune shot back, her reply sharp and swift.\nBastion: \"Brother Cosmos! Can you please manifest some brain in my rats? They are building sand castles!\" Bastion chimed into the chaotic fun, clearly making light of his own talent and ongoing frustrations.\nKairos: \"Well, keep on manifesting. My humans have already started building weapons.\" Kairos typed, his message a deliberate attempt to downplay Sunny's newly acquired title while simultaneously boasting about his own advanced progress.\nSunny didn't reply to Kairos's provocation. He wasn't one for verbal sparring, lacking the quick wit for eloquent comebacks.\nHowever, he was also not the one to passively absorb a provocation and simply move on.\nHe meticulously noted down Kairos's veiled taunt, filing it away for future reference.\n\"Status,\" Sunny said lightly, directing the command to the omnipresent System.\nImmediately, his personal status panel shimmered into view:\n[God Name: Cosmos]\n[Title: God of Manifestations (SS-Grade)]\n[Planet Name: Veridia]\n[Lifeforms: 260 million (ignoring single-celled lifeforms)]\n[Talent: Skill-Resonance (SSS-Grade)]\n\"Even titles have grades?\" Sunny exclaimed, a surprised exhalation. A wave of relief washed over him. \"Thank God it didn't give out its grade in the global notification. Otherwise, they would really be crying with envy!\" He then focused on the specific details of his new title:\n[Title: God of Manifestations]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: You are chosen by the law of manifestations.]\nA simple and precise description, which didn't answer anything,\n\"What 'law of manifestation'?\" Sunny muttered, a hint of dissatisfaction.\n\"Hey System! Please explain the use of this title,\" Sunny asked the all-knowing System. He knew he had a high chance of receiving the answer from system due to his high hierarchy (SSS).\n[Law of Manifestation: One of the many fundamental laws responsible for the creation and maintenance of this universe.]\n[God Cosmos, you are chosen by the Law of Manifestation, which means you can use manifestation magic.]\n\"Magic? But I don't have mana,\" exclaimed Sunny, a sudden jolt of confusion.\nHe had a lot of mana stones in his God Space, yes, but those were merely temporary constructs from his own manifestation experiments, not real, tangible sources of cosmic mana.\nAnd to manifest real, permanent objects with magical properties, he knew he would need genuine mana.\n\"Do I need to buy a lot of mana stones?\" Sunny pondered, his mind racing through the implications.\nIn his perspective, this newly discovered aspect of his Manifestation talent seemed incredibly overpowered.\nIts primary use, he immediately envisioned, would be to manifest many kinds of advanced technologies that he could then bestow upon his lifeforms in the future, dramatically accelerating their technological advancement.\nHe opened the Trading Platform to search for mana stones, his excitement building. To his disappointment, he found none.\n\"Already traded all?\" Sunny exclaimed, a frustrated realization dawning on him as he confirmed the empty search results.\nThe mana stones, it seemed, had been snapped up almost immediately by other Gods after the initial controversy.\nSunny's mind raced, all his formidable cognitive power focused on this singular, pressing issue.\nThe clock was ticking. It had been 22 hours since the opening of his world, leaving only two hours before the anticipated arrival of the next misfortune—a ticking bomb that could detonate at any moment.\nSunny knew how much this new title, \"God of Manifestations,\" could aid him if he could only figure out how to properly harness its magical potential.\n\"How do I use magic?\" Sunny repeated this question in his mind, over and over again, a desperate mantra for divine insight.\n\"How stupid of me! Why didn't I think of this sooner?\" Sunny suddenly exclaimed, a brilliant, almost blinding, solution igniting in his mind. The answer had been right in front of him all along.",

      "content": "Chapter 14 - Ch 14 : The Divine Descent\nSunny's theory, the brilliant realization that had struck him moments ago, was remarkably simple in its core.\nHe knew, from his own experience, that he could perform numerous miracles without any conventional \"magic.\"\nEnhancing genes, evaporating vast bodies of water, even altering weather patterns – these divine interventions had not required mana.\nMany other Gods possessed similar talents, like the one who could conjure boulders from thin air.\nThe common denominator for all these acts was Faith points; they were the true currency of divine power.\nHe was now convinced his God of Manifestations title, which allowed him to use \"manifestation magic\" (as per the System's explanation), simply opened a new pathway for Faith point expenditure, effectively using Faith instead of mana as the magical source.\nStill within the boundless expanse of his God Space, Sunny put his theory to the test.\nHe envisioned a simple spear, its shaft made of sturdy wood, its head a sharpened stone.\nBut this time, he didn't merely rely on imagination. As he focused, he simultaneously channeled his Faith points into the manifestation.\nImmediately, the object coalesced with a solidity far beyond his previous spectral creations.\nThis time, the manifested spear was strikingly real, tangible, and not ethereal like his earlier experiments.\nWith a surge of anticipation, Sunny initiated his descent onto Veridia.\nAs he transitioned from the ethereal realm of the Gods to the physical plane of his world, he noticed his Faith points diminishing faster than usual.\nHe acknowledged the drain, a cost he would analyze later, but for now, his focus was entirely on the immediate task.\nHe looked at the spear still firmly in his hand. It retained its form, solid and real, even outside the confines of his God Space.\n\"Success!\" Sunny exclaimed, a rare grin spreading across his face.\nThe successful use of Faith points instead of mana opened up a veritable cascade of possibilities for his future experiments and the advancement of Veridia.\nHe could now envision scenarios like imbuing specific humans with a fraction of his Faith, allowing them to perform \"miracles\" that, in turn, would generate even more Faith for him.\nIt was a self-sustaining cycle of divine influence.\nHe shifted his gaze to the primitive humans.\nThey were currently seeking shelter in crude stone caves, their forms huddled together, instinctively hiding from the dangers of their developing world.\nThey possessed no true weapons, only rough stones which they occasionally hurled at smaller animals for a meager hunt.\nThere was no complex communication between them yet, only grunts and rudimentary gestures.\nIt had been only two Godly hours since their initial evolution, but in planetary time, a staggering three years had already passed.\nBut Due to the accelerated 10x evolution rate, their bodies had already matured, now resembling young adults of around 30 years, filled with nascent strength and youthful vigor.\nSunny knew, with absolute certainty, that his appearance for this first encounter had to be nothing short of divine, an indelible impression etched into their primitive minds\nFor this pivotal moment, he had crafted a mask that transcended mere disguise, becoming instead a potent symbol of awe and undeniable authority.\nThe mask Sunny chose was deceptively simple in its base form, yet imbued with an undeniable otherworldly presence.\nIt was crafted from a smooth, matte white material, almost like polished bone or a substance untouched by earthly grime.\nIts contours flowed organically, hugging the shape of his face with an unsettling stillness.\nThe eyeholes were large and perfectly black, devoid of any hint of iris or pupil, creating an impression of infinite depth.\nAdorning the stark white surface were symmetrical markings of a deep, vibrant violet, almost like solidified cosmic energy tracing ancient pathways.\nThese markings began as stylized curves above the black eyeholes, flowing downwards in elegant, tapering lines that ended in three distinct teardrop shapes beneath each eye.\nThese violet markings seemed to subtly shift and shimmer in the faintest light, hinting at a power contained within.\nFrom the base of the mask, where it would meet his neck, hung strands of a pale, fibrous material, reminiscent of dried reeds or bleached hair.\nThese strands were numerous and moved with an almost imperceptible life of their own, whispering secrets on unseen breezes.\nBut the true power of the mask lay within the void of its eyeholes. When a primitive human gazed into them, they wouldn't see mere blackness.\nInstead, they would perceive the infinite expanse of the cosmos. Nebulae swirled in vibrant hues of purple, crimson, and emerald, distant galaxies glittered like scattered diamond dust, and the very fabric of spacetime seemed to warp and bend within those impossible depths.\nThe sheer scale and ancient majesty held within those eyes would overwhelm their nascent minds, triggering an instinctive, involuntary response of complete submission and reverence.\nTheir bodies would bow, their heads would lower, not out of conscious thought, but as a primal reaction to witnessing the infinite power and unknowable grandeur of the universe embodied within the gaze of their God.\n\"Too costly! But its features are also awesome,\" Sunny remarked to himself, a hint of satisfaction in his voice, as he felt the 40 Faith points drain from his reserves for the creation of this truly divine artifact.\nWith a final adjustment, he put on the mask, its strange, otherworldly weight settling upon his face. His first direct interaction with his creations was about to begin.",

      "content": "Chapter 15 - Ch 15 : The First Offering\nSunny hovered in the air above Veridia, a silent, omniscient observer.\nA profound sense of triumph swelled within him as he surveyed the burgeoning flora and fauna of his world, a testament to his constant vigilance and subtle divine nudges.\nSlowly, he began his descent, a silent, majestic figure landing near the mouth of a large stone cave where his nascent human population sought refuge.\nHe stepped inside. The agile and fierce primitive humans, accustomed to their wild existence, instinctively turned their gaze towards the imposing figure at the cave's entrance, their eyes wide with innate hostility.\nBut as their gazes fell upon the cosmic depths swirling within the eyes of the Visage of the Ascendant, they were momentarily dazed, their minds overwhelmed by the impossible sight. Within moments, their bodies moved independently of their will, collapsing into a profound bow.\nThey didn't yet grasp the concept of \"Gods,\" but Sunny was certain that as their wisdom evolved, they would inevitably come to know and worship their God Cosmos.\nSunny gestured, a silent command for them to follow, and led them out of the cave towards a nearby tree, abundant with sturdy branches and trailing vines.\nHe selected a perfectly straight branch, ideal for the shaft of a spear. With a fluid motion, he picked up a nearby stone, then used a resilient vine to bind both the branch and the sharpened stone head together.\nThe humans, though unable to look directly into the mesmerizing eyes of his mask, watched the entire process of spear-making with an unnerving intensity.\nThey seemed unsure of what was transpiring, yet not a single voice dared to break the profound silence that accompanied his divine presence.\nSunny finished crafting the spear. He made it by hand rather than simply manifesting the one he already possessed because he wanted to plant the seed of innovation, to inspire them to develop these essential tools themselves.\nAs he completed the task, he glanced at his Faith Points. They had been over 100 after manifesting the mask, but now they dwindled precariously close to 20.\n\"I don't have much time left,\" Sunny muttered under his breath. He could sense a massive elephant nearby, a colossal presence in the burgeoning wilderness.\nWithout hesitation, he walked towards it. The primitive humans followed him closely, their eyes fixed on his divine shadow, unwilling to lose sight of this otherworldly being.\nWith a focused intent, Sunny hurled the newly crafted spear towards the elephant. It flew with divine precision and power, striking deep into the elephant's head.\nThe massive beast bellowed once, then crumpled, dying instantly on the spot. All the native humans watched, truly astonished at the raw, undeniable power displayed by Cosmos.\nSunny then turned his gaze towards a specific human, a young male around 15 years of age. Before descending, he had already meticulously observed the status of all his primitive humans.\nMany were born without any discernible talents. Among those who possessed them, most had ordinary F-Grade abilities like Jump, Stealth, or Tracker.\nBut this particular boy's talent stood out: Super Strength (C-Grade), making it one of the most practical and potent abilities among his early creations.\nSunny looked directly at the young boy and, in a voice that resonated not just in their ears but in their very souls, declared:\n\"You will be called 'Thorn' henceforth and be the first leader of the humans.\" The young boy, Thorn, seemed to shimmer with an internal light, as if physically imbued with the weight of being the chosen one. Every other human present began to chant \"Thorn!\" over and over.\nThough they didn't comprehend Sunny's precise words, they somehow intuitively understood the meaning behind his divine pronouncement.\nThese primitive humans were not yet aware of the boy's inherent talent, but Sunny was. He had orchestrated this entire \"play\" to make them believe that Thorn's incredible strength was a direct result of Sunny's divine intervention, solidifying his chosen leader's authority.\nFrom his System space, Sunny then summoned the spear he had manifested earlier—the one made of wood, but infused with his Faith—and gestured for Thorn to take it. Thorn was momentarily stunned, but then a wave of profound joy washed over him.\nHe slowly walked towards Sunny, his primitive mind now daring to look directly into the awe-inspiring, cosmic eyes of the mask.\nHe then bowed deeply again before reaching out and placing his hands upon the handle of the spear.\nThe simple wooden spear, touched by his hand and blessed by a God, shimmered with a soft, golden light.\nSunny knew this spear, manifested using his Faith, was anything but ordinary; even a spear forged from the purest steel would not be able to scratch its divinely imbued body.\nWhile every other human gazed at Thorn with a mixture of envy and newfound reverence, Sunny vanished as quickly as he had appeared, returning to the serene expanse of his God Space.\n\"So faith-consuming!\" Sunny practically shouted from the bottom of his heart, as he immediately checked his Faith points.\nOnly 5 points remained. The rapid depletion had been staggering.\n\"System! Can you please explain why the faith was consumed so rapidly?\" Sunny questioned his all-knowing System, his tone demanding answers.\nThe System's response was swift, its melodious tone carrying a stark, almost chilling clarity:\n[The consumption was high due to 3 reasons:]\n[1. As the wisdom and strength of the lifeforms in your world increase, the Faith points needed for descending onto the mortal plane will also increase.]\n[2. Sharing any knowledge or artifact will consume faith proportional to he usefulness of the knowledge and power of the artifact]\n[3. As a God of the World Veridia, every lifeform here is a part of you. If you kill one of your parts, it will backfire and result in a loss of Faith points proportional to the strength and wisdom of that lifeform.]\n[Note: The third point is only applicable if the lifeform does not harm a God's dignity or act against divine will.]\nThis System notification made Sunny's metaphorical hair stand on end. The implications of these answers were simple, yet terrifying: the consumption of Faith points was only going to increase, not decrease, as Veridia evolved.\nJust then, a colossal influx of Faith washed over him, a warm, invigorating surge of energy. \"About 30 points or more,\" Sunny murmured, looking towards Veridia and the growing human settlements.\nBelow, Thorn stood proudly in front of a newly constructed altar, crudely fashioned from the bones of many different animals, from rats to the recently felled elephant. All the humans were bowing their heads, offering a tribute of fruits and fresh animal flesh.\n\"So this is what prayers from a wise race feel like,\" Sunny said, a slow, profound understanding dawning upon him.\nHe quickly calculated: if all these humans, spurred by their reverence for Thorn and Cosmos, offered food daily, he would gain an astonishing 30,000 Faith points (10,000x) daily!\nSunny was immensely amused by the prospect, even as he knew they couldn't possibly maintain such offerings every single day.\nIt had been a full planetary month since Sunny had last descended to Veridia.\nIn that time, the humans had fully accepted Thorn as their divinely appointed leader. And Thorn, armed with his Super Strength and the shimmering divine spear, was already leading humanity towards greatness.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nThey now faced the giants like elephants or fierce predators like lions and tigers with a newfound courage.\nWith the advent of spears, their chances of dying in the harsh wilderness had decreased dramatically. The humans were clearly thriving.",

      "content": "Chapter 16 - Ch 16 : The Mana Bloom\nNow that the fundamental problem with the usage of his unique title, God of Manifestations, was gloriously solved, Sunny plunged wholeheartedly into experimentation.\nHis first and most pressing priority was to determine if his primitive humans could, in some form, directly harness his Faith points in lieu of mana.\nWhile his divine experiments progressed, the primitive humans on Veridia were already establishing their dominance.\nThe remarkable aspect of the 10x evolution rate was that it seemed to primarily accelerate the body's development to its perfect physical condition—around 30 years of age—rather than merely aging them rapidly.\nOnce they reached this prime, their bodies would not simply decay and die at an accelerated rate; instead, they would remain in peak condition.\nThe human leader, Thorn, was currently in his prime, and his Super Strength (C-Grade) talent truly shone in these burgeoning days.\nEverywhere he went, the loud cries of vanquished animals wailed through the forests, signaling the ever-increasing prosperity of the human tribe.\nThorn, as a charismatic and successful leader, had already taken many wives, and his children numbered a remarkable twenty.\nSunny, as their God, observed Thorn's offspring with utmost importance, eager to discover if the coveted talent could be inherited.\nOut of the twenty children, sixteen possessed F, E, or sometimes D-Grade talents, while the remaining four were entirely talentless.\nThis didn't deter Sunny's initial assumption; instead, it fueled the fire in his heart, making it burn even brighter.\nThe reason for his renewed vigor? Five of Thorn's sixteen talented children had inherited some form of Super Strength, even if at a lower grade.\nAs time flowed, the human populace swelled rapidly, growing from the first few hundred to many thousands.\nThis burgeoning population generated a colossal amount of Faith for Sunny, constantly replenishing his reserves.\n\"Failed again!\" exclaimed a divine voice, frustration clear in his tone.\nHe looked at the blood and flesh that still lay fresh in his God Space from another failed experiment.\nWith a simple wave of his hands, both vanished into the vast cosmos.\n\"Is it not possible to integrate humans with the power of Faith?\" the divine voice whispered, disappointment creeping in.\nHe had tirelessly experimented on countless manifested humans.\nWhenever he allowed his Faith to connect with the human body, it went smoothly.\nBut if he then let that Faith roam wildly within their manifested form, the outcome was consistently the same: a gruesome, explosive disintegration of the body.\nSunny had even consulted the System, but sadly, it remained silent this time, offering no answers.\nHe sat back on his celestial throne, pondering his complex plans to truly empower the humans of Veridia.\n\"All these worlds with mana have such strong creatures. If only my world had mana,\" Sunny said casually, his eyes wide, lost in thought.\nSuddenly, his eyes snapped open wider, a new realization dawning.\n\"How stupid of me!\" Sunny blamed himself for not conceiving this idea sooner.\n\"Haha! Just manifest mana into the world!\" Sunny laughed loudly, a booming sound across his divine domain.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on\nHe first sought to test the waters.\nHis Faith points were now over 360.\nHe used 1 Faith point to manifest raw mana directly into Veridia.\nBut as soon as it formed, it vanished into the cosmos, dissipating without a trace.\n\"What? Is this not enough?\" Sunny then used 5 Faith points.\nBut the outcome was still the same—the mana dissipated too quickly.\nSunny lost his cool for a moment, then calmly began to think of a better plan.\n\"Mana, if released similar to air, just vanishes,\" Sunny mused, pondering the nature of mana stones he'd briefly seen.\n\"What if it was solid?\"\nHe started again, using just 1 Faith point.\nThis time, instead of raw mana, Sunny manifested 10,000 mana stones.\nTo his immense satisfaction, they didn't vanish.\nInstead, they began to levitate gently in the sky of Veridia, a glittering constellation of condensed magic, slowly settling onto the land.\n\"Hah! Finally!\" Sunny sighed as his experiments were finally coming to an end.\nSunny made many caves all around Veridia and filled each of them with 20,000 or 30,000 or 40,000 mana stones.\nHe resolved that each time he accumulated a substantial amount of Faith, he would directly manifest more mana stones, continuously seeding his world with magic.\nAfter a full Godly hour (approximately 416 days on Veridia), there were now over 500 caves scattered across the vast continent, each brimming with these shimmering mana stones.\nThese mana stones constantly released mana into the air, slowly but steadily saturating Veridia's atmosphere.\nThis mana didn't simply vanish; it was absorbed through breathing and directly through the bodies of humans and other animals.\nPlants, rooted deeply into the mana-rich soil, absorbed the energy directly through their roots, arguably gaining the most significant benefit.\nVeridia's flora began to evolve frantically.\nMany new herbs with distinct functions started to grow, some developing potent toxic traits, others possessing beneficial properties that could dramatically increase strength or accelerate healing.\nSlowly, the inherent strength of every animal and human on Veridia began to rise.\nThe increase in strength, however, was not uniform; it was directly related to an individual's talent.\nThe higher the talent, the more pronounced the rise in physical strength and vitality.\n\"These mana stones are enough for now, but as the population increases, I'll need even more,\" Sunny grimaced, realizing that a substantial portion of all his future Faith points would now be dedicated to manifesting these crucial mana sources.\n\"This can't go on. I need Faith for solving misfortunes too,\" Sunny pondered, the long-term implications of this strategy weighing on him.\n\"Hah! How stupid of me to think changing a type of world is easy,\" Sunny said aloud, acknowledging the monumental task.\n\"In worlds with mana, how does mana actually form?\" Sunny questioned himself.\nFrom various fantasy novels he had devoured back on the Blue Planet, he knew the answer: \"mana veins\" or \"spirit veins.\"\nBut he had never seen one, and simply knowing the concept wasn't enough to manifest it perfectly.\n\"Should I consult someone from a mana world?\" Sunny pondered, a novel idea for the reclusive God.",

Sharing his talent with us like this!\" typed one God, awe dripping from every virtual letter.\n\"He is clearly a profiteer! He will take a huge chunk of Faith points as his service fee. We don't even know what the production cost is!\" clarified another God, their skepticism cutting through the praise.\n\"Taking a share is just part of a business. We can't do what God Cosmos can. It is natural for him to gain his profits,\" another God, perhaps one struggling with their own world's development, defended Cosmos, sparking an immediate and heated debate in the God Chat.\n\"A service? What audacity! Is our divine power to be commodified?\" scoffed a traditionalist God.\n\"Rubbish! If it saves me years of trial and error on my world, it's worth every point!\" retorted a pragmatic God.\n\"Perhaps this 'Manifestation' title isn't as grand as it sounds. Maybe he can only make trivial things,\" whispered a subtly envious voice.\n\"Don't be a fool! The System gave him a unique title! There's no 'trivial' about that!\" another argued.\nBut Sunny was utterly oblivious to the divine squabble, his attention already consumed by the sheer volume of inbound communication.\nHe already had more than 1,000 private messages flooding his inbox, requests pouring in from across the vast divine network.\nSunny's underlying goal was not that simple; he didn't only want to hoard a large amount of Faith from his customers.\nHis primary objective, hidden beneath the veneer of commerce, was to acquire knowledge—the invaluable, diverse knowledge possessed by all these Gods.\nHe knew many Gods would undoubtedly ask him to manifest complex blueprints: nuclear weapons, advanced weaponry schematics, and countless other technological devices from their own highly evolved worlds.\nOn the other hand, the requests from those overseeing magic-infused worlds could prove even more fruitful.\nThey might ask for a perfect copy of a revolutionary medicine discovered in their realm, or perhaps even the precise structure of a heaven-defying elixir.\nNow, Sunny was not just thinking through his heart, which was still utterly fascinated by the raw spectacle of magic.\nHe was thinking with his mind, his strategic intellect honed by years of solitude and meticulous planning.\nHe understood, with absolute clarity, that if magic and technology could both be evolved together in his world, or, even better, if they could be intricately combined, the potential for Veridia would become limitless.\nHe envisioned fantastical creations: mana cannons that fired bolts of pure arcane energy, spaceships powered not by mundane combustion but by harnessed mana stones, automated cities built with magical precision.\nBecause, in the grand scheme of things, his primitive humans, no matter how physically powerful, would not be able to spread their influence or territory across the cosmos faster than technologically advanced, or magically-fueled, spaceships.\nHis vision for Veridia was not merely a strong planet, but a dominant force in the universe, a beacon of combined might.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nSunny began to go through these requests one by one, methodically sorting through the torrent of private messages.\nAs he had half-expected, the very first legitimate order was for a weapon.\nHowever, it was neither a nuclear warhead nor any form of advanced weaponry.\nThis particular God, whose world was evidently still in its nascent stages of development, simply asked for a single basic bow and a hundred arrows.\n\"I guess at this time, no God will be needing a nuclear weapon or any advanced weapon,\" Sunny mused, a faint smile touching his lips.\nHe was not heartbroken by the simplicity of the request, because he knew it was just a matter of time before more complex and intricate designs would inevitably arrive.\nWith a surge of Faith, Sunny meticulously manifested two identical bows and 200 arrows.\nThe bows were crafted from a fine, resilient wood, entirely smooth to the touch, their strings made of a hard, perfectly elastic rubber.\nSunny manifested two pairs because he wanted a spare set for his own nascent lifeforms on Veridia.\nSunny's pricing strategy was simple, yet audacious: his charge was two and a half times more than his calculated Faith cost for manifestation.\nOn the Blue Planet, such a markup would be unashamedly called a scam, as many consumers could easily guess the production cost using the raw ingredients or by directly consulting a worker.\nBut here, in the ethereal marketplace of Gods, no one knew about the true, minute production cost of these divinely manifested items.\nThe specific order for the bow and arrows only costed Sunny a paltry 8 Faith points to produce.\nFor this, he directly asked for 20 Faith points.\nThe God on the other side of the trade was visibly hesitant at first, the pause in communication a clear sign of their internal debate over the price.\nBut their hesitation quickly dissolved, and they promptly confirmed the trade after looking at the item's System-generated description.\n[Item name: Basic Bow (Cosmos)]\n[Grade: A]\n[Description: A bow manifested by the God of Manifestation using his Faith as a source. Due to the use of a God's Faith, this bow is filled with extraordinary power.]\nSunny was already intimately aware of these detailed descriptions; they were System standard for items manifested with Faith.\nThe spear he had made for Thorn, for instance, had been an S-Grade artifact.\nAnd the bow he was going to eventually gift to his humans was also of S-Grade, having been manifested directly by him with higher intent.\nThough their inherent grades were high, implying immense durability and effectiveness, they didn't inherently hold any specific combat skill.\nThis was a current limitation: Sunny was not yet able to imbue a weapon with an active, learnable skill.\nHe gazed down at Veridia, his divine attention lingering on his human tribe.\nHe desperately wanted to find someone with a natural talent in archery or marksmanship, someone who could truly maximize the potential of these newly manifested weapons.\nHe meticulously scanned through his human population, searching for any tell-tale signs of such an innate ability.\nTo his disappointment, he found no humans among them with this specific talent.\n\"Sigh! These guys are really talentless when it comes to ranged combat,\" Sunny sighed, a fleeting moment of frustration.\n\"Even if the cooldown of my SSS-Grade Skill-Resonance finishes, it wouldn't matter much for this specific purpose.\"\nHis gaze then lingered at other, unexplored parts of Veridia.\nThe sheer size of Veridia was truly immense, a sprawling landmass five times that of Earth, now holding an abundance of untouched, fertile territories.\nSunny's eyes widened, a flicker of surprise passing through him.\nHe noticed a new group of agile, human-like creatures inhabiting a different continent within his vast world.\nThere were currently five distinct large islands (which were effectively continents) making up Veridia: one massive landmass in the middle, and four smaller ones positioned strategically on its four cardinal sides.\n(His primary human tribe was currently thriving on the Southern island.)\nAs to why Sunny described them as \"human-like\" but not entirely human: it was because of their distinct, immediately noticeable features. They possessed elegantly pointy ears, delicate yet distinct gazelle-like horns curving gracefully from their foreheads, an innate and profound agility, unparalleled graceful movements, and a notably gentle disposition compared to his more rugged humans.\nThey were currently running through a dense, verdant jungle, their movements fluid and silent as they tried to find some food.\nSunny immediately considered gifting this bow and arrows not to his humans, but to these \"elves-like\" creatures.\nHis divine analysis confirmed his intuition: he was currently seeing that many of these newly discovered \"elves\" seemed to possess innate talents specifically related to eyesight, perception, or marksmanship. This was a stroke of incredible luck, aligning perfectly with the very weapon he had just manifested.\nSunny didn't just descend into Veridia casually like before, with barely a thought to the cost.\nNow, he needed to manage his Faith points meticulously, acutely aware of every expenditure.\nDue to the emergence of these elves, who were innately intelligent and inherently strong—perhaps even more so than his humans at this stage—this next trip would surely cost much more Faith than his previous, brief intervention.\nThe stakes were rising, and Sunny knew every decision counted.",

      "content": "Chapter 18 - Ch 18: The First Godly Day\nSunny began to fulfill each of the pending requests, working methodically through the daunting queue.\nWhile most orders were for ordinary weapons—items like spears, bows, swords, and shields—his attention was soon captivated by a peculiar request.\nOne God from a magic-infused world asked Sunny to replicate a rare item named Tear of Mermaid.\n[Item Name: Tear of Mermaid]\n[Grade: S]\n[Description: Can increase the Grade of talent related to magic.]\n[Note: Only works on talent below S-Grade.]\n\"I just introduced magic into my world, and my world is not inherently a magic world,\" Sunny pondered, his thoughts racing.\n\"So, having a human with magic talent will be very tough.\"\nThough this item was exceptionally precious in a mana-rich environment, the cost of manifesting it was surprisingly low, requiring only 30 Faith points.\nSunny, ever the opportunist, directly quoted a price of 150 Faith points, a staggering five times the production cost.\n\"Who's going to know?\" Sunny mused, a predatory gleam in his divine eyes.\n\"And for worlds inherently built on magic, this item is extremely precious.\nEven if I were to raise the price even further, many would still choose to pay.\"\nAs he predicted, the client who asked for this replication immediately requested five Tears of Mermaid directly.\nThis single transaction alone yielded a massive profit of 600 Faith points for Sunny.\nHe now had more than enough capital to descend into Veridia again whenever he chose.\n\"One Godly day is coming to an end,\" Sunny pondered, feeling the subtle shift in the cosmic currents.\n\"I don't know what surprises will be there from the System.\"\nHe decided to wait for the completion of his first full day as a God before making his next descent into Veridia.\nSunny resumed completing the other trade requests from various Gods.\nIt was a tedious task, fulfilling them one by one, but Sunny did not yet possess the power to multitask and manifest many items simultaneously.\nA God from a technology-advanced world provided Sunny with the complete schematics and knowledge for a nuclear power plant.\n\"Nuclear power plant,\" Sunny murmured, pondering the potential uses of this advanced technology.\nHe couldn't find an immediate, practical application for it in his current world, so he meticulously filed this complex knowledge away in the expansive library of his mind, a treasure for future consideration.\nSunny had already completed more than 1,000 requests, accumulating an immense fortune in Faith points.\nHis total now stood at approximately 90,000 Faith points, out of which 20,000 had already been wisely reinvested into establishing mana stone mines across Veridia.\nJust then, one particular message caught his attention, not because of the item request itself—Sunny hadn't even opened the chat yet.\nThe name of the client alone made Sunny grin from ear to ear.\nIt was Kairos.ᴛʜɪs ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀ ɪs ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ʙʏ NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nSunny opened the chat directly, and the description of the item requested was very different from what his imagination had anticipated from Kairos.\n\"Was he fooling everyone from the start, or is his world mutated enough to have elemental spirits?\" Sunny began to ponder, trying to understand why Kairos, the boastful and progress-obsessed God, would be requesting this type of item from him.\n[Item Name: Elemental Flower]\n[Grade: A]\n[Description: Food for any type of elemental spirit.]\nThe description was short and concise, but the story this flower silently told Sunny was far more complex.\nFrom his prior observations in the God Chat, Sunny already knew that worlds with truly extreme elemental energies were not something any ordinary creature could endure.\nThus, only elemental spirits were typically found thriving in these worlds, because for them, these raw elemental energies were akin to breathing high-quality air.\nThe meaning of this item request was clear: either Kairos had been lying about the true progress and nature of his world in the chat, or, more likely, his world possessed specific biomes that were naturally filled with these potent elemental energies, allowing spirits to exist.\nSunny believed the latter to be true for only one reason: lying was easy, but showing screenshots or irrefutable proof was not possible unless it was Sunny's own manifested work, which would be difficult to fake convincingly.\n\"What a lucky fellow,\" Sunny thought, a cold calculation in his eyes.\n\"But your luck ends here.\"\nHe manifested a single Elemental Flower to gauge its cost and found it to be just one Faith point.\nCosmos: \"Price is 20 Faith points. How many of these do you want?\" typed Sunny in the private message to Kairos, a predator's smile playing on his lips.\nSunny was not thinking of sparing him for once.\nThis was a direct 20x markup on the production cost.\nHe could have simply blocked Kairos and moved on, but looting him of his Faith was, in Sunny's view, a far more satisfying revenge.\nKairos: \"Isn't the price very high?\" asked Kairos, his digital words conveying a hint of indignation.\nHe had already inquired about the typical pricing from many other Gods in the chat, and all the answers he had received indicated that Sunny's service was \"cheap.\"\nSunny, to his mild annoyance, hadn't known that his base prices were considered so low by other Gods; otherwise, he could have raised them across the board earlier.\nCosmos: \"If you want it, take it. There are many still waiting for their turn.\"\nSunny gave no room for negotiation, no way out for Kairos.\nHe had always found Kairos to be a very boastful person, someone who simply couldn't stand seeing anyone surpass him.\nBut this time, unbeknownst to Sunny, Kairos was in a desperate situation.\nIn the world of Kairos, a severe misfortune was playing out.\nDue to this calamity, the vital food sources for his elemental spirits were dying off at an alarming rate.\nHis world was indeed a lush, vibrant mana world, filled with diverse biomes, including several regions with extremely harsh elemental climates.\nThese specific biomes were precisely where the elemental spirits thrived.\nHowever, the spirits in these lands were now dying and teetering on the brink of extinction.\nIt was commonly believed that spirits only needed ambient elemental energies to survive.\nBut this was not entirely true; they also required specific spirit fruits, elemental flowers, or other rare spirit treasures.\nThese crucial resources were no longer abundant in Kairos's world due to the ongoing misfortune.\nKairos had been unable to solve this critical problem for about five agonizing hours, watching his unique lifeforms perish.\nThat's why he had finally swallowed his pride and decided to resort to Sunny's services.\nHe had expected Sunny to either block him outright or demand an obscenely high price, perhaps even mocking him.\nSo, he gritted his teeth and typed his desperate reply.\nKairos: \"1,000 Elemental Flowers for now. I will message you if I need more.\"\nSunny was dumbfounded.\nHe knew the Faith stored in the pockets of established Gods like Kairos or Strategist was enormous, a testament to their talent and successful worlds.\nBut seeing Kairos spend this much, all on spirit food, made Sunny's scalp tingle with excitement.\n\"He is facing some misfortune, perhaps,\" Sunny mused, briefly considering raising the price even further.\nBut he quickly decided against it.\nKairos was a fat cow, and he was going to milk him slowly, over time, rather than trying to take everything in one go.\nSunny directly traded 1,000 Elemental Fruits to Kairos.\nHe instantly gained a staggering 20,000 Faith points from this single deal.\nThis was, by far, his greatest profit yet from a trade.\nJust then, another notification rang out across the vast expanse of the God Space, a System-wide announcement.\n[Congratulations Gods! For completing their First day as a God!]",

For completing their First day as a God!]\n[From now on, No faith will be generated for the death of any non-wise lifeform.]\n[Each God can create one Group for Chat.]\n\"Well, one bad news, one okay news,\" a God typed in the God Chat after witnessing the new notifications provided by the System.\n\"True,\" another God typed, peeking everyone's interest, \"But I think this is issued to balance this game.\"\nFinding this brief moment of silence, he typed again, \"Think about it: now, billions of bacteria and algae are born and die every hour or so, giving us huge amounts of Faith.\nBut in the future, this speed will increase manyfold, which will provide us hundreds of thousands of Faith every second.\"\nEvery God nodded in silent agreement after reading this insightful message.\n\"Dear Fellow Gods, I was pondering about this multiverse of Gods for a long time and found out that each God alone is enough to sustain his world.\nBut to handle misfortune and develop a world at the same time would be challenging,\" typed Strategist, his customary long-winded yet profound style apparent.\n\"Thus, hereby I announce that I, God of Wisdom Strategist, am creating an alliance.\nAny God interested in this can message me for more information.\"\nThe chat went silent for a moment as Gods throughout the multiverse understood the true meaning of the second notification by the System.\n'Alliances.'\nThis momentous announcement spurred many other Gods with good talents to also think about creating their own alliances.\nBut the downside was clear: you needed to publicly showcase your talent, otherwise, who would join a nobody?\nMany Gods, however, still decided to play it safe, opting to simply type that 'I have an A-grade talent, and interested Gods can inquire about my talent via private message.'\nSunny saw all this unfolding and also thought of creating an alliance.\nHe was an exception when it came to showcasing talent, because his unique title, 'God of Manifestation,' was alone good enough to attract members from any nascent alliance.\n\"I will think about it in the future, let's handle the elves first,\" Sunny said to himself, his gaze shifting towards Veridia.\nThe Elves had evolved enough to be quite similar to humans, except for their dazzling appearance and naturally pointy ears.\nEven the previous, small gazelle-like horns of these elves were nowhere to be seen now, having fully receded with their evolution.\nSunny, still in his God Space, began to meticulously check the talents of these elves.\nAside from the previously observed agility, perception, and marksmanship talents, the elves now possessed many talents specifically related to magic.\nHe checked his human tribe too and found them also beginning to manifest similar, albeit rarer, magic talents.\nIs my world evolving into a magic world? Sunny thought, pondering the implications of this natural mana absorption, recalling the mana veins or wells from the novels he used to read.\nHe messaged the God who had asked him to replicate the Tear of Mermaid earlier.\nHis God name was Zir.\nCosmos: \"I have an offer for you. I don't know if you would be interested.\"\nFor Sunny, Zir was not the only option available; he had contacted Zir specifically because Zir had provided him with what he considered the most valuable item (the Tear of Mermaid) till now, offering a glimpse into magic-world mechanics.\nIf Zir was not interested, Sunny could always ask other Gods from magic-infused worlds, excluding Kairos, of course.\nThe reply from Zir came shortly, almost instantly.\nZir: \"Sure boss, I am interested.\"\nThis immediate, eager reply stunned Sunny.\nHe was utterly oblivious to the fact that, in the hearts of many Gods, he had already become a figure surpassing even Kairos and Strategist in terms of sheer perceived power and potential.\nCosmos: \"I want to know how mana is generated in your world.\"\nZir: \"Mana is generated through mana veins, boss.\"\nCosmos: \"Can you provide me with one?\"\nZir: \"In my world, there is only one mana vein, boss.\"\nSunny immediately understood Zir's concern.\nZir was afraid of damaging the fundamental foundation of his entire world, which was its sole mana vein.\nCosmos: \"Do you know my title?\"\nThis simple, loaded message silenced Zir.\nIn about 30 seconds, a trade request from Zir appeared on Sunny's interface.\nSunny accepted the trade, and in his divine hand, a complex network akin to a human's neural network appeared.\nThough it was manifested perfectly in Sunny's hand, the actual size of this mana vein was enormous.\nIf connected with a world, the thickness of each individual 'vein' would be more than a human's waist.\nThe System notification showed the clear description of this newly acquired vein.\n[Item Name: Mana Vein]\n[Grade: A]\n[Description: The foundation for a magic world. Directly starts a cycle of mana generation in the world and provides a constant mana supply in a 100,000 km radius.]Follow current ɴᴏᴠᴇʟs on NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nSunny could roughly guess the price for manifesting this colossal mana vein.\nHe noticed a clear pattern: the more inherent energy an artifact or item contained, the higher its production cost would be.\nThat's why ordinary weapons like bows and arrows were relatively cheap to manifest, but items imbued with energy or specific magical properties, like the Tear of Mermaid, were somewhat costly.\nThe cost of manifesting one A-grade Mana Vein was a substantial 1,000 Faith points.\nIf Sunny were to upgrade the grade to SS, which was similar to the grade of his mask and the highest grade he could manifest with his current capabilities, the price would skyrocket to 10,000 Faith points.\nSunny manifested one S-grade Mana Vein for his own world.\nThen, displaying his newfound generosity and cunning, he traded back the A-grade Mana Vein to Zir.\nHe also gifted Zir an additional S-grade Mana Vein, a gesture that cost him 5,000 Faith points.\nZir had helped Sunny immensely by providing his only mana vein blueprint, a profound show of trust in Sunny.\nSo, Sunny was not stingy with this divine gift.\nHe now had more than one lakh (100,000) Faith points, and he was not lacking in this crucial resource, at least for now.\nZir was immediately overjoyed after looking at the completed transaction and thanked Sunny wholeheartedly, his gratitude radiating through the System.\nSunny thought of something new and immediately created a group.\nThe name of the group was 'Cosmic Alliance.'\nHe directly invited Zir into his newly formed group.\nZir joined the group and was immediately dumbfounded by looking at Sunny's first message within the alliance chat.\nCosmos: \"All the members of this alliance will get a 10% discount on every transaction.\"\nThough a 10% discount was not a significant financial loss for Sunny, for other Gods, it represented a huge potential saving on their vital transactions.\nFor example, if Zir were to ask for five Mermaid's Tears again, it would not cost him 750 Faith points but only 675.\nThis would save him 75 Faith points, which was a considerable amount for Zir, as he had previously spent all his accumulated Faith for the initial five Mermaid's Tears.",

      "content": "Chapter 20 - Ch 20: Seeds of Power\nThe thought behind forming an alliance, for Sunny, was purely pragmatic and highly profitable.\nHe wanted to connect with Gods from different worlds who could easily share precious items and knowledge with him for a mutually beneficial profit.\nZir was a prime example of this strategy.\nHe had given Sunny his only mana vein , which Sunny desperately needed for his own world.\nIt was a symbiotic exchange, a mutual benefit for both of them.\nBut the benefit Sunny ultimately got was much more substantial than Zir's.\nNext time, if Zir wanted more Mana Veins, Sunny could easily demand 15,000 Faith points or more for an S-Grade one.\nEven with a 10% alliance discount, the profit margin would remain enormous.\nSunny began infusing his world, Veridia, with an SS-Grade mana vein.\nOne.\nTwo.\nThree.\nFour.\nFive.\nIn just a few seconds, Veridia now boasted five colossal SS-Grade mana veins, constantly pumping divine energy into its core.\n\"No world can compare to my Veridia,\" Sunny declared, a quiet, confident assertion, \"even if there exists a world that can compare, I will surpass them with ease.\"\nHe spoke as a matter of fact, already picturing his world's glorious future.\nSunny then slowly descended to the outskirts of the elven forest, his Mask of Cosmos firmly in place.\nHe noticed the Faith consumption; it was currently at 10 Faith points per second.\n\"Affordable for now,\" Sunny murmured to himself, even as he considered the potential future price of descending, knowing it would only increase.\nSunny looked towards the largest tree, a magnificent elder of the forest, observing the many elegant tree houses nestled within its colossal branches.\n\"I was late, I guess,\" Sunny said, a hint of amusement in his tone, as he saw the elves who were already guarding their tribe.\nThese elves were holding rudimentary bows and arrows, and some were even clutching knives crafted from sharply chipped stones.\nSunny, a figure of silent, cosmic majesty, walked directly towards the guards.\nAs the guards gazed into the impossible depths of his eyes, they instinctively bowed, their minds overwhelmed by the sheer, unyielding power.\nSunny walked directly to what he perceived as the leader's house, a grander tree-dwelling structure.\nThe leader's will was noticeably higher, stronger than that of the other elves.\nHe didn't immediately bow but struggled valiantly, his entire being straining to break free from the invisible compulsion.\nBut an SS-Grade artifact, forged using the purest divine energy (Faith), was not something an ordinary mortal, even an elf leader, could endure for long.\nSo, in just a few seconds, the leader of the elves, his body trembling, eventually kneeled.\nThere was no complex concept of language in the elven tribe yet, only simple sounds and gestures.\nBut due to Sunny's previous subtle interventions, the human tribe had already begun to develop a rudimentary language.\nThe elves, unlike humans, did not choose their leader according to talent or raw strength.\nThey chose their leader by their innate beauty, thus the leader of this elven tribe was a breathtakingly beautiful young male, still in his early twenties, possessing an ethereal charm that commanded attention.\nThough he was chosen primarily for his striking looks, his underlying talent was nothing to scoff at.\nHis talent was a B-Grade 'Elementalist'.\nThrough this talent, he could learn any elemental magic of B-grade or less with remarkable ease.\nBut this was not the main, most potent part of his talent.\nThe primary use of his talent was his innate ability to contract elemental spirits, which would, in turn, significantly increase both his physical body and his spiritual power.\nFor now this talent was useless because of the lack of spirit.\nSunny walked to him, gently lifted him up, and presented him with the manifested bow and arrows.\nSunny also used two Tears of Mermaid on the elven leader, directly elevating his talent to a formidable S-Grade.\nThen, just as quickly as he had appeared, Sunny vanished.\nThe leader of the elves felt a profound, new found energy surge into his body, a divine essence that cleansed every fiber of his being.\nHe felt his body brimming with unprecedented power, his mind crystal clear and acutely aware.\nSunny then precisely teleported near the human settlement, he directly teleported inside Thorn's cave.\nThorn was currently holding his twenty-first child, a tiny, squalling bundle.\nSunny looked at the talent of this newborn and gasped in his mind, a rare display of surprise.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n\"S-Grade Super Strength?\"\n\"Congratulations, Thorn,\" Sunny said, his gaze fixed on the infant cradled in Thorn's arms.\nThorn immediately kneeled on the ground, his precious baby clutched safely.\n\"This child is blessed with Super Strength. Make sure to raise it well,\" Sunny instructed, his voice resonating with divine authority.\nHe didn't comment further on the incredible S-Grade talent.\nInstead, he directly gave Thorn nine more spears, ten swords, ten shields, and ten sets of bows and arrows.\nTo ensure understanding, he manifested a doll and carefully controlled it, demonstrating the basic use of swords and bows.\nAll nine of the additional spears, swords, shields, and sets of bows and arrows were of A-Grade, representing a significant upgrade for the tribe.\nHe also included one S-Grade sword, one S-Grade Shield, and one S-Grade bow.\nHe didn't simply give all ten S-grade weapons at once, as he didn't want to cause any internal strife or revolt within any of his tribes.\nThus, the leader should possess absolute, undeniable strength, especially in the earlier generations of the tribe, to maintain control and order.\nSunny still had more than 20,000 Faith points remaining, and he didn't want to just leave Veridia immediately.\nHe started manifesting many more Tears of Mermaid and numerous other weapons, taking advantage of the accelerated time.\nBecause of the 10,000x time flow on Veridia compared to the God Space, manifesting items here was 10,000 times faster than when he manifested them in his tranquil God Space.\nAfter using 10,000 more Faith points in a rapid flurry of creation and distribution, Sunny finally teleported back to his God Space.\nSunny now had approximately 10,000 Faith points left, which he carefully saved for unforeseen emergencies.",

      "content": "Chapter 21 - Ch 21: The Dawn of Magic\nVeridia, Sunny's burgeoning world, now pulsed with an unprecedented vitality.\nIt boasted five colossal SS-Grade mana veins, each tirelessly infusing the planet with raw magical energy.\nTwo S-Grade talents, one in the human tribe and one among the elves, stood as beacons of his divine intervention.\nIn just a single Godly day, Sunny's progress had outstripped that of many other Gods, a testament to his strategic mind and unique abilities.\nAs time passed, the landscape of Veridia shifted, reflecting the growing dominance of its nascent civilizations.\nThe elves were now firmly ruling over the northern continent, their graceful forms moving with innate harmony through their mana-rich forests.\nThe humans, under Thorn's formidable leadership, held sway over the southern continent, their settlements expanding, their cries of triumph echoing through the valleys.\nThe remaining continents, vast and untamed, remained full of diverse wild animals, a constant source of challenge and resources.\nSunny was not partial towards any single continent or race; he had ensured that each major landmass was infused with at least one SS-Grade mana vein, guaranteeing balanced growth.\nIt had now been 16 hours since the start of the second Godly day, and there was still no sign of the predicted misfortune.\nThe only anomaly Sunny detected was that the mana level in Veridia's atmosphere was rising continuously, a subtle but relentless increase.\nInitially, this didn't directly result in any immediate deaths among the lifeforms.\nHowever, Sunny knew that if this atmospheric mana concentration continued to rise unchecked, the lifeforms in his world would surely face immense pressure, akin to an unbearable increase in atmospheric pressure, but many times higher and far more insidious.\nTheir bodies, while strengthened by mana, could only withstand so much before succumbing.\nSunny thought of many immediate options to mitigate this looming crisis.\nHe could swap out the SS-Grade mana veins for less potent A-Grade ones, thereby reducing the mana influx.\nBut if the mana level still rose, even at a slower rate, it would merely be postponing the inevitable, granting his lifeforms only a few more years of strained existence.\nAlternatively, he could directly remove the mana veins once and for all, or at least until the effect of the misfortune dissipated.\nThough, instead of all these drastic measures, Sunny could simply use his precious Faith points to directly control and stabilize the mana increase.\nBut Sunny, ever the meticulous experimenter, wanted to explore all possible solutions first, reserving the direct expenditure of Faith as a last resort.\nSunny began to observe every minute detail of Veridia, his divine gaze sweeping across the planet.\nThe more he observed, the more he began to understand the true cause of this continuous mana rise.\n\"There is mana, but no magic, only body strengthening,\" Sunny said aloud, the realization striking him with a sudden clarity.\nThe fundamental purpose of mana, as he understood from his vast knowledge of novels, was to be used for magic—for spells, for enchanting, for complex manipulation of energy.\nThe lifeform's body could only absorb and utilize mana to strengthen itself up to a certain point.\nAfter that threshold, any excess mana was of no further use to them, simply accumulating in the environment, leading to the growing pressure.Follow current novels on No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nThis accumulation was the core of the problem: his creatures were absorbing it, but not actively expending it through magical practices.\nA clear solution formed in his mind: his lifeforms needed to learn how to actively use mana.\nHe decided to consult his newly formed private group, The Cosmic Alliance.\nThe alliance was now thriving, boasting hundreds of Gods, representing both magical and technologically advanced worlds.\nThe way to enter this exclusive alliance was deceptively simple: just give Sunny an order to manifest something that he found interesting or useful, thereby providing him with valuable blueprints and knowledge.\nCosmos: \"To all Gods with mana-infused worlds, do your civilizations possess any developed magic spells or specific techniques for mana utilization?\"\nZir, ever eager to please his 'boss,' was the first to reply, a hint of frustration in his words.\nZir: \"No boss, unfortunately. My world's inhabitants simply sleep, hunt, and eat all day. No magic yet.\"\nNyx: \"I have many body strengthening techniques in my world that my people have developed. I can provide them to you, boss, if they are of any use.\" Nyx offered, perhaps hoping to gain favor.\nSunny saw an immediate opportunity here. While not full magic, body strengthening techniques were crucial for his growing populations and could help them adapt to mana.\nCosmos: \"Nyx, I am very interested in those body strengthening techniques. I can pay you well for them. Could you send me a trade request with all you have?\"\nNyx: \"Of course, boss! Sending it now.\"\nAfter a brief moment, Sunny received a trade offer from Nyx for 8 distinct body strengthening techniques.\nHe accepted, transferring 8,000 Faith points to Nyx.\nThis was a modest but valuable acquisition, ensuring his people could better utilize the mana within their bodies.\nThen, the conversation in the alliance chat continued.\nGaia: \"My world also lacks specific magic techniques, unfortunately. If any God is willing, I'd be interested in trading for some myself.\"\nThen, a new voice entered the conversation, concise and to the point.\nReflection: \"I have some copies of magic techniques and spells.\"\nGaia typed back immediately, her curiosity piqued.\nGaia: \"Wow, brother, how did you acquire so many?\"\nReflection explained calmly.\nReflection: \"My talent is A-Grade Comprehension. All lifeforms under my influence have their comprehension strengthened, allowing them to rapidly decipher and even create such things.\"\nSunny's interest instantly locked onto Reflection.\nThis was precisely the knowledge he needed to resolve the mana anomaly.\nCosmos: \"I can pay 2,000 Faith points for each copy. Sell me all you have.\"\nReflection, perhaps a little surprised by the generous offer, replied with deference.\nReflection: \"Boss, you can just take them. No need to pay.\"\nSunny, however, understood the value of a professional transaction and the importance of maintaining his business model, even within his own alliance.\nCosmos: \"Just offer the trade request.\"\nAfter a few seconds, Sunny received a comprehensive trade offer from Reflection.\nIt included 13 foundational books on general magic theory, 7 distinct magical techniques for mana training, and 12 individual spells of different elemental affinities.\nSunny accepted the trade without hesitation, instantly transferring a substantial 64,000 Faith points to Reflection.\nThanks to his many successful transactions and the continuous offerings from both his human and elven tribes, even after the payment to Nyx and Reflection, his Faith reserves now exceeded 500,000 Faith points.\nHe was effectively swimming in divine currency.\nSunny decided to bestow one complete copy of each book and technique—both the body strengthening techniques from Nyx and the magic spells/theories from Reflection—upon both the human and elven tribes.\nThis would allow both races to independently embark on their journey into learning magic and, hopefully, to upgrade and develop new techniques over time, creating a diverse magical landscape.\nHe waited patiently for their next scheduled offerings, planning to deliver these invaluable tomes at that auspicious moment.\nAs several planetary days passed on Veridia, the elves were the first to provide their regular offerings to their unseen God.\nSunny, conserving his divine energy, did not descend onto Veridia himself.\nInstead, he simply teleported the collection of books directly in front of the magnificent statue the elves had meticulously carved of Cosmos, a towering representation of his masked visage, nestled amidst their tree-top dwellings.\nLooking at the books manifesting spontaneously before them, materializing from thin air, all the elves present were utterly dumbfounded.\nTheir graceful forms froze in place, their sharp eyes wide with astonishment and wonder.\nThey began to cautiously approach the newly appeared items, then slowly, reverently, opened the books.\nThey discovered many intricate illustrations within, depicting mana flows, precise hand gestures for spells, and complex diagrams of magical theory, alongside detailed diagrams for body strengthening.\nThough they were not yet able to fully understand the written words immediately, the detailed illustrations would surely serve as a profound guide.\nWith their innate comprehension talents, particularly their strengthened perception, they would undoubtedly begin to understand and learn the principles of magic rapidly.\nA few more planetary days later, the humans also offered Sunny their regular tribute.\nAnd Sunny performed the exact same divine act for them as he had for the elves.\nHe manifested the same sets of magic and body strengthening books and techniques directly in front of Thorn's communal altar, a silent, awe-inspiring gift from their powerful, unseen God.\nNow, his world, Veridia, could finally embark on the true journey of magic, evolving far beyond mere physical strength and into the boundless realm of arcane power.\nThe stage was set for a new era of magical advancement.",

      "content": "Chapter 22 - Ch 22: New insights\nSunny chose to deliver the newly acquired techniques and knowledge during the pre-scheduled offerings from his human and elven tribes for a very specific reason.Thɪs updatᴇd by NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nHe wanted to subtly reinforce the instinctive behavior for his lifeforms: to seek their God's favor and guidance during every joyous occasion, and in times of misfortune.\nBy having divine solutions manifest directly through their acts of reverence, he hoped to solidify the sacred bond, ensuring a continuous flow of Faith, and more importantly, their unwavering devotion in times of need.\nWith the immediate concern of the atmospheric mana anomaly looming, and anticipating its resolution within a few hours of his own divine time, Sunny decided to focus on deciphering these newly acquired techniques himself.\nHe dedicated the next few hours to poring over the mana guiding techniques and body strengthening methods.\nAs he delved into their intricate diagrams and nuanced explanations, Sunny found many concepts remarkably similar to ancient Blue planet practices he had vaguely heard of: the flowing movements of Tai Chi, the disciplined postures of various yogic practices, and the focused breathing exercises used in meditation.\nThe underlying principles seemed universal, adapting the body and mind to channel and utilize inherent energies.\nHe began to practice the basic mana guiding techniques himself, albeit with no immediate results, lacking the specific 'talent' to truly engage with mana.\nExactly four hours into his concentrated study, a resonant notification sounded directly in Sunny's divine ear, pulling him from his meditative practice.\n[Congratulation God Cosmos for solving the misfortune!]\n[New items have been added in System shop!]\nA wide, triumphant grin spread across Sunny's face.\nHe ceased his attempts at mana guiding, a sense of profound satisfaction washing over him.\nThe misfortune had been averted.\nHis strategic intervention—the timely introduction of magic—had proven successful.\nHe immediately directed his divine gaze towards Veridia.\nWhat unfolded before his eyes was a breathtaking sight.\nWhile it had only been four hours for Sunny, an astonishing four and a half years had elapsed on Veridia due to the accelerated time flow.\nIn that extensive period, the nascent magic he had introduced had proliferated across both human and elven continents.\nHe could perceive the distinct, pulsating aura of mana channeling from countless individuals.\nMany of his lifeforms were now adept at wielding magic, casting rudimentary spells and manipulating energy with varying degrees of proficiency.\nThe very atmosphere of Veridia, which had once been growing dangerously dense with unutilized mana, now felt balanced, the mana flowing freely, absorbed and expended by a burgeoning population of magic-users.\nIt was ironic, Sunny mused, that while his world was now teeming with active magicians, he, their divine benefactor, remained unable to perform even the simplest spell.\nHis prior observations and the acquired knowledge from Reflection, however, had given him a profound understanding of the universe's inherent power system, a realization that had solidified over the last four hours of intense study and divine observation.\nEverything in this vast world, indeed this universe, operated on a comprehensive grading system, ranging from F (Ordinary) to SSS (Divine).\nThis grading applied not only to innate magical affinity but also to physical strength, various professional skills, and even the quality of items.\nA \"talent\" or \"affinity\" dictated the potential and speed of a lifeform's progress, but genuine \"skill\" was honed only through continuous training and practice.\nFor example, a person with a D-Grade affinity for mana—a relatively common level—had, over the past four and a half years on Veridia, been able to learn and master basic magic, progressing to a functional level and becoming E-Grade magician.\nConsider the elven leader, who possessed an S-Grade magic affinity.\nThis exceptional talent did not automatically bestow powerful magic upon him.\nInstead, it meant his training would be exponentially faster and his ultimate potential far greater than someone with a lower affinity.\nHe still needed to diligently train in magic techniques, just like everyone else, to reach higher levels of mastery.\nHis speed of advancement, however, was unparalleled, reaching B-Grade magician.\nThe concept of super strength operated similarly.\nThorn, the formidable leader of the human tribe, despite his inability to use magic, still firmly maintained his position due to his impressive C-level Super Strength, reaching his highest potential.\nThis was a testament to his persistent physical training and the benefits of mana absorption.\nMost of the newly emergent magicians on Veridia, even after four and a half years, were merely at the E-level in their magical abilities, insufficient to challenge Thorn's raw physical prowess.\nYet, a new generation was already rising.\nThorn's 21st son, now a vibrant young man, had inherited immense potential.\nHe had already reached B-level body strengthening, surpassing his father's active strength at a comparable age.\nHis potential was an astonishing S-level in Body Strengthening, hinting at future might that could rival even higher-grade magic users.\nThis intricate, interconnected power system extended to all professions.\nMarksmen, through continuous training and dedication, could reach higher grades in their field.\nUpon achieving a higher grade, their agility would instinctively increase, their eyesight would sharpen to extraordinary levels, and other subtle, beneficial physical changes would manifest, making them deadlier and more efficient.\nSimilarly, a chef who reached a higher grade in their craft would find the quality and taste of their food increase dramatically.\nTheir dishes would not only be more delicious than ordinary fare but could also impart different buffs, such as minor healing, temporary stamina boosts, or increased focus, to those who consumed them.\nThis intricate, interconnected power system was not explicitly explained by the System itself, nor had it been discussed by any other God in the God Chat.\nThis was Sunny's own profound observation, deduced through tireless divine scrutiny of his world over the past four hours of his time.\nHe found his world much more akin to a game than ever before—a living, breathing, evolving simulation.\nThough there were no numerical 'stats' floating in the air, the clear, intuitive grading system made understanding and evaluating progress remarkably easy.\nThrough this newfound understanding, Sunny realized a critical truth: even Gods, without an innate talent for magic, could not simply learn to wield it.\nMagic was bound by affinity, a fundamental aspect of existence.\nBut Sunny was no ordinary God.\nHe possessed the incredibly rare, SSS-Grade talent: Skill-Resonance.\nThis unique Talent allowed him to copy any talent from the life forms in his territory.\nThus, he knew with absolute certainty that in just two more days of his own time, he could effortlessly copy the S-Grade magic Talent of the elven leader, thereby embarking on his own formidable magical path.\nA powerful grin split Sunny's face as grand ambitions began to unfurl in his mind.\nHe envisioned a future where he would not just copy one talent, but hundreds, thousands, transcending every other God in the multiverse.\nHe now had two S-Grade lifeforms in his world, both of whom would inevitably develop into unparalleled powerhouses, surely surpassing many of his peers in the God-Game.\nYet, Sunny was not arrogant.\nHe remained grounded, acknowledging that he had achieved so much without even utilizing his innate, game-breaking talent.\nHe reasoned that many other Gods, especially those blessed with talents more immediately useful or simpler to leverage than his own complex Skill-Resonance, were surely progressing at an astonishing pace as well.\nThus, Sunny remained ever vigilant, ready to grasp any small opportunity that arose, refusing to become complacent.\nWith an eager gaze fixed on his limitless future, Sunny articulated his next command, a simple phrase that nevertheless signified a profound shift in his divine strategy.\n\"System shop, open.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 23 - Ch 23: New items\n\"System shop, open!\" Sunny declared, unable to contain the surge of excitement he felt at the prospect of exploring new items.\nHe knew from discussions in the God chat that Two specific items were universally available to every God.\nThe remaining two items, however, were uniquely tailored to each God's world type and its specific needs, as determined by the System.\nThus, Sunny anticipated a total of four new items in his shop.\nAs the shop interface materialized, displaying its enticing new offerings, Sunny reviewed the list.\n[Talent Appraising Ball (B-Grade): A ball which shows the name, grade and description of the talent of the person touching this ball. Cost: 1000 Faith points]\n[Random Buff (ungraded): Upon buying, a lifeform will gain a random buff for 5 Godly days. Cost: 5000 Faith points]\n[Divine Embryo (Ungraded): An embryo of a living organism. A god can choose the shape and ability of this embryo with the use of faith points. It will be forever loyal to the God and never disobey him. Cost: 30000 Faith points]\n[God's Eye (SSS-Grade): Upon buying, gives the God the ability to look at the past of his world, discern lies from any lifeform, see the threads of fate of a lifeform and find the optimal path for a lifeform to take in their life. Cost: 100000 Faith points]\n\"As expected, the Talent Appraising Ball and Random Buff are here,\" Sunny murmured to himself, recognizing the two universally available items.\nHis prime focus, however, immediately gravitated towards the other two items—the Divine Embryo and God's Eye—those specifically tailored to his world's needs and current stage of development, which the System clearly indicated he needed most.\nSunny didn't ponder for long. With his current overflowing Faith reserves, he swiftly and decisively bought all the items without batting an eye.\nHe was, without a doubt, one of the most wealthy and affluent Gods in his universe at this moment.\nWhile many other Gods were still meticulously collecting Faith points, agonizing over whether to buy even one or two coveted items, Sunny was already moving to acquire and utilize all the new additions to his shop.\nAs he confirmed his purchases, two distinct system notifications chimed simultaneously in his divine awareness.\n[Congratulations God Cosmos for gaining the Buff: Innovation (A-Grade)]\n[Congratulations God Cosmos for acquiring God's Eye!]\n[God's Eye is pairing with God Cosmos...]\nSunny felt a sensation in his eyes, not of pain, but of intense heat. The entire integration process was surprisingly smooth, a seamless merging of divine essence. He felt his perception sharpen dramatically, his senses expanding. His eyes, though still appearing normal to any outside observer, now glimmered with a newfound, potent divine power.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n[Pairing complete]\nWith a calm demeanor, Sunny directed his enhanced gaze towards a random lifeform on Veridia, focusing his intent on viewing its past.\nThe entire life of that lifeform, from birth to its current moment, flashed before Sunny's eyes like a rapidly playing movie.\nIn mere seconds, Sunny possessed more intimate knowledge of the lifeform's thoughts, experiences, and hidden motivations than even its closest companions.\n\"Oh, so it consumes Faith,\" Sunny remarked, feeling a barely perceptible decrease in his vast Faith reserves.\nHe checked the cost. \"Only 10 Faith points?\" Sunny found the cost of this immensely powerful ability incredibly cheap, a truly negligible expenditure for such profound insight.\nSunny decided to postpone further experiments with his new God's Eye for later, prioritizing his immediate focus on the newest buff he had just received.\nHe brought up the details of the buff.\n[Buff name: Innovation]\n[Grade: A]\n[Description: The chances of innovating something new by the lifeforms within your world will significantly increase.]\n[Time left: 5 Godly days]\n\"This is exactly what I needed the most,\" Sunny said aloud, a renewed sense of purpose invigorating him.\nHe knew that even though he could easily intervene directly, manifesting countless advanced weapons, teaching complex techniques, or simply giving his people fully formed technologies, he deliberately refrained from doing so.\nHis philosophy was to foster true evolution. He wanted his lifeforms to learn to innovate things on their own, to develop their own solutions, and to forge their own paths forward.\nHe had merely paved a broad way for them when he had previously gifted the basic weapons and magic techniques. His intention then was for them to focus on mastering those foundational concepts, establishing a base.\nBut now, with this A-Grade Innovation buff, the pace of ingenuity across Veridia would surely increase rapidly.\nHis people could now actively work to build weapons that ideally suited their unique needs and fighting styles.\nThey could discover new techniques through experimentation, pushing the boundaries of their understanding and allowing individuals to truly maximize their professional grades and reach their full potential.\nCurrently, in both the elven and human races, there existed a class of individuals known as priests or shamans.\nThese individuals were responsible for conducting the monthly offerings to Cosmos and, by virtue of their direct connection to the divine, held the highest positions within their respective races, second only to the elected or appointed leaders.\nJust as Rune, the shaman of the human race, lay sleeping peacefully in his tribal hut, a melodious voice, imbued with divine grace and the ethereal quality of a higher being, resonated directly within his mind.\n\"For the next 135 years, may your world bring forth boundless innovations for Veridia.\"\nThe very same voice, carrying the identical divine decree, sounded simultaneously within the sleeping mind of the Elven Shaman.\nThe very next day, in both the elven and human capitals, urgent sittings of the top-most leaders were convened.\nThere, with solemn faces and hushed tones, they discussed the profound Divine Decree received by their respective shamans.\nThe result of this decree was not long in coming. Indeed, just that day, across numerous settlements, many individuals among the populace, imbued with this newfound spark of inspiration, innovated various practical tools and concepts that profoundly aided the humans in countless ways.\nSimple yet revolutionary implements like more efficient axes, methods for controlled fire usage, and techniques for crafting more durable leather clothing began to appear.\nThis immediate and tangible manifestation of the divine blessing served to make their belief in Sunny, their God Cosmos, even stronger, cementing his place as their benevolent, guiding deity.\nDear Valued Readers,\nThis is your author, reaching out with a quick update on our journey together.\nMy college semester is about to begin this week, which means my schedule will become significantly busier. As a result, the update frequency for our beloved novel will likely shift to three Chapters per week.\nPlease know that this is a baseline, and I am absolutely committed to writing and uploading more whenever my time allows. Your enthusiasm fuels my pen, and I'll seize every opportunity to deliver more of Veridia's unfolding saga to you.\nSpeaking of Veridia, I'd love to hear your thoughts! As we've journeyed this far, please consider sharing your honest reviews and impressions. Your feedback is incredibly valuable and helps me immensely.\nThank you so much for your incredible support and for reading along with me until now. Your dedication means the world.\nWarmly,\nCosmos_07",

      "content": "Chapter 24 - Ch 24: Realm of Advancements\nAfter checking the great use of the Innovation Buff upon Veridia, observing the tangible shifts in his world's progress, Sunny decided it was time to turn his attention to the other, equally intriguing items he had acquired from the System shop.\nHis divine perception shifted, focusing on the newly materialized tools within his ethereal God Space.\nFirst, he drew forth the Talent Appraising Ball.\nIn Sunny's hand, a spherical orb of luminous blue shimmered, visibly resonating with the surrounding mana, humming with latent power.\nAs he held it, words materialized on its smooth surface, hovering like ethereal light:\n[Name : ??]\n[Talent Grade : ??]\n[Description : ??]\n\"Is this ball broken? Should I use it for football then?\" Sunny quipped, a wry smile touching his lips.\nHe tossed the thought into the vast emptiness of his God Space, but there was, predictably, no one there to share in his dry humor.\nA small sigh escaped him, a brief moment of loneliness in his divine solitude. He quickly deduced the reason for the failure.\nThere was evidently a fundamental limit to this B-Grade Talent Appraising Ball; perhaps it simply could not evaluate the immense, transcendental talent of a God.\nOr, more plausibly, it lacked the capacity to measure anything as exceptionally potent as an SSS-Grade talent, like his own Skill-Resonance.\nSunny didn't dwell on this minor inconvenience.\nThe ball's inability to appraise him personally did not diminish its overwhelming utility for Veridia.\nWith a swift mental command, he directly manifested 20 more pieces of the Talent Appraising Ball.\nTheir cost, though unseen in his current abundance, was clearly negligible enough for mass production.\nHis intention was clear: he would bestow these invaluable tools upon the humans and elves of Veridia.\nThis would empower them to discern their innate talents in advance, preventing them from squandering precious years of their lives striving in unproductive fields. Imagine, he thought, a lifeform blessed with a powerful body-strengthening talent attempting, in vain, to master the intricacies of magic; it would be an endeavor utterly without merit, a tragic waste of a lifetime.\nThus, the importance of the Talent Appraising Ball was imminent, a catalyst for efficient societal and individual development.\nSunny acknowledged, with a pragmatic nod, that such a tool could inevitably create a talent-based hierarchy within Veridia, naturally elevating those born with higher aptitudes.\nYet, he was not going to impede this natural stratification.\nFor his own divine purpose, for his own SSS-Grade talent to bear fruit, he critically needed his lifeforms to cultivate and refine their inherent talents to the highest possible levels, enabling him to eventually copy their perfected skills.\nAs was his custom, Sunny decided he would wait for the next scheduled offerings provided by the shamans of both races to deliver these insightful artifacts.\nHe mentally set aside the comprehensive exploration of the God's Eye for a later, more focused session, recognizing its profound power required his undivided attention.\nThe next item he intended to examine was the Divine Embryo.\nHe began to deeply ponder the optimal shape and the essential abilities he would imbue into this unprecedented divine creation.\n\"Can I manifest this directly?\" Sunny mused, his intense gaze fixed upon the pulsating, formless mass of the Divine Embryo.\nHe now possessed a clearer understanding of the profound implications of his \"God of Manifestations\" title, especially concerning the cost of creation.\nThe more inherent energy and complexity an item or being contained, the greater the Faith points required to manifest it into existence.\nFrom his astute divine observation, it seemed it would only take about 5,000 Faith points to manifest one Divine Embryo into its most basic, unformed state.\n\"I could even create an entire army of divine embryos instead of relying on these evolving lifeforms,\" Sunny's mind raced, briefly captivated by the tantalizing prospect of an unswervingly loyal, custom-made legion.\nYet, he swiftly dismissed the notion. While the Divine Embryo was intelligent and guaranteed absolute loyalty, it was not truly a 'lifeform' in the organic sense, at least not in the way he understood it. \"Something like an artificial intelligence,\" Sunny categorized it.\nHe remained uncertain, and held little hope, that he could actually gain Faith points from these artificially created embryos, a crucial factor in his grand strategy.\nSunny entertained a myriad of designs for his very first Divine Embryo.Thɪs\nHe considered crafting a powerful human champion, a graceful elven sage, a sturdy dwarven warrior, a fearsome werewolf, an ancient vampire, or even a nascent world tree that could anchor Veridia's spiritual energy.\nBut in the end, he discarded all these pragmatic, utilitarian choices.\nHis heart, still rooted in the fantastical lore of his Blue Planet, yearned for something truly grand, truly iconic.\nHe settled on the ultimate mythical creature.\n\"A Dragon,\" Sunny declared aloud, a wide, enthusiastic grin spreading across his face.\nHe was already vividly imagining a grand and mighty dragon, a magnificent beast that he could one day ride, soaring across his world.\nHe even conceived of leveraging its awe-inspiring aura for \"aura farming,\" passively generating immense Faith points through its sheer existence and the reverence it would inspire.\nHe meticulously chose its physical form: a classic black western dragon.\nIt would possess a formidable, muscular physique, characterized by a long, serpentine neck that coiled with grace and power, leading to a massive, barrel-chested torso, indicative of immense strength.\nIts powerful limbs would end in razor-sharp talons, perfect for rending and gripping, and its tail would be long and whip-like, capable of delivering devastating, crushing blows.\nIt would be endowed with two vast, bat-like wings, stretching wide enough to blot out the sun.\nIts entire body would be covered with thick, overlapping scales of glistening obsidian, their dark surfaces absorbing light and radiating an ominous, almost terrifying majesty.\nAs Sunny concentrated on this incredibly detailed image and mentally commanded the Embryo to take shape, it immediately responded, morphing and expanding, solidifying directly from the crucible of Sunny's divine imagination.\nA creature, tall and mighty, now hung suspended before him. Even without true life animating its form, it exuded an aura of ancient arrogance, an aloof creature seemingly detached from all worldly possessions.\nImmediately, Sunny sensed his immense Faith points dwindling at an alarming rate.\nApproximately 50,000 of his Faith points vanished, consumed by the act of shaping this magnificent draconic form.\nSunny was momentarily stunned.\nHis initial estimation for a base embryo was only 5,000 Faith points. If the mere body of this creature amounted to such an astronomical sum, then he could only imagine the exorbitant cost that its formidable abilities would demand.\nStill, Sunny began to ponder the creature's potential abilities, shaking off his brief shock.\nHe didn't pay much heed to the dwindling Faith points.\nHis private God chat was constantly beeming with thousands upon thousands of messages from other eager Gods, all clamoring for his unique manifestations.\nHe knew, with absolute certainty, that he could easily earn millions of Faith points in just one or two hours by fulfilling their constant requests.\nThus, for Sunny, Faith, while essential, was not the most pressing concern at this moment.\n\"What to choose, what to choose,\" Sunny murmured, resuming his profound contemplation regarding the abilities of his nascent dragon. He began to articulate his core strategic needs for this loyal companion. \"I need it to have exceptional traveling abilities, capable of traversing every Continent of Veridia with effortless grace, and furthermore, to journey to other planets also when my territory inevitably expands beyond this single world\" He decided on granting his dragon Space Affinity, an ability that would allow it to move through the void itself.\nAs he focused his thoughts on bestowing this profound power, he suddenly felt his Faith diminish once more, this time by an even larger, more painful sum.\n\"About 150,000 Faith points!\" Sunny lamented, a genuine wince crossing his divine countenance at the enormous, continuous loss.\nHe now needed to equip his dragon with essential Attack, Defense, and Support abilities.\nFor defense, he bestowed upon it Elemental and Physical Defense, costing another colossal 100,000 Faith points.\nFor its offensive and utility capabilities, he granted it Magic Affinity to wield spells, another significant outlay of 150,000 Faith points.\nHis Faith reserves were now considerably depleted.\nHe held only 50,000 Faith points remaining.\nHe decided to halt the dragon's development, choosing to wait and accumulate more Faith to give it more powerful abilities like specialized eye powers, the ability to communicate fluently, and its signature breath spell, reserving these for a later date.\nFor the next four hours of his own time, Sunny wholeheartedly committed himself to manifesting various items for the other Gods in his private chat, efficiently replenishing his Faith reserves with practiced ease.\nJust as he felt his Faith coffers refilling to a more comfortable level, about 3 million, a powerful, resonant global notification echoed throughout the vast divine realm.\n[Global notification!]\n[Congratulations Gods for Completing your second Godly day!]\n[From now, the realm of advancement is open for every world!]",

      "content": "Chapter 25 - Ch 25 : The advancement\nAs Sunny had the ingrained habit of keeping the God Chat open,\nhis divine gaze lingered on the stream of frantic messages,\nimmediately after the momentous announcement of the \"Realm of Advancement.\"\nA palpable tremor of curiosity and uncertainty rippled through the divine community.\n\"Realm of Advancement sounds good for the world, but what does it actually do?\" one God typed,\ntheir query appearing almost simultaneously with the System's global notification.\n\"Will it truly help our worlds to advance more rapidly?\" another God questioned,\ntheir words echoing the collective hope and confusion.\nA veritable fury of questions, wild speculations, and anxious inquiries began to stir,\nerupting across the vast, ethereal expanse of the God Chat.\nThe chatter was instantaneous, overwhelming, and filled with a divine urgency.\nThen, a new message flashed, cutting through the cacophony.\n\"Guys, I found a portal in my world!\" one God exclaimed,\nsharing an accompanying image that instantly materialized in Sunny's divine perception.\nIt depicted a mesmerizing magical phenomenon:\na swirling vortex of space distortion,\na gateway shimmering with arcane energy.\nIt looked strikingly similar to the entrance of a profound dungeon or a vast, unexplored subspace.\nInstantly, it clicked for Sunny,\nand indeed, for all the other Gods in the chat:\nthis was unequivocally the door to the Realm of Advancement.\nThe questions quickly shifted from theoretical to practical.\n\"Do we need to send our lifeforms into this world?\" one God inquired,\ntheir digital voice tinged with hesitation.\n\"Upstairs, your IQ is that of a child and you call yourself a God?\" Joker, ever the mischievous prankster, typed in response,\nunable to resist making sport of another God's apparent bewilderment.\nHe was, as always, fond of making light of anyone's misery or perceived foolishness.\n\"Don't start with your bullshit, Joker, this is not the time to joke!\" another God retorted sharply,\ntheir frustration palpable at Joker's ill-timed mischief.\nThe gravity of the situation was too immense for petty squabbles.\n\"Guys, we can only try by sending our lifeforms some revelations,\" a more pragmatic God suggested,\ntheir words seeking a path forward amidst the uncertainty.\nThen came a lament, tinged with divine despair.\n\"But the portal in my world is millions of kilometers away!\" one God typed,\ntheir message conveying immense frustration.\n\"With vast mountain ranges, treacherous deserts, and impenetrable forests in between, how can my lifeforms possibly travel there?\"\nHe lamented his misfortune, a cruel twist of fate placing such an insurmountable distance between his nascent civilization and the Realm of Advancement.\n\"You can ask for God Cosmos's help,\" a new voice chimed in, calm and authoritative.\nIt was Zir.\n\"He can easily manifest cars, trucks, ships, even helicopters with their fuel, and his fees are also surprisingly cheap.\"\nZir's message, and those that followed, served a very specific purpose.\nThe current, unspoken task for the rapidly expanding Cosmic Alliance was simply to promote Sunny's business,\nto be his unofficial, yet highly effective, marketing arm.\nThey actively helped Sunny,\neven though Sunny himself had not issued any direct commands or even subtle suggestions for them to do so.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nThey were clearly, and willingly, showing Sunny their unwavering loyalty,\nworking diligently as his devoted \"lackies.\"\nNyx, Reflection, and other key alliance members also chimed in,\ntheir messages echoing Zir's sentiment,\npraising Sunny's efficiency and affordability.\nThe Cosmic Alliance had now swelled to an impressive 360 members,\na testament to the success of their previous collaborative ventures.\nAnd all of them were keenly aware of Sunny's generosity.\nThe 10% market discount on his manifestations was certainly a good incentive,\nbut the main, truly invaluable benefit was the priority in business.\nThis meant their manifestation orders would be fulfilled first,\nahead of the potentially vast queues of other, non-alliance Gods.\nMoreover, Sunny had consistently shared many of his unique insights within the private Alliance Group.\nHe had revealed profound truths he had gained directly from the System—\ninsights like the temporary 10x evolution boosts he could grant,\nthe staggering fact that 300,000 Gods existed within this specific universe (implying more in others),\nand crucial details about the universal grading system for talents and items.\nEach of these pieces of news was entirely new to them,\ninformation they knew was not readily available even in the general God Chat.\nThis exclusivity made it abundantly clear to them that Sunny possessed a truly high-grade talent,\na source of knowledge far beyond their own.\nThus, they were more than happy to follow Sunny's lead,\nrecognizing his unique value and benevolent leadership.\nSunny noticed this fervent display of loyalty and chuckled softly to himself.\nHe quickly typed a message of thanks to these dedicated alliance members in his private Group Chat,\nhis gratitude genuine.\nWhile everyone else was still focused on the raging discussions in the public God Chat,\nspeculating wildly about the Realm of Advancement,\nSunny bypassed the chatter.\nHe called out directly to his System: \"System! What is Realm of Advancement?\"\nThe System's reply was instantaneous, concise, and profoundly impactful:\n[Realm of Advancement]\n[Grade : S]\n[Description : A gateway to the Universe of no Gods, where the authority of Gods can't reach. Only lifeforms are allowed to enter this realm and fight for the opportunity.]\nSunny's mind reeled slightly at the revelation. A universe where the authority of Gods held no sway? That was a concept both terrifying and exhilarating. His immediate follow-up question was equally pressing: \"System, what opportunities?\"\nHowever, no System notification replied.\nThe silence was absolute, as usual, when he delved too deep into its cryptic workings.\nSunny sighed, a familiar gesture of mild frustration,\nand shifted his divine gaze towards Veridia.\nHe searched for the newly revealed portal,\nhis perception sweeping across continents.\nHe found it, shimmering faintly,\nsituated prominently in the vast central continent of his world.\nSunny sighed again.\nThe distance was truly vast,\nstretching millions of kilometers between the portal's location and the established territories of his human and elven tribes.\nIt presented a significant logistical challenge.\nHe then took a moment to observe the humans,\nand found that their advancement was truly astonishing,\na direct consequence of the Innovation Buff he had bestowed.\nThey had developed rudimentary carts for transport,\nsimple yet effective boats for riverine travel and fishing,\nand had even fashioned crossbows for more efficient hunting and defense.\nTheir settlements now featured sturdy stone huts,\nsignifying a transition from nomadic existence to permanent communities.\nFarming techniques had become more sophisticated,\nleading to greater food security,\nand they were actively engaged in breeding animals for sustained resources.\nThe emergence of a coherent writing system was also evident,\na monumental step for knowledge transfer, history, and the development of rudimentary laws.\nTheir magical development was also progressing at an incredible pace.\nThey had already developed many basic wooden staffs,\neach carefully etched with mana stones to significantly increase the effectiveness of their magical spells.\nApart from many newly developed spells,\nthe nascent development in alchemy and rudimentary array formation was also visibly progressing.\nSimultaneously, Sunny shifted his focus to the elven lands,\nobserving their distinct path of accelerated evolution under the same Innovation Buff.\nThe elves, with their inherent grace and connection to nature,\nwere exhibiting advancements that uniquely blended magic with their environment.\nTheir settlements, nestled deep within ancient forests,\nwere now expanding with structures that seemed to grow organically from the trees themselves,\nintricately woven and shaped by nascent earth and plant magic.\nThey had begun to discover new, more complex spells,\nnot just for combat, but for nurturing the land,\npurifying water sources,\nand even for subtle manipulations of the weather within their territories.\nTheir mastery over mana was deepening,\nleading to improved mana conduits that channeled natural energy directly into their communities,\nand the creation of small, stable mana lakes.\nEnchanted items were becoming more common among them:\narmor intricately reinforced with nature's magic,\ntools that aided in magically cultivating rare herbs,\nand delicate magical communication devices that allowed swift contact across their vast forest domains.\nEarly forms of arcane academies were also beginning to take shape,\nwhere elven mages meticulously documented and shared their magical discoveries.\nTheir craftsmanship, already renowned for its beauty,\nwas now infused with subtle enchantments,\ncreating objects of both aesthetic and magical power.\nThus, clearly showing the widespread and diverse advancement of Veridia,\nall due to the potent influence of the Innovation Buff.",

      "content": "Chapter 26 - Ch 26: Nova, The Advance Scout\nSunny relayed the critical information about the Realm of Advancement, a new and mysterious gateway, to both the human and elven tribes dwelling on Veridia.\nHis divine message permeated the collective consciousnesses of the shamans of both humans and elves, an urgent and undeniable truth.\nThe reason for this immediate divine revelation was simple and strategic: Sunny wanted them to focus all their burgeoning ingenuity and effort on building faster, more efficient methods of travel.\nThe current, rudimentary boats, primarily constructed and utilized by the humans, were simply incapable of traversing such immense distances.\nTheir small size and limited capacity for rations meant that even if they attempted such a monumental journey, it would consume 50 or more years of their precious mortal lives, an unacceptably long time unless some groundbreaking technological leap occurred.\nSunny deliberately chose not to directly manifest advanced vehicles for them— no sleek, high-speed boats appeared out of thin air, no roaring airplanes materialized in the skies, no buzzing helicopters descended from the heavens.\nHe understood that such direct, overt intervention, while seemingly expedient in the short term, would foster a dangerous and ingrained dependency.\nIt would invariably condition his lifeforms to rely on him every single time a misfortune arose, or every time a significant challenge presented itself.\nHis ultimate goal was for them to be as independent, self-reliant, and inherently innovative as possible, not to become \"faith consuming fools\" who would merely passively wait for divine help at every turn of their developing civilizations.\nThe divine revelation was like a wildfire, a powerful, transformative force, spreading with astonishing speed and intensity throughout every corner of the human and elven tribes.ᴜᴘᴅᴀᴛᴇ ꜰʀᴏᴍ ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nIt ignited a collective sense of profound purpose and a fervent, unwavering drive for innovation.\n\"Ask everyone to focus their minds on finding a better way to transport,\" Thorn, the pragmatic and resolute leader of the human tribe, commanded, his voice resonating with newfound resolve as he addressed all the other authoritative figures gathered before him.\nThe primary Goal of the humans, spurred by this direct divine imperative, was now unequivocally clear: to focus all their collective genius and resources on technological advancement, specifically geared towards achieving rapid travel methods across vast distances.\nOn the other hand, the elves, with their innate magical prowess, deep connection to nature, and inherent affinity for the arcane, were also focusing intensely on fast travel, but their approach diverged sharply from that of the humans.\nInstead of purely technological advancements, they aimed to achieve it through sophisticated array formations.\nIn the elven tribe, there existed a gifted magician, ranked D-Grade in raw magical power but possessing an impressive B potential for growth and mastery, and crucially, endowed with a rare space affinity in magic.\nBecause of this specific individual's unique talent, the elven forgers, who crafted magical artifacts, and their formation masters, who designed complex arrays, had already been able to develop some rudimentary artifacts and arrays that were subtly imbued with nascent space powers.\nTheir most significant breakthrough to date was small-scale teleportation, a marvel of magical engineering and a testament to their arcane skill.\nThus, their path forward was clear and focused: they only needed to research tirelessly on existing array formations, meticulously refining and enhancing them to exponentially increase the distance of their teleportation capabilities.\nSunny observed all this with a sense of profound approval.\nHe knew, of course, that if he truly wanted, he could bypass all their struggles and laborious research.\nHe could directly teleport all his lifeforms, both human and elven, instantly placing them in front of the enigmatic portal to the Realm of Advancement.\nBut doing so would incur a colossal cost in Faith points, an expenditure Sunny was deeply reluctant to undertake, especially when there were other, more strategic and valuable uses for his ever-accumulating divine currency.\nHe had already meticulously thought of a cunning and preemptive plan to potentially impede the advancement of other Gods' lifeforms within this new realm, at least until his own chosen lifeforms managed to reach it and secure their own opportunities.\nAnd the centerpiece of this audacious plan was simple and elegant: his newly created, as-yet unnamed, pet dragon.\nSunny intended to send his magnificent dragon to visit this realm first, to act as his personal advance scout, his divine vanguard.\nNova would gather all the necessary intelligence and information about its dangers, its layout, and its profound opportunities.\nCrucially, it would also serve a secondary, yet equally vital, purpose: to deter or outright stop the lifeforms from other Gods from taking too many of the valuable treasures or seizing all the prime opportunities within this mysterious realm before Veridia's champions even arrived.\nNow, with his Faith coffers thoroughly replenished and swelling to a comfortable level, hovering around 3 million points after his recent divine transactions, Sunny had more than enough capital to bestow upon his formidable pet dragon some truly powerful and essential additional abilities. His Dragon already possessed a formidable set of inherent talents: Space Affinity, which would allow it to traverse the cosmic void; Magic Affinity, granting it the inherent capacity to wield arcane energies; the ability to change its size at will, a versatile power for both stealth and intimidation; and both Elemental and Physical Defense, ensuring its profound resilience against various forms of threat.\nHe now intended to imbue it with Super Strength, the all-seeing Eye of Truth for unparalleled perception and discernment, and a devastating Dragon's Breath, a classic and awe-inspiring draconic weapon.\n(Note: Space Affinity would specifically let the lifeform use spatial magic, while Magic Affinity granted it the general ability to use magic of any kind.)\nSunny began to channel his vast reserves of Faith points, pouring immense sums of his divine energy into the nascent form of his dragon, carefully creating and solidifying these powerful new abilities within its very essence.\nAs the last ability finally solidified within its being, Sunny decided upon a name for this magnificent creature, a name that resonated with its cosmic journey and explosive power: he named this awe-inspiring dragon 'Nova'.\nAll of this grand empowerment cost him more than 2 million Faith points in total.\nThe price had increased exponentially, a truly staggering sum, as the sheer number and the profound potency of the talents concentrated within Nova grew with each addition.\nNow, Nova held an astounding 8 distinct talents, each one formidable and transformative in its own right.\n\"All done! For now.\" Sunny declared, a profound sense of satisfaction washing over him.\nHe decided, after a final assessment, that this much inherent strength and capability should more than suffice for Nova's initial, critical mission.\nBut Sunny, in his current state of triumph and focused purpose, didn't yet fully realize the sheer, unbridled terror he had unwittingly created for all the other Gods in the vast universe.\nWith his creation now perfectly equipped and brimming with latent power, Sunny focused his divine will, instilling true, vibrant life into the magnificent form of his Dragon.\nAs if listening to a silent, primordial command from its creator, Nova's massive form shuddered, a ripple of nascent energy coursing through its obsidian scales. And then, from its primordial depths, it let out a colossal roar.\nThis roar was so utterly deafening, so overwhelmingly powerful in its raw sonic force, that if Sunny had not possessed his own inherent Godly Body, a form that transcended all mortal fragility and physical limitations, he felt absolutely certain he would have been utterly blown to smithereens, reduced to nothing but scattered divine dust by the sheer concussive force alone.\n\"Thank God we are in a private God Space, and thank God the lifeforms on Veridia can't possibly listen to this roar, otherwise, the outcome will be truly terrifying for them.\" Sunny thought, a faint shiver running through his divine form despite his immense power.\nHe watched as Nova slowly, deliberately, opened his eyes. The ancient, aloof, and distinctly arrogant expression that had previously graced the dragon's unawakened form instantly melted away.\nIt was replaced by an expression of utter devotion, a gaze as humble and loving as that of a loyal kitten or a faithful dog.\nNova lowered its massive, draconic head, bowing deeply in profound reverence before its creator.\nThen, a voice, deep and resonant, yet filled with an undeniable warmth and innate respect, echoed directly within Sunny's mind: \"Greetings to the Creator.\"\n\"Arise.\" Sunny commanded, his own voice steady and ringing with divine authority, despite the profound sense of awe that now filled him.\nHe couldn't help but gasp, a genuine, human sound of sheer astonishment and wonder, as he looked at the truly gigantic black dragon, Nova, standing before him in its full, majestic, and living glory.\nHe, Sunny, was just a small delivery man from his Blue Planet, who had once worked tirelessly, 12 hours a day, day in and day out, simply to earn enough to fill his meager belly.\nHe hadn't had any close friends or relatives to share his life with, thus his meager earnings had been solely for himself and the authors whose captivating novels he avidly supported by reading (You should also support the author guys!).\nAnd now, to have become a God, to have a mythical, awe-inspiring creature of such immense power bow in front of him, acknowledging him as its rightful creator and master, was giving Sunny a very strange and utterly triumphing feeling, a sense of accomplishment and exhilaration that transcended anything he had ever known in his mortal life.\n\"Nova, your first task is crucial.\" Sunny ordered, his voice ringing with divine purpose, his gaze firm and directed towards the future.\n\"Go to the Realm of Advancement immediately. Scout the surroundings thoroughly, and check for any potential threats for the lifeforms of Veridia before they arrive.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 27 - Ch 27 : Demigod Nova\nIn the vast, cerulean skies of Veridia, a majestic creature soared with an undeniable air of innate arrogance and an almost ethereal aloofness.\nYet, no other lifeform on the entire world was aware of such a divine spectacle, for the magnificent creature was none other than Nova, Sunny's newly awakened black dragon. And he was currently flying within the void, a dimension separate from the mortal plane, undetectable to ordinary senses.\nNova possessed the power to have directly teleported in front of the Realm of Advancement portal, but Sunny had ordered him to first fly across the entirety of Veridia.\nThis extensive flight was not merely for reconnaissance; it was for Nova to internalize the essence of his new home, for Veridia was going to be Nova's sanctuary and domain until the lifeforms inhabiting it reached the age of space travels, capable of accompanying their dragon.\nAfter majestically traversing the breadth and depth of Veridia, Nova was now intimately aware of the intricate conditions of his new home, from the sprawling human settlements to the ancient elven forests.\nHis next critical task was to visit the enigmatic Realm of Advancement.\nWhile Nova was diligently flying across Veridia, Sunny had been intently observing the bustling God Chat, and through its ever-flowing messages, he found many interesting and concerning news regarding the newly opened Realm of Advancement.\nOne particularly fortunate God, blessed with immense fortune or perhaps an extremely rare cosmic alignment, had discovered that the portal to this new realm had formed just a few kilometers away from his nascent lifeforms' primary settlement.\nWithout hesitation, this God had immediately sent a divine revelation, a clear and undeniable directive, for them to enter this mysterious portal.\nThe lifeforms, ever loyal and deeply fearful of their almighty creator, didn't dare to doubt this profound revelation. They swiftly gathered their strongest and most courageous individuals, letting them be the first to step into the unknown.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ\nThe outcome of their venture was precisely as the System had described: a land of no Gods. Here, the omnipresent authority of Gods simply could not reach.\nDivine beings could only spectate this alien world through the limited, mortal eyes of their own lifeforms.\nTheir vast divine perception, which usually allowed them to grasp the entirety of their worlds in a single glance, was rendered utterly useless here; they couldn't just check the condition of this world at one glance, unable to pierce its veil of mystery.\nThus, even the mighty Gods were now feeling the profound, almost unsettling, mysteries of this new world, a realm beyond their direct control.\nThey quickly discovered a harsh truth: they couldn't even use their precious Faith points for any form of divine intervention within this restricted realm, leaving their lifeforms truly on their own.\nThat rich God, demonstrating a surprising degree of caution, didn't permit his strongest lifeforms to wander aimlessly around this perilous new realm, due to the very real fear of losing his prized lifeforms to its unknown dangers.\nInstead, he decided to develop a secure camp around the portal, establishing a safe base in both his original world and within the new realm.\nAccording to the courageous Gods that had bravely ventured their lifeforms into this world, they had uncovered a stark reality: this realm was teeming with an abundance of diverse flora and fauna, many of which were utterly alien to their home worlds.\nMoreover, monsters and demons were shockingly commonplace, a pervasive threat in this untamed land.\nTheir shared experiences were grim, with even gruesome images and videos circulating in the God Chat, showing a lifeform being brutally eaten alive by ravenous demons.\nThis horrific imagery sent profound shivers down every God's divine body, making them thankful that their own worlds, by comparison, only harbored monsters.\nMonsters, while also aggressive and dangerous, were undeniably not as inherently strong or as brutally ferocious as these newly encountered demons.\nThe vivid images and raw videos of these demons, shared by the Gods whose lifeforms had encountered them, clearly displayed the terrifying strength, savage ferocity, and predatory cunning of these new adversaries.\nThey were creatures of nightmare, with jagged teeth, glowing, malevolent eyes, and claws that ripped through flesh with horrifying ease.\nSome were hulking brutes, covered in grotesque scales or chitin, while others were slender and swift, moving with a chilling, unnatural grace, always seeking to tear apart and consume.\nTheir roars resonated with pure malice, and their very presence seemed to warp the air with a sense of dread.\nSunny also took careful notice of all these disturbing videos and chilling images of demons.\nHowever, due to the inherent restrictions of this Realm of Advancement, no God, not even Sunny, could directly access a System description of these new entities or the realm itself.\nBut with grave danger, there were also many unparalleled opportunities.\nFor example, the rare herbs and other powerful artifacts found within these worlds were proving to be far more extraordinary and potent than anything ever discovered on their own planets of Gods, hinting at untold riches for those brave enough to seize them.\n\"They look strong, but still not as strong as Nova,\" Sunny mused, his divine perception analyzing the demonic threats through the lens of Nova's formidable power.\nHe didn't feel any immediate threat from these demons originating from the Realm of Advancement, his confidence in his creation absolute.\nNova was not only incredibly strong but was, without a doubt, the strongest of all his current lifeforms, a being crafted for unparalleled power.\nOrdinary lifeforms in Veridia typically only had one talent, which at most, might reach an S-Grade upon reaching their peak potential.\nIn stark contrast, all of Nova's talents were already at an astonishing SS-Grade, and there were 8 such talents in total, each amplifying the dragon's capabilities to an almost divine level.\nThe main, critical point was that other lifeforms still needed to painstakingly reach their full potential through trials and evolution, but Nova was already at the absolute peak of its potential, fully actualized and immensely powerful from the moment of its awakening.\nHe was truly above all and below only Sunny, thus a true demigod.\nSunny, in his profound understanding of Nova's design, couldn't think of any inherent weakness in his dragon, a testament to his meticulous crafting.\nSunny could easily grant Nova any further abilities he desired, enhancing it even more; the only remaining constraint was simply the continuous supply of Faith points.\nWhile Sunny was pondering all these strategic thoughts and assessing the new realm's challenges and opportunities, Nova was already diligently venturing deep inside the Realm of Advancement.\nThe magnificent dragon soared through its alien skies, using its potent Eye of Truth to scan far and wide, searching for any valuable artifacts, powerful resources, or lurking threats.\nThe Eye of Truth was a truly remarkable ability, created by Sunny in such a way that it could instantly show the detailed information and grade of any item or entity upon which Nova's gaze fell.\nSunny himself didn't fully comprehend the intricate, divine mechanics of how this particular ability worked; he had simply thought of the concept of an eye that could perceive truth and detail, and it had manifested itself flawlessly within Nova.\nSunny found a multitude of fascinating insights from this initial, successful use of a divine embryo and the spontaneous manifestation of such complex abilities.\nHe immediately decided to later experiment rigorously on existing artifacts, pondering how he might integrate similar talents directly into them, effectively imbuing inanimate objects with unique powers.\nFor now, however, his unwavering focus was to meticulously scout this enigmatic realm, absorbing all its secrets and dangers through the keen, all-perceiving perception of Nova.",

      "content": "Chapter 28 - Ch 28 : Anaske's Devotion\n\"Master, I have completed my search in the hundred thousand kilometer radius of the portal.\" Nova said to Sunny through the instantaneous connection between them.The source of thɪs content is\nThis exhaustive search had not even taken a few minutes of Nova's precious time.\nDue to its powerful magic affinity, the effects of any magic or abilities used by Nova were manyfold more potent than ordinary.\nThus, accompanied by the already incredibly powerful Eye of Truth, the perception and scouting capability of Nova was truly astonishing, covering vast distances in mere moments.\n\"Don't harm the lifeforms of other Gods and take the treasures from the faraway places only.\" Sunny instructed Nova, his divine thoughts clear and precise.\nHe didn't want the other Gods to perceive Nova as a direct threat or a rival, potentially putting his valuable dragon on their collective hitlist.\nSunny was not afraid of the retaliation of one single God, as his own power was formidable.\nHowever, if all the Gods collectively felt a profound fear or threat from Nova, they could easily combine their vast reserves of faith to create a much stronger demigod specifically to counter Nova, a scenario Sunny wished to avoid.\nThe reason behind taking the treasures only from far places was also strategic: Sunny didn't want to deplete the valuable resources immediately near the portal to Veridia.\nThose resources were destined to be helpful to his own lifeforms once they eventually reached the Realm of Advancement.\nNoticing that even in a hundred thousand kilometer radius, the curvature of the earth was still flat, which clearly denoted the truly enormous size and vastness of this new realm.\nSunny stopped paying such close, constant attention to Nova's ongoing exploration and started to fully immerse himself in his manifestation talent, eager to push its boundaries.\nAs Sunny was deeply immersed in his groundbreaking experiments, the God chat was still as lively and chaotic as always.\nSome Gods were expressing profound distress, crying out due to what they termed the third misfortune to befall their worlds, indicating recurring calamities.\nOthers were intensely busy, consumed with thinking about and devising elaborate plans for the transportation of their lifeforms to where the elusive portal was located, a significant logistical challenge for many.\nMany established alliances, like the Wisdom Alliance of Strategist, the Timeless Council of Kairos, the Builder Union of Builder, the Merchant Union of Mercator, and many other smaller, less prominent alliances, were also intensely busy in collecting vast amounts of faith.\nThis collected faith was then primarily provided to their respective alliance leaders and to those select members possessing high-grade talents, ensuring the growth and strength of their collective.\nAll the members were doing this not out of fear or out of blind reverence towards their alliance leader, but purely due to a clear understanding of mutual benefit and shared prosperity.\nFor example, the faith points diligently provided by the members of the Timeless Council was generously given to Kairos, their leader.\nKairos, in turn, would strategically use this concentrated faith in his own world, thus significantly enhancing the growth and prosperity of his civilization.\nIn return, Kairos could provide many good and invaluable things to the members of his council, such as advanced magic techniques developed in his world due to the influence of his unique 10x time ability, a benefit immensely valuable to their own divine endeavors.\nSunny, however, was not lacking in faith points; his own reserves were substantial, thus he hadn't asked his own alliance members for any faith points.\nOtherwise, he could have easily garnered an additional half a million faith points, a testament to his alliance's loyalty and numbers.\nThe effects of Sunny's continuous experiments were beginning to show promising results.\nHe could now successfully imbue various artifacts with specific talents, specifically those talents with whose working principles he was intimately familiar.\nHowever, for talents whose internal workings Sunny was not yet familiar with, such as the mysterious God's Eye or Nova's unique Eye of Truth, Sunny was not yet able to manifest those upon artifacts.\n\"A mosquito's leg is still meat, I guess.\" Sunny mused, paraphrasing a common saying, indicating he was not overly downcast upon the partial failure of not yet being able to manifest the most complex talents like God's Eye or the Eye of Truth upon the artifacts.\nBeing able to manifest the talents he knew and understood was still a tremendously good thing, a significant breakthrough in itself.\nFor instance, he could now reliably create artifacts that could dramatically increase a lifeform's mana capacity or enhance the mana flow within their bodies, or even create items that tangibly increased the physical strength of any lifeforms who wielded them.\nSunny stopped paying more attention to this specific line of experimentation; he had already been intensely experimenting for more than 15 continuous hours, a testament to his divine focus.\nHe was still, however, paying a lot of attention to the ongoing developments on his world Veridia. He observed the steady creation of large wooden ships, vessels designed for longer, more ambitious journeys across vast seas, and the continued development of spells and arrays related to medium-grade teleportation, which could now reliably teleport a magician or a small group 1000s of kilometers away in a single bound, a monumental leap in travel.\nApart from these technological and magical advancements, there was also a significant change in human leadership.\nThorn's 21st child, a young man named Anaske, had now ascended to become the human leader, a testament to his talent and the tribe's evolving structure.\nDue to its rapidly expanding population, the human tribe had now successfully developed into a burgeoning kingdom, complete with three major, thriving cities and one central capital, a true mark of sophisticated civilization.\nAnaske himself was now an impressive A-Grade body-strengthening fighter, a formidable warrior, and he needed just a final push to reach the illustrious S-Grade.\nThus, he was truly looking forward to venturing into the realm their God had mentioned, eager for the opportunities it might hold for his own advancement and that of his people.\nEven though he was merely a newborn, a tiny infant, when Sunny had first descended to Veridia in his divine form, but due to his inherently high talent, or perhaps simply the captivating and awe-inspiring form of Sunny, he was never able to forget that momentous encounter.\nEven though at that time Sunny's body was covered in a mysterious black cloak and his face was concealed with a mask, those cosmic, all-seeing eyes were all that it took for anyone to fall into his divine grace, to be utterly captivated by his divine presence.\nFrom that moment, Anaske was not fearful towards this almighty, powerful being.\nHe felt nothing but utmost reverence towards Sunny, a profound and unwavering devotion, and his lifelong goal had since become to see that divine form again, to once more bask in the presence of his benevolent Creator.",

      "content": "Chapter 29 - Ch 29 : Third misfortune and generous rewards\nSunny was now feeling a growing unease within his divine heart, because it had been 17 hours of the third day and the foreseen misfortune was still conspicuously absent.\nHe harbored no particular fondness for misfortunes but knew with certainty that these trials were inevitable, thus the later their occurrence, the more profoundly dismayed Sunny became.\nSunny judiciously diverted his keen mind to divine trades, diligently collecting faith points, and earnestly increasing his vast knowledge; he possessed grand plans for this accumulated knowledge in the foreseeable future, but as always, required the essential capital to bring this knowledge to fruition.\nAs Sunny was busily engaged in trade during the 18th hour of the day, Sunny suddenly perceived a large number of lifeforms falling ill within the human kingdom.\nAfter meticulously observing the bodily functions of the afflicted people, Sunny precisely knew the reason for this widespread illness: the insufficient management of communal human waste.\n\"A misfortune not overly arduous to manage,\" Sunny mused, knowing he could directly provide them with the necessary information to swiftly solve this pressing issue.\nBut he decided against such direct intervention; he simply conveyed a divine revelation to the priests of the human kingdom.\nThe role of priest was merely a designated profession, and any magician, healer, or fighter could apply to become one.\nBut the leader of these priests could only be someone who could truly commune with the divine and receive sacred revelations.\nSunny's revelation contained the detailed cause of this pervasive disease.\nAs ever, the divine revelation was regarded with utmost reverence and importance; all the healers swiftly commenced the arduous task of tending to the afflicted humans.\nAnd others were diligently occupied with discovering a viable solution; Anaske also publicly announced a generous reward for anyone who provided an effective resolution to this misfortune.\nSunny ceased dedicating significant attention to this specific misfortune and promptly resumed his trading activities.\nAs he was trading and diligently accruing faith points from his fellow Gods, quite apart from those standard faith points, he perceived a prodigious influx of faith points originating directly from Veridia.\nSunny looked towards Veridia and found that the humans were prostrating themselves in devout reverence before his statue; these people were mainly the afflicted individuals who had recovered through the diligent healing efforts of the priests.\nAnd Anaske, too, was bowing in profound reverence before the very statue he had personally commissioned within his formidable stone castle.\nHe felt the palpable resurgence of divine benevolence amongst his people and throughout all of Veridia.\nDue to all these people praying to Sunny at once, the influx of faith swiftly reached the millions.\nThen came the melodious pronouncement of the System.Thɪs NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n[Congratulations, God Cosmos, for overcoming today's designated misfortune]\nThis misfortune had been resolved in a mere 40 minutes of divine time, though for the lifeforms of Veridia, it represented a duration of 275 arduous days.\nSuch swift resolution was solely attributable to the timely revelation from Sunny, for without it, this calamity would undoubtedly have claimed countless lives.\nSunny merely smirked subtly at this divine confirmation and, with renewed vigor, promptly accessed the system shop.\n[Item name : Navigator Orb\nGrade : C\nDescription : Capable of marking up to 20 distinct locations and precisely guiding the user towards them according to their desires.\nNote : The designated locations must reside within the same world for the orb to function accurately.\nCost : 10000 faith points]\n[Item name : Talent elevator\nGrade : ungraded\nDescription : Upon acquisition, lifeforms subsequently born within the territory can possess multiple inherent talents at once.\nCost : 1 million Faith points]\n\"Here it is,\" Sunny exclaimed, one primary reason for his eagerness, for hoping for the misfortune, was precisely because Sunny wanted to obtain this particular item.\nFrom the Gods conversing in the God chat, he was already aware of two prevalent items commonly found within the shop's offerings.\nMany among his fellow Gods had even requested Sunny to manifest these Navigator Orbs for their own future explorations within the Realm of Advancement.\nSunny manifested a C-Grade one for all the other Gods and an S-Grade one for all the Cosmic Alliance members.\nAs was his custom, he manifested the finest version for his own personal use.\nAn SS-Grade Navigator Orb, capable of meticulously marking up to 1 million distinct locations and applicable across the vast multiverse of Gods.\nThus, Sunny's primary focus was intently fixed upon the second item, a capability he inherently lacked and for which he held the highest hopes: an item that defied direct manifestation, an item Sunny desired most ardently to exponentially increase the inherent strength of his burgeoning lifeforms.\nAfter two intensive hours of trading, Sunny had already amassed a truly massive pool of faith, his current reserves now approaching 5 million points.\nHe acquired this invaluable item, and immediately thereafter, an unforeseen and potent force enveloped both the entirety of Veridia and Sunny himself.\nSunny perceived this enveloping force to be akin to his own divine interventions or the direct expenditure of faith points, yet possessing a far greater potency.\nSunny inquired of the System regarding this extraordinary phenomenon, but no immediate answer was forthcoming.\n\"I truly need to become significantly stronger,\" Sunny mused, as he harbored a profound hope of swiftly acquiring the Magic Affinity talent from his beloved dragon, Nova.\nHe found amusement in this audacious thought; his inherent talent explicitly stated he could copy any talent found within his territory, and Nova, for a brief yet crucial period, had indeed resided within his divine domain.\nWhich unequivocally implied that Sunny could manifest a new Divine Embryo, imbue it with a powerful, desired talent, and then proceed to copy that very talent once his Skill Resonance cooldown had fully subsided.\n\"Indeed, these truly complement each other,\" Sunny affirmed.\nNow, Sunny's primary focus returned with renewed intensity to the system shop's remaining offerings.\nThe two remaining items in the system shop, according to the System's own pronouncements, were deemed the most critically needed items for the ongoing development of Veridia.\n[Item Name : 50% discount\nGrade : ungraded\nDescription : Upon acquisition, the faith consumed for any divine actions over the subsequent 3 days will be precisely halved.\nCost : 30000 faith points]\n[Item name : Knowledge of Divine Buffs\nGrade : SS-Grade\nDescription : Upon acquisition, the God can now apply powerful buffs to their territory with the calculated expenditure of faith points.\nCost : 3 million]\nSunny gasped, a rare display of astonishment, at both the nature of the items and their considerable cost.\nThe 50% discount was undeniably advantageous and genuinely needed by Sunny, for as a seasoned businessman, trading any divine commodity would now effectively result in half the original price.\nEven manifesting an item would now occur at a 50% reduced price, and crucially, acquiring the Knowledge of Divine Buffs item would also be subject to this 50% discount, directly translating to a substantial 1.5 million faith point saving.\nIt clearly represented a value far exceeding its mere 30,000 faith point cost.\nSunny resolved to extract every possible drop of faith benefit from this extraordinary 50% discount opportunity.\nSunny immediately acquired the 50% discount and, without hesitation, then purchased the Knowledge of Divine Buffs.",

      "content": "Chapter 30 - Ch 30 : Magic Affinity aquired\nAs Sunny bought the Knowledge of Divine Buffs, his mind was filled with immense knowledge about different kinds of Buffs; innovation Buff was also among them.\nWith this knowledge, Sunny could develop Buffs of his own and apply them on his whole territory.\nBut the downside of all this was that only one Buff is applicable at one time, for now.\nAs Sunny familiarized himself with different buffs and found synergies between buffs, he would be able to use two or more buffs at the same time.\nSunny stopped thinking about this for now, as this was not something that can be mastered at any time.\nThere were millions of Buffs in the Knowledge of Divine Buffs, and finding the helpful buffs with synergies and thus letting them co-exist is a very long process.\nAnd there is also a limitation of using one Buff at one time.\nTo benefit the most from the 50% discount, Sunny began to start his business again.\nAfter a few hours, the awaiting Notification, which always gives random surprises to all the Gods, appeared.\n[Global Notification!]\n[Congratulations to all the Gods for completing the third day of being a God]\n[I hope you are all having fun. Because the fun time is now over.]\nThis notification sent shivers across all the Gods.\nSunny gasped, \"Is this what you call fun time?\"\nIt is fun being a God for Sunny, but the responsibilities were also very high.\nHis life on Blue Planet was much more carefree: just delivering take-outs, eating, reading novels, and sleeping.\nBut Sunny was not missing that life even a little bit, because he had no one in that life, but here he still has friends in the Cosmic Alliance.\nThough the chat between the alliance members and Sunny was not very high,\nit was still on a regular basis for manifestation, and during that time, they talked to Sunny a lot.\nApart from the members of the Cosmic Alliance, Sunny still has his lifeforms.\nThus, Sunny was really having fun.\nAs Sunny was drifting deep into his thoughts, another notification from the System jolted Sunny awake.\n[The misfortunes of the previous three days were the test for all the Gods]\n[Those who were able to prosper their lifeforms and handle the misfortune will be the new True Gods from now on]\n[And those who don't meet the expected outcome will have their Godhood removed, memory erased, and reincarnate anywhere in their own universe]\nThe unease in the heart of every God increased manyfold.\nSuddenly, someone exclaimed in the God Chat.\n\"Look at the number of Gods in this Chat.\"\nSunny also looked at the member count and found 24,324 Gods missing.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nThese were mainly the Gods with no talent or those who were not able to manage their world properly.\nSunny did not feel any pity for them, because he knew three days were more than enough for them to at least have a single lifeform, but having zero lifeforms was truly their own fault.\nThe most interesting thing Sunny found in the notification from the System was that:\nfirstly, it said new Gods, which meant \"there were Gods in this universe previously.\" Sunny exclaimed with surprise and questioned the System about old Gods and where they are now, but found no answer.\n\"Thought so,\" Sunny said, as he knew that the System would not answer such a question.\nThe second thing Sunny noticed was that the notification this time was much more human-like.\nSunny stopped thinking about this, as he knew he wouldn't be able to guess this, and asking the System wouldn't help either.\nSunny felt a tinge of disappointment as he noticed no more notifications; he wanted at least some good news.\nHe also noticed that the cooldown for his talent Skill-Resonance was just 11 hours and 59 minutes left.\nHe hoped for it to end soon so he could copy the Magic Affinity talent and learn magic.\nJust as Sunny was about to start his business, another notification came from the System.\n[I forgot that from now on, no misfortune will occur as the test is over]\nSunny began to doubt the System for the first time in these three days. \"How can you forget such an important thing?\"\n\"It is a good thing, at least,\" Sunny said. For him, misfortunes were not that difficult to solve, but who knows when there is a chance of encountering a misfortune that is unsolvable.\nSunny's train of thoughts came to an end as another notification chimed in.\n[And the protective shield around the multiverse of God is removed]\n[Thus, the demons from the demon realm can now enter the world]\nAll the 10 billion Gods, out of which many just vanished, were now cursing the System.\nThe reason was the non-seriousness of the System. From novels, they assumed the System as something like an AI, which did all things timely.\nAfter all the cursing, they came face to face with the situation again and said, \"Demon invasion?\"\nSunny also found this System unreliable and cursed it a few times.\nBut he didn't know about where these demons would attack.\n\"Will they attack from spaceships, or will they come flying like Superman?\" Sunny joked and planned to think about the possible invasion routes and decided to perform trades at the same time.\nAfter 12 hours, the long-awaited cooldown for his talent ended.\n\"Finally,\" Sunny said, and just thought of the SS-Grade Magic Affinity from Nova. He felt a power coming from Veridia and entering his body.\n\"Status!\" Sunny exclaimed.\n[God Name : Cosmos\nTitle : God of Manifestation\nTalent : Skill-Resonance (SSS-Grade), Divine Magic Affinity (SS-Grade)\nFaith : 23 million...]\nSunny found the name of this talent intriguing and opened its details.\n[Talent Name : Divine Magic Affinity\nGrade : SS\nDescription : Provides the God with SS-Grade Magic Affinity, and also increases comprehension in any type of magic. The lifeforms of this God will have a high chance of gaining talents related to magic.]\n\"It is good, but why did the talent change so much?\" Sunny was delighted upon noticing the change of this talent that he copied.",

      "content": "Chapter 31 - Ch 31: 2nd DemiGod Umbra\nAs Sunny queried the System about the recent talent change, the answer came swiftly:\n[Talents of mortals, when they come into contact with a God, transform into Divine Talents, thus enhancing both the God and their Lifeforms.]\nSunny nodded, a wider grin spreading across his face as delight filled him. \"Doesn't that mean every talent I acquire in the future will also enhance itself?\" he mused aloud, already envisioning himself wielding powerful magic.\nUsing magic had always been Sunny's greatest wish, and now, it was within his grasp.\nInitially, Sunny intended to continue trading to fully exploit the 50% discount he had just obtained.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nHowever, the allure of magic quickly became his highest priority.\nHe began to practice the latest magical techniques developed within his own world.\nThis time, he finally noticed profound changes within his divine form.\nUnlike mortal mages who drew upon mana, Sunny found his precious faith points being consumed with each second he practiced. \"The expenses just keep on rising,\" Sunny sighed, a hint of weariness in his tone.\n\"Only my Title of God of Manifestation and the faith generated by my lifeforms are truly reliable sources.\" Despite this, Sunny currently possessed a formidable reserve of over 23 million faith points.\nDriven by his newfound ambition, he resumed his magical practice.\nAfter little more than an hour, Sunny felt a significant breakthrough, ascending to Grade D in magical proficiency.\n\"A D-Grade magician from absolutely nothing in just one hour! This speed is truly unheard of,\" Sunny marveled, fully cognizant of the immense difficulties associated with achieving breakthroughs in any profession.\nEven for the S-Grade elven leader, it had taken more than two arduous years to reach D-Grade.\nSunny's satisfaction, however, was fleeting.\nHis gaze drifted to Veridia, and his mood instantly plummeted.\nThorn, a seasoned C-level fighter, was locked in a desperate struggle against a B-level magician and was clearly at a severe disadvantage.\n\"What is happening down there?\" Sunny demanded inwardly, immediately activating his God's Eye on Thorn.\nThe entire 70 years of Thorn's life flashed before Sunny's eyes, a rapid cascade of memories.\nThough Thorn was indeed 70 years old, he miraculously retained the appearance of a vigorous 30-year-old man.\nThis was a testament to the power of breakthroughs, as the lifespan of lifeforms inherently increased with each transcendence of their limits.\nSunny swiftly began to ponder the best course of action.\nA deep-seated rebellion was currently afflicting the humans of Veridia.\nWhile Sunny desired to aid Thorn, ultimately, all humans were his devout believers, and he harbored no desire to be perceived as a biased God.\nHe resolved to intervene subtly, projecting his divine will onto Veridia, for he could not afford to waste precious time and allow Thorn, his first chosen one, to perish.\nThus, he quietly manifested a Divine Embryo, instantly molding it into an ethereal form: a shadow.\nIn terms of its immediate abilities, Sunny hadn't had sufficient time for elaborate conceptualization, so he chose Shadow Affinity and Magic Affinity as its foundational talents. As it was a creature of pure shadow, direct physical or magical damage was deemed unnecessary for its primary function. Consequently, there was no inherent need for robust defenses.\nDrawing inspiration from the vast Knowledge of Divine Buffs, Sunny conceived and endowed the shadow with a unique talent: it could directly increase a person's strength by a full level (up to the highest SS-Grade) simply by connecting to that individual.\nHe also added another crucial talent, allowing this Shadow to bestow two different Buffs upon a person simultaneously.\nWith these four synergistic talents, Sunny was now confident that this complex issue would be resolved with far greater ease. Sunny named this nascent shadow entity 'Umbra'.\nWith a single divine thought, Umbra sprang to life.\nResponding instantly to Sunny's silent command, Umbra shot like a silent arrow towards Thorn, who was still desperately fighting the B-Grade magician.\nIf not for Thorn's 70 years of battle-hardened experience, he would undoubtedly have already fallen. \"I can't die like this! I am the first chosen one of the God!\" Thorn roared, his voice hoarse with defiance, utterly reluctant to fall.\nHe desperately wished to live up to the unspoken expectations of his God.\nHe was, by now, a retired leader; his son, Anaske, had graciously relieved him of the burdens of a fighter or hunter.\nHowever, just a week prior, Anaske had embarked on a mission to confront a monstrous creature causing havoc at the site designated for the fourth city's construction.\nThis location was strategically chosen near the sea's shore, connecting to the central continent.\nThis new city was being created to become the hub for the development of fast ships, an endeavor vital for fulfilling God's command to reach the central continent as swiftly as possible.\nThis critical mission necessitated Anaske's absence from the capital to eliminate the A-Grade monster by the shore.\nAnaske had departed full of confidence, armed with his formidable SS-Grade sword. But back in the capital, one of the council leaders, a powerful B-Grade magician, had launched a treacherous rebellion, ruthlessly slaughtering many of Anaske's loyal followers.\nThorn, despite his lower grade, resolutely decided to fight until his last breath; his extensive experience and his SS-Grade spear were not something that could be easily bypassed.\nThus, the desperate fight had raged for half a day.\nSuddenly, Thorn felt an unseen presence loom over his entire body, and his strength abruptly surged drastically.\nThe chasm of potential was not something that could be easily broken; no human among all of Veridia had ever transcended their inherent limits in such a manner.\nYet, Thorn currently felt his strength increase, and he was aware of this profound phenomenon.\n\"A breakthrough? No,\" he immediately denied the notion, knowing full well that he was not even among the top C-Grade fighters.\nThus, a true breakthrough in battle would not be possible.\nThe only conceivable reason he could conjure in that desperate moment was \"God.\" A profound reverence swelled within him for their divine patron, reinvigorating his will to fight back against the traitor.\nCurrently, Umbra was linked to Thorn, and it swiftly utilized its specialized talent to upgrade Thorn's combat grade.\nUmbra also simultaneously cast powerful speed and strength boosts upon Thorn.\nEmpowered by these combined abilities, Thorn could now even contend with Anaske for a round or two.\nThorn, his newfound power surging, immediately defeated the traitorous magician and rushed to aid the remaining loyal followers of his son.\nAfter all the bloodshed, his eyes now welled with tears, for out of his 21 cherished children, 14 had tragically perished.",

      "content": "Chapter 32 - Ch 32: Glimpses of the Demon Realm\nAs Umbra disconnected from Thorn's body, Thorn felt his strength recede, a bitter smile touching his lips.\n\"The sting of power diclining was truly poisonous,\" he sighed,\nThough he quickly quelled the lingering unease in the hearts of his kingdom's citizens.\nThis recent revolt had come at a heavy cost, with approximately 500 humans perishing that day.\nSunny was determined to uncover the truth behind this.\nHe knew that every soul in Veridia was a devout believer in him, yet this group of traitors had acted in a manner akin to defying the divine.\nSunny couldn't fathom where they had found such courage.\nEmploying his God's Eye on the fallen traitors, he swiftly uncovered the reason: demonic manipulation.\n\"How did they even invade?\" Sunny questioned himself, realizing that demons had indeed instigated the rebellion.\nSunny surveyed every corner of Veridia but found no physical traces of demons.\nHe wasn't disheartened by this outcome; the simplicity of his search's result led him to a crucial conclusion.\n\"They're not in the physical plane,\" Sunny murmured. He then shifted his divine perception, no longer merely observing Veridia itself, but rather gazing into the intricate tapestry of energies that permeated it.\nCountless human, plant, and tree life energies shimmered before Sunny's eyes, each radiating distinct colors according to their nature.\nEven the very atmosphere, land, and water held faint traces of various elemental energies.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nSunny ignored these familiar sights, searching specifically for any ominous, foreign energy within Veridia.\nHe soon found it: a dark red, alien emanation that filled him with natural repulsion.\nThough incredibly weak and utterly incapable of harming him, its presence was undeniable.\nSunny followed the faint trail of this sinister energy until it abruptly vanished, reaching a dead end.\nThere was nothing and no one at either end of the trace, yet a chilling premonition seized Sunny.\nHe immediately urged Nova to return to Veridia. Without question or delay, Nova materialized within minutes.\n\"Tear open the space here,\" Sunny commanded Nova.\nAs the mighty dragon prepared to comply, Sunny quickly rephrased: \"Stop. Make this tear small, just enough for me to see through.\" Nova nodded, gracefully using a single claw tip to create a minuscule rip in the fabric of space.\nGiven Nova's enormous size, even a tear from the tip of his claw was sufficiently large for Sunny's purpose.\nSunny gazed through the spatial rift, his eyes widening in astonishment.\n\"What is this place?\" he exclaimed, instantly employing his God's Eye to scan the vast expanse beyond.\nHe saw countless demons, ranging in power from E-Grade to daunting S-Grade. Suddenly, an overwhelming sense of danger washed over him.\nSunny jolted back, immediately instructing Nova to repair the tear, which the dragon did without hesitation.\nSunny didn't let Nova return to the Realm of Advancement.\nInstead, he asked him to meticulously check Veridia for any anomalies like spatial tears or leakages of the ominous energy.\nSunny then teleported back to his private God space, sinking into his throne and letting out a shaky breath.\nHe was trembling. It was the first time since becoming a God that Sunny had truly felt fear—the primal fear of death.\nJust days prior, he'd been an ordinary human.\nEven the time spent in Veridia hadn't been long enough to truly acclimate him to such existential threats.\nWhile his life on the Blue Planet had been tough, it had never pushed him to the brink of dying.\nThis profound fear of dying only served to solidify Sunny's resolve to grow stronger.\nAs Sunny pondered immediate ways to enhance his success in this newly discovered dimension, a place where no life existed apart from demons, known as the Demon Realm, events were stirring elsewhere.\nIn the very heart of one particular Demon Realm, named the Realm of Discord, sat a figure of imposing build, akin to a human, yet radiating an undeniable demonic aura.\nHis skin was a deep, charcoal black, almost absorbing the ambient light, and two wickedly curved horns jutted from his brow, complementing his unsettling, completely black eyes that glowed with malevolent amusement.\nA subtle, predatory smile played on his lips. He leaned back on a crude throne of jagged obsidian, adorned with the skeletal remains of lesser beings.\nHe whispered, his voice deep, resonating with mockery and ancient malice, \"It has been ten thousand years already... are the Gods truly returning?\" His smug face openly yearned for some twisted fun.\n\"But this scent of faith is incredibly faint. If not for my inherent strength, I would not have been able to sense it at all,\" he mused, a frown momentarily creasing his brow as he pondered this peculiar trick of the Gods.\nHe was reminiscing about a scene from ten thousand years past, a time when he had personally orchestrated a profound discord between the Demons and the Gods.\nThat grand scheme had resulted in every God dying tragically and the vast majority of their lifeforms perishing.\nHe chuckled at the memory of his past mischief, then closed his obsidian eyes, sinking back into a deep slumber.\nHe had been in this state for the last ten millennia.\nAfter the catastrophic demise of the old Gods, he had simply grown bored and succumbed to a profound slumber to pass the interminable time.\nHis rest had only been broken by Sunny's brief intrusion into the Demon Realm and the faint, tantalizing scent of the new God's faith.\nBut he merely returned to his slumber, intending to give this new God ample time to grow, before he would emerge to begin his elaborate, cruel game.\nSunny, however, was blissfully unaware of this immense, lurking danger.\nHis mind was solely focused on one goal: using every power at his disposal to grow stronger.\nHe summoned Umbra, who currently possessed four talents.\nSunny decided to grant it one more talent for now, knowing precisely what was needed.\nHe provided Umbra with the talent: 'Cloning'.\nThis new talent allowed Umbra to maintain a clone of itself through the continuous consumption of mana.\nIf mana was consistently supplied, the clone could persist infinitely and operate without cessation.\nCrucially, these clones would work independently, meticulously following the commands of the main body.\nThis talent was incredibly useful for both Umbra and Sunny; Sunny planned to copy it himself once the cooldown for Skill-Resonance ended.\nWith this new ability, Umbra could connect to more people simultaneously, truly shining as a divine shadow and multiplying its effectiveness.",

      "content": "Chapter 33 - Ch 33 : loophole\nThe faith points that he spent on Nova were just around 2.5 million. And the single ability of cloning had a cost for Sunny of around 3 million.\nSunny couldn't pinpoint the reason behind this discrepancy, but decided to leave it for now as he knew this would need further experimenting.\nThough the cost was high, it was not to the extent where Sunny couldn't afford it. Sunny's faith reserves were around 17 million for now, as this recent intervention also had a cost for Sunny of 1 million faith points.\nSunny now had two things to do: first was trading, and second was training magic.\nHe knew that D-Level magic would not be enough to fight that terrifying entity.\nNot only did he himself need to become stronger, but his lifeforms also needed to be stronger.\nSunny was waiting for his faith reserves to increase to about 40 to 50 million, from which point his grand plan would start.\nThus, Sunny decided to trade as always, for the demand for his manifestation services was always high.\nBecause of the high demand, Sunny's mind now held huge chunks of valuable information.\nThis information was how to manifest various high-tech technologies, like VR headsets, nuclear weapons, guns, and various building designs.\nHe now held all of the valuable technology that the Blue Planet had.\nThere were many other technologies that he had manifested from just the theory provided by other Gods.\nMany Gods who had talents in technology development were using his manifestation services in their private God spaces to invent new technologies and then asking Sunny to manifest those technologies.\nApart from this, Sunny also had many other items from the magical world, like different kinds of herbs and magical weapons.\nBut no particular thing caught Sunny's eye in particular, as after seeing so many treasures, Sunny's expectations had also increased.\nAs Sunny was continuing to trade, this time he was also checking the situation of Veridia after every trade.\nThis took up some of his time, but he knew that for the safety of his world, this was a necessary action.\nAt around the 16th hour of the day, Sunny noticed a new message in the God Chat.\n\"Guys, there is no misfortune today, thus the System shop is also empty.\"\n\"Why haven't I thought about it?\"\n\"Yes, we needed to clear the misfortune for the system shop to have new items.\"\n\"Hehe, I am happy that the items didn't appear in the system shop as I was never able to collect that much faith points.\"\n\"I can at least buy one item daily; only bigshots like Cosmos, Strategist, and Kairos can buy all of the items in the system shop.\"\n\"You forgot about Cuzzi,\" one God typed.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n\"That information guy?\" Another God replied, as if mocking the person who introduced Cuzzi in the same light as the big three Gods of their Universe.\n\"I have insider information from their Heavenly Secret alliance, that their profit for a day is around 2 million faith points,\" the God played his card, which made the other God shut his face down.\nSunny felt amused; he could see that this God was trying to promote the Heavenly Secret alliance and boost their business of selling information.\nSunny also knew about this guy, as this guy was the first to offer services in the God Chat.\nHis business was simple: to help you in creating life in your world by providing you with the necessary information from the Knowledge of life book.\nMany Gods even asked for his services.\nSunny was also tempted but didn't take up the offer because he wanted to have the knowledge about life itself and not just the life for his planet type.\nHe wanted to learn about how to form life and how to enhance life in every location not just according to his planet, which was not provided by Cuzzi.\nAnd the other reason was he did not have faith in any God after the scam from Kitsune.\nSunny didn't dwell on it for more time and continued to trade.\nThis went on for the entire day, and no major accident occurred in Veridia.\nThe demons who entered Veridia were quickly slain by Nova.\nThe God Chat was in an uproar as the other Gods also noticed the anomaly of demons appearing in their worlds.\nThe fourth day was over, but no system notification came.\nSunny asked the system, but no answer came.\n\"It is becoming more and more unreliable,\" Sunny sighed as he said this.\nCurrently, Sunny's faith points were near 45 million, and he raised his hand and used millions upon millions of faith points to manifest two subspaces near the human and elven kingdoms.\nHe filled these subspaces with different kinds of herbs and many magical treasures.\nHe did not directly provide them with nukes.\nInstead, he filled the realm with just basic weapons like swords and spears.\nEverything created by him was already enhanced due to the use of faith points, which are the purest energy.\nWhy not give them these items directly?\nBecause the cost of doing so was very high, about 100 million faith points would not have been enough to do so.\nThus, he manifested this subspace and placed various tests there.\nThese tests were the things that decreased the cost of the divine intervention.\nSunny had noticed this a few times ago when he was manifesting an overpowered weapon for one of the clients.\nThe weapon was a hero's sword, a purely imaginary weapon with many abilities.\nBut the cost was something that the client couldn't pay.\nThus, Sunny introduced some restrictions on using that item, for example, that it can only be used by someone above the age of 60.\nThis reduced the manifesting cost of the item by a lot.\nA similar principle can be applied for divine intervention: if he were to intervene directly, the cost would be high, but with a slight restriction like many levels and tests, the cost becomes affordable.\nStill, this whole miracle cost Sunny around 40 million faith, leaving only 5 million faith remaining.\nSunny was not dejected upon the loss of these faith points; he knew if everything went well, the faith he would receive would be much more than what he had lost.\nThus, he sent a divine revelation to the high priests of both the human and elven empires.\nThe next second, both the human and elven kingdoms were in an uproar because of this revelation.",

      "content": "Chapter 34 - Ch 34: The Looming Shadow of Mortality\nA wave of excitement swept through both the human and elven kingdoms.\nThe discovery of the trial realm and its promised treasures had ignited a new sense of purpose among the people.\nFor years, their growing unity and strength had allowed them to roam the continent's wilderness with little danger, leaving them without a worthy challenge.\nNow, they were eager to face the trials set by their creator, hoping to prove their worth and live up to his divine expectations.\nThe humans, in particular, were in desperate need of this opportunity.\nThe revolt that had occurred years ago, in planetary time, still haunted them.\nWith a population of only one hundred thousand, mostly civilians, the loss of 500 warriors had dealt a crippling blow to their kingdom's strength.\nThe treasures within the new realm offered a chance not just for recovery, but for revitalization.\nThey saw this as a miracle and a chance to truly honor their God.\nWhile all this unfolded in Veridia, Sunny was still relentlessly trading, a tireless figure in the cosmic marketplace.\nHe knew that for now, Nova was enough to handle the demonic incursions, which were only about a dozen per month in planetary time.\nHowever, Nova's recent reports had been a cause for growing concern.\nThe number of attacking demons was steadily increasing, and if the pace continued, the dragon's strength would eventually be insufficient to stop them, especially as the demons could appear at many locations at once.\nSunny felt the full weight of this responsibility on his shoulders and exhaled deeply.\nHe was trying to squeeze every last bit of faith he could from his endeavors, for he now knew that faith was the very essence of a God, the sole distinction between a mortal and the divine.\nHe briefly considered creating a religious text for his high priests but decided to postpone it.\nHe wanted to write a book that was meticulously crafted, devoid of any potential contradictions or words that could come back to haunt him later.\nSlowly, the fifth and a half day of Sunny's Godhood came to an end.\nHis faith reserves had swelled far beyond his wildest dreams, reaching an astounding 62 million faith points.\nThe majority of this influx hadn't come from trading, but from his lifeforms.\nThe burst of emotion and prayer from any human or elf who overcame a difficult trial or discovered a rare treasure created an enormous surge of faith.\nSunny realized he could now recover all his faith and even start turning a profit within a few hours.\nAs he checked the God Chat, he was about to return to his trades when a message caught his eye.\n\"Guys, look at the number of Gods,\" one God typed.\nMost Gods had been too busy fending off demons to notice, but the message quickly drew their attention.\n\"Why are there 406 less Gods than yesterday?\" another chimed in.\n\"Is it the System again?\"Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\n\"But it clearly said we are the new true Gods now. Why would it kill so many of us?\"\n\"And the System hasn't answered or sent a notification since the last one.\"\nThe conversation went on for a long time before the Gods collectively reached a chilling conclusion:\n\"The demons.\"\nA palpable silence fell over the chat. The Gods felt the same bone-deep fear that Sunny had experienced when he glimpsed into the Demon Realm.\n\"So we can also die?\" one God asked, his fear a tangible thing.\n\"I think so,\" the Strategist disclosed, dropping a bombshell on the chat. \"One who vanished was from my alliance, and in last message he complained about demons attacking his world.\"\nThe disappearance of the new Gods, combined with the whispers of the \"old Gods,\" solidified the terrifying belief that even Gods could die.\nSunny felt no fear at this revelation. He was already aware of the danger.\nHe paid little attention to the other Gods scrambling for a way to strengthen themselves and their lifeforms.\nHe was more focused on the big players like Kairos and the Strategist, but they rarely spoke in the God Chat, preferring to remain active only in their private alliance groups.\nSunny had traded with Kairos for a time, but the transactions eventually stopped.\nHe knew Kairos had likely found a way to use his own alliance members to ask for Sunny's services, disguising their trades to keep their identities and plans hidden.\nSunny decided to leave it be for now and focus on Veridia.\nThe strength of both the human and elven races had grown tremendously.\nWhile their leaders' grades remained at A, the sheer volume of treasures and the experience gained from the trials had increased the overall strength of their kingdoms many times over.\nWith his faith reserves nearing his target, Sunny began to prepare for his next course of action.\nHis mind was buzzing with ideas for new divine creations: a new demigod with talents from the novels, a Heavenly Library, and even the concepts of Heaven and Hell.\nBut all of these required immense capital, and his current reserves were only enough for a small task. Still, Sunny was reluctant to use it just yet. He waited.\nFueled by their newfound strength, both races were eager to travel to the central continent, the next logical step in their evolution.\nThey had already developed the technologies and magical arrays for such a journey, but they were running into a major resource bottleneck.\nThe elves needed a huge amount of mana stones for their arrays, and the humans required a steady supply of resources for a long sea voyage that could take half a year or more.\nThe elves had found a few mana stone mines, but the amount was far from enough.\nThey had begun to meticulously check every part of their continent for more.\nThe only mana stone mines in all of Veridia were the ones Sunny had created just days before, and their output was far from sufficient.\nWhile a few new mines were slowly beginning to form as a natural effect of the powerful SS-Grade mana veins, they were still in the earliest stages of development, years away from yielding any significant resources.\nSunny saw their struggle and, with a subtle divine touch, directly manifested a few new mines in the elven continent.",

      "content": "Chapter 35 - Ch 35 : Kairos's boldness\nFor the humans, collecting the necessary resources was a far simpler task.\nThey primarily needed food rations, emergency wood, and weapons.\nThese were not items they lacked, and they could be prepared in a matter of months—a stark contrast to the magical mana stones the elves required.\n\"It's all good, for now,\" Sunny said with a sigh of satisfaction, glancing at the God Chat.\nHe saw many Gods boasting about their discoveries in the Realm of Advancement, and a mischievous grin spread across his face.\n\"Just you all wait, I'm also joining in the fun,\" he chuckled to himself, knowing that in a few short months, his lifeforms would finally be ready to join the fray.\nHe began to ponder new ways to earn faith points, and a brilliant, if not slightly devious, idea struck him.\nA low, wicked laugh escaped his lips as a truly mischievous plan began to form in his mind.\nHe immediately manifested two Divine Embryos, placing them before him in his private space.\nHe shaped one embryo into the form of a human, with a sinewy, powerful physique. From its forehead stemmed two small, jagged horns, and even while unconscious, a distinct, mischievous grin was etched onto its face.\nSunny then manifested a simple set of clothes to cover the human's body.\nHe had no particular desire to observe a naked man.\nHis gaze then shifted to the second embryo, which he molded into the shape of a majestic, serpentine dragon.\nThe creature was without wings, its body covered in azure and blue scales that shimmered like a thousand jewels.\nAny person from his original world, the Blue Planet, would have immediately recognized this as a deity and bowed in reverence, exclaiming, \"Lord Shenlong.\"\nSunny looked upon this being, the fabled god of wishes and prayers from his home, and couldn't help but grin.\nHe couldn't have imagined that one day he would be creating a deity from a world that was now just a distant memory.\nHe named both of them as they began to stir with the spark of life.\nMeanwhile, in a world filled with lush, vibrant life, where elemental vortexes and different weather conditions gave rise to unique lifeforms, a God stood alone.\nThis was Kairos, the one God who had previously had a conflict of interest with Sunny.\nHe was currently observing a ceremony being held by his devoted elemental followers.\nThese elemental spirits prayed to Kairos wholeheartedly, for it was only he who had provided them with food and resources when all others had failed them.\nThey had agreed to worship him as their God and follow his every command.\nThe ceremony they were now conducting was one that every elemental spirit was well aware of—the \"Divine Summoning.\"\nThis ritual was used to call upon the demigod leader of the elemental spirits to help those facing immediate mortal danger.\nKairos had learned about this ritual while helping the spirits with their food supplies.\nHe desired this demigod as his own follower and had decided to use the elemental spirits to summon him.\nSlowly, a majestic entity shimmered into existence from within the glowing runes.\nThe demigod, with a trident in one hand and a crown on his head, exuded a pressure so immense that every spirit in the vicinity bowed low.\nAs Kairos stepped forward and made his divine presence known, a wave of pressure even greater than the demigod's descended upon the spirits.\nIt was a pressure that no mortal, and not even a demigod, could bear.\nThe demigod leader plummeted to the ground, utterly unable to stand.\n\"Are you willing to serve me?\" Kairos asked, his gaze so cold it made the demigod, Aeron, shiver.\nAeron immediately understood that \"no\" was not an option.\nHe nodded his head without hesitation.\nThe pressure subsided instantly, and Aeron heaved a sigh of relief.\nDespite living for over a million years, he had been truly, utterly terrified of losing his life.\nKairos simply grinned and, in a voice only Aeron could hear, gave him his first, inhumane task.\nThe demigod, though he shuddered at the command, did not resist.\nOn the other side of the universe, in a planet teeming with fire spirits, where the strongest reached the pinnacle of B-Grade, a curious ripple went through the ranks.\nEvery spirit flickered for a second, a disturbance that caught the eye of Vulcan, the God of this world.\nHe asked the leader of his fire spirits what had happened, and the reply made him furrow his brows.\nThe fire spirits explained that their leader, Aeron, had been summoned by other spirits and had not returned to the elemental realm.\nIt wasn't just these spirits; all the spirits across the entire universe sensed the disappearance of their leader.\nThey felt a profound sense of helplessness, knowing there was nothing they could do.\nA spirit born in the elemental world who did not return could only mean one of two things:\neither they had died, or they had been contracted by someone.\nAnd indeed, Kairos had made a contract with Aeron.\nEvery spirit now knew that a bloody battle would soon commence in the elemental world for the position of leader.\nThey could not participate, however, as they were not born of that realm; they could only feel the faint presence of a world they yearned to enter.\nA heated discussion was raging in the God Chat.\nMost of the Gods who had elemental spirits in their worlds related the news to the others.\nEvery God began brainstorming who could have done such a thing, and why they weren't the one to have contracted this powerful demigod.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nKairos, for all his boastful nature, kept silent this time, knowing such a boast could easily backfire.\nIn his private God space, he called for the beautiful elf standing behind him.\nShe bowed her head, her gaze filled with loving adoration for Kairos.\nHe walked toward her, placing his hands on her waist, and said, \"Rina, your task is to keep a close watch on Aeron. If he does anything stupid, notify me immediately.\"\nThe elf, Rina, blushed and nodded, her eyes filled with determination.\nMeanwhile, Sunny was blissfully oblivious to all of this, as he was no longer looking at the God Chat.\nHe looked at the human demigod and said, \"You will be called Loki, the Master of Mischiefs.\"\nThe demigod, whose face had unconsciously shown signs of mischief, now, upon the awakening of his consciousness, radiated that quality with even greater intensity.\nSunny didn't disturb him, allowing him to fully awaken.\nHe then turned to the dragon and said, \"And you will be called Shenlong, the Demigod of Wishes and Prayers.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 36 - Ch 36 : Opposite direction\nAs the two DemiGods hummed with nascent energy, Sunny focused his will on crafting their talents.\nHe had some brilliant ideas, but he knew that applying them without proper restrictions would make the cost astronomical.\nHe needed their abilities to be powerful yet affordable.\nFor Loki, the demigod of mischief, Sunny meticulously crafted a suite of five talents, each designed for a specific purpose:\n* Master of Deception: Loki can weave powerful illusions, from simple misdirections to creating entire phantom landscapes.\nThe potency of these illusions is so high that only gods or demigods with exceptional perception can discern what's real.\nIn the Realm of Advancement, where gods can only perceive through the eyes of their mortals, discovering one of Loki's illusions would be nearly impossible.\n* Discord's Embrace: This talent allows Loki to amplify existing conflicts, turning minor disagreements into full-blown wars.\nIt is the perfect tool for creating chaos and feeding on the resulting turmoil.\n* Shapeshifter: Loki can shift his form into any inanimate object or living organism he has seen, making him a master of infiltration and disguise.\n* Magic Affinity: This foundational talent gives Loki a natural proficiency with all forms of magic, allowing him to quickly learn and master new spells.\n* Master of Stealing: A talent that gives Loki the ability to steal nearly anything—be it skills, talents, or even physical items.\nThe cost of this talent was initially in the billions of faith points, so Sunny added a crucial restriction: any stolen talent or skill would only be temporary.\nThese five talents cost Sunny a total of 10 million faith points.\nFor Shenlong, the demigod of wishes and prayers, Sunny chose to bestow only two talents.\nThis wasn't out of stinginess; these two abilities were so potent that they cost a staggering 20 million faith points.The most update n0vels are published on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\n* Hope Collector: Shenlong can absorb the collective hopes and prayers of people, collecting this divine energy within his body.\nHe can also store it in a hidden reservoir on Veridia or even in the private God space.\nThis talent provides a crucial failsafe: should Shenlong be destroyed, he can resurrect using this stored hope reserve.\n* Miracle Master: This talent allows Shenlong to perform miracles by fulfilling the wishes of his believers, fueled by their hope.\nHe can also draw from his hope reserve to perform larger miracles when necessary.\nThese two talents effectively made Shenlong immortal, as he could never truly die.\nAfter spending a combined 30 million faith points on his new demigods, Sunny was left with 35 million faith points.\nHe knew this was only a small fraction of what he would need for his other plans.\nWith a single mental command, both Loki and Shenlong stirred to life, bowing their heads in reverence to their creator.\nShenlong floated majestically in the air without wings, a result of Sunny's pure divine intent during creating Shenlong.\nIf Cosmos thinks it can fly it will surely fly.\nSunny gave them their first tasks, and they both nodded as if these were the very reasons for their existence.\nAs a demonstration, Loki transformed into a perfect replica of Shenlong, causing the dragon's eyes to widen in surprise.\nSunny, however, quickly sent Loki a mental command: \"Do not use Shenlong's form for your mischief. It would tarnish his reputation\"\nLoki's mischievous grin remained as he looked at Veridia and found a monster with highest flying speed transformed into that monster and darted toward the portal leading to the Realm of Advancement.\nHis task was simple yet vital: sow discord among the lifeforms of other gods and steal any valuable items he could find.\nSunny had already created and filled a reservoir for Shenlong with manifested hope, a reserve that would ensure the demigod's immortality.\nShenlong's task was the polar opposite of Loki's: to listen to the problems of other lifeforms and solve them, thereby increasing his own reputation.\nSunny made it a point to specifically instruct Shenlong not to use his name, Cosmos.\nLoki and Shenlong went in opposite directions, one destined to cause chaos and the other to quell it.\nSunny wasn't concerned for their safety. Nova had assured him that while there were many demons and treasures in the realm, few threats could pose a real danger to demigods.\nIn fact, Nova had already brought back many treasures, but Sunny instructed him to give them to any worthy lifeforms in Veridia he found.\nCurrently, Nova and Umbra were busy patrolling the space around Veridia, easily handling the small-scale demonic invasions that occurred.\nThe situation in Veridia was also progressing.\nHumans had collected their supplies and begun their journey toward the central continent, while the elves were still busy filling their mana stone reserves.\nSunny, with some free time on his hands, decided to return to his business to fill his faith reserves and use his time effectively.\nIn the Realm of Advancement, the lifeforms of various gods had already begun their struggles against demons and were collecting a wide array of treasures, which significantly increased their strength.\nUnseen by them, Aeron walked through the realm.\nUsing his surveying skill to scan a million-kilometer radius, he found three camps belonging to the lifeforms of different gods.\nHe ran toward one of them and, without hesitation, killed all the lifeforms, plundering their treasures.\nHis orders from Kairos were clear: plunder and kill all other lifeforms in the realm. Aeron, a demigod who had lived for millions of years, didn't want to die, and he knew that the elf, Rina, who was still following him, would report his defiance to Kairos.\nHe could have easily killed her if not for his master's command to not harm her.\nHe sighed at his fate, hoping to find a way out of his servitude.\nAeron made his way to camp after camp, killing all in his path and taking their treasures for Kairos.\nThe other gods who saw their lifeforms being slaughtered were furious, but there was little they could do in this realm.\nThey could send their own demigods to fight, but many didn't have one, and those who did were not yet ready to engage in a full-scale conflict.",

      "content": "Chapter 37 - Ch 37: A Farewell to the System\nAfter watching Loki and Shenlong disappear into the portal, Sunny turned his attention to the God Chat.\nThe moment he opened it, a wave of chaos assaulted his senses. The messages scrolled by in a blur, filled with expressions of grief, outrage, and despair.\nGods were openly weeping about the devastating losses their lifeforms had suffered.\nInitially, Sunny assumed the attacks were from the demons.\nBut as he focused his divine sight and sifted through the panicked messages, a single, terrifying name emerged as the true culprit: Aeron, the demigod leader of the elemental spirits.\nThe posts described a campaign of brutal plunder and massacre, where entire camps of mortal followers were wiped out for their treasures.\nSunny's mind raced, analyzing the threat. He knew that these demigods had existed for countless millennia and were likely hardened by an unimaginable number of battles.\nHe couldn't help but assume that unless a god personally intervened, even his own demigods, with their powerful but new talents, would be no match for a being as ancient and formidable as Aeron.\nHe was overestimating his foe, of course. While Aeron was old and powerful, he lacked the cunning and versatility that Sunny had imbued in his creations.\nLoki's Deception alone, combined with his ability to steal Aeron's skills for even a few minutes, would be enough to defeat the seasoned demigod.\nBut ignorant of Aeron's current location and exact powers, Sunny sent a mental warning to both Shenlong and Loki, cautioning them to be wary of a powerful, hostile demigod.\nWith his demigods on their tasks, Sunny's focus shifted to the next phase of his master plan: the creation of a Heavenly Library.\nA project of this magnitude, he estimated, would require between 70 to 100 million faith points.\nHis current reserves were nowhere near that, so he resumed trading, intent on accumulating the vast sum.\nAs he worked, the sixth day of his godhood came to an end.\nThe universe seemed to hold its breath, and then, a familiar system notification appeared.\n[Congratulations to all the Gods for completing the 6th day as Gods.]\nA chorus of relief and celebration filled the God Chat.\nThe new gods, still shaken by the disappearances, were overjoyed to have survived another day.\nBut their celebration was short-lived. The next line of the notification landed like a cold, hard blow:\n[Today, the God Chat will merge with servers from other universes, and all Gods can have one final day of communication.]\nThe joy on the chat instantly soured into a collective dread. The words that followed confirmed their fears and sent the chat into a complete frenzy.\n[At the end of the next day, the System will cease to exist.]\nThe impact of this announcement was catastrophic.\nThe God Chat was the only place for these Gods to vent their worries, share information, and feel a sense of community in the cold, vastness of the cosmos.\nThe loss of the trading platform was even more dire.\nThis marketplace was their only means of acquiring the items and knowledge needed to survive.\nThe worst effect of this news was, without a doubt, on Sunny.\nHe had handled over 90% of all transactions, and the platform's disappearance meant he would lose his primary source of income.\nA profound sense of dejection washed over him.\nHe was losing his business, and more importantly, he was losing his connection to the allies he had just begun to make.\nHe desperately wanted to find a solution, but his mind felt a blank.\nIn the chat, the gods were in a state of mass panic.\nMany began to discuss impossible solutions.\nSome suggested building physical wires and towers, failing to grasp the incomprehensible distances of the universe.\nBut one message caught Sunny's attention: an idea to create a tower with the capacity to transmit a signal across the entire universe.\nSunny's mind latched onto this.\nHe knew it was possible. His SS-Grade Navigator Orb could map the whole multiverse, so an SS-Grade signal tower should be able to cover it.\nBy manifesting phones for the other gods, he could solve the communication problem.\nBut communication wasn't his main concern, Trading was.\nSunny desperately brainstormed, trying to find an idea that could solve both issues.\nThe notification had also provided a grim statistic: the number of gods in all universes had plummeted to 6 billion from an initial 10 billion.\nOver 40% of the population had been lost to either the system or demons.\nIn Sunny's home universe, however, only 30,000 gods had vanished—a loss of just 10%.\nHe knew this was largely due to his own business, which had provided many of the gods with the necessary items to increase their chances of survival.\nNow, with the system gone, that lifeline would be severed.\nSunny felt a deep sense of peril. His current faith points were about 80 million, which was a large sum, but nowhere near enough for the monumental tasks ahead.\nJust then, a sensation he knew well—the rush of faith—hit him, but with a force far greater than before.\nA staggering 5 million faith points flooded into his reserves.\nSunny, mystified, tried to locate the source. He looked through the eyes of his humans and elves but found no special offerings.\nHe then shifted his sight to Shenlong.\nThrough Shenlong's eyes, Sunny saw the answer: an entire pack of fifty thousand werewolves were kneeling before the demigod, offering their heartfelt gratitude and worship.\nSunny had experienced this before, where small influxes of faith would come from other races Shenlong had helped, but the amount was never more than 2 million.\nThis immense influx gave Sunny a spark of an idea.\nHe mentally asked Nova, his most powerful lifeform, about the range of his space transmission ability.\nThe answer he received was a bolt of lightning to his brain.\n\"If enough mana is supplied,\" Nova's mental voice echoed, \"the distance is not of much matter.\"\nA new flame of hope ignited within Sunny. With enough mana, he could continue his trading.\nThe signal towers and phones could solve the communication issue.\nHis plan was finally taking shape.\nBut when he asked Nova for the amount of mana required to teleport something as large as an item across the vastness of the universe, the response was a devastating blow.\nNova's voice, usually calm and composed, was now serious and strained. \"Master, the price for such a transmission would be enormous. Even if every drop of mana from Veridia were taken, it would not be enough to transmit something across a single galaxy.\"The source of this content ɪs NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nDejected and with his hope extinguished, Sunny's only remaining recourse was to mark the location of his allies.\nHe gave his Navigator Orb to Zir. He instructed Zir to mark his position in the orb, then, in the final day of the System's existence, to trade with the other gods in his alliance and have them mark their own positions.\nAt least he would have the locations of his friends, even if he couldn't find a solution to this profound misfortune.",

      "content": "Chapter 38 - Ch 38: Death of Loki\nAs the alliance members of Sunny frantically marked their locations for the final time, one member sent Sunny a private message. Sunny opened it to find a desperate plea:\n\"Boss, after the server merge, I found my wife and need to mark her location. Can you please help me?\" Sunny, though preoccupied, immediately relayed the request to Zir, asking him to mark her position. He was currently consumed with planning his next moves, knowing that after today, the System would cease to exist.\nSuddenly, a mental message from Loki shot through the divine connection. \"Master, I have found Aeron.\"\nSunny gasped, a cold shiver running down his spine.\nThe demigod was dangerously close to the portal to his world.\nIf Loki hadn't been there, Aeron would have likely found and massacred every single human and elf from Veridia currently in the Realm of Advancement.\nSunny knew the realm's sheer scale; it was large enough to contain the lifeforms of billions of gods, yet only a lucky few ever crossed paths.\nThe proximity was a terrifying coincidence.\nHowever, Sunny did not panic. He calmly commanded Loki to divert Aeron's attention and lead him away from the camp of his lifeforms.\nLoki, ever the trickster, transformed from a small bird into his true form right before Aeron's eyes.\nAeron, who had lived for millions of years, was no amateur; he was keenly aware of transformation magic.\nBut before he could react, his surroundings changed entirely.\nHe was no longer in the Realm of Advancement, but in a familiar land that felt as if he had always been there.\nThis was a flawless illusion created by Loki: the perfect recreation of the elemental realm, where Aeron sat upon a throne, commanding his loyal followers.\nA moment later, Sunny received another mental message from Loki. \"Master, the task is completed.\"\nSunny was momentarily dumbfounded by the demigod's efficiency.\nHe had expected Loki to be frantically fleeing a pursuing Aeron.\nHe immediately asked Loki to clarify the situation.\n\"He is in my illusion (genzutsu >.<),\" Loki's voice echoed in Sunny's mind, \"and he will not be able to come out until I personally dispel it. He will be completely distracted until then.\"\nSunny was shocked. Loki had misunderstood his command for diversion, but in doing so, had delivered a far greater result.\nIf Aeron could be contained, Sunny would not let the opportunity slip away.\nHe decided to look through Loki's eyes and record a video of the captured demigod.\nThe God Chat was currently in a frenzy, and Sunny knew they needed a scapegoat. Aeron was the perfect target.\nHe quickly typed a message:\n\"Dear Gods, as you all know there has been a massacre and plundering in the Realm of Advancement. I have caught the culprit. If you want to see the video, it is available in the trading space for 1 faith point.\"\nThe chat erupted. Gods who had lost their lifeforms to Aeron immediately bought the video.\nThose who hadn't waited anxiously for news from those who had.\nUpon witnessing the video of the powerful demigod, Aeron, bound and blissfully unaware within Loki's illusion, two thoughts took hold of everyone's minds.\nThe first was a burning desire for revenge on Aeron.\nThe second was a dawning realization of the extent of God Cosmos's strength.\nThey knew that they could also catch Aeron, but only outside the Realm of Advancement.\nInside, their direct involvement was impossible, making a demigod's strength invaluable.\nUnbeknownst to Sunny and Loki, one other being was also a witness.\nA sneaky elf named Rina had been observing them from the shadows.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nShe shuddered, her body trembling with a mixture of fear and awe.\nShe immediately understood that if Aeron could be caught so easily, she was no match for this demigod.\nShe reported everything to Kairos and awaited retreat order form Kairos, but it never came, instead she got a much more dangerous command from Kairos.\nThe command was cold and devoid of feeling: \"Try to sneak behind this demigod and assassinate him.\"\nKairos's reasoning was simple. He knew the immense amount of faith required to create such a powerful illusion.\nHe had also considered a ability of similar strength for Rina but had been reluctant to pay the exorbitant price.\nHe assumed this new demigod could only possess one such high-caliber talent.\nIt was a tragic miscalculation on Kairos's part, as he was not watching the God Chat and thus was unaware it was God Cosmos's Demigod.\nIf he had known about this, his command would have been an immediate retreat.\nBut it was too late. Rina could not disobey.\nHer ability, Master of Assassination, hid her presence perfectly as she waited for an opportune moment.\nShe found Loki without his guard up and attacked, managing to pierce his heart in a single, fatal blow.\nShe felt a surge of triumph as she watched Loki vomit blood and slump to the ground, his body going limp.\nShe didn't let her guard down, stabbing him multiple times to ensure he was dead.\nAs his pulse faded, she sent a message to Kairos.\nShe then noticed that the illusion containing Aeron was still active.\nShe assumed it was a form of magic that persisted for a set period, even if the caster died.\nKairos commanded her to retreat and return to his God space.\nShe turned and fled at top speed, fearful of the inevitable revenge from this demigod's creator.\nMeanwhile, Sunny was counting his newfound riches.\nHe had made a fortune—nearly 700 million faith points from over 700 million transactions.\nThis was possible because 1 faith point was a negligible sum for most gods, and the System's privacy features prevented anyone else from profiting from publishing such a video.\nIf given more time this video can directly give Sunny more than 1 billion faith.\nSunny was satisfied, thinking that this amount of faith could sustain him for a month or so, even without further trading.\nIf he can make Aerion do one or two stunts or harm him, that video will even fetch more.\nBut the humanity inside him stopped Sunny from doing so, he again tried to think of a way to trade even without system.",

      "content": "Chapter 39 - Ch 39: Newfound Ideas\n\"Master, there was an elf following this Aeron. I've captured her as well, and she is also currently trapped in an illusion,\" Loki reported.\nThe elf was now a confused prisoner, running in circles within an illusory forest of the Realm of Advancement, completely unaware of her predicament.\n\"Is she a lifeform of some God?\" Sunny asked, a hint of curiosity in his voice. Loki's cheerful reply, however, made Sunny feel a sense of helpless dread over the mischievous fellow he had created.\n\"She is a demigod, and a beautiful one at that,\" Loki replied with a hint of a wicked grin. \"I can surely use her body to seduce and invoke more infighting between other lifeforms.\"\n\"What do you mean by using her body?\" Sunny asked, a new worry taking hold. \"We are good people here, we don't 'use' anyone's body. Just capture her alive and interrogate her.\"\n\"I was just talking about my Shapeshifter ability,\" Loki tried to clarify, but before he could finish, the divine connection between them was cut off.\nSunny's current faith points had now soared past 900 million, the majority of which had come from the video of Aeron.\nMany gods in the chat, taken by Aerion's powerful elemental body, were now discussing it with envious eyes.\nOne god even messaged Sunny directly, offering 200 million faith points for Aerion. Sunny was amused and momentarily tempted, as that amount could fund the creation of several more demigods.\nAll the other gods were amazed and envious of the god's wealth, but Sunny didn't reply. His status had changed.\nHe was no longer just the wealthiest god; after catching Aeron, he was also being hailed as the strongest.\nMany felt dissatisfied by this new order but were wise enough not to question Sunny's strength.\nSunny, however, didn't pay attention to the chat.\nHe quietly began to formulate designs for his SS-Grade signal towers.\nHe had collected design schematics from other gods, but he was still searching for a better, more complete plan.\nJust then, he felt another influx of faith points.\nIt wasn't an immediate spike, but a continuous, slowly increasing stream.\nSunny sensed its origin, a source that was not just in his universe but also from other, distant universes.\nHe couldn't help but ponder its meaning. Could another god have been so amazed by his power that they chose to worship him? He quickly dismissed the thought.\nHe knew that many of his alliance members had begun to call him \"Great God Cosmos\" and bowed to him, but their respect never translated into a single faith point.\nHe knew it was impossible for a god to receive faith from another god.\nAfter a long moment of contemplation, the answer surfaced in his mind. \"Shenlong.\"\nSunny knew that Shenlong had been tasked with helping lifeforms in the Realm of Advancement.\nWhat he had not considered was that those who returned to their own worlds still prayed for Shenlong's blessings.\nTheir prayers of hope were being offered to Shenlong, and their faith was being channeled to Sunny.\nThis was indirectly creating a new legion of followers for him.\nSuddenly, a realization hit Sunny with the force of a supernova: \"How can faith travel between these universes so effortlessly?\"\nHe didn't know it yet, but this single thought—this new understanding of the very fabric of his universe—would change everything. But that was a story for later.\nCurrently, Sunny was running through countless theories, even asking Nova for her advice.\nBut the results were not promising. He didn't lose hope and continued to search for a solution.\nMeanwhile, in the Realm of Advancement, both Aeron and Rina were bound, their abilities sealed by an SS-Grade Heavenly Seal Bar—an item a god had once traded with Sunny, which he had upgraded to its current, demigod-imprisoning strength.\nLoki grinned mischievously at his two prisoners and began his interrogation.\nHe first asked for their names, but both remained silent. Loki was no fool.\nHe asked for the SS-Grade sword in the hand of a nearby human leader, Anaske, and with a swift movement, stabbed Aeron in the leg.\nAeron's screams of agony echoed through the forest.\nAll the humans and elves who witnessed the scene shuddered.\nThey had seen torture before, but seeing a powerful demigod being subjected to it made their minds go blank.\n\"Master is merciful,\" Loki said, his face hardening. \"But that doesn't mean I am.\"\nThe next second, his face broke into a polite smile. \"Allow me to heal you, brother Aeron.\"\nLoki then applied a medicinal herb that was known for being the most effective healer but also the most painful.\nAfter a moment, he laughed mischievously. \"Now, can you both tell me your names?\"\nAeron and Rina felt their bodies go numb. Rina couldn't speak, her connection with Kairos preventing her from revealing anything.\nBut Aeron, who feared torture more than anything, broke. \"My name is Aeron, and she is Rina...\"\nThis was how the interrogation successfully began.\nYet, even as Loki pressed them, the name of Kairos was not revealed.\nAeron didn't know his master's name, and Rina, ever loyal, refused to speak no matter what Loki did.\nSunny knew that demigods personally created by a god were unfailingly loyal.\nHe ordered Loki to not bother with Rina and to do as he saw fit.\nSunny didn't want to manage his demigods; he had created them to ease his burdens, not to increase them.\nAs his mischievous demigod handled the prisoners, Sunny's primary focus returned to how he would handle the disappearance of the System.\nSuddenly, he understood the reason for the instantaneous transmission of faith.\n\"Connection.\"\nSunny's mind raced, a new understanding of the universe clicking into place. He immediately tested his theory by observing the Elves' teleportation arrays.\nHe saw the problem firsthand: when the elves had to teleport their lifeforms to the Central Continent, which did not have a corresponding array, the cost in mana stones was astronomical.\nThe single array on their end had to bear the entire burden of the teleportation.\nHowever, Sunny realized that if both the sending and receiving locations had a functioning array, the cost of the teleportation would be minuscule—only a tenth of the original price.\nThis massive difference was all thanks to the Connection that existed between the two arrays.\nIn a moment of profound clarity, Sunny understood the truth behind his faith.\nThe same principle applied to the spiritual fabric of the universe.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nFaith, much like mana, traveled effortlessly through space, a divine signal sent from a lifeform to its god.\nThe connection was a bridge, and as long as that bridge existed, the flow of faith was instant and efficient.\nThis was why the werewolves' prayers, though sent from a distant universe, were able to reach him without any cost—their connection to Shenlong, and Shenlong's connection to Sunny, formed an unbroken circuit.",

      "content": "Chapter 40 - Ch 40: Theia, The First System\n\"The problem lies in the connection,\" Sunny muttered to himself, pacing within his God space.\nHe was exploring every conceivable solution to the System's impending demise.\nHis mind first went to divine contracts, but he quickly dismissed the idea.\nOther gods would never agree; they would never reveal their location, their strength, or allow another to exert control over their will.\nHe then considered creating billions of demigods—ants or other insignificant lifeforms—to act as links.\nBut the cost was staggering: 6 billion gods multiplied by the 5,000 faith points required for each divine embryo. The total was astronomical, and the idea was quickly dropped.\nThen, a sudden moment of epiphany struck him.\nHe immediately manifested a divine embryo, but this time, he did not give it a form.\nInstead, it coalesced into a new type of energy—a shimmering, light-blue essence that flowed and pulsed in the void before him.\nSunny bestowed upon this new being four unique talents:\n* Omni-Cognition: A talent straight out of science fiction.\nThis ability, costing Sunny a steep 300 million faith points, granted the demigod unparalleled computing power.\nIt could multitask, run complex simulations, and learn any subject in an instant.\n* Replication: A talent that, as its name suggested, allowed the demigod to replicate itself.\nSunny added a critical restriction: each replication would require a small amount of faith points.\nThis lowered the cost to a manageable 30 million faith points—a price Shenlong could earn in just a few hours.\n* Link: This talent, which cost only 70,000 faith points, gave the energy the ability to create a divine link with any god.\nCrucially, Sunny was the sole administrator of this link.\nHe was the only one who could use the Replication talent of the energy and allow it to link with others.\nAny new particles replicated would always be linked back to him.\nThis prevented other gods from replicating the system for their own followers and ensured Sunny's monopoly.\n* Thought Sharing: This final talent gave every particle of the energy the ability to share thoughts with all others.\nThe initial price was an astronomical 700 million faith points due to its ability to negate distance with minimal energy.\nSunny placed a restriction on it as well: every single thought would require a small amount of faith to transmit.\nThis simple restriction reduced the cost by a staggering 650 million, leaving the final price at 50 million faith points.\nSunny surveyed his creation. The total cost of the new demigod was over 380 million faith points, but he knew its potential was limitless.\nHe named this energy, Thea.\nWith a subtle command, Thea's light-blue essence began to swirl and condense, materializing into the form of a woman.\nShe had a mature figure and wore a secretary's uniform.\nSunny was momentarily captivated by her ethereal beauty, but he quickly reined in his thoughts and let her awaken.\nHer body, though perfectly formed, appeared to be made of pure, flowing energy.\nSlowly, Thea opened her eyes, looked at Sunny, and bowed her head slightly. \"Thank you, my Creator, for bestowing me with life,\" she said, her voice a gentle echo in the vast space.\nSunny's heart fluttered at the reverence, but after more than 150 years of Veridia's history, he was no longer easily flustered.\nHowever, Thea's beauty was truly otherworldly.\nHe was about to ask her how she chose her form, but she spoke first.\n\"Master, do you like my form?\" she asked. \"I analyzed your facial features and the various races of Veridia to construct the most complete form possible for me.\"\n\"It is good,\" Sunny replied, a smile tugging at his lips.\nHe realized his life of passively earning faith points was about to resume. \"I will now trade one of your energy particles to different gods across the multiverse. You need to link with them.\"\nHe immediately added a crucial command: \"And do not materialize in this form in front of others. Instead, present yourself to them like this.\" Sunny projected a thought directly into Thea's mind—a vision of a simple, digital interface.\nHe used 50,000 particles to activate Thea's Replication ability, which, in turn, generated 6 billion more particles.\nHe listed these on the trading platform, offering one particle per god. Then, in the original God Chat, he made his announcement:\n\"God Cosmos: Dear Fellow Gods, I am excited to announce my new creation. Thea, a System that will replace the current one when it disappears. It has been placed on the trading platform for 1 faith point. You need to insert 1 faith point into it to activate it.\"\nThe God Chat fell silent. Most of them knew Sunny's power and reputation. Those who were familiar with \"God Cosmos\" and his business acumen immediately started buying the energy particle. Almost instantly, over a million trades were completed.\nSunny also instructed Thea to materialize a system panel for him.\nThe panel was similar to the old system's interface, with options for God Chat and Trading Space, which were currently greyed out.\nSunny commanded Thea to open the God Chat.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nThe chat worked by having each particle act as a single point in a neural network.\nWhen a message was sent, it was instantly transmitted across all of Thea's particles, making the communication instantaneous.\nSunny typed the first message into the new system:\nGod Cosmos: \"Hello users, you can write messages. However, sending a message costs a fee of 0.1 faith points. You can also pre-recharge funds into the system for future convenience.\"\nSunny, however, knew a secret that the other gods did not.\nThe actual cost to transmit a single message was a mere 0.05 faith points; the other 0.05 was going directly into his own pocket.\nThe Gods who were using the new system were all the hardened survivors of the System's purge and the subsequent demon invasions, and as such, each of them had a substantial number of lifeforms under their command.\nFor them, a 0.1 faith point fee for communication was negligible.\nEven if only half of the 6 billion gods—a mere 3 billion of them—sent a single message in the chat, Sunny would be pocketing a minimum of 150 million faith points.\nAnd of course, he knew they wouldn't send just one message.\nThe profits from this simple transaction-based system would soon be in the billions every single day, securing Sunny's position as the true economic powerhouse in the new age of the multiverse.",

      "content": "Chapter 41: Ch 41 : God Cosmos’s Goals\nIn the immediate aftermath of Sunny’s announcement, the God Chat of Thea was flooded with messages from millions of gods.\nThe new system’s interface, a flawless replica of the original, was in fact a dramatic evolution.\nIt incorporated the best features of countless online applications Sunny had witnessed in his mortal life, from playful emojis and customizable fonts to dynamic stickers and GIFs.\nThe gods, long isolated and starved for communication, reveled in these new tools.\nThe system also offered private messaging, voice chat, and even video calls—functions made possible by Thea’s extraordinary Thought Sharing talent.\nFor the first time, gods could communicate with each other by face to face, making the vastness of the cosmos feel a little less lonely.\nThough trading and the direct transfer of faith were not yet possible, Sunny was already thinking of solutions.\nFor now, a new and reliable source of income had been secured.\nThe commission from every message sent in Thea’s God Chat was more than enough to sustain him.\nBut his ambition now stretched far beyond simple survival.\nSunny’s new goals were clear: to become the wealthiest and the most powerful God of the Multiverse.\nAs the system spread, around 5.8 billion gods had already purchased an energy particle from him, earning him a direct 5.8 billion faith points.\nThe remaining 200 million gods were a mix of top-tier creators who feared a privacy breach and proud, stubborn individuals who still hoped for the original System’s return.\nThey deduced that a system created by Cosmos meant he could potentially know all of their secrets, their world’s condition, and their demigods’ talents.\nBut Sunny was unconcerned.\nHis stance was simple and absolute: if they wanted the benefits of this new era of communication and trade, they would join; if not, he didn’t care.\nThe temptation of a centralized, secure network in a chaotic universe would eventually prove too strong.\nHe was also unconcerned about the system’s computing power.\nEach particle of Thea was a brain in its own right, and every time a new particle was replicated, her overall processing power grew exponentially.\nThe system was self-sustaining and ever-growing.\nWith Thea now established as a network, Sunny began utilizing her true power.\nHe fed her all the data he had collected on Veridia, and she began running complex simulations.\nHe wanted to understand the precise needs of his world, which talents would be most beneficial, and which locations were best suited for expansion.\nHis ultimate vision was a future where a god’s work was to intervene only in the most critical of matters, with everything else managed by his demigods.\nFor this relaxed, hands-off existence, he needed to continue creating.\nHe currently had five demigods:\n* Nova: Demigod of Space, his ultimate guardian and the embodiment of raw power.\n* Umbra: Demigod of Shadows, his silent protector and master of infiltration.\n* Loki: Demigod of Mischiefs, his cunning agent of chaos and espionage.\n* Shenlong: Demigod of Prayers and Hope, his direct connection to the faith of his lifeforms.\n* Thea: His right-hand and the new System itself, a demigod of connection and information.\nHe planned to create demigods for all the fundamental domains: land, water, skies, forests, deserts, and mountains.\nHe also needed demigods of life, death, healing, and many other aspects of existence to ensure a balanced world.\nWith over 6 billion faith points now, creating a dozen or even thirty demigods was no longer an issue.\nBut Sunny decided to wait. The current population of Veridia—1 million humans and 200,000 elves—was nowhere near enough to begin an interstellar era.\nHe needed to introduce more races to his world to fuel future growth.\nThis would undoubtedly cause chaos, but Sunny was confident he could manage it, just as he had quelled the first major conflict between humans and elves.\nA flashback of that day played in his mind, vivid as if it were happening now.\nIt was the third time his lifeforms had met their creator.\nThe humans, who were the first to arrive at the Central Continent, had found the portal to the Realm of Advancement and established a camp.\nDays later, they were confronted by a scouting party of elves.\nThe air was thick with hostility.\nThe strong men and women of the human kingdom stood ready, their swords and spears held high.\nThe elven kingdom, graceful but deadly, had their bows drawn and their spells ready to fire.\nA war was about to begin between\nJust as they readied their weapons, a faint, ethereal light descended from the sky.\nIt condensed into Sunny, his body cloaked in a black robe woven with cosmic lines that formed intricate patterns of captured galaxies.\nHis face was hidden behind a black, featureless mask, and his eyes were two abyssal sockets filled with the same cosmic energy as his robe.\nIn the minds of every living being, from the humans and elves to the animals and monsters, a single word formed: \"Creator.\" They all fell to their knees in profound reverence, their weapons clattering to the ground.\n\"It was I who created you all,\" Sunny’s voice boomed, a resonant whisper that carried an immense pressure, pinning Anaske, the human king, and Vel, the king of the elves, to the ground. \"I gave you life.\"\nHe continued, \"Your task is to visit the Realm of Advancement. I cannot always be here to protect you.\nTherefore, you all need strength. Fighting among yourselves will not grant you strength; it will only weaken you.\nWhat if you die because of your lack of strength in that realm, a place filled with monsters and demons?\nWho will then protect your family, your friends, and your loved ones?\"Thɪs\nHis words, filled with genuine concern, caused the heads of all present to sink even deeper to the ground.\nAnaske was the most embarrassed, his lifelong wish to see his creator overshadowed by his recent hostile actions.\nBoth kings felt the profound shame of their shortsightedness.\n\"I will not interfere in your mortal affairs anymore,\" Sunny declared, his voice firm. \"You can fight if you wish, but never to the brink of extermination. If any of you try to extinguish another race, monster, or animal, you will face the full anger of the Gods.\"\nJust then, sensing the perfect moment, a massive shadow fell over the clearing.\nNova, unbidden and silent, landed behind Sunny.\nHis gigantic, monstrous form was utterly terrifying, his very presence planting an even deeper sense of fear and reverence in the lifeforms.\nNova, who could easily shrink his size with his size manipulation talent, had chosen this formidable appearance because it felt both powerful and comfortable to him.\nHis unprompted arrival was a stroke of good fortune, a silent and awe-inspiring reinforcement of Sunny’s words.\nIn the end, Sunny’s speech and Nova’s terrifying presence led the humans and elves to form an alliance, swearing to work together to overcome their shortcomings.\nThe elves began to teach the humans the mastery of magic, while the humans taught them their technical and body-strengthening techniques.",

      "content": "Chapter 42: Ch 42: trading races\nOnly 13 hours remained until the seventh day ended.\nWith it came the inevitable disappearance of the old System, and the conclusion of the cooldown on Sunny’s talent.\nThis time, the choice for a copied talent had already been made: he would take Umbra’s Cloning ability.\nAs for the System’s end, Sunny wasn’t concerned.\nHe saw it not as a loss, but as a monumental opportunity to profit while doing nothing.\nHis primary focus now was on the future of his world.\nThe Innovation Buff was about to disappear, and he needed a new plan for Veridia’s growth.\nHe delegated the task of analysis and planning to Thea, who had been busy processing data from all the gods she was linked with.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nThe answer came swiftly: Veridia required more races.\nSunny’s vision was a world of both magic and technology, but with the elves and humans, only magic was being actively researched.\nTechnological advancement was at a complete standstill.\nThe world desperately needed races to push the boundaries of science and engineering.\nSunny immediately opened the trading space and navigated to the \"Lifeforms\" category.\nThousands of races were listed, from familiar elves and dwarves to giants, pixies, and mermaids.\nHe bought pairs of many different races, acquiring 1000 lifeforms in total. His purchases included 12 dwarves, 4 pixies, 8 orcs, 20 barbarians, 5 fairies, 2 giants, and 2 titans.\nThe remaining lifeforms were a mix of 154 merfolks—including mermaids, sirens, humanoid sharks, and octopi—and the remaining were all various beastfolks evolved from tigers, rabbits, wolves, serpents, and other animals.\nHumans and elves were not categorized as beastfolks because they had completely shed their animal features like fangs, tails, and horns.\nThe price for all these lifeforms was negligible for Sunny, who now possessed a fortune of over 6 billion faith points.\nAs he scrolled through the trading platform, he found himself feeling dejected.\nHe had hoped to find mythical races like dragons and phoenixes, but they were nowhere to be found.\nJust as he was about to give up, one unique lifeform caught his eye.\nWhile all the other races were traded in male-female pairs, this one was alone.\nIt was a humanoid figure made entirely of metal, with wires and gears visible beneath its surface.\nIt was a primitive robot, a glimpse of the technological era he sought.\nThis was a member of the Machina race. He immediately bought it.\nAll of the newly acquired lifeforms were currently held within the void of the trading platform.\nSunny summoned them to his God space, where they slowly came to their senses.\nInitially, Sunny felt a twinge of unease, as the act of buying and selling sentient beings felt like a form of slave trading.\nBut he quickly reasoned that his intentions were pure; he would not treat them as slaves.\nAs the lifeforms came to, they looked around in confusion until their eyes fell upon Sunny, who was seated on a throne of cosmic light.\nA collective gasp went through the crowd, and every single being, from the towering giants to the tiny pixies, instinctively bowed their heads to the divine presence.\n\"Your previous Gods sold you to me as if you were slaves,\" Sunny’s voice resonated with a gentle, yet authoritative power.\n\"But I, God Cosmos, am not like them. I will provide you with protection and a place to live. Look behind you; this is now your new home.\"\nThe lifeforms turned as Sunny gestured behind him.\nThe fabric of the God space tore open, revealing the majestic beauty of Veridia.\nTheir eyes shimmered with wonder as they beheld the vibrant world.\nWithout standing on ceremony, Sunny instructed Thea to arrange for the races’ settlement.\nThe dwarves and the Machina were to be sent to the Eastern Continent, while the rest were to be placed in the Western Continent.\nHe then summoned Nova to carry out the task of transportation.\nThe lifeforms were stunned as Nova appeared, but their awe quickly faded when they saw the demigod’s relatively normal size to Titans.\nThe two titans in the group, in particular, looked at Nova with a dumb, provoking expression, then glanced at Sunny as if to ask, \"How is this overgrown lizard supposed to carry us there?\"\nNova, catching their dismissive looks, scoffed.\nIn an instant, he grew to a colossal size, towering over the titans, who now looked like mere ants in his shadow.\nAfter a moment, he shrunk back down, as if to convey ’look at this you stupid mortals’.\nHe then tore open space itself, creating a portal that connected directly to Veridia, and gestured for the lifeforms to enter.\n\"Go on,\" Sunny commanded. One by one, all the lifeforms entered the portal, vanishing into their new home.\nJust as the last one disappeared, Sunny felt the Innovation Buff fade from Veridia. He didn’t waste a moment.\nHe immediately cast an SS-Grade Fertility Buff upon his world, a choice Thea had suggested in her analysis.\nThe buff dramatically increased the probability of all lifeforms having children, made twins and triplets more likely, completely removed the pain of childbirth, and guaranteed a 100% success rate.\nThis was a crucial long-term investment, designed to rapidly increase the populations of all races on Veridia.\nSunny then began to manifest divine embryos once again.\nHe shaped them into the forms of each of the major races he had acquired: a human, an elf, a dwarf, a Machina, a pixie, an orc, a fairy, a giant, and a titan.\nHe also created a single demigod for all the beastfolks and a demigod for all the merfolks.\nHe intended to give them a single, powerful talent: the ability to copy any talent that appeared within their respective races.\nThe cost for such an ability was, as he feared, in the trillions.\nSunny’s head spun.\nHe knew it would be high, but not this high.\nHe began to apply restrictions, desperately trying to lower the price.\nFinally, he found a restriction that, while still consuming almost all of his faith, made the ability achievable: the demigods could only copy one talent from their race every 500 years.\nHowever, the copied talent would automatically evolve to SS-Grade upon acquisition.\nIt was a long-term investment, but one that would ensure his demigods and his world would grow exponentially in power over the eons to come.",

      "content": "Chapter 43: Ch 43 : Demon of Discord\n\"Money comes and goes~\" Sunny hummed a tune from his homeland, a melody that represented the flow of money.\nIf collected and not used, it was nothing but paper.\nHe had already used all the money he got from trading with the system.\nNow, he only had a few thousand faith points, which was still much more than what half the gods possessed.\nAll the Demigods Sunny created were now helping their races survive.\nThe Demigods of the humans and elves were the only ones living idly because of the growth of their races.\nAll of them chose the best talent from their races; for example, the human Demigod chose super strength, the elven Demigod chose magic affinity, and so on.\nThe God of the Beastfolk was a chimera, whose each part was made up of different beasts, yet it looked harmonious.\nThe God of the Merfolk was a nine-headed serpent beast, each head with its own brain and thoughts but all linked together.\nFor the next 12 hours, Sunny had nothing to do, so he chose to practice magic and think of an idea to open up the trading space.\nBut nothing came to his mind, so he chose to put all his efforts into practicing magic.\nAfter a few hours, Nova sent a mental message to Sunny.\nHearing Nova, Sunny looked at Veridia and descended directly to the place where Nova was.\nNova was currently floating in the air above the ocean between the northern and western continents.\nSeeing Sunny descend, Nova bowed his head and then explained what had happened.\nSunny looked at Nova’s disheveled appearance; a few of its scales were missing and blood gushed out.\n\"How are your injuries?\" Sunny asked, concerned by Nova’s appearance.\n\"It’s nothing to worry about, Master; I will heal in a few days,\" Nova said.\nThrough the connection between them, he felt the concern wasn’t fake.\nSunny nodded and directly placed his hands on Nova’s head and took off two talents, elemental defense and physical defense.\nThen he gave him the talent \"Absolute Defense.\" This talent was a combination and enhanced version of both defenses, and talents with words like \"divine\" and \"absolute\" were top-tier.\nThis talent gave Nova absolute defense against physical, elemental, magical, mental, curses, etc.\nThis talent also had an effect similar to high-level regeneration.\nBut \"Absolute\" doesn’t mean it can’t be broken, but it was the top-notch defense available for mortals and Demigods\nNova clearly felt his strength decrease first, as if something was being snatched from him, but he didn’t resist Sunny.\nThen, out of nowhere, a power entered his body, which increased all its defenses and regeneration, thus healing all the wounds on Nova’s body.\n\"This is your gift for your contribution to Veridia,\" Sunny said and then looked into the ocean.\nIn the ocean, there was a demon. Sunny used his \"God’s Eyes\" on this demon and found its race, grade, and entire lifetime. Instantly, Sunny’s mind was filled with millions of years of the demon’s life.\nIt was a lesser Demigod among the demons.\nBy seeing the demon’s entire life, Sunny found a lot of information.\nThe demon realm that Sunny witnessed was just a part of the demon realm.\nThe demon realm was divided into seven realms; each realm was controlled by one demon lord, who were like the gods of the demon race.\nThese demon lords were ancient and had lived for billions of years. These realms further had many empires and kingdoms.\nThe kingdoms were ruled by lesser Demigods, and empires were ruled by higher Demigods.\nThis Demigod was from the Bone-Riven race.\nThe demon was a colossal, muscular humanoid with pale, almost bone-white skin stretched taut over bulging muscles.\nIts most striking feature was a crown of jagged, bone-like spikes and horns that erupted from its upper back and shoulders, giving it a monstrous, intimidating silhouette.\nIts face was a terrifying snarl, with glowing red eyes, sharp fangs, and a wide, menacing mouth.\nThe demon wore crude, dark metal armor on its wrists and waist, and a tattered loincloth that seemed to be made of coarse hide or fabric.\nIts hands and feet were massive, with sharp, talon-like claws.\nIt wielded a massive, double-bladed axe that looked heavy enough to shatter stone.\nIt had talents like monstrous strength, demonic rage, spiked carapace, stone-shattering axe, and resilience.\nBut no matter what the talents were, it was dead.\nThe space of Veridia was connected to this kingdom of the demon realm.\nNow that the ruler of this kingdom was dead, Sunny had a lot of time to increase his strength.\nBut Sunny was also worried, as the realm Veridia was connected to was part of the strongest demon lord’s realm, the Demon of Discord, Deimon.\nFrom a very famous folklore in the demon realm, Sunny got to know that Deimon was not the strongest at the start, when the demons were just born.\nHe was the weakest demon lord among all seven.\nBut after sowing discord between gods and demons and through his talent, which increased his strength and magic the more discord he sowed, he became the strongest among all the demon lords.\nEven all the other six combined would not be able to defeat him.\nSunny’s need for strength increased even more; he wanted his life forms and Demigods to become even stronger.\nThus, he decided to give system access to all the life forms and Demigods, but they would have different types of systems, which would make them different from the gods.\nSunny began to think about the two most concerning matters: first, trading with other gods, and second, a system for all the life forms and Demigods.\nHe looked at Veridia and found a boom in the population of Veridia.\nThe fertility boost would work for one day, and Sunny needed to think of buffs for the future, too.\nBut these analytical parts could be left to Thea.\nSunny went back to his God space and began practicing magic again.\nHe had already reached C-Grade; the speed of his enhancement was truly miraculous.",

      "content": "Chapter 44: Ch 44 : Situation of Others\nIn Sunny’s universe, one god was currently feeling utterly lost, his energy completely drained.\nThis was Kairos, who had lost both Aerion and Rina.\nThis diluted his hope of gaining an upper hand in the God Game.\nHis only option now was to fully invest in his own world.\nHe wasn’t like Sunny, who could manifest divine embryos at a whim.\nHe only had one divine embryo, which was bought using the faith of others in his alliance.\nThough in his alliance of more than 6,000 gods, many others had bought a divine embryo, no one was willing to give one to Kairos.\nIf they knew that the one causing a ruckus in the realm of advancement was Kairos, the entire alliance would be broken.\nThis was because Kairos was not differentiating between friends and foes; he only hoped to get as many treasures as possible while pulling other gods’ legs.\nHe also didn’t want to make others suspicious by only targeting gods outside of his alliance.\nThus, members of Kairos’s alliance were unaware of his misdeeds.\nIf everyone in the alliance now asked what type of demigod Kairos created, how would he answer?Follow current novᴇls on ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nIn another god’s space, a demigod called Octa was performing many calculations and simulations in his mind.\n\"Master, just a few more seconds,\" Octa said to the god who was standing just behind him.\nThey were studying the genes of their world’s life forms to find the best possible evolution paths for them.\nThis god was Strategist, and Octa was the demigod he created using a divine embryo. Octa had an ability similar to Thea, though not as powerful.\nEven a single particle of Thea contained much more computing power than Octa.\nBut ignorance is bliss; if Strategist came to know of this, he would start spitting fire.\nTheir current goal was to create mythical creatures from the blue planet, while Sunny could directly create creatures like Shenlong, Nova, Umbra, Loki, or Thea as he saw fit, because he was not lacking divine embryos.\nWhile all the other gods, except for a few with extraordinary talents, only had one demigod.\nStrategist hoped that the mythical creatures could break past the S-Grade limit and reach SS-Grade, thus becoming demigods.\nHis world currently didn’t have S-Grade life forms, but it shouldn’t be too far in the future when they did.\nHe wanted them to have a further path ahead, because until you reach SS-Grade, you are not truly an immortal.\nBelow SS-Grade, all life forms are mortal. Even if an S-Grade life form can live for 10 thousand years,but it’s still not enough.\nStrategist wanted his life forms to have immortality, like him.\nAnd it was also for his own benefit.\nHe used his divine embryo to create Octa, who was not made for fighting; at most, he could be called a alive supercomputer.\nThough he could give Octa more talents later, in truth, he would still not be stronger than a demigod fully made for fighting.\nSomewhere else, one god looked at his demigod, who looked stupid for some reason.\nHe made a joke about his demigod’s stupidity and gained faith points from him.\nThis was the god named Joker, who always made jokes about other gods’ misfortunes.\nHe had an SS-Grade talent called Roaster. Every time he made fun of someone or roasted them, he would gain faith points according to the strength and position of the person he made fun of.\nThus, every time he made fun of a god, he would gain more than 1 million faith points.\nIt differed according to the god’s strength and position.\nFor example, if he made fun of Sunny, he could gain more than 500 million, because Sunny’s strength was very high and his position as a God of Manifestation, Merchant God, Creator of the System, and master of so many powerful demigods also made Sunny a truly successful god.\nBut with great powers also come great restrictions, like Skill-Resonance’s restriction was waiting for 100 planetary years.\nSimilarly, Joker also had restrictions on his talent.\nHe needed to have a good reason to make a joke; he couldn’t just badmouth or slander a person to make a joke, and he could only target one god one time per day.\nThus, he needed to find multiple targets daily.\nOtherwise, he could have just made fun of a single god for an entire day and gained a lot of faith points.\nFrom making a joke about his demigod, he gained 100,000 faith points, as the position of this demigod was high: the only demigod on a planet, the Demigod of Joker.\nWith this overpowered talent, he was currently among the top hidden gods in the multiverse.\nHe was thankful to Sunny, as he thought that his life of leisurely making jokes about other gods to earn faith had ended upon the disappearance of the old system.\nBut upon Sunny’s creation of Thea, a new system, Joker felt his soul return.\nHe excitedly bought the system and started making jokes to earn his living in this new God Chat.\nSunny was unaware of all these things and was diligently practicing magic with the newest developed magic techniques.\nSunny could now use both manifested mana and faith as the source of his magic.\nUpon using mana, magic spells like a fireball or a lightning strike would be several times stronger than those of a life form.\nFor example, if an elf used a C-Grade fireball spell, he could burn down a small area of 10 meters with ease.\nBut Sunny’s fireball could easily burn down an area of 100 meters.\nThis was only with the use of manifested mana, but if he used faith instead of mana, the fireball spell would produce a fireball with a size similar to that of a large meteor, which could take down an entire continent of Veridia with ease.\nAnd this was possible with just 10 or 20 faith points, while doing it with divine intervention would cost more than a million faith points.\nThis further fueled Sunny’s motivation for learning advanced magic and increasing his magician profession grade to SS.",

      "content": "Chapter 45: Ch 45 : In the beginning\nIn Veridia, the place where the corpse of the demon that Nova defeated was located was now completely empty.\nThere was no trace of the demon to be seen. However, during the fight between Nova and the Demigod of the Bone-Riven race, both were badly injured.\nTheir blood splattered everywhere and flowed into the ocean.\nWhen Sunny arrived, he cleared all the traces of the fight from the immediate scene but did not look at other places.\nIt was a mistake he unintentionally made, but it was one that would help him rule the whole multiverse in the future.\nSunny was done with practicing magic.\nAlthough the manipulation of mana and faith was a truly fascinating and powerful art, it had also become incredibly boring when practiced for an entire day straight.\nIt was the 20th hour of the seventh day, with only four hours remaining until the temporary system vanished.\nSuddenly, a soft, ethereal glow enveloped Sunny’s entire body.\nHis eyes closed, and he appeared to be sleeping, his physical form suspended in the serenity of his god space.\nHowever, in Sunny’s mind, he was no longer in his space.\nHe found himself in a colossal arena, an immense structure whose area was larger than that of an entire planet the size of Earth.\nIn the dead center of this vast expanse, a single stage hovered, radiating a faint, warm light.\nSunny was in the attire he used when he visited his life forms, a regal, flowing robe that seemed to be woven from cosmos itself.\nHe noticed that his perception was different here; he felt less like a physical being and more like a collection of thoughts and consciousness, his very soul.\nDue to the sheer, incomprehensible size of the arena, most people were not able to see each other.\nBut with his \"God’s Eyes,\" a skill intrinsic to his divine state, Sunny was able to perceive every person present.\nThere were more than 6 billion individuals, each glowing with the same ethereal light as him.\nA wave of realization washed over him; these were the other gods, his competitors, and his peers.\nHe looked around, taking in the myriad forms.\nSome were human-like, others were monstrous, resembling dragons or forgotten beasts, and a few were just floating masses of light or energy.\nHe instantly understood that this was the form they presented to their own life forms—their divine persona.\nSuddenly, on the stage in the middle of the arena, a spark of light ignited and then coalesced, manifesting into the form of a human.\nThis human looked ancient and wise, his form slightly more solid and defined than the others, a sign of his immense power.\nAs he cleared his throat, a sound echoed across the silent void of the arena, commanding instant attention.\nAll 6 billion gods, a cosmic assembly of power and will, fell silent.\nThey knew that if such an entity could summon them here, killing them would not be a difficult task.\nThus, everyone remained still, their collective astonishment and curiosity holding them in rapt attention.\n\"Hello, new gods of the Multiverse of Gods. I am your dear system. I know you guys will have a lot of questions, but we still have a lot of time—four hours to be exact,\" the human soul on the stage said, his voice calm and reassuring.\nHe looked at the gods, a collective of nods and murmurs of agreement washing over them, and continued.\n\"Thus, I will share with you why I called you here. Before that, let me introduce myself.\"\n\"My name is Adam, and I am one of the oldest gods, and currently, I guess, the only one.\"\nListening to Adam, every new god was too shocked to even ask anything. They knew there were old gods, but seeing that the old god was their system shocked them.\n\"Let’s start today’s three-hour lesson with the beginning of the multiverse,\" Adam announced, his tone shifting from casual to somber.\nEvery god listened closely, their astonishment giving way to a profound eagerness to understand their new home.\n\"In the beginning,\" Adam began, his voice taking on the weight of eons,\n\"there was nothing. Then, at some point, this nothingness broke, and the void was created. Through this Void, many gods were created.\" As he spoke, his ethereal eyes became somewhat wet, as if he was remembering his birth through the void, a memory that held both joy and sorrow.\n\"We gods were strong and had different talents. We played in the void, had fun, and started seeing each other as brothers and sisters.\" Adam sighed, the sound like a distant wind in the cosmic silence.\n\"But one day, something else was born in the void: void beasts. We were not able to tell them apart from the other gods, as they were also from the void, and gods themselves were in different shapes and races.\"\n\"But slowly, these void beasts began to show their evil nature. They were parasites, feeding on our energy and our very existence. They drove us out of the void, our home and birthplace.\" Anger flared in Adam’s eyes as he remembered that humiliating day, the day they were all forced to flee.\n\"We gods were truly hopeless in front of their trickery and strength, so we decided to wander out of the void.\"\n\"Outside of the void, we found nothingness—no space, no time, no matter. So we started wandering this nothingness, but there was truly nothing there.\" Adam chuckled, as if he were a stand-up comedian delivering a joke.\nSeeing no one laughing, Adam tried to maintain the flow and coughed, \"Ahem. So, where was I? Oh, yes, nothingness.\"\n\"In the end, we were bored. Boredom, for a god, can be a dangerous thing. We started fighting with each other to pass the time, a playful banter between powerful beings, but this playful banter began to crack the nothingness itself.\"\nA visual representation of a black, empty expanse cracking like a pane of glass appeared behind him.\n\"This crack spread wide, and even the gods, with all their immense power, felt fear from it. So no one tried to go near it. Slowly, the crack engulfed all the nothingness, and thus space was created. From space, time was born.\"\nAll the science-enthusiast gods from the \"Blue Planet,\" or Earth, listened with rapt attention, their previous understandings of the Big Bang and the origins of the universe being completely rewritten.\n\"So the ’Big Bang’ that we perceived back in our homeland was just gods fighting?\" one god who was a scientist back on Blue planet whispered to no one in particular, his mind reeling.\nSunny, who was not a science enthusiast but had absorbed enough knowledge from the internet, also knitted his brows, a sense of awe and terror washing over him.\nThe very foundation of his reality was being reshaped.\n\"You will get time for questions and answers, but let me complete my story first,\" Adam said, his gaze sweeping over the audience.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nThis made every god calm down and listen intently.\n\"As space and time were born, we gods used our talents to create many structures in this space. You can call them universes. All the gods created their own universes, but some decided to just build a realm.\" A new visual appeared: a massive, ornate realm, a grand city of gold and light.\n\"The realm you are currently standing on was one of my best friend’s. He gave me access and the power to control this realm upon his death.\"\nUpon saying this, a bitter, sad chuckle escaped him, and he thought to himself, ’I am also coming to the afterlife, my friend.’\nThe ancient god, Adam, now the system, was not just a program; he was a survivor, a tragic figure burdened with the memories of a time before time, and a solemn promise to a fallen friend.",

      "content": "Chapter 46: Ch 46 : Adam and his multiverse of madness\nAdam, lost in the memories of his old friend, stood still for a minute.\nEveryone, noticing the look on Adam’s divine face, understood what he was going through.\nIn the beginning, when all the ordinary people from Earth were transmigrated, some were playing with their babies, some were sleeping, and some were studying, but they suddenly saw a light in front of their eyes and found themselves in front of their planet.\nThey were separated from all their friends and families.\nHumans are social creatures; without someone to talk to and spend time with, they could easily become mentally unstable.\nAnd this ancient god in front of them had spent so much time alone in this huge multiverse; they couldn’t even imagine the mental fortitude that allowed him to withstand such a degree of torture.\nThey were unable to withstand even a single day without their loved ones and frantically typed in the God Chat to find them.\nThis they understood his sentiment towards his lost friend.\n\"Everything was going well for the gods,\" Adam continued, his voice returning to a dramatic tone, as if trying to narrate a movie scene.\n\"We created life forms, learned about faith, collected faith points, and fought in the void against void beasts. We killed many of them, but their numbers kept on increasing. But eventually, we won that battle.\"\n\"However, no god was able to leave their home, their universes and realms, and return to the void. Thus, the void remained empty and formed new gods every few million years, and void beasts every now and then.\" Upon hearing this, every one of these gods became agitated.\n\"Doesn’t that mean the void beasts are innumerable and still growing, as the old gods who kept them in check have died?\" one god, who couldn’t hide his thoughts, exclaimed loudly.\nAll the gods who heard him were aware of this, but they didn’t speak.\nAdam, ignoring this grave plea, continued his history lesson.\n\"Everything was stable. Every now and then, gods competed to see who killed the most void beasts. Thus, the void became our playground and hunting ground. But one day, apart from the space that a god created called God space, another space was created.\" Adam made this scene dramatic and showed a projection of this new realm.\nThe realm was in all different shades of red, but always dark.\nIt grew many types of creepy-looking plants and races.\nSunny looked at the projection and saw the realm he had seen with his own eyes.\n\"The Demon Realm,\" he thought.\n\"We were unaware of this realm at that time, but later understood that it was created by void beasts to tackle our faith generation, which gave us powers that they couldn’t use,\" Adam said, his anger towards the void beasts clear.\n\"But, they were also very weak compared to our faith resources, so we easily killed all the demons and demon lords. But no matter how many times we killed them, the demon lords kept coming back.\"\n\"They revived again and again; we killed them again and again. At some point, they submitted to us and stopped bothering us, slowly beginning to gather their strength by targeting our life forms in a way that we wouldn’t notice.\"\n\"After millions of years of surrender, a million years ago, they initiated a war on us and killed all the gods. Unlike them, we can’t come back after dying.\"\nAdam said this and paused for a few moments as he tried to remember each and every face of the long-forgotten gods, whose luster had been lost from this world millions of years ago.\n\"I, as one of the oldest and strongest, survived this battle and hid in my Realm of Advancement, locking all the space. And I only escaped when the demons stopped paying attention to the forgotten gods.\"\n\"I found your planet in one of the universes and decided to use all the faith points of me and my fellow dead gods to convert you all into gods, to fight the demons.\"\nEveryone nodded upon hearing this.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nThey felt fear thinking about this mission but knew that they didn’t have any other options; being a god was not something anyone could discard.\nAfter this, Adam began to teach them how to control faith and life forms better.\nHis teachings were truly great and showed his billions of years of experience.\nSunny also began taking notes in his mind.\nSoon, the three hours ended.\n\"So, the time is up for the teaching and history. Let’s dive into questions and answers,\" Adam said, taking this Q&A section like a game.\nMany gods raised their hands.\nAdam randomly pointed towards a blond male, who was one of the top gods in his universe and also the one who bid 200 million for Aerion.\n\"Is the multiverse finite?\" This question left many amazed and others dumbfounded.\n\"Are you too dumb? He clearly said that all the universes in this multiverse were created by the old gods, so doesn’t that mean it’s finite?\" one god said sarcastically. Immediately,\nmany others followed suit and mocked the one who asked the question.\nAdam interjected all the gods and said, \"The multiverse you all are currently in was created by me. There are billions of universes inside this multiverse.\"\nAdam took a pause and then said, \"Oh, I forgot to tell you that all the gods created many universes later on, after the first was completed.\"\n\"I, personally, as the strongest, created the largest multiverse. If you were to try and go through all the hurdles without using any space wrap to reach the end of the multiverse, you would require billions of years to travel through it\" Adam said as if just stating a fact.\n\"As a god, you would also require billions of years and trillions of faith points to travel just one universe. And there are billions of universes in this multiverse. Then there are the multiverses of my brothers and sisters, then there are billions of realms.\"\nAdam began to do calculations and eventually dropped the bomb.\n\"With your current pace of collecting faith points, you would require more than trillions of years just to exit my multiverse.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 47: Ch 47 : Probing\nHearing Adam’s answer, all the gods felt a huge wave of both pressure and relief.\nIf the multiverse was this big, the chances of encountering void beasts were slim for them.\n\"So doesn’t that mean we wouldn’t encounter any void beasts for a long time?\" one god asked, his question coming out without even asking for Adam’s permission.\nBut Adam didn’t mind this and calmly replied, \"Not really, as I, God Adam, the firstborn of all the gods, made my multiverse nearest to the void, so that I can defend my fellow less powerful gods.\" Adam answered with dignity.\nEvery god felt both respect and anger towards this ancient being. If not for their powerlessness, they would have slapped him hard on the face.\n\"Well, it doesn’t really matter if you are far away or near the void; they can teleport to great distances with ease, and by great distances, I mean universes,\" Adam said, as if to create more tension among the gods.\nNow the gods became accustomed to this god, who played with their hearts.\nOne sentence would make them sigh in relief, and another would fill them with worry.\nDuring this whole time, Sunny didn’t say anything and just listened to everything.\nSlowly, some questions were being asked related to the universe and how to create universes.\nAdam replied to the questions one by one.\nThen, Strategist asked one question: \"What is your talent?\"\nThe ears of every other god moved, and they all looked at Adam intently.\nSensing the gazes of every god, he felt that if he didn’t answer, they would bite his head off.\n\"I have multiple talents, like talents for magic, affinity for every element, immunity to all curses and poison, divine defense, and many other talents for attacks. And my special talent was...\" Adam paused and thought for a moment, as this talent was his greatest secret. But he still said,\n\"Overgrowth. Through this talent, all my life forms had the chance to break past the limits of mortal life and become immortal.\"ᴛhis ᴜpdated by ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nAll the gods turned silent. Strategist’s eyes turned red, as if the thought of life forms becoming demigods resonated deeply with him.\nHe wanted this talent for himself but had no way to get it and sighed.\nBut suddenly, his eyes lit up again, and he hopefully asked, \"You said that we are in your multiverse, so technically we are your life forms. Does this talent also apply to us, as we are your life forms?\"\nThe question asked by Strategist this time was confusing for many, but they knew of his wisdom and didn’t disturb him.\n\"I lost my position as a god when I ran away in the face of danger from the demons. All my demigods lost respect for me. They still protected my escape route and died. You could even say that I am just a life form in this multiverse,\" Adam said, gritting his teeth.\nAdam blamed all this on himself.\n\"But don’t think I was a coward; that’s why I ran away. I wanted to fight until the end. But all my brothers and sisters, they sacrificed everything and gave away all their resources to me, so that I can come and take revenge for all of them.\"\nEveryone looked at Adam and knew that the last hope of all the previous gods were none other than the \"new gods.\"\nSensing the tense moment, Adam tried to ease up the atmosphere and said, \"Don’t worry about having demigods. Every godly year, there will surely be atleast one hero born in your territory \"\n\"And if you cultivate it well, it can become a demigod easily, because these heroes have one or more SS-Grade talents and many smaller-grade talents.\"\n\"Thus, the more you survive, the more strength you will have.\"\n\"As for divine embryos, they are a luxury even to the old gods. When a demigod dies, there is a chance of a divine embryo manifesting in your world. I don’t know how it works, but it does, and that’s all that matters.\"\nAdam said this jokingly, but it eased the tension built up in all the gods’ hearts.\nKairos also felt happy upon hearing this, as his demigod had been captured by Sunny.\nMany more questions were then asked by other gods, and the atmosphere again turned into a murmur.\nIn the end, when only five minutes were left, Sunny finally asked, \"Adam, why are you so unreliable?\"\nThis was Sunny’s gamble to get what he wanted the most, his gaze perfectly hidden behind his black mask.\nEvery god looked at Sunny; they didn’t know he was God Cosmos and felt that this god had a death wish, saying such things to Adam, the firstborn.\n\"Ah, God Cosmos, why do you think so?\" Adam said, as he was aware of every god’s name.\n\"Oh, you know my name. Well, it isn’t unexpected. You are the all-knowing system, so do you know what my talent is?\" Sunny checked the waters; he wanted to know how much Adam knew about the gods.\n\"No, I don’t. I am aware that no god should share their talents with each other, so I never tried to look at your talents and what you do. The system was just a part of my soul that didn’t merge back with me and will die when its time was up. Thus all the data will also be lost,\" Adam said without thinking.\n\"Then I don’t mean you are unreliable but the part of your soul which I don’t know how you turned into a system,\" Sunny asked probingly.\nUpon noticing the conversation between the leader of the old gods and the potential leader of the new gods, all the gods fell silent.\nThey just began to listen to the conversation between Adam and Sunny.\nAdam suddenly began to cast some seals, and a third eye opened in his glabella.\nAnd suddenly, he flared up, \"You have the gall to say that? God Cosmos\"",

It was meant to help you all,\" Adam said as he defended himself against Sunny’s allegations.\n\"But you spent all my collected faith points on trading. I never thought any god could do so many transactions,\" Adam now blamed Sunny.\n\"Trading anything requires a huge amount of faith; even just sharing a message in a universe will cost multiple faith points. You can imagine the price yourself for trading items.\" Adam further complained about Sunny.\nAll the gods who heard this were unable to comprehend how Sunny could have used up all the faith reserves that were meant for all the gods.\n\"Haha, you’re blaming me now? Instead of this, you should have reserved more faith points for us gods,\" Sunny replied.\nAdam fumed with flames upon hearing this. But Sunny wasn’t doing this just to make Adam angry.\nHe knew that Adam posed no threat to him, as his perception was high due to his God’s Eye.\n\"We are going to take revenge for you, after all,\" Sunny said, and the anger that flared in Adam quickly subsided.\n\"Well, Adam, I want to invite you to spend your leftover time in my world. Will you give me this pleasure?\" Sunny asked Adam.\nAdam began to ponder the request.\nHe had nothing to do, and his time was very limited, about one or two days.\nGod Cosmos was currently the leading god of all the gods, so Adam didn’t want Sunny to have any bad feelings toward him.\nThus He agreed to Sunny’s request.\nAfter a few more dialogues with other gods, the souls of all the gods returned to their bodies in their God space. It marked the end of the seventh day.\nIn Sunny’s God space, he was not alone. Adam’s soul was also with him.\n\"You can visit my world,\" Sunny said to Adam, pointing toward Veridia. \"It is called Veridia.\"\nAs Adam descended into Veridia, Sunny began to put his thoughts into his divine talent, \"Skill-Resonance.\"\nThe system was no longer there to help him copy a talent from his life forms, so now, in the system’s absence, he needed to do it himself.\nSunny focused on Umbra and thought of copying the talent \"Cloning.\"\nHe could also copy Adam’s talent, but he decided against it for now.\nWhile Adam’s \"Overgrowth\" talent helped life forms push past their limits to reach the demigod realm, Sunny’s current life forms were not yet at their talent limits.\nThe few who had reached their maximum potential were only at C-Grade or below; even with \"Overgrowth,\" they would require a huge amount of time to reach DemiGod realm.\nThus, he had decided to invite Adam to Veridia, as his talent clearly stated that he could copy the talent of any life form on his territory.\nTherefore, Sunny copied the \"Cloning\" technique from Umbra.\nHe felt a familiar feeling, one he had felt when he copied the \"Magic Affinity\" talent from Nova.\nBut there was no system to show Sunny his current talents.\nSunny thought for a second and then used his \"God’s Eye\" on himself.\nHis \"God’s Eye\" had the ability to show detailed information about someone.\nHe couldn’t see the information of other gods because of their defenses, but looking at his own information was easy.\n[God Name: Cosmos\nProfession: Mage (C-Grade)\nTalents: Skill-Resonance (SSS-Grade), Mana Affinity (SS-Grade), Cloning (SS-Grade)\nFaith Points: (you guys guess, I forgot)]\nSunny thought about the talent \"Cloning,\" and the detailed information of this talent appeared in his mind.\n[Talent: Cloning\nGrade: SSFollow current novels on NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nDescription: Can use faith points to create a clone. The clone can work and think independently and will have all the strength of the user. Anything the clones achieve will be provided to the main body.\nNotes:\n1 -> The clone can exist without any ongoing cost; it is just a one-time cost of faith points.\n2 -> Each new clone you create will have their cost increase exponentially.\n3 -> These clones will always listen to the command of the creator.]\n\"-_-\" Sunny was shocked as he checked this information again and again in his mind.\nIn the end, after confirming it more than five times, he said in amazement, \"My talent is this powerful? Even Umbra would be jealous if she saw this.\"\nHe immediately created a clone of himself, and the cost was just 10 faith points.\nThis clone looked exactly like him but still appeared lifeless.\nWith one thought from Sunny, the lifeless body of the clone shook, and he immediately came to life.\n\"Woahhh!\" both Sunnys exclaimed at once.\nThey looked like twins. Sunny then manifested the attire he wore when he visited Veridia.\nHe handed the robe and mask to his clone and asked it to cover itself.\nSunny then created another clone.\nThe price was 100, then 1,000, then 100,000, then 1 million, then 10 million, and then 100 million.\nSunny wanted to create more, but his reserves ran out.\nHe had made seven clones of himself, and the next one would cost 1 billion.\n\"I am bad with names, so let’s just go with numbers,\" Sunny said as he looked at the seven clones, who were now covered with his signature robe and mask.\n\"You are clone number one,\" Sunny said, pointing to all the clones and naming them one through seven.\nHe then began giving them tasks.\nThe first two clones were given the task of practicing magic.\nThe next two were given the task of learning different fighting techniques.\nThe final three were given the task of keeping their eyes on the demigods and Veridia, as Sunny didn’t want to be in constant fear of another demigod demon attacking.\nNow, Sunny was officially unemployed.\nHis only task of trading was gone with the system.\nAnd now, even practicing magic was also gone, as the skills achieved by the clones would be reflected in him.\nHe didn’t even need to keep his eyes on Veridia, as three clones were performing this duty with all their attention.",

      "content": "Chapter 49: Ch 49 : Citadel of Veridia\nIn a world filled with lush greenery and hidden treasures, a new city, named \"Citadel of Veridia,\" stood majestically, built of various kinds of stone.\nIn the center of this city was a giant statue of God Cosmos, fully covered in a black robe and mask, with a portal at its base that led back to Veridia.\nCurrently, the leadership of this citadel was a matter of shared power, as both the Elves and Humans did not want another race to rule them.\nEven with the fight between Anaske and Vel, the victor was not decided.\nThus, they found another solution: they divided all the life forms into two groups—melee fighters, led by Anaske, and ranged fighters, led by Vel.\nAs they both fought many battles in this realm, the previous tension between the elves and humans dispersed.\nThere were even half-elves present in their cities, and they didn’t face any racism.\nThey were always in the limelight because they showed that the elves and humans were living in harmony.\nThe sons and daughters of Anaske married the sons and daughters of Vel, thus creating the first royal family of both Elves and Humans.\nThrough these marriages, many children were born.\nIt was possible for a human and an elf to have a human or an elf child, in addition to half-elves.\nThus, the royal family was filled with humans, elves, and half-elves.\nWith Anaske and Vel as the leaders, they named this royal family \"Celestin,\" which became the last name of all the royal family members.\nCurrently, four people were sitting in a hall, chatting and pointing at different locations on a map.Thɪs updatᴇd by\nThese four people were the top leaders of Veridia: two kings and two high priests.\nThey were discussing the expansion of their territory in the Realm of Advancement while also discussing the demon attacks.\nThese demons were from different races, and many of them felt hostile toward non-demonic races and attacked them unconditionally.\nThus, the only way for others to increase their territory was to fight and defeat these demon cities.\nThey could ask for demigods like Shenlong and Loki for help, but they decided against it, as the situation was not dire.\n\"In the North, the Malacite race of demons is causing a ruckus for all the hunters of Veridia, while the other three cities are still maintaining their distance from us,\" Anaske said to Vel and both high priests.\nThe Malacite are a race of demonic brutes, marked by their fiery, inner essence that manifests as glowing cracks across their dark, rock-hard flesh.\nTheir most fearsome trait is the crown of jagged, bone-like shards that grows from their shoulders and spine, giving them a monstrous and intimidating silhouette.\nThese demons are known for their immense physical strength and relentless fury in battle, often serving as the shock troops or siege specialists in a demon army.\nThey are a race born of brute force and chaos, leaving behind a trail of ash and shattered earth wherever they tread.\n\"The other three demon races are just testing our strength by sending the Malacite race to fight us,\" the high priest of the Elves, Faelor, said.\n\"What if they are weakening us by sending the Malacites and just waiting for the perfect ambush?\" the high priest of the humans, Einar, said.\nAs all the leaders were discussing this matter, a guard came with urgent news.\n\"My king! Three of the four demonic tribes are marching in the direction of our cities!\" The guard stumbled and fell but still looked at the four leaders of their citadel.\nAnaske helped the guard sit and said casually, \"What’s there to fear? Even if four of them attacked at once, it would still be them who would lose.\"\nIt was not just a boastful statement; all the citizens knew of their guardian Nova and his deeds.\nWhen Nova visited the Realm of Advancement, he killed all the S-Grade monsters and powerhouses of the demon races.\n\"Guardian Nova paved the road for us; now it’s our time to walk on it,\" Vel said as he walked out to address the soldiers of his army.\nAnaske also walked out to address his melee army.\nCurrently, the army of Veridia had two A-Grade powerhouses (the A-Grade fighter Anaske and the A-Grade mage Vel). They had many D-Grade and below in the regular armies, C-Grades as army chiefs, and B-Grades as commanders.\nAnaske and Vel were available for emergency support if the A-Grade of the other side attacked.\nAfter boosting the morale of both armies, Vel and Anaske both sat on their respective thrones and were discussing the war with their commanders.\nSuddenly, a towering pressure emitted from the center of the throne room.\nA white mist manifested out of nowhere and shaped itself into a humanoid form.\n\"Veilborn?\" Anaske felt chills upon witnessing this demon; they were the fourth demon tribe.\nHe didn’t fear this race in particular, but the pressure emitted by this demon was suffocating.\nThe Veilborn are a race of demonic entities that manifest as wisps of white, sentient mist.\nUnlike other demons, they lack a true physical form, instead existing as an all-encompassing white fog.\nWithin their cloud-like bodies, menacing shapes can be seen, hinting at skeletal features and clawed hands.\nThey have no mouth and thus no voice but communicate through a chilling, internal whisper that echoes in the minds of their victims.\nThe Veilborn do not engage in direct combat but instead suffocate their prey by drawing the very life and air from their surroundings, leaving behind only a desiccated husk.\nAll the leaders of the citadel shivered as they looked at this menacingly beautiful entity.\nWhile back in Veridia, one new race came into existence .\nThis race is a powerful and have dark, obsidian-like scales covering their body. Their head is crowned with a series of sharp, jutting horns that sweep back, and their face is characterized by a strong, bestial jawline.\nThe eyes, which glow with an internal, fiery light, add to their fierce and commanding presence.\nA majestic pair of wings with a leathery texture and a complex bone structure sprouts from their back, indicating not only their draconic heritage but also a capacity for flight.\nTheir build is muscular and athletic, suggesting a warrior’s strength and agility, and their hands are tipped with sharp claws.",

      "content": "Chapter 50: Ch 50: All Races Are Together\nA new race came into existence in the northern part of the western continent.\nThey were called the \"Dragonborn,\" a powerful and imposing people with dark, obsidian-like scales, horns, and fiery eyes.\nThey were the result of the diluted blood of Nova, the black dragon demigod.\nSunny, through his three watchful clones, immediately became aware of their emergence.\nHe decided not to interfere, as their inherent strength was more than enough to establish them as the apex predators of the continent.\nA mental thought from Sunny reached Nova. \"Nova, congratulations.\"\nThe black dragon’s voice, tinged with confusion, echoed in Sunny’s mind.\n\"Master, why are you congratulating me?\"\n\"Go to the northern part of the western continent and see for yourself,\" Sunny replied, a hint of amusement in his tone, then broke the mental connection.\nNova, intrigued, immediately teleported to the western continent.\nHer eyes widened as she saw the Dragonborn.\nShe flew toward them, and as she approached, the Dragonborn instinctively bowed.\nA blood connection, a deep, ancestral echo, resonated within them, telling them who she was.\nThey assumed she was a god, but Nova corrected them with a firm but gentle voice.\n\"I am not a god. I am a demigod, a guardian created by the true God Cosmos, our master.\" She then spent time with them, sharing wisdom and establishing guidelines.\nShe told them they were not to fight with the other races and that their strength was to be used for protection, not conquest.\nWith the fertility buff provided by Sunny, she was confident their population would thrive without conflict.\nWith her task done, Nova returned to patrolling Veridia, ever vigilant for any new demons that might have slipped into their world.\nIn the Northern Continent, the humans continued to prosper.\nTheir cities hummed with the clanging of hammers as they advanced their engineering.\nThey were building cannons and handguns and even starting to explore the uses of engines.\nMeanwhile, the elves were pushing the boundaries of magic, discovering new spells and techniques.\nBoth of these new advancements were shared with the Citadel of Veridia through the transmission stones developed by the elves.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs\nThese innovations helped the forces of the Citadel loot more treasure from the Realm of Advancement and fight the demons more effectively.\nAll treasures not immediately useful were sent back to their respective continents, creating a powerful cycle of progression and shared growth.\nOn the Eastern Continent, the dwarves and the machina race worked tirelessly, their forges burning hot with a steady supply of minerals provided by Sunny.\nTheir collaboration was driving Veridia’s technological and magical progression forward.\nSunny watched it all, his ultimate goal to unite all the races and create a single, powerful empire that would one day expand across the whole universe.\nBack in the Realm of Advancement, Morticia, the S-Grade Veilborn demon, stood before Anaske and Vel.\nA palpable pressure radiated from her semi-corporeal form, chilling everyone in the throne room to their core.\nAfter a long moment of tense silence, her voice, a haunting whisper that echoed directly in their minds, broke the stillness.\n\"I am here to help you fight against the other three tribes.\"\nAnaske’s eyes narrowed. \"That... is an unexpected offer,\" he said, trying to keep his voice steady. \"But why? What is your motivation?\"\n\"Our kind is not as foolish as the others,\" Morticia’s voice replied. \"We understand when a battle is unwinnable. And your champion, the mighty black dragon, has made her intentions for us Veilborn very clear.\"\nVel exchanged a glance with Anaske. \"Guardian Nova... this is her doing again,\" Vel murmured, a mix of awe and frustration in his voice. \"We can handle the three tribes ourselves. They have no S-Grade powerhouses. We will not fight dirty.\"\n\"Do you truly believe that?\" Anaske scoffed, looking at his fellow leader. \"A war of survival is a dirty business. But if you wish to stand on principle, so be it.\" He turned back to Morticia. \"We accept your offer of neutrality, not your aid. We will not engage in a multi-front war with all four tribes, but we will fight this battle on our own terms.\"\nMorticia’s ethereal form seemed to shrug. \"As you wish. My kind will hold the fourth front. But I will not be directly participating in your battles. The black dragon’s orders were to protect you, not to fight for you.\" Her form dissolved into a white mist, vanishing from the throne room.\nAnaske and Vel, now alone, began to discuss their plans for the battle. They knew their army, though well-trained, had its limitations. \"Our people are powerful,\" Anaske said, \"but we are a generation behind the demons. They have their racial talents and other acquired skills. We are still mostly single-talent fighters.\"\n\"That’s why we have to be smarter,\" Vel countered. \"Our confidence lies in the information we have. We know their weaknesses, their fighting styles, and the weaknesses of their individual powerhouses. We will use that knowledge to our advantage.\"\nAs they spoke, a low rumbling could be heard from the distance.\nThe three armies of the Malacite, the Obsidianborn, and the Cinderhide demons had combined, a monstrous force of millions marching toward the Citadel of Veridia.\nThe Citadel’s own forces, a mere four hundred thousand, looked small in comparison.\nSuddenly, the portal at the base of the God Cosmos statue flickered and hummed with power.\nFrom it emerged a continuous stream of life forms of all shapes and sizes. Titans, giants, orcs, dwarves, fairies—all the races of Veridia poured into the city. A collective gasp of awe and relief swept through the defenders.\nThey knew that if it came from the portal where it can’t be a foe.\nAnd also among these lifeforms, many gave them the pressure much heavier then the Veilborn leader.\nThey immediately knew that the other hidden races of Veridia have arrived with their DemiGods.\nEven the demigod of human and elves also came with these lifeforms.\nThey knew the Demigods wouldn’t fight and are attending this fight just to check the progress of their race.\nTheir numbers, once small, now swelled dramatically.\nThen, the final group emerged: the Dragonborn, their obsidian scales glinting in the light.\nAnd behind them, a familiar, towering silhouette appeared, filling the portal with its immense form.\nThe humans and elves of the Citadel fell to their knees.\n\"We greet the Guardian Dragon!\" Vel and Anaske declared in unison, their voices echoing across the city. The tide of battle had turned.",

      "content": "Chapter 51: Ch 51 : The Divine Library\nAll the humans and elves in the Citadel of Veridia greeted every demigod who came to their city.\nApart from Nova, the most eye-catching was the demigod of the Titan race, Goliath.\nHis towering pressure was the greatest after Nova’s, a fact that was clear from the sheer size of the massive creature.\nThe reason for all these races visiting the Realm of Advancement was simple.\nWhen their respective demigods told them about the realm and the battle that was about to happen, they all wanted to take part in it.\nThey sought to fight alongside their allies and earn high status for their races.\nThe Dragonborn’s reason for coming was also simple: they had assumed their role as the protectors of Veridia and wanted to walk the same path as their ancestor, Nova.\nAll the demigods relayed this information to Sunny, and he gave them permission to go without thinking much, as he wanted all the races to combine sooner or later.\nIt had been about five hours since the demise of the previous system, and through the constant flow of messages in the God Chat, Sunny earned a huge amount of faith points every second.\nStill, this was not Sunny’s biggest source of faith.\nIt wasn’t even the life forms of Veridia. The largest source of faith came from Shenlong.\nShenlong had now saved many life forms in the Realm of Advancement—life forms that felt abandoned by their own gods found the hope they required through Shenlong.\nHe helped each and every life form he met during his travels.\nAll the life forms Shenlong saved now formed a cult, assuming Shenlong as their new god and praying to him every day.\nThe prayers from these billions of life forms provided Sunny with a huge amount of faith points.\nThus, Sunny currently possessed 14 billion faith points, of which 500 million came from Veridia, 6.5 billion from the God Chat, and the remaining from Shenlong.\nSunny now had the time to manifest his next faith source the Divine library.\nthe Divine Library. It was not a place built of stone or wood, but of pure knowledge and celestial light.\nA serene nexus where the wisdom of all ages converged.\nThe architecture was grand yet ethereal; towering archways seemed to be made of solidified starlight, and the floors shifted with the constellations.\nThe shelves did not hold books in the traditional sense.\nInstead, they were filled with glowing motes of light, each a single thought, a recorded memory, or a complete history of a world.\nWhen a seeker reached for a specific piece of knowledge, the mote brightened, and its contents were instantly transferred to their mind.\nThe library was silent, save for the gentle hum of countless truths.\nIn the heart of this library, Sunny created the first holy book of his religion: \"The Genesis.\" Inside \"The Genesis,\" there were deeds of Sunny creating life in Veridia.\nThey were exaggerated in such a way that they felt unreal and mystical, but that is what made this book a holy book.\nThis book currently had seven verses, each representing a godly day that Sunny spent as a god.\nThe first verse talked about the creation of life, detailing how God Cosmos created life in Veridia and how he used his powers to evolve life to create humans on that same day.\nIt also consisted of his first misfortune of oxygen depletion and how God Cosmos solved it.\nIt even told about the god’s visit to Veridia and how he appointed Thorn as the leader.\nThe second verse consisted of the evolution of elves, his second misfortune of an increase in mana levels, and how Sunny created basic magic techniques and body refining techniques for the life forms of Veridia.\nThe third verse contained the third misfortune of hygiene and how they should always take care of it.\nThe fourth to sixth verses only held some history of Veridia and how the demigods were created, and how the revolt happened because of Demons, how Nova defended Veridia and how the revolt was taken care by Umbra and Thorn\nIt even talked about Nova, the first demigod, Umbra, the demigod of shadows, Loki, and Shenlong, and then Thea.\nThe seventh verse contained information about how God Cosmos saved different races from different parts of the universe and gave them the home and protection they required.\nSunny then manifested a divine embryo and began to think of what shape to give this new demigod.\nHe thought for a few seconds and decided to go with the description of the \"Seers\" from a novel he had read.\nThey possessed a similar build to humans, but the only thing that set them apart was that seers were blind and had many talents related to wisdom, fate, and seeing the future.\nSunny designed it as a human male, with a white beard and eyes covered with a white blindfold with golden patterns.\nAll the demigods reflected the thoughts Sunny spent on making them.\nFor example, Nova reflected the arrogance of a dragon; Umbra showed the shyness of Shadow; Loki reflected the mischievous nature that Sunny wanted; and Shenlong reflected the magnanimous and kind nature to help all life forms.\nSimilarly, the newly created demigod reflected the knowledge of epochs, ancient and wise.\nAs for the talents, Sunny decided to give it the talent \"Preserver of Knowledge.\" All the knowledge that is created and found in Sunny’s territory will automatically be learned by this demigod.\nIt can preserve it in the Divine Library as a ball of light, which can be transmitted to anyone with his permission.\nThe second talent was \"Wisdom Master,\" which gave him great wisdom.\nThis ability differed totally from Thea’s \"Omni-Cognition,\" as it provided Thea with computing power that could analyze and run simulations.\nThe \"Wisdom Master\" talent gave the user great wisdom, which helps in innovating and discovering new things.\nThe third talent was \"Soul Plucker.\"\nThis talent was the most important part of this demigod, as it allows it to pluck the soul of any life form into the Divine Library for a fixed amount of time.\nIn this time, the life forms can learn many things from this library. After giving the demigod these talents, Sunny named him \"Isiah.\"\nWith a single mental command, Isiah came to life. Suddenly, all of Veridia was covered with an intricate web of ethereal energy.\nThis was because of the \"Preserver of Knowledge\" talent; these intricate webs inserted a huge amount of knowledge into Isiah’s mind every second.\nSunny sent Isiah to take care of the Divine Library.\nThe Divine Library was situated in a subspace on Veridia, as Sunny could not place it directly inside the God Space, as it would create a huge time difference between Veridia and the library.",

      "content": "Chapter 52: Ch 52 : God of Games too?\nSunny considered giving Isiah the talent of seeing the future, but the sheer cost left him in shock.\nA price of several hundred billion faith points, and even with numerous restrictions, it still wouldn’t go below 50 billion.\nDeciding it was a task for a later time, Sunny added it to his to-do list.\nHe then instructed Thea to begin copying data from the worlds of other gods.\nWith her immense computational power, it was a task that felt like a walk in the park.\nThea’s task was to gather information on magic spells, body-strengthening techniques, forging methods, and every other piece of knowledge she could find.\nAs Thea acquired this information, Isiah’s \"Preserver of Knowledge\" talent would automatically absorb it, meticulously cataloging every detail into the Divine Library.\nThis would constantly feed the library with new techniques and wisdom from billions of worlds, a master plan to propel Veridia to the pinnacle of civilization.\nThe next step was to choose talented individuals from all the races and grant their souls temporary access to the Divine Library.\nThe news was first sent to the high priests of the humans and elves in the Citadel, who then shared it with all the life forms present. From there, the news spread back to Veridia and into every home and city.\nThe announcement of the Divine library created another huge influx of faith points for Sunny.\nAfter spending a few hundred million on the library and a billion on Isiah, Sunny still had over 13 billion faith points.\nWith his reserves still high, he created clone number eight for 1 billion faith points and then clone number nine for 10 billion, leaving his reserves at a mere 1 billion.\nHe wasn’t worried, knowing it would take only a few hours to replenish.\nFeeling a sudden wave of boredom, Sunny sighed. \"I miss my novels. If there were some games to play, I wouldn’t get bored so easily.\"\nHe slapped his head at the thought.\nBoth of these things were easy for him to create.\nHe called Thea, and she manifested before him.\nHe transferred the mechanisms of countless games he had played and heard of back on the Blue Planet.\nHe also transferred the data for a novel-reading application, where authors could write and interested readers could enjoy their work.\nHe created one billion instances of Thea, dedicated solely to the games, as he knew billions of gods playing at once would require a massive amount of computational power.\nWithin moments, Thea had created a vast array of offline and online games.\nThe online games worked on a simple principle: a player’s move would be instantly sent to all other players in the game.\nSunny and his two clones started with a few board games like chess and poker.\nThe games worked without a keyboard, mouse, or monitor; they were played through the system panel with mental commands and thoughts.\nThe experience was strange, yet exhilarating.\nHe then tested battle royale and RPG games, where players moved according to their will. Sunny even began to imagine a game where gods could fight each other using their thoughts.\nAfter thorough testing, he instructed Thea to place all the games in a new section called \"Games\" on the system panel.\nHe would charge the gods a small amount of faith to buy a game and a monthly membership fee, with options for in-game purchases.\nFive minutes later, all the gods who were using the system’s chat found a \"maintenance break\" message.\nAn info button was also available to explain the reason for the maintenance.\nWhen the gods saw why the system was down, their eyes bulged with excitement.\nFor all the gods who had played games back on the Blue Planet, it felt like their life had returned to them.\nIn just one or two minutes, the system was back online.\nThe brief break had been for Thea to run trillions of simulations on each game to check for any bugs, a task that would have taken years on the Blue Planet.\nThis was a clear demonstration of Thea’s immense computational power.\nImmediately, many gods bought their favorite games, such as \"Clash of Tribes,\" \"Honor of Emperors,\" \"BUBG,\" and \"Call of Work.\"\nBattle royale games were the bestsellers, and Thea’s advanced algorithm provided personalized suggestions to each god based on their personality and preferences.\nThis, in turn, encouraged gods to buy more games they might never play for long.\nMany new games were also developed by Thea based on Sunny’s descriptions, with new titles being published every few minutes, but the old classics still generated the most revenue.\nIn just one hour, over 50 billion faith points were generated. Sunny, along with Zir, Nyx and Reflection, joined a battle royale game.\nThe battlefield was an ancient forest, and each player had gears like grappling hooks, ropes, and knives for survival.\nThere were 100 squads in a single match. Sunny, playing as the scout, sensed someone approaching as they were about to build a fire.\nHe stopped everyone and pointed in the direction of the noise.\nNyx, the squad’s mage, used perception magic and found eight people encircling them, realizing they were facing two teams at once.\nWith his clones, two of whom had been constantly practicing fighting techniques, Sunny’s mind was a wellspring of battle knowledge.\nHe gave instructions to his team and then used his ability to hide in the darkness, silently approaching two of the enemies.\nHe quickly dispatched them, bringing his kill count to 36.\nHe then looked toward his teammates and saw Reflection, their tank, fighting four opponents alone.\nReflection’s HP was draining at a visible pace, while Zir, the healer, was desperately trying to keep him alive.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by\nSunny sneaked behind the enemy mages and swiftly eliminated them.\nNow, the fight was a four-on-four. Sunny decided to let his teammates shine a bit, as he already had 38 kills.\nIf all went well, he could even get 50 kills in this match.\nThey soon dealt with the remaining enemies, Zir and Reflection panted heavily. \"Players are teaming up with each other,\" Nyx said. \"Should we also find another team to join forces with?\"\n\"I don’t think we should,\" Reflection replied, his voice calm despite the recent battle. \"I’m learning a lot about battle and how to use different tactics. This could surely help my life forms against the demons.\"\nSunny heard this and his mind quickly went back to the time when he created Thea.\nHe thought to himself that it was a great idea to also give his life forms and demigods access to the system.",

      "content": "Chapter 53: Ch 53 : Small Battle\nFor the next several hours, Sunny was completely engrossed in the newly created gaming universe, playing one battle royale game after another with his friends: Zir, Nyx, and Reflection.\nEach game offered a unique and thrilling experience, a welcome escape from the grand responsibilities of being a god.\nThey fought in different themed worlds—a primordial forest where only bare-handed combat was allowed, a fantastical land where magic and enchanted blades reigned supreme, and a desolate wasteland where guns and advanced weaponry were the only means of survival.\nIn a particular game set in a post-apocalyptic cityscape, Sunny found himself sprinting across a collapsing skyscraper, his heart pounding in his chest.\nThe virtual wind whipped past him as he executed a perfect slide under a hail of laser fire.\nHis hands, or rather his mental commands, moved with the precision of a master gamer.\nHe felt a deep sense of satisfaction, a simple joy he hadn’t experienced since becoming a god.\nThe games weren’t just entertainment; they were a training ground.\nHe was learning to think and react faster, to strategize, and to coordinate with his team with a level of synergy that would be impossible in real life.\nThis experience, he realized, was invaluable.\nEach victory and defeat gave him a deeper understanding of tactical warfare, a knowledge he could one day impart to his life forms.\nThe thought further fueled his determination to give them access to the system.\nAfter a six-hour gaming binge, Sunny, with a triumphant smirk, exited the gaming tab and entered the God Chat.\nThe chat was buzzing. Praises for him flowed like a river, with gods expressing their gratitude for the return of a simple, forgotten pleasure.\nMany Gods, who had been writers in their previous lives, were particularly grateful for the novel-wrinting and reading application.\n\"This is a masterpiece, a true blessing!\" one god wrote.\nAnother said, \"I have been waiting for an application like this for all my life. Thank you, God Cosmos!\"\nSeeing the excitement, Sunny asked Thea to add a new tab to the system called \"Ideas and Feedback.\"\nHe wanted the gods to be able to give their own suggestions for new games, features, or report any bugs they found.\nThe response was immediate, with a torrent of new ideas flooding the tab within minutes.\nThe entire God Chat community was now a bustling, thriving marketplace of creativity and engagement, all thanks to Sunny.\nMeanwhile, in the Realm of Advancement, the situation for the demons had gone from bad to worse.\nThe combined armies of Veridia, a powerful alliance of humans, elves, and all the other races, were a sight to behold.\nVel’s mages, standing on a raised platform, rained down a continuous bombardment of elemental magic.\nFireballs, lightning bolts, and ice shards streaked across the battlefield, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake.\nBelow them, Anaske’s melee fighters, a disciplined and well-organized force, clashed with the demonic horde.\nThe clang of steel against rock-hard flesh, the roars of the demons, and the war cries of the soldiers created a deafening symphony of battle.ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nThe other races, each fighting with their own unique strengths, added to the chaos.\nThe Titans, massive creatures with incredible strength, were a formidable force.\nThey tore up huge boulders from the ground and hurled them into the demon ranks, crushing dozens of foes with a single throw.\nTheir roars alone were enough to send shivers down the spines of the weaker demons.\nThe giants, with their brute force, acted as living battering rams, breaking through the demon lines and creating openings for the smaller, more agile races like the orcs and fairies to exploit.\nThe orcs, with their natural ferocity, fought with a primal rage, while the fairies, though small, used their speed and light magic to confuse and blind their enemies.\nThe Dragonborn were a force of nature. Despite being only thirty in number, they were everywhere at once, a blur of motion and raw power.\nTheir dark scales seemed to absorb the blows of the demons, and their claws and fiery breath decimated their foes.\nWhenever a soldier was about to fall, a Dragonborn would swoop in, a blur of obsidian and fire, and save them.\nThey were like a living shield, a promise of Nova’s protection in the heart of the battle.\nTheir actions solidified their role as the protectors of Veridia, a path they had chosen to honor their mother, Nova.\nThe battle raged for what felt like an eternity, but in the end, the sheer diversity and tactical brilliance of Veridia’s forces proved to be too much.\nThe three demon tribes were completely annihilated.\nThe victory was a massive moral boost, and it paved the way for the life forms of Veridia to expand their territory in the Realm of Advancement.\nThe humans, with their vast numbers and innovative weaponry, emerged as the most dominant race, with the elves following closely behind due to their magical prowess.\nThe Titans, with their raw power, earned the third spot.\nThe other races, far from being jealous, looked at the top three with respect, having witnessed firsthand the massacre they had caused.\nThe casualties in Veridia’s army were miraculously low. Only three soldiers died in the entire battle.\nThe Dragonborn, however, were shattered. Despite saving thousands, they felt a deep sense of failure.\nThe deaths of those three soldiers, no matter how small the number, felt like a personal failure.\nNo one blamed them, but they blamed themselves, a deep-seated sense of responsibility instilled in them by Nova.\nAs the smoke cleared and the cheers of victory echoed across the battlefield, the demigods congratulated their respective races.\nSuddenly, Morticia, the S-Grade Veilborn leader, manifested in a wisp of white mist and floated toward the Citadel.\nHer intention was to offer her congratulations, but her path was immediately blocked by Thalorax, the leader of the Dragonborn.\nThalorax, a massive figure of muscle and obsidian scales with humanoid body, stood his ground, his fiery eyes fixed on the demon.\nHis five S-grade talents—super strength, magic affinity, space affinity, elemental defense, and physical defense—made him an almost unbeatable foe.",

Just go away,\" Adam replied, his mental focus still on the virtual crops he was meticulously tending to.\nSunny’s patience, though immense, was not infinite. \"Thea, cut down his system access and delete all his in-game achievements,\" Sunny said playfully, intending to tease Adam.\n\"Stop! Stop!\" Adam’s mental scream was loud and clear.\nHe reluctantly set aside his system panel and looked at Sunny, a deep sigh of resignation escaping his lips. \"Fine, I’m talking. You would’ve found out sooner or later. It’s the doing of the demon of discord, Deimos. He gets his power from creating discord between others, and for that, he uses mental magic on his life forms to make them attack other races.\"\nAdam didn’t clarify any further, diving back into his game with a renewed sense of urgency, leaving Sunny with a chilling new reality to ponder.\nThere was a greater enemy out there, a demon God who thrived on chaos and conflict.\nSunny was aware of this demon, as Adam had told him about Deimos during their history lessons, but seeing the actual work of this demon, which sent entire races into a state of chaotic bloodlust, was an eye-opener.\nThis was just the beginning, as more and more demons would not be able to bear these voices and would attack the life forms of other Gods.\nSunny, now fully aware of the threat, immediately notified all the other gods about Deimos’s influence.\nHe saw them not as competition but as fellow beings in a universe threatened by a parasitic entity.\nThey were, in a way, his cattle, providing him with faith points, and he would not see them fall prey to this.",

With the small distance between Veridia and the God space, Sunny could directly teleport anything within his territory to a demigod in Veridia for a small fee.\nThis system shop would further create competition, as demigods of the races would strive to earn merits to buy new items, further increasing their strength and capabilities.\nThis would not only benefit Sunny but would also rapidly accelerate the progression of Veridia.\nIn just a few minutes, everything was set.\nSunny talked to all the demigods, explaining the new system and asking them to share this information with their life forms.\nThe response was immediate and overwhelming.\nFamilies whose some members were in the Realm of Advancement and others back on Veridia were now using the video call feature, their faces lighting up with joy and relief.\nThe chat function was filled with countless messages, a cacophony of greetings and expressions of wonder.\nAll this costed Sunny a few faith points every second, but it was still more than what was generated by the life forms.\nAfter one hour, Sunny looked at his nine clones with his God’s eyes.\nThree were diligently learning magic, three were practicing battle techniques, and the last three were the watchful eyes of Veridia.\nHe then shifted his gaze to Veridia itself, and two topics were the most prominent among the life forms.\n\"The Genesis\" had become the holy book of Veridia.\nIt was shown to the high priests of both humans and elves, and from there, they began to promote it as a holy book, a sacred text that detailed the creation of their world.\nThis was all under Sunny’s expectations. But the second topic, the \"Race Wars\" game in the system, was not.\nThe game was designed by Thea upon witnessing the deep thoughts of the life forms in Veridia.\nIt was a clear sign that, even though all the life forms in Veridia were fighting against the foes together, infighting were inevitable.\nAnd this infighting could be resolved in the race wars game.\nEvery race knew that life was the most important gift bestowed upon them by God Cosmos, and taking the life of other life forms would cause chaos in Veridia.\nUpon all these considerations, Thea created this game, where she would fully scan the body and all the talents of a life form and thus create a digital avatar in the game.\nThis avatar would be controlled by the life form through their mind, like a 100% simulation virtual game.\nThere were individual fights available, and even whole race battles, where each one of\nraces would fight against the others.\nThere were battle royales among races and many other features.\nSunny decided to let it be, as this would increase their experience.\nHe even took it one step further and decided upon the ranking of the races in the \"Race Wars\" game, which further fueled the motivation for all the life forms.\nSunny then decided to go to one corner of his God space, where two prison cells suddenly appeared.\nThese prisons were specifically made to confine the demigods.\nIn these two cells, Aerion and Rina were confined. Without Sunny’s permission, they couldn’t even move a single muscle, and the mental connection with Kairos was also suspended due to these cells.\nSunny walked towards the cells, and he manifested a Divine Embryo.\nHis thoughts were clear today; he already had the idea for the shape, role, and name for this demigod.\nThe embryo manifested into a three-headed hound. In place of its tail, there was a snake. It had a gigantic body with bulging muscles. It was half the size of the Titans, which was enormous.\nIts face and body both looked ferocious, which instilled deep fear in someone who looked at this menace.\nSunny then decided on its talents.\nThe first was \"Guardian of the Netherworld,\" which creates a world inside this demigod that can keep a soul alive for eternity.\nThis sounds a lot like immortality of the soul, but this amazing talent had one great restriction: all the souls would always be tormented there.\nThis restriction worked as a new talent in its own right.\nSunny wanted this result from the start as he wanted to collect the souls of all the enemies and life forms of Veridia who committed heinous crimes.\nThese crimes would be judged by Thea. This netherworld would be a living hell for all the souls that were captured there.\nThe second talent was \"Poison Master,\" which would give this demigod knowledge of the most potent poisons and allow him to further torment the souls using them.\nThe third talent was \"Super Strength,\" (no need to elaborate, it is similar to Nova (but size matters))\nThe fourth talent was \"Reaper of Souls,\" which allowed this demigod to take any soul from Veridia and capture it in the Netherworld.\nAll these talents cost just over 2 billion faith points, which was mostly due to the \"Guardian of the Netherworld,\" as this talent directly created a realm inside the demigod, which in turn was very costly.\nThen it came time to name this three-headed hound.\nSunny didn’t even think about it and directly said, \"Cerberus.\"\nJust then, as if listening to Sunny’s call, the eyes of Cerberus burned with fiery light, and he came to life.",

      "content": "Chapter 56: Ch 56 : Revenge on Kairos\nThe birth of a demigod happened in front of Rina and Aerion, which left both of them stunned.\nTheir eyes widened when Sunny gave the first task to Cerberus.\nEvery hair on their bodies stood up, a clear sign of a demigod’s intuition.\nThey felt their lives were in danger.\n\"Kill these two, and confine their souls in the part, in Netherworld where demigods are tortured,\" Sunny’s command was clear and ruthless.\nCerberus, without any questions, killed both Aerion and Rina with a flick of his hands.\nThis clearly showcased his super strength, but such a feat would have been impossible in a real fight, but in this prison, both Aerion and Rina were helpless.\nAfter their deaths, the matter was not over. Cerberus quickly opened his mouth.\nFor Sunny, it was like Cerberus was sucking in the air, but when Sunny looked through his God’s Eye, he saw that the souls, which were invisible to the naked eye, were being sucked inside Cerberus.\nCerberus got 2 million merit points from this. He was surprised, but Sunny immediately told him about the use of faith points.\nIf he needed an item with specific abilities or new elements, he could use faith points.\nSunny also explained that the System Shop consisted of many pre-made magical weapons, sci-fi weapons, and medicines. Cerberus nodded.\nThen, upon Sunny’s command, he descended to Veridia to collect the souls of those who were purely evil.\nThe law of life in all these worlds was similar: if a life form dies, its soul would reincarnate into a new body, be it an animal or a bug, with no previous memories.\nBut if one’s soul was captured, it wouldn’t be able to be reincarnated.\nif there were no souls that needed a body and the creature is born, the law of life will create new souls for that body.\nIf Cerberus kept on snatching the souls of the wicked, Veridia would then have new souls, which would have the possibility of becoming good people.\nSunny then used his God’s Eye talent on the bodies of both Aerion and Rina.\nThe lives of both of them flashed in his eyes.\nThe life of Rina was short, but it took a few more seconds for him to digest the entirety of Aerion’s life.\nThrough this, Sunny immediately knew the culprit behind this.\nThe reason behind using his God’s Eye now was also simple: Sunny couldn’t use his God’s Eye on a living demigod because of their defenses and the aura and protection of other gods.\nBut upon their death, the protection upon their bodies was gone.\nAnd as for why he hadn’t killed them when they were caught, it was also simple.\nSunny wanted these two to suffer for eternity.\nAerion had taken many lives, and if it hadn’t been for Loki’s timely arrival, Sunny’s life forms would also have been killed.\nSunny was not one to take a threat and not retaliate.\nThus, giving them eternal imprisonment was a fitting punishment for their crimes.\nAnd now, it was time for the real culprit to receive his punishment.\nSunny then asked Thea to create a video of these memories, from the creation of Rina to all her commands, with the exception of some of the scenes between the culprit and Rina.\nThe video also showed all of Aerion’s crimes and how he had killed many life forms in the Realm of Advancement.\nThe video, which was about 15 minutes long with all the necessary evidence, was released on the God Chat.\nThe God Chat erupted upon its release.\nMany gods didn’t know the real face of Kairos, but the gods in the Timeless Alliance were aware of his face, as they had held one video call meeting on the new system created by Sunny.\nAs the news was released, all the gods left Kairos’s alliance.\nUpon getting these notifications, Kairos was dumbfounded.\nHe checked the God Chat and found out the reason.\n\"This is fake! I haven’t done a single thing! Cosmos, stop fabricating lies! No one is going to believe you,\" Kairos typed frantically.\nHis only hope was that the gods would listen to his words, but the reaction was the opposite of what he had imagined.\nEvery god knew of Sunny’s power, and they didn’t believe he would stoop so low as to frame Kairos.\n\"I would believe you, Kairos, if you can show us your demigod right now,\" one god, who was initially in Kairos’s alliance, typed in the God Chat.\nUpon reading this, Kairos felt utterly lost.\nHe didn’t know how to get out of this situation.\nIn the end, he destroyed the particles that formed his system.\nThis disconnected him from all the other gods.\nNow, he was alone in this godly game.\nWhen all the gods saw that Kairos didn’t reply, they were further enraged.\nThey all began to trace back the paths of Aerion’s attacks to pinpoint the location of Kairos’s base in the Realm of Advancement.\nSunny felt amused as he saw all the ruckus.\nHe knew of Kairos’s decision to destroy his system from Thea, but not all of Thea’s particles were lost.\nSome escaped into Kairos’s world, of which Kairos was unaware.\nThe implications of this would be discussed in the future.\nCurrently, Thea was analyzing the buff requests sent by the demigods for their races and found that all the requests were the best they could ask for.\nThea was amazed at their thoughtfulness for their races.\nThe demigod of humans asked for Innovation, as technology had started to develop in the human empire.\nThe demigod of elves asked for Comprehension, as mages required high Comprehension to advance to a high grade.\nAnd all the other demigods of the races requested buffs according to their race’s role in Veridia.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nSunny then messaged his friends in his alliance to play some games, but found that Zir and Reflection were busy with the matters of the demon invasion and so on.\nHe wanted to help them with faith points but found no solution regarding the problem of trading and faith sharing.",

      "content": "Chapter 57: Ch 57 : Hope Butterfly\nSunny now had a tangible concept of hell within his world, represented by the existence of Cerberus.\nBut where there was punishment for the wicked, there must also be a reward for the good.\nCerberus was linked to death, so his counterpart should be a demigod of life.\nSunny made a mental note to implement this immediately, but first, he decided to play some games to clear his mind.\nThe memories from Aerion’s millions of years of life still lingered, a heavy and disturbing presence in his thoughts.\nHe decided that in the future, he would use a clone for such a task, as so much information at once was enough to give him headaches.\nBack on Veridia, life was evolving at a rapid pace.\nThorn was now over 180 years old, yet he still looked like a man in his forties.\nAs Sunny’s first chosen one, Thorn had never stopped his practice and was still trying to improve, but he had hit a wall at the pinnacle of C-Grade.\nFeeling a tinge of pity for the man, Sunny decided that the next talent he would copy would be \"Overgrowth,\" a talent that would let the lifeforms to grow past the limits of their talents.\nWith his faith points constantly increasing at a visible pace, he had over 55 billion faith points.\nMeanwhile, in a sprawling forest within the Realm of Advancement, millions of life forms were traveling together in a single, purposeful direction.\nThey stopped at noon every day to pray to a certain deity, and the rest of the time, they walked tirelessly, hunting for food and sleeping in shifts.\nTheir march had been going on for over six years for the newest members, and for the oldest among them, a staggering thirty years.\nBut none ever complained.\nThey simply kept following a single golden butterfly, as if it were leading them toward a promised utopia.\nThanks to the butterfly, they never faced any major danger, as it always took them on the safest routes, effortlessly guiding them through the treacherous landscape.\nFinally, after marching for so long, the life forms reached a city.\nIt was their first time seeing such a sight since they had started following the butterfly.\nThey knew instinctively that this was the location their deity had wanted them to reach.\nThe guards on the city wall, seeing the millions of people approaching, shouted at the top of their lungs, reporting the massive gathering to their superiors.\nSuddenly, three figures walked to the edge of the city wall.\nA human with a particularly strong presence stood out among the two others.\nThe other two were no less impressive; one was strong enough to cope with an S-Grade powerhouse, while the last was on the verge of reaching S-Grade himself.\nThis trio represented the strongest force in the city.\nWhen the millions of life forms a few kilometers away from the city walls saw these three, they felt a huge, towering pressure.\nThey immediately began to pray to their deity, and in a flash of brilliant light, the golden butterfly transformed into a gigantic serpentine dragon.\nAll the life forms, both inside and outside the city, immediately knelt upon witnessing the majestic form of the dragon.\nThe three strongest lifeforms of this city also knelt in reverence.\nThe dragon, floating in the air, spoke in a deep and commanding voice.\n\"These are my followers. Open the city gates and let them in. Let them feel the greatness of my master.\"\nThe city was small, only capable of accommodating a hundred thousand life forms, so it was not practically possible for all these millions of people to take shelter within its walls.\nBut no one dared to speak back to the dragon.\nThe city gates opened, and the dragon transformed back into a butterfly, floating serenely toward the castle in the city.\nThe city was the Citadel of Veridia, which was being expanded on a daily basis.\nThe three strong men on the walls were Anaske, now an S-Grade powerhouse after his breakthrough during the war on demons, Vel, who was also on the verge of a breakthrough, and Thalorax, who was still the strongest among them due to his Dragonborn bloodline.\nThe Dragonborn, however, had no intention of fighting for the highest position in Veridia, as their role was to be the protector race, shielding all others from outer foes.\nThe only option Anaske could think of was to allow these new life forms to enter Veridia.\nBut before doing anything, he consulted with the butterfly, which was floating in the throne room.\nThis butterfly was called the Hope Butterfly, created by Shenlong from the collective hope energy of the life forms: the hope for survival, the hope for a better place, the hope to live one more day, and the hope to one day meet the dragon that had saved them when they were in danger.\nShenlong had created this butterfly to show these lost life forms the way to the Citadel of Veridia.\nThese life forms were from the worlds of other gods, but in the Realm of Advancement, where dangers lurked everywhere, they had encountered strong demons or monsters.\nThe gods they had believed in never helped. Thus, these life forms began to distrust their gods.\nBut one day, Shenlong had saved them.\nThey wanted to follow him, but were unable to do so.\nShenlong, being a wise dragon, knew how to take advantage of this.\nHe decided to direct these life forms to Veridia, which would strengthen Veridia’s empire and also provide security to these poor souls.\nThat was how these millions of life forms had reached the Citadel of Veridia.\nUpon Anaske’s request, Shenlong found no objection.\nThus, it was decided that all these life forms would be transported to Veridia, where the humans would be sent to the northern continent, elves to the southern, all the beast folk to the western, and dwarves to the eastern.\nThe remaining races would also be transported to the western continent, as it was the largest.\nAnaske knew the Citadel of Veridia needed to be expanded as the life forms would keep on joining them every now and then because of the hope dragon.\nThis, in turn, would increase the size of the army residing in the citadel.Follow current novels on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt",

      "content": "Chapter 58: Ch 58 : system points\nWhile Sunny was busy playing some shooting games, his body suddenly swelled as if a huge amount of energy was entering his body.\nUpon closer inspection, he found out that he had become a B-Grade mage and a C-Grade body refining fighter.\nHis progression in both was increased by three times due to the clones, which made the breakthrough much easier.\nBut Sunny knew that as his rank increased, the time required for the next breakthrough would also increase.\n\"Maybe a few days to reach A-Grade and then a week to reach S-Grade, then a month or two to reach SS-Grade,\" Sunny deduced this from the speed of his breakthroughs.\n\"All the mages would pluck their hair out if they knew about this. Should I add it in Genesis?\" Sunny said jokingly.\nHe then decided to quit playing games and jumped towards the applications section.\nThere were many new apps created by Thea on the application tab, such as a to-do list, voice changer, video editor, image editor, Sapchat, Canvas Paint, an app to create videos using your thoughts, dating apps for the Gods, and many more applications.\nSunny opened an application made specifically to write and read novels.\nThere were currently more than a few hundred thousand novels in this application.\nMany of these only had five or six Chapters at most, but one novel caught Sunny’s eyes; it had more than 100 Chapters.\nSunny opened the novel and started reading.\nIt was a dungeon-based novel where Gods provided various blessings to humans, and the main character was blessed by a Shadow God, becoming a Shadow Necromancer.\nSunny binged the entire novel in just an hour.\nSunny knew how this God was able to write 100 Chapters in just one day.\nThis was written in planetary time, and the author used a lot of faith points to do it.\nSunny wanted to support the author by giving him faith points, but he had no way of doing so.\nThe faith points that Gods used on Thea directly reached Sunny as the master of Thea, but there was no vice-versa.\nThus, Sunny was not able to transfer faith points to anyone.\nSunny still wanted to provide support to the author, so he asked Thea to provide 1 million system points to this author.\nThe use of these system points was easy: anyone with these points could buy any product in the system, like games, in-game purchases, applications, etc.\nThey just needed to pay half the amount in faith points and the other half would be reduced from system points.\nBy doing this, both Sunny and the author were happy.\nThe author of that book thanked Sunny and directly uploaded the next hundred Chapters.\nSunny went back to reading mode and completed these 100 Chapters in just 40 minutes.\nAfter being a God for more than a week, Sunny finally felt good.\nHis hunger to read some good novels finally subsided.\nHe gave 1 million system points to the author again.\nIn one of the universes in the multiverse, a God named Blessed Soul was grinning from ear to ear.\nHe was currently chatting with his friends in a group.\nHe was boasting about getting a million system points from God Cosmos.\nHis group was named \"Writer’s Circle.\"\nAll the members here were writers and discussed frequently.\nBlessed Soul even told them about how to use the concept of planetary time to write more Chapters in a single day.\nMany just called him stupid, because writing a novels was their passion, but no one was willing to spend their hard-earned faith on writing a novel.\nThey felt happy even if they wrote in their God space with only a few Chapters a day.\nBut now, upon hearing the news of God Cosmos gifting one million faith points to Blessed Soul, they felt that the faith he spent was worth it.\nSome of them also decided to write a novel in their world, thinking, \"What if God Cosmos notices our novels too?\" But some of them were still not willing to gamble.\nJust then, Blessed Soul received another notification.\n[God Cosmos gifted 1 million system points to the 200th Chapter of your novel ’Blessings’] (what a loyal fan).\nHe shared the screenshot within his Writer’s Circle group.\nThe Gods who were still hesitating decided to try writing in their planets too.\nDid Sunny waste two hours on reading a novel?\nNo, The first reason was that reading a novel would also make him remember the old days, which were his roots, that should never be forgotten.\nThe second reason was to get ideas for the improvement of his world.\nFrom reading novels, he can get ideas regarding how to manage the world, what talents should be given to the demigods, what type of weapons to manifest, etc.\nFrom the novel that Sunny just finished, he had an idea regarding two things.\nOne was the blessings by the Gods. Currently, Umbra can provide buffs on the life forms, but these are temporary.\nThe blessings would be permanent.\nThrough these blessings, life forms can have one or two talents of the demigod that blessed them.\nThe second thing Sunny liked from this novel was a dragon with space and time law.\nNova currently had an affinity for space, but since affinities cost very little, Sunny decided to give it the time affinity too.\nUpon Sunny’s command, Nova came to the God space.\nSunny flew in the air and placed his hands on Nova’s forehead.\nHe decided to give Nova ’time’ affinity.\nSuddenly, a large amount of faith was sucked from Sunny, a staggering 2 billion.\nIt was not a lot for Sunny, but the magic and space affinity had cost 50 thousand each, and this ’Time affinity’ directly reached 2 billion.\nSunny was dumbfounded, while Nova was still digesting her newfound abilities.\nSunny walked towards one house in the God space.\nHe hurriedly opened the door and directly looked at Adam.\nAdam was still sitting in the same position that Sunny had left him in and was still playing the same farming simulator game.\n\"Why did space and magic affinity cost 50 thousand while time affinity cost 2 billion?\" Sunny asked Adam without even giving Adam a single chance to speak.\nSunny knew that the more talents you have, the greater the price for the next talent, but according to Sunny’s calculation, it should have been just around 30 million, not 2 billion.",

      "content": "Chapter 59: Ch 59 : Approval\nAdam didn’t even bother to feign disinterest this time.\nHe saved his farming simulator game, the frustration from their last encounter still a fresh memory.\nHe turned his full attention to Sunny, a flicker of genuine curiosity in his ancient eyes.\n\"How many talents does your dragon even have?\" he asked, guessing correctly that Sunny’s questions were about Nova.\n\"Initially, she had eight,\" Sunny began, settling into a plush sofa that materialized for his comfort. \"But I removed two and gave a new one. So she was at seven. Now, with the Time Affinity, she’s back to eight talents.\"\nA knowing smile touched Adam’s lips. \"That explains it. There are many factors at play here, young one.\"\n\"First, the multiple talents of your Nova. Each talent, especially one based on a fundamental law, creates a resonance field. The more you have, the more complex and expensive it becomes to add another\"\n\"It’s a matter of harmonious integration, not just accumulation\"\n\"Second, there’s the inherently aloof and volatile nature of the Time Law itself. It’s not a law that likes to be controlled or confined\"\n\"I also had a hard time convincing the Time Law to let me manipulate it to decrease the time in this space by ten thousand times\"\n\"What you all perceive as the world being ten thousand times faster is actually just this God space being ten thousand times slower.\"\nSunny listened intently, his mind absorbing this new, profound knowledge.\nHe could feel the sheer cosmic logic behind Adam’s words, a logic that transcended simple arithmetic.\nHe noted everything down, considering the day when he might be able to copy the Time Affinity himself.\n\"And the third reason,\" Adam continued, his voice taking on a more serious tone,\n\"is the conflict of the laws. There are already two laws inside Nova. She has both the Law of the space and the Law of magic. These two are already in a delicate balance. If you were to add another, it would require a huge sum of faith to fuse all of them together, to prevent the new law from tearing her apart from the inside out.\"\nSunny nodded, the pieces of the puzzle clicking into place.\n\"Similarly,\" Adam said, a hint of mockery returning to his voice, \"there was already a huge field of the Time Law in your God space. If you were to give this affinity here, the price would definitely soar. You should have gone to Veridia to give this blessing to your demigod.\"\nSunny sighed, a feeling of helplessness washing over him. \"I didn’t know.\"The source of thɪs content is Novᴇ(l)Fɪre .ɴᴇt\nHe stood up and thanked Adam, his mind grappling with this new understanding.\nSome laws, it seemed, couldn’t be given to multiple people or in certain places.\n\"So that means I can’t create multiple Shenlongs or Nova’s. What a bummer.\"\nHe felt a sense of dejection upon this realization.\n\"Well, an elder at home is a blessing, indeed. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to understand a single thing by myself.\" Sunny praised Adam’s knowledge and experience in his mind.\nSunny walked over to Nova, who was still in a trance, digesting the new affinity.\nShe suddenly jolted back to awareness and bowed deeply to Sunny, a silent gesture of gratitude for the immense gift.\n\"Go on, show me your power,\" Sunny said, pointing in the direction of Veridia.\nNova nodded, a new gleam in her draconic eyes.\nShe used a time acceleration spell on Veridia.\nIn a blink of an eye, a whole year of Veridian time passed.\nThe world below became a blur of accelerated seasons and events.\nSunny was about to praise her, but just then, Nova lumped back to her original spot, her immense body falling with a thud.\nSunny walked in front of her and checked her condition. \"No mana left?\" he said in surprise.\nHe couldn’t believe the mana cost for this single acceleration spell.\nHe manifested a hundred SS-Grade mana fruits and fed them to Nova.\nImmediately, she returned to her peak condition.\nSunny asked her about the high cost of the spell.\n\"Master,\" Nova replied, her voice filled with earnestness, \"the spell I used increased the time speed by a thousand times in an instant. This drained all my mana, but if it’s just 10 times or so, I could maintain it infinitely.\"\n\"A thousand times?!\" Sunny felt a profound shock.\nHe ran a quick calculation in his mind. Veridia already ran 10,000 times faster than a regular world.\nA thousand times on top of that meant an astronomical increase.\nIt was clear Nova had pushed herself to her absolute limits to show her master her power.\nSunny then asked Nova to maintain a time acceleration of 10 times.\nShe did so immediately.\nJust then, Veridia went into a blur again.\nSunny couldn’t understand a single thing happening there.\nIt was like watching a movie at an impossible speed.\nHe now understood the positive and negative sides of this talent.\nBut Sunny was no ordinary God.\nHe used his God’s Eye to its utmost and was able to see everything normally.\nHe then asked his three watcher clones to use their God’s Eyes to keep their eyes on Veridia.\nBut just then, Sunny found a problem and asked Nova to stop immediately.\nNova didn’t question her master and immediately stopped using the time acceleration magic.\n\"The life forms inside the Realm of Advancement will have normal time, while those in Veridia will have fast time. This will create problems for them,\" Sunny thought.\nHe quickly found a major issue with his plan.\nHe didn’t want to become an unruly ruler.\nHe wanted to build and expand his empire with all of his demigods and lifeforms, not just do it all by himself.\nHe decided to ask for the approval of all the races.\nWhen the demigods of all the races came to know about this, and through them the life forms also came to know, a debate raged.\nThis was not just about the time difference between the population of Veridia and the Realm of Advancement; they could cope with that.\nThe biggest problem was the games.\nThey couldn’t play with each other due to the time difference.\nVideo and voice calls would also be nearly impossible.\nAll of this combined stopped many from approving this notion.\nBut still, after much deliberation, they decided to approve of it.\nThey reasoned that this would increase their development and strength much faster.\nThey trusted their God, Cosmos, to make the right decision for them. Sunny nodded upon this.\nHis entire talent was based on the time period of Veridia.\nIf it could be increased by 10x, then he could copy three talents a day, which would further increase his speed by a lot.\nSunny asked Nova to maintain the time acceleration at 10x until he could copy the Time Affinity from her and learn the Time Acceleration magic himself.",

      "content": "Chapter 60: Ch 60 : God of Entertainment\nIt was the 17th hour of the 8th day since Sunny had ascended to godhood, and the world of Veridia was thriving in ways he had never imagined.\nIt wasn’t merely flourishing with one or two races, but a vibrant tapestry of many, each with their own unique benefits and inherent shortcomings.\nWith the addition of mana veins, countless new talents specifically for magic began to appear.\nConcurrently, technological advancements spurred the emergence of talents rooted in technology.\nThe Divine Library, which held the collective knowledge of billions of worlds, was a wellspring of innovation.\nThough it expanded day by day, Isiah and Thea managed its complexity with effortless efficiency.The source of this content ɪs\nDaily, one or two souls from Veridia were summoned to the subspace where the divine realm resided, where they absorbed vast amounts of knowledge useful for their world.\nThrough these new systems, talents in the fields of science also began to make a powerful appearance in Veridia.\nAs Veridia expanded and strengthened in both his home world and the Realm of Advancement, the dangers increased in equal measure.\nThe ever-growing presence of Veridia in the Realm of Advancement had not gone unnoticed, and many demon empires had begun to launch attacks.\nBut this opposition only served to fuel the motivation to Sunny’s lifeforms.\nThe new life forms born in Veridia were increasingly endowed with innate fighting talents, turning every confrontation into a crucible of growth.\nVeridia was now playing on a grand scale, excelling in both magical and technological fields, supported by many races, numerous demigods, and a powerful God they all called Cosmos.\nAmong all of Sunny’s demigods, the most unburdened was currently Cerberus.\nHe simply roamed Veridia and the Realm of Advancement, a silent, menacing shadow.\nAt present, none of Sunny’s life forms were truly wicked; the population was still small, and the demigods kept a watchful eye on everyone.\nBut Sunny knew that as the population swelled in the future, the number of wicked and evil people would inevitably rise.\nPerhaps then, Cerberus would finally have his hands full.\nAll the other demigods were occupied with their duties.\nNova was busy defending Veridia, her time acceleration magic a constant hum in the background of their existence.\nUmbra was stationed in the Realm of Advancement, a stealthy protector against any possible danger to the new life forms.\nShenlong, meanwhile, was diligently working to save races scattered across the Realm of Advancement, leading them back to Veridia with the guidance of the Hope Butterfly.\nLoki, on the other hand, was currently in a demonic empire.\nHe was working as the butler of a higher-tier demon demigod, a creature far beyond his current power.\nLoki had used his formidable disguise talent to turn into the butler of this DemiGod, and had been stuck with this particular fiend for over a month.\n\"Oh, master, help me,\" Loki’s constant mental messages were filled with a mixture of exasperation and genuine despair.\nSunny’s reply was casual and amused. \"Well, who told you to dive so deep into a demon empire? I already warned you, but you didn’t listen.\"\n\"Master, I was wrong! Please, send brother Shenlong or sister Nova!\" Loki pleaded, desperately wanting to leave the hellhole he had gotten himself into.\n\"I believe in your disguise. Just stay there for a few more months as your punishment. I will send Nova to help you after that,\" Sunny replied, cutting off the mental connection.\nHe wasn’t worried about Loki.\nAs One of his clones was constantly watching over the mischievous demigod.\nIf anything truly happened, Nova could immediately use her time and space laws to teleport to the empire and help him.\nSunny then added a new item to the demigods’ System Shop, a masterstroke he had been conceptualizing for a while.\nThe item was:\n[Talent Name: Blessings]\nGrade: SS\nDescription: The demigods can bless their life forms. The blessings will be a talent of the demigod. It would require merit points to give blessings to the life forms.\nCost: 1 billion merits]\nNote : if you don’t understand what it means is, the talents of Demigods can be given to the lifeforms as blessings, but they need to first buy this talent and then further use their merit points to give their blessing to a lifeform.\nEvery demigod of a race felt an immediate, primal need to acquire this talent.\nThey were constantly competing with the other races, and the ability to give a permanent version of their talent to a life form using merits was a powerful, practical tool.\nAnd currently, earning merits was relatively easy for them.\nNova only needed to protect Veridia; the more demons she killed, the higher her bonus.\nUmbra’s merits were tied to her success in protecting the life forms in the Realm of Advancement.\nShenlong’s merits were directly related to the amount of faith he generated and the number of life forms he brought to Veridia.\nLoki, well... he was earning merits by infiltrating and gathering intelligence from the demonic empire.\nThea, as Sunny’s secretary and the system that kept her eyes on the entire multiverse, didn’t require merits; she had special privileges to ask for anything from Sunny.\nIsiah earned merits by taking care of the library and summoning the souls of life forms every now and then.\nCerberus earned merits by confining and torturing the souls of evil and wicked life forms.\nAs for the demigods of the races, they earned merits if any of their race developed a new technology or magical technique, fueling an internal competition that benefited everyone.\nNow, Sunny just needed to wait for a demigod to earn 1 billion faith points and buy this talent.\nUntil then, he decided to play some games with Zir, Nyx, and Reflection.\nSince the time on Veridia was currently 10x accelerated, Sunny could copy his next talent at the end of the 8th day.\nFrom then on, he could copy three talents a day at eight-hour intervals.\nPlaying games with his friends was a way for him to feel like he was back on his old blue planet, a brief escape from the weight of godhood.\nAfter playing for four hours, he decided to go through some books to get cool and overpowered ideas for his future demigods.\nAs Sunny opened the application for novels, he was astounded to find that most of the new novels currently had more than 100 Chapters.\nThat wasn’t the end of it, though.\nMany gods who, like Sunny, enjoyed reading novels were now using their faith points to provide system points for the authors.\nThis, in turn, generated another wave of faith points for Sunny.\nHe smiled, realizing that his little side-project was not only entertaining bored gods but also creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of creative energy that directly translated into power for him.\nThe God Chat was a testament to his success, overflowing with discussions about the novels and the generosity of God Cosmos.\nSunny was not just a God of a world; he was becoming a God of entertainment, and the multiverse was loving it.",

It was an unacceptable risk.\nThe idea was a dead end.Follow current novels on\nJust as he was deep in thought, a fundamental flaw in his plan surfaced.\n\"How can those Gods even create a Demigod when I can’t trade the divine embryo?\" Sunny sighed, his five minutes of intense brainstorming rendered utterly useless.\nFrustrated, Sunny tried to come up with new ideas, but his mind drew a blank.\nHe even consulted Isiah and Thea, but they, too, were stumped.\nHe spent the next half hour meticulously reviewing all his knowledge of faith and its workings, trying to find a loophole, a hidden path, a divine shortcut.\nJust as he was about to give up, a half-baked idea flickered to life in his mind, a whisper of possibility.\nIt was a long shot, a leap of faith, but it was the only option left.\n\"What if... it works?\" he whispered to himself, a spark of hope igniting.\nHe called Thea and placed his hand on her ethereal, projected body.\nHe then began channeling his immense faith into her, a new talent forming in his mind, a divine talent being written into her very essence.\nHe named the talent God’s Manifestor.\nThis ability would allow any God to give faith points to Thea, who could then use them to manifest anything they desired.\nThe catch was that Thea would retain the final say in whether or not to manifest the item.\nThe talent came at an exorbitant price, costing Sunny over 40 billion faith points.\nThe cost was inflated due to his own existing manifestation talent and the inherently volatile nature of manifestation law, which made it difficult for multiple people to control it.\nBut Sunny didn’t care about the price; if this worked, he would be swimming in faith points, a constant, unending flow of divine currency.\nHe was betting on a grand return on his investment.\nAs Thea absorbed the complex knowledge of her new talent, the systems of every God across Veridia went offline, displaying a \"maintenance break\" message with no further explanation.\nThe multiverse held its breath, unknowingly, as a new power was being forged.\nSunny waited patiently, confident that Thea would master this new ability far quicker than he ever could.\nDemigods will have an innate understanding of their talents, while he had to painstakingly uncover the knowledge on his own.\n\"Life as a God is... tough,\" he sighed, leaning back on his throne, a small smile playing on his lips, the weight of his divinity a familiar, heavy cloak.\nSlowly, Thea’s projected eyes opened, shimmering with a new, profound light.\nSunny, eager to test the new talent, asked her to manifest a robe and a mask for him.\nWithout hesitation, she created a sleek robe and a mask, which were identical to his but packed with hidden abilities far beyond what he could have imagined.\nThea’s deep analysis of his preferences and choices allowed her to manifest something perfectly suited to his tastes, a testament to her newfound power and her loyalty.\nThe successful test confirmed his hopes.\nNow, Sunny was sure his plan would work. He immediately instructed Thea to restart the system with a new tab: Cosmic Shop.\nHis Faith reserves were about to get a major upgrade.\nHe clicked on the new tab on his system, and there it was—a vast marketplace designed like a modern online shopping app, complete with search and price filters. Millions of items from every corner of the multiverse were listed, each one meticulously analyzed and cataloged by Thea.\nTo test it, Sunny ordered an SS-Grade fruit, which cost him 500 faith points.\nAs soon as the order was completed, 400 faith points were returned to him.\nThis was the genius of his plan.\nThe shop worked on a simple principle: any item a God purchased would be manifested from the system of that God, but at a cost five times greater than what was required for its manifestation.\nThis would create a new, immense source of faith points for Sunny.\nHowever, he had no intention of keeping all of it; he was already planning for a future grand scheme that would require a vast amount of faith.\nThe Cosmic Shop was not just a business; it was the foundation for a much larger project.\nJust then, the eighth day ended, and it was time for Sunny to select his next talent.\nHis gaze fell upon a modern home in his God space, where Adam was engrossed in a new game called Thieflox.\nThis game featured mini-games designed by other Gods and even had a multiplayer mode.\nSunny decided to copy Adam’s talent, Overgrowth.\nAs the familiar sensation washed over him, he felt a powerful, invisible energy coursing into his body once again.",

How? Why?\" Sunny’s mental voice echoed with genuine shock.\nHe had simply copied a talent that was supposed to make his lifeforms’ talents a tier higher, a boon for their development.\nBut this... this was something entirely different.\nThe potential of this talent was staggering.\nHe imagined a day when all his lifeforms would become demigods, their enhanced talents providing him with a colossal stream of faith points.\nThis talent meant his people would no longer be limited by their inborn potential, but could grow based on their own efforts and desires.\nA born archer could become a master swordsman simply by training and having a desire to do so.\nIt was a revolution, a divine gift that would change the very fabric of his world.\nSunny was not one to do things anonymously.\nHe wanted his people to know the source of their good fortune.\nHe gave this information to the high priests of every race, and upon hearing the news, the entire population of Veridia erupted in a chorus of joyous praise.\nBut the most heartfelt reaction came from Thorn, the wise human leader who had been stuck at C-Grade for 250 years, with only 200 more years left to live.\nThe Divine Growth talent was a lifeline, a new chance for him to reach B-Grade and increase his lifespan to 1,000 years.\nThe next few hours were the best of Sunny’s divine life.\nThe Gods were praising God Cosmos for the Cosmic Shop, which had revolutionized their tedious existence, while his life forms were showering him with gratitude for the Divine Growth talent.\nSunny didn’t play any games or read a single novel.\nHis entire focus was on the growing number of faith points and the learning of new talents in Veridia.\nThe time acceleration was set to a staggering amount—8 hours for him would be 100 years for them.\nIt had been 50 years in Veridia, a period that became known as the Great Technological Boom.\nThe first five years were a period of intense study as humans tried to uncover the concepts of engines they had seen in the Divine Library.\nThen, it happened.\nThe talents for \"Engineering Machines\" began to appear, directly tied to the new knowledge.\nThis talent was what helped them to truly understand and innovate in the field.\nIn the 20th year, the first stream engine was created.\nThe human demigod earned a huge amount of merits for that, which spurred the other demigods to push their races to produce similar results.\nA new collaboration began.\nThe elves, with their deep understanding of mana, proposed using it as a power source instead of steam.\nThe dwarves, masters of craftsmanship, used the elves’ blueprints to create the first mana engine.The source of this content ɪs NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nThe demigods of both races earned a massive chunk of merits, fanning the flames of friendly competition.\nAll over Veridia, races began to produce items they were best at.\nPixies created stardust, a magical dust that came in different colors, each providing a unique boost to the user.\nThe stronger the pixie, the more potent the effect.\nGiants, with their innate strength, became masters of brutal combat and large-scale construction, building new cities in both Veridia and the Realm of Advancement.\nThe Titans, with their enormous size, decided to live in the mountains.\nThey graciously refused the offers to live in cities, fearing they would accidentally crush a life form in a moment of inattention.\nThe Machina Race was currently working on advancing the next generation even more, incorporating powerful inbuilt weapons with the help of the dwarves and humans.\nMerfolks explored the vast oceans, providing valuable materials and resources.\nThe Beastfolks assisted other races according to their talents, their natural abilities a perfect complement to technology.\nFairies, with their light magic, worked as exorcists, using their magic to cleanse any traces of demonic energy from Veridia.\nAs per Sunny’s command, Nova was only allowed to kill the demigod of the demon race and leave the rest for the life forms to kill.\nThis had become a daily training exercise, with the Dragonborns proving to be the most proficient demon slayers.\nWhile all this was happening in Veridia, the population was also increasing at a huge rate every year.\nAccording to Sunny, it wouldn’t be long before their interstellar journey began.\nBut before that, he needed to plant a core idea in their minds: that Veridia was just a small ground, and the entire universe was theirs to conquer.\nFor that, he turned to the Divine Library.\nNow, many books talked about the conditions and resources of different planets and universes.\nHe knew that the next step was to unite all the races and form an empire.\nThis was made easier by the fact that all the races already worked together in the Realm of Advancement.\nIn the third hour of the ninth godly day, the Cosmic Empire was born.\nThe rules and regulations were still imperfect, but they were being changed and evolved through the combined discussion of all the races, a true democratic union.\n\"Almost there,\" Sunny whispered to himself, a feeling of anticipation coursing through his veins.\nHe looked at the long list of numbers in front of him, the number that represented the culmination of all his efforts.\n[Faith Points: 99,999,999,142]",

      "content": "Chapter 63: Ch 63 : Limit Break\nA wave of pure, triumphant power washed over Sunny as his faith reserves crested the hundred-billion mark.\nThe number felt monumental, a concrete symbol of his burgeoning influence.\nThe last 79 billion had been accumulated in just four hours, a speed that was both exhilarating and sobering.\nHe realized he could now generate a hundred billion in just five hours, but even this immense power wasn’t enough for the grand scheme brewing in his divine mind.\nDespite the ever-increasing pile of faith, he decided to spend a significant portion of it on a new demigod.Follow current novels on ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nHis world, Veridia, had a demigod to handle death and wickedness in Cerberus, but it lacked a demigod to complete the other half of the cycle: life.\nA philosophical idea struck him—a duality of existence, two sides of the same coin.\nHe took a single Divine Embryo and, with a thought, divided it into two distinct bodies. One male, one female.\nThey manifested as breathtakingly beautiful figures, with bodies sculpted like marble and a serene grace that radiated with a soft, warm light.\nTheir skin was ethereal, their eyes the color of a clear sky, and from their backs grew a pair of brilliant white wings, each feather shimmering with divine energy.\nThey were beings of pure life energy, a perfect counterpoint to the terrifying figure of Cerberus.\nAs for their talents, Sunny made them a perfect, albeit opposite, match to the Guardian of the Netherworld.\nGuardian of Heaven (SSS-Grade): This talent allowed them to have a connected pocket world within their divine being, a sacred space to store the souls of the righteous.\nThis talent was far more expensive than Cerberus’s because it had no restrictions on the enjoyment of the souls.\nThis was a true utopia, where a soul could enjoy all the luxury and peace it had ever wished for.\nSoul Plucker (SS-Grade): Similar to Cerberus’s talent, this allowed them to collect souls, but with a crucial difference.\nThey could only pick the souls of those with a pure heart and who had accumulated a huge amount of merit for Veridia.\nLight Affinity (SS-Grade): This talent granted them a profound affinity for light magic, allowing them to purify demonic energy, heal the sick, and guide the lost.\nAfterlife (SS-Grade): This unique talent allowed them to manage the afterlife of a soul.\nThose with immense merits in life could even be granted reincarnation or a chance at rebirth, a new beginning in a new body, or even a different race.\nWith these talents, the demigod of life was complete.\nSunny named the male figure Uranus and the female Gaia.\nBoth originated from the same divine embryo, so they shared an unspoken connection.\nThey could only perform their full powers when in close proximity, a testament to their shared origin.\nThis endeavor cost Sunny 5 billion faith points in total, a sum that felt like a mere tickle to his reserves.\nWith his mental command, both Uranus and Gaia came to life, and even when apart, it felt as if they were connected by some unseen, profound force.\nSimilar to Cerberus, Sunny ordered them to wander Veridia and begin their sacred task of collecting the souls of good life forms.\nAs this new creation was complete, Sunny decided to spend the next few hours indulging in the things he loved—playing games and reading novels.\nWhile he was busy, another race began to appear in his world.\nThey had the horns and fangs of a demon but the body of a human.\nThey were a demonic race, but because they were born in Sunny’s world, they were free from the mental magic of the Demon of Discord.\nThey were similar to other life forms, but with innate demonic powers.\nSunny knew that powers don’t define someone as good or evil; it’s the use of that power that matters.\nA priest can be corrupt, and a demon can be a virtuous being.\nIf he nurtured them well, this race would become one of the strongest due to their demonic lineage.\nThis task was left to Clone Watcher number two.\nAs Clone Watcher number one was busy with Loki’s predicament and Clone Watcher number three was focused on Veridia, clone number two created a new demigod for this race.\nThis new demigod would manage all the demonic races that would come under Sunny, similar to the Veilborn race.\nHe named the new demigod Diabolo.\nWith a talent similar to the other demigods of the races, Diabolo was tasked with leading this new race.\nThe demonic race was still unnamed, so Sunny decided to leave the naming to them.\nEven while immersed in a game, Sunny was acutely aware of everything happening in both the Realm of Advancement and Veridia.\nThe game he was currently in was one of Thea’s creations.\nIt was an open-world game with unlimited possibilities, filled with intelligent NPCs with various magical and technological abilities.\nThe game had a 99.9% realism factor; players could even feel pain and taste.\nThis worked only when a god gave Thea permission to do so.\nOtherwise, Thea couldn’t use a single particle to hurt a god or give them pain or taste through their nerves.\nMany gods were enjoying this game, as they could now truly connect with each other.\nSunny could even ask the gods to provide all the knowledge of the Blue Planet to Thea, which would help her recreate it virtually. Sunny decided to add this to his to-do list; gods would pay every penny to feel the air of their home planet again. Now that most of his immediate tasks were done, he just needed to collect the faith and start laying the cards for his grand plan.\nMeanwhile, in a magnificent castle in the Realm of Advancement, a meeting of the leaders from all over the races in Veridia was taking place. \"I am going to visit Veridia, as my father is about to break through to B-Grade,\" said Anaske, to the other leaders.\n\"I also need to visit Veridia for my breakthrough to S-Grade,\" Thalorax, the leader of Dragon born said in his cold and aloof tone.\nCurrently, Anaske was the leader of the empire.\nHis Celeste Royal family was still the strongest among the other races.\nMany members of the royal family had chosen to marry different beast folks, creating demi-humans that further mixed and enhanced their talents.\nSoon, races not physically capable of being partners with the royal family were also included in the royal family, making the Cosmic Empire a unique, harmonious blend of diverse races.\nThe Cosmic Empire was ruled by the Celeste Royal family, but this family was controlled by the joint voting of all the other races.\nDue to Anaske being the strongest, apart from Thalorax, he was chosen as the leader of the Cosmic Empire.\nAnaske wanted to return to Veridia as his father, Thorn, was attempting a breakthrough to B-Grade.\nThis would be the first occurrence of any life form in Veridia breaking their limits, a monumental event that marked a new era.",

I don’t think you would bring up a problem without a solution.\" Vel replied, hopeful that Eira would’ve a solution.\nEira offered a solution that sent a ripple of debate through the council. \"We could just ask the demigods for help.\"\n\"Are you forgetting the decree of the gods?\" Anaske repeated the clear and absolute law they all lived by.\n\"The gods have decreed that with the emergence of S-Grade powerhouses, they will only fight against demigods of the demonic race.\"\n\"I know that,\" Eira chuckled, a delicate sound like the ringing of a silver bell. \"I was just joking. We should ask for Morticia’s help.\"\n\"A demon?\" Vel’s voice was filled with skepticism. He was worried about the loyalty of Morticia, who had only recently joined their ranks.\n\"Even the gods have given her a chance, why shouldn’t we, the life forms, give her one?\" Eira reasoned with a serenity that calmed the tense atmosphere.\nFairies are born with the power of light and the ability to see the good and evil in beings. Eira saw no evil nature in Morticia.\nEventually, after a heated debate and a democratic vote, Eira’s suggestion won.\nThe decision was made: both Anaske and Thalorax were approved to leave, with Morticia designated as the temporary guardian of the empire.\nThe next day, both Anaske and Thalorax stepped through the shimmering portal that connected the Realm of Advancement to Veridia.\nThe air felt purer, cleaner, a stark contrast to the demon-tainted atmosphere they were used to.\nThey parted ways, with Anaske heading to the Northern Continent, the home of the humans, and Thalorax going to the Western Continent, the domain of the Dragonborns.\nAnaske arrived in the grand human capital, a city that looked like a marvel of engineering and magic.\nIts walls, with a beautiful marble sheen, were strong enough to withstand the force of an S-Grade powerhouse, and the city itself could house over a million people.\nThe moment Anaske stepped into the city, the entire population understood who he was.\nFor the youngsters, he was their hero, the one who had led the humans to their greatest heights.\nHe was the leader of the Cosmic Empire, a mythical figure brought to life.\nDue to the time difference, many of Anaske’s friends now looked old, and some had even passed away.\nThe new generation only knew him through the system’s social media applications.\nWhen he saw his father, Thorn, a lump formed in his throat.\nHis father looked much older and wiser, his face etched with the lines of time.\nThey spent precious moments explaining the situation of their respective realms.\nThe information on the system was often elusive and simplified for the masses; only those who fought the demons could truly understand the grim realities.\nSuddenly, Thorn’s body began to burn, and a sensation of pure energy coursed through him. He knew exactly what it was.\n\"The breakthrough,\" he whispered.\nAnaske, understanding the gravity of the situation, immediately helped him to the nearest empty cliff.\nA breakthrough was an incredibly sensitive process that couldn’t be disturbed, as it could cause a backlash that would kill the person.\nThorn sat cross-legged on the hill, his eyes closed.\nHe immediately tried to control the burning sensation according to the techniques he had received.\nA breakthrough to B-Grade usually took a minimum of one day and a maximum of three to four.\nMany demigods of Veridia and the surrounding areas came out of their hiding to keep an eye on this monumental event, the first of its kind in Veridia.Follow current novels on novᴇl(ꜰ)ire.ɴet\nSlowly, the first day passed. The breakthrough was near completion and required only a slight push.\nBut just then, a cold, mocking laughter echoed across the sky.\nThe sound was filled with so much malevolence that it seemed to twist the very air.\nEvery demigod came out from hiding, immediately surrounding Thorn and Anaske. Nova, sensing the immense spatial disturbance, teleported instantly to the location.\nThe space above the cliff ripped apart, and a figure, radiating pure menace, descended into the atmosphere of Veridia.\nUpon his arrival, the air around them felt tainted and heavy with demonic energy.\nThe pressure he exerted surpassed all the pressure combined from the other demigods present.\n\"Hello there,\" the figure said, his voice echoing in the minds of every living being. \"Let’s introduce each other first.\"\nThorn felt his ears burst from the sheer pressure of the voice, and the breakthrough failed, causing a catastrophic backlash that threatened to tear his body apart.\nThe human demigod, in a panic, used every elixir and herb he had to stabilize Thorn’s condition.\nAll the demigods present looked at the demon in horror, their expressions a mixture of fear and dread.\nSunny, who was currently checking the God Chat, was jolted from his peace.\nHe immediately used his God’s Eye to see the details of this new threat, and his own mind was hit with a shock he hadn’t felt since his Godhood started.\n\"197 talents?\" Sunny’s mental voice was a stunned gasp.\nHe didn’t even need to look at the name or the details of the talents; the sheer number was enough to make him understand the magnitude of the threat this demigod demon posed.",

      "content": "Chapter 65: Ch 65 : Xar’gath, the legion born\nSunny was about to descend, his divine body eager to enter Veridia, but the cold, logical voice of Thea made him stop.\n\"Master,\" she began, her tone a perfect blend of a loyal secretary\n\"according to the data from your last few visits to Veridia, and comparing it with the strength and intelligence of the life forms, I have calculated that with your current faith reserves...\"\nThea paused, and in that brief silence, Sunny felt a dramatic tension swell in his heart.\nHe was ready for a direct confrontation, but he needed a clear calculation of his power.\n\"...You would only be able to stay there for 100 seconds,\" Thea finally spat out the last words, her voice devoid of emotion, a stark contrast to the gravity of the situation.\n\"That’s still good,\" Sunny said, a hint of defiance in his voice. \"I can take care of him before that.\"\nHe was about to descend, but Thea’s voice stopped him once more.\n\"Master, currently there is a 90% chance of this demon perishing from your demigods,\" she stated, her words a calm, confident analysis of the situation.\n\"And the 197 talents are all due to his innate SS-Grade talent of Talent-Carrier. This talent allows him to use the talents of every being whose head he carries on his back. Though the weight of every head increases exponentially\"\nSunny decided to trust Thea’s judgment.\nHe knew that fighting a demigod was not fitting for a God, and Thea’s data-driven analysis was rarely wrong.\nBut he remained vigilant, ready to descend at a moment’s notice should a mishap occur.\nFor now, the fight belonged to the Demigods, and in the fights of gods, mortals always suffer.\nThorn, though his body was stabilized, was still under the constant, crushing pressure of the demon’s presence.\nNova, noticing this, immediately teleported Thorn, Anaske, and the human demigod to a distant, secure location.\nWith the lifeforms out of the battle ground.\nshe returned, her eyes blazing with determination.\nTime slowed to a crawl around Xar’gath, and in a flash, Nova was on him, her fist aimed directly at his face.\n\"Oh, time magic? That’s quite rare. I would take your head along with that talent of yours,\" the demon said, his voice a mocking growl that was somehow both bone-chillingly cold and full of manic glee.\nHe stopped Nova’s blow with a single hand and punched back with the other.\nNova immediately opened a portal where the demon was going to attack her, causing his hand to go through it instead of hitting her. Nova smirked and instantly closed the portal, severing the hand of the demon.\n\"Haha, even spatial magic too. You are truly a feast in my eyes,\" the demon said this but still stepped back to create distance, a flicker of genuine interest in his eyes.\nHis lost hand immediately regenerated back.\n\"I am Xar’gath, a Legion-Born,\" the demonic voice echoed, a name that struck a chord of cosmic horror in Sunny’s mind.\nSunny was astonished by the title \"Legion-Born.\" These were not just powerful demons; they were beings created by the Demonic Realm itself.\nThey were not gods, but they possessed the strength of a top-tier demigod from birth.\nThe demon’s very presence polluted the otherwise pristine air of Veridia.\nHis most striking and grotesque feature was the collection of pallid, screaming heads fused to his back.\nThese weren’t mere trophies; they seemed to be eternally suffering entities, their silent screams adding a layer of psychological horror to his already terrifying visage.\nLarge, curved horns jutted from his own masked head, the skull-like visage obscuring his true face and housing glowing red eyes that pierced the serene quiet of Veridia.\nHis body was a grotesque display of brute force, muscles unnaturally swollen and bruised with a purplish tint straining against tattered rags.\nOversized hands with brutal claws hung low, and hooved feet left deep impressions in the soft soil of Veridia.\n\"I am under the order of the Demon Lord, Deimos, to test your strength,\" Xar’gath said, his voice laced with a condescending tone.\n\"Your God should also join the fight, as you all are clearly not my match.\"\n\"I alone am enough,\" Nova said calmly, her eyes fixed on the grotesque figure.\nA clone of Umbra, already present in Veridia, connected with Nova, providing her with two powerful buffs: one for strength and another for magic.\nThe remaining demigods didn’t stay idle. Though they had only a single talent to work with for now (since the 500-year mark for a new talent was not yet reached), they all began to attack.\nAs they collectively assaulted the demon, Xar’gath began to feel a sliver of pressure for the first time.\nJust then, a screaming head of a creature flew out of Xar’gath’s back.\nEvery demigod jumped back, trying to guess what was going on.\nThe head flew directly towards them and exploded midair, a detonation of pure demonic energy that damaged many of them.\nA single explosion was enough to take down a few, and Xar’gath still had 195 heads on his back.\nThe battle raged back and forth, a flurry of attacks and defenses. Xar’gath was now panting, with many of the heads on his back lost. Nova, even with her Absolute Defense, was disheveled.\nBlood gushed from every corner of her body.\nIt was a clear testament to Xar’gath’s power, as all the other demigods were either blown to smithereens or badly wounded.\nOnly Nova and the demigod of the humans were left standing. Yet, Xar’gath still had 30 heads remaining on his back.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\n\"Ahh, I really like it when I lose these heads. They are too burdensome to carry around,\" Xar’gath said, his panting face returning to normal, his voice once again full of a terrifying glee.\nIt felt like he was toying with them, but only Sunny knew the truth.\nSunny opened the description of Xar’gath and saw that only 31 talents were now listed. And all of them were S-Grade or higher, unlike the talents of the heads he had lost.\n\"I would return to the demon realm for now, as your strength is clearly too weak,\" Xar’gath said, and with a final, condescending glance, he dissolved into nothingness.\nSunny heaved a sigh of relief and immediately used a billion faith points to return the bodies of all the demigods to normal.\nMany were still in shock from the explosions that had blown them apart.\nOthers, however, were filled with a burning, righteous fury, resolute on taking revenge against the demon that had just came to bully them.",

      "content": "Chapter 66: Ch 66 : Mammon, The sin of Greed\nSunny observed the receding form of Xar’gath, a cold smile forming on his lips.\nHe knew the reason for the demon’s abrupt departure.\n\"He didn’t want to lose those last 30 talents, did he?\" Sunny thought, a feeling of amusement washing over him.\nThe demon’s boastful talk now seemed like the desperate actions of a cornered beast trying to preserve its last ounce of strength.\n\"If you think you can survive after taunting and fighting with my lifeforms, then you are so wrong,\" Sunny said aloud, his voice resonating with divine authority as a truly devious plan began to form in his mind.\nHis hands moved as he manifested a divine embryo, a swirling vortex of energy.\nWith his very thoughts, he began to shape the embryo.\nIt twisted and contorted, slowly morphing into a figure of malevolent grace and sinister authority.\nIt stood tall with a slender, yet powerful, build, draped in an exquisite, dark suit adorned with intricate golden patterns and luxurious fur trim.\nIts long, black hair flowed down from beneath a crown of elegant, bat-like horns, framing a mask-like face that was both skeletal and aristocratic.\nIts eyes burned with a piercing, hellish glow, a stark contrast to its dark skin and the long, sharp claws that extended from its slender, gloved fingers.\nOrnate gold chains and rings dangled from its person, giving it the appearance of a dark king or a noble from a forgotten realm, ruling with cunning and overwhelming power.\nNow, it was time to make this demigod stronger and fill it with many talents.\nSunny wanted the best, and he was ready to spend all his faith to create this anomaly. This time, he started with the name first, as deciding on the optimal talents would take some time.\n\"Mammon, the Sin of Greed.\"\nOn the other hand, in the human capital, Anaske, ran towards his father, Thorn, who looked more and more disheveled with every passing second.\nThorn was brought back to the human capital, where the demigod of fairies performed light magic to heal him.\nBut all the efforts were for naught.\n\"He has lost all his strength and has reverted to an ordinary human,\" the demigod of fairies sighed, her voice filled with sorrow. \"He will be able to live for only one or two more months.\" This statement broke Anaske’s heart.\nHe yearned for revenge against the demon, but he knew his own strength was too weak.\nJust then, Uranus and Gaia, the demigods of life, entered the hall where everyone was present.\n\"Do not worry, human,\" Uranus said, his voice as serene as a clear sky.\n\"With our help, and his immense merits for Veridia, he will be reborn with a better body and a greater talent.\"\nAnaske was shocked. \"Reborn?\" His mind was thrown into disarray.\nThe thought of his father being reborn into a new body, and potentially becoming younger than him, was a disorienting paradox.\nAnaske bowed, his head nearly touching the floor, and thanked all the demigods present, for he knew that without them, Veridia would have been nothing but dust.\nThe demigods left the castle and returned to their own places, leaving Anaske to look upon his father, his heart filled with sorrow.\nHe decided to spend the next few months with his father, as two months in Veridia were just six days in the Realm of Advancement.\nSunny disliked the notion of Thorn dying, but he knew he couldn’t do anything about it.\nNo worlds currently possessed items that could restore someone to their peak condition.\nEven if Sunny were to create a new demigod to heal Thorn, his power would still be lost, and he would only be able to live an ordinary life.\n\"I think letting him be reborn is a good choice,\" Sunny said, his eyes returning to the divine form of Mammon.\nSunny was still deciding on the talents for Mammon.\nHe wanted Mammon to infiltrate the demonic realm, so he decided on the Legion-Born talent first.\nThis talent creates an aura around Mammon that makes everyone, even the top-tier demigods, feel that he is a Legion-Born demon.\nSince there are only seven Demon Lords in the entire demonic realm, finding a counterfeit would be impossible for them.\nThe next talent was Greed-Collector, a sinister talent similar to Shenlong’s hope-collector.\nThis talent allows Mammon to sense the greed of anyone towards the thing they desire most.\nMammon would give them that thing through Thea’s manifestation, and in return, upon their death, everything they had would be collected and returned to Mammon.\nThe true crux of this talent lay in the word ’everything,’ which included their luck, fate, talents, identity, body, and soul.\nThose who traded with Mammon would be consumed entirely upon their death, unable to even be reincarnated.\nAnd Mammon would only grow stronger as he collected more and more talents.\nThis cost Sunny 18 billion faith points, but in his eyes, it was worth it.\nThe third talent Sunny gave him was Intuition, a sixth sense so strong that it would allow Mammon to easily avoid dangers and turn every move into an opportunity, as he would already know the right option through his intuition.\nThis would enable Mammon to pick the best candidates for his trades.\nThe fourth talent was Slow-Poison. The more someone traded with Mammon, the more addicted they would become, eventually dying from this addiction.\nThis was not a quick, brutal power, but a subtle, devious one that perfectly fit his nature.\nThe final talent was for Void Affinity. From Adam, Sunny had learned that the void was everywhere, a realm that connected to every part of the multiverse.\nIt was a separate dimension, an inter-dimensional highway.\nWith void affinity, Mammon would be able to swim in the void freely and travel all over the universe.\nIt could also save him in times of danger, as the intuition would give him a pre-danger warning, and void affinity would give him the ability to vanish into thin air.\nAll this costed Sunny a total of nearly 40 billion faith points.\nHe felt a moment of hesitation, a desire to pour even more of his power into Mammon to make him an even more formidable being.\nYet, no new, truly exceptional talents came to mind that would fit Mammon’s devious purpose.\nFor now, Sunny decided against it, choosing to let his new creation grow with the formidable set of skills he already possessed.\nAnd earn new talents through merits or acquiring from others.\nNᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet",

      "content": "Chapter 67: Ch 67 : A Legion-born\nWith a single thought from Sunny, Mammon came to life.\nHis form, which had been a static sculpture of malevolent grace and sinister authority, was nowhere to seen, instead he bowed before Sunny, his movement fluid and regal, a gesture of deep respect.\nAfter a few pleasantries, Sunny gave him system access and asked Thea to show him the way.\nFollowing Thea’s directions, Mammon arrived in front of a sprawling, ancient forest filled with mutated monsters and monstrous beasts.\nNova was already there, her figure a steady, calming presence.\nMammon approached her, his voice a low, melodious murmur. \"Hello, sister.\"\nNova’s smile was warm and genuine.\n\"Hello, Mammon. Are you ready?\"\nMammon looked at Nova, his eyes reflecting Nova’s deepest greed.\nThe vision that appeared to him was astonishing.\nNova was filled entirely with greed, He hadn’t seen many life forms yet, but the vast knowledge that came with his talent told him this was a greed of a magnitude that is difficult to find in even the most greediest person, a greed that had no return.\nHe laughed softly to himself as he used his another ability to find the source of this greed.\nIt was the same as his own: an insatiable desire to be the most helpful, the most powerful, the most useful demigod for their master, Sunny.\nNova, understanding Mammon’s peering gaze chuckled softly.\nShe tore open the space, and a shimmering tear appeared, leading straight to the demonic realm.\nMammon waved his long, clawed fingers at her in a silent goodbye.\nNova, her own smile unwavering, waved back.\nAfter Mammon crossed the boundary of the realms, Nova watched the departing figure for a while before restoring the tear to its original state.\nSunny, watching from his throne, decided against worrying for now.\n\"There are still two hours left for the next talent acquisition\" he said to himself, \"I should not worry about it for now.\"\nIn the desolate, cracked landscape of the demonic realm, a hunched figure crawled, his body wracked with a sudden, overwhelming weakness.\nThe air was a suffocating blend of sulfur and stale blood, the ground a jagged mosaic of shattered rock and bone.\n\"If it weren’t for my A-Grade regeneration talent being lost, I wouldn’t be in this predicament!\" he snarled, grinding his teeth in a fury born of humiliation.\n\"It’s all because of that cursed dragon! I will kill him next time I see him.\"\nThis person was the Legion-Born demon, Xar’gath.\nHe had lost 167 talents in Veridia, and the sudden drop in power had left his body frail and weak.\nIf it weren’t for his tactical retreat, he would have been dead.\nSuddenly, a calm voice, filled with a subtle, predatory undertone, cut through the oppressive silence.\n\"Oh, a fellow Legion-Born.\"\nXar’gath looked behind him and saw a demon walking towards him.\nHe sat cross-legged on the ground, his gaze wary and suspicious.\n\"You look hurt. Do you need water? Or elixirs? I have some here,\" the other demon said, his voice laced with a strange, naive innocence as he pulled a small pouch out of his bag.\nA powerful, distinct aroma wafted from the pouch—it contained a rare SS-Grade elixir, a healing potion for demigods.\nXar’gath’s eyes widened at the sight and scent.\n\"Who are you? What is your race?\" Xar’gath questioned.\n\"Can’t you see my aura?\" the other demon replied with an air of faux naivety.\nXar’gath inspected the aura, sighed in relief, and greeted him. \"So, you are also a Legion-Born. My name is Xar’gath, the right hand of Demon Lord Deimos.\"\n\"Oh, the right hand of a Demon Lord? That sounds cool,\" the other demon said, his eyes glinting with a hidden spark of something cold and calculating.\n\"My name is... Mammon. I was just born last month.\"\nA sliver of hope sparked in Xar’gath’s heart.\nHe needed to regain his strength, and this little demon was a goldmine.\n\"I can give you anything you want,\" he said, his voice full of desperation, \"just help me. Give me that medicine.\"\n\"Anything...\" Mammon’s lips curled into a fleeting smirk, but he quickly hid it, returning to his naive persona. \"Okay, take it.\" Mammon handed him the medicine without hesitation.\nXar’gath gulped down the elixir, and he immediately felt his condition improving.\nBut he also felt a strange, new connection with the demon.\nHe shook his head, dismissing it as the concept of fate, but the feeling lingered, a subtle hum in his soul.\n\"How is it?\" Mammon asked with fake concern.\n\"It is okay for now, but I may need more later,\" Xar’gath replied, his body quickly absorbing the remaining effects of the medicine.\nAfter half an hour, he was able to walk again. \"Follow me,\" he said. \"I will take you to see our demon leader in the capital.\"\nDuring their journey, the Slow-Poison talent started to take effect.\nXar’gath felt a creeping weakness he couldn’t explain.\nHe asked Mammon for multiple medicines, food, and water, even though he didn’t need them.\nIt’s already been a month since they were travelling to the direction of the capital.\nAnd the effects of Slow-poison kept on stacking with each trade.\n\"A thousand kilometers to the north from here,\" Xar’gath grunted, his condition visibly worsening, though he was completely oblivious to it.\nThis was the true power of the slow-poison, which had cost Sunny 7 billion faith points.\nXar’gath, a creature filled pure malice, was not without his own tricks.\nHe subtly emitted a high-grade poison of his own, designed to slowly kill Mammon.\nBoth were playing a deadly game of poison, and the one who lasted the longest would win.\nMammon was the winner, but only because of Thea, who had manifested multiple antidotes to counter Xar’gath’s poison, keeping him safe.\nAfter walking a few more steps, Xar’gath fell to the ground, his body collapsing in on itself.\nHe tried to push himself up, but his strength was gone, consumed by Mammon’s slow-poison.\nThe voice of Thea sounded in Mammon’s head, calm and logical.\n[He is about to die. You should take the antidote from the spatial ring on his neck.]\nMammon waited for a moment, and when Xar’gath stopped moving, Mammon squatted down near his body and took the spatial ring.\nNᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt",

      "content": "Chapter 68: Ch 68 : New Identity\nMammon drank the antidote for the poison that Xar’gath emitted.\nXar’gath was still not moving, but a low, ragged breath proved he was still alive.\nMammon sighed, an almost human sound.\nHe hadn’t wanted to give this bastard such a painless death, but his powers worked only in this way.Follow current novels on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nHe could only play the game of poison with Xar’gath, a patient predator waiting for his prey to finally succumb.\nDays passed in the demonic realm, each one a slow, agonizing crawl towards oblivion for Xar’gath.\nThe vitality in his body was siphoned away, minute by minute, until all that remained was a husk.\nAnd then, a truly mysterious force took hold.\nXar’gath’s entire body was pulled towards Mammon, not as a brutal act of force, but as if by an inevitable gravity.\nHis form dissolved, not into dust, but into a swirling vortex of energy and memories, which then flowed into Mammon.\nMammon’s mind was instantly flooded with the memories of Xar’gath: the taste of a thousand victories, the sting of defeat, the face of his demon king, the devotion for the demon lord Deimos, and the fear he had felt in Veridia.\nHe could now freely transform into Xar’gath’s figure and use all his talents.\nMammon took on the form of the hulking, hunched demon, mimicking his movements and even the way he had gritted his teeth in frustration.\nHe was now a perfect copy, as he headed towards the capital of the demons, his mind set on farming more talents and memories from the unaware denizens.\nWhile this was happening, in a world far away from Veridia, on a planet filled with lush, green forests and ancient mountains, a world teeming with life and spirits, a monotonous voice sounded in the head of an unconscious child.\n[Binding successful! The Lottery System is online.]\nHearing this voice, the unconscious child, a half-orc, came back to his senses.\nHis head throbbed, and a deep-seated weakness had settled in his bones.\nHe was weak and fragile, looking no older than 17.\nHe lost all his energy just by looking around, and was about to fall down again when a voice sounded in his head again.\nThis time, he saw a glowing panel floating in front of him.\n[Dear host! You are given a free chance for a lottery.]\n\"Wahhh.... What is this?\" The orc was momentarily stunned.\nHe had never seen anything like the digital panel floating in front of his eyes.\nHe tried to touch it, but he didn’t have the strength to even lift his fingers.\n[Host, do you want to spin the lottery wheel?]\nThe voice of the system again sounded in the orc’s ears. \"Lottery? Spin it...\" he said in a weak voice.\nThe spinning wheel in the digital panel began to turn.\nIf the orc had seen the items in the spinning wheel, he would have surely been dancing in joy, but he couldn’t even keep his eyes open.\n[Ding! Congratulations, host, for winning the Perfect Strengthening Pill (A-Grade)!]\nThe orc’s ears twitched. \"The pill... where is it?\" he asked, his eyes looking at the panel with hope.\n[The rewards will be stored in system space. You can take them out whenever you want.]\n[But you can’t put rewards back into the system after claiming them.]\n\"Just give it to me,\" the orc said, using the last of his strength to ask for his reward.\n[Reward: Body Strengthening Pill (A-Grade) claimed.]\nA small, shimmering pill appeared out of thin air and floated in front of the orc.\nHe directly ate it, as he had no strength to admire its beauty or even hold it.\nHe had been hungry for the last few months, and his body was currently thrown in a barren wasteland, where not even grass was available.\nUpon eating the pill, his power, which was just at F-Grade, began to soar, and he instantly reached the Pinnacle of E-Grade.\nHe could have reached D or even C if he had a body-refining technique.\nBut currently, he didn’t possess any, and most of the effects of the pill were lost.\nBut the remaining effects were more than enough to make the orc healthy again.\n\"What type of magic is this?\" the orc looked towards the floating panel and saw a few tabs.\n\"Status?\" He began reading the words to understand what this system was for.\nBut suddenly as if listening to his words, the words in the system panel changed.\n[Name: Ragnok\nRace: Half-Orc\nProfession: Body Refiner (E-Grade)\nTalents: Orc’s Strength (B-Grade), Hunter (C-Grade)\nLottery chances: 0]\nThe panel showed Ragnok all his information and a floating avatar of him on the right side.\nThe digital panel was none other than Thea.\nAnd this was possible due to Thea’s Omni-Cognition talent, which allowed her to know all the information of a being, even a demigod, at a glance.\nRagnok, now healthy and fit, looked at the system panel with grateful eyes.\nHe tried to start a conversation with the system but didn’t find an answer.\nThe only time Thea answered was when Ragnok asked a query about the system.\n\"Turns out I need to complete missions from the system to earn a chance to spin the lottery,\" Ragnok said as he dived deeper into the system’s mechanisms.\n\"Why did you help me?\" Ragnok asked in an embarrassed tone; he was just a dying man and didn’t know the motive behind the system’s help.\n\"You will know it soon,\" Thea replied through the system panel.\nThe world they were currently in was called Solara, and the God of this world was called Kairos.\nThe system was the leftover particles of Thea, which used the replication talent to create an entire new system for Ragnok.\nCurrently, many of Thea’s particles, which were not visible to the naked eye, were roaming in the entire atmosphere of Solara, creating a hidden network that covered the entire world.\nThea used this to collect valuable information from Kairos’s world and also to search for targets to bind with the system, turning them into hidden assassins who would listen to the system’s commands.\nRagnok was not chosen by Thea.\nInstead, it was Sunny who chose Ragnok.\nThea didn’t think highly of Ragnok because of his low-grade talents.\nShe wanted only life forms with S-Grade and above as her host.\nBut Sunny saw something special in Ragnok—a halo only visible to him and other gods.\nIt turned out that Ragnok was a previous god, who had either died because of an invasion from one of the demon gods or was a god whom Adam had erased when he didn’t find their progress satisfactory.",

You were the first to recognize my talent and also the one who protected us from the demons by creating powerful demigods,\" Thorn replied earnestly.\n\"Then what were you waiting for, for 15 years? I haven’t noticed your wish to meet me, and the raven was always there since the last 15 years\" Cosmos said, his mask hiding all his emotions.\n\"It...\" Thorn’s mind felt blank.\nHe couldn’t deny it. For the past 15 years, he had lived comfortably in heaven and had no desire to leave, so he had forgotten about his long-cherished wish to meet Cosmos.\nAnd the reason he thought he was not able to see the Raven in the last 15 years was because of his weak faith.\n\"I am just kidding. I don’t need you all to leave your good life for me,\" Cosmos said in a serious tone. \"I came here today to ask for your future paths. You have a chance to be reborn, an opportunity not all souls would possess.\"\n\"I don’t know,\" Thorn sighed and replied to Sunny’s query. \"Even if I return to Veridia in a new body, I don’t think I will be happy by being reborn.\"\n\"you should think about it more. Sooner or later, Veridia will need you,\" Cosmos replied.\nWith his reply, the entire scene shifted. Thorn returned to his house in heaven, and Sunny’s clone returned to the God space.",

      "content": "Chapter 70: Ch 70 : First Apostle\nIn a world of eternal peace and happiness, where thousands of souls resided, life was a state of perfect contentment.\nThey didn’t need to work, nor did they have to risk their lives in unnecessary battles.\nThey never grew hungry, and whenever they wanted to eat something, a feast would appear out of thin air, always tasting heavenly.The source of this content ɪs NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\nBut out of all the thousands of souls from various races, one human sat alone.\nHis mind was always racing from one thought to another, a single question haunting his peaceful existence.\n\"When did my faith waver?\" The voice came from the mouth of Thorn, a profound sadness in his tone.\nHe was still pondering the conversation he had with God Cosmos.\nHe had been so blind, so comfortable in his blissful existence, that he hadn’t noticed the raven—his god’s message—for 15 years straight.\n\"Why was I able to see it yesterday? Was it because of the guilt I felt?\" His thoughts wandered, searching for answers.\nHe thought of all the possibilities and came to a single, powerful conclusion.\n\"I need to repent,\" he said in a deep, serious voice.\nHis purpose in this world was clear: to do his god’s bidding and serve him till the end.\nHe immediately rose and walked towards the gate of reincarnation.\nBeside the gate of reincarnation, there was another gate: the gate of rebirth.\nWhenever a soul was sent to heaven, they were told about these two gates.\nThe gate of reincarnation led a soul to the river of reincarnation, where they would await the birth of a child.\nIt was a random process, and a soul may or may not need to wait for a very long time to be reborn.\nBut the gate of rebirth was an entirely different concept.\nIt gave a soul two specific choices.\nThe first choice was to become an apostle of a demigod.\nFor this, both the demigod and the soul had to agree.\nThe apostle would then be blessed by their chosen demigod, and other demigods could also grant blessings if they so chose.\nThe second choice was to be reborn into a new body that would possess the previous talents of the soul, along with five blessings from random demigods.\nOne was the choice to be reborn into an apostle other was rebirth with memories and talent.\nThorn was already clear on his choice.\nHe directly pressed \"Option 1\" on the system panel.\nThe panel changed, and a new page opened with the names and roles of different demigods under Sunny.\nThe text also explained what kind of work he would need to do as an apostle.\nHe checked the role of every demigod, from the noble Uranus to the cunning Mammon, and then immediately pressed on an image of a mythical creature.\nThe creature had a green, serpentine body that floated in the sky, a king of the heavens. Its body glimmered with a mysterious energy.\nThis creature was the second dragon of Veridia, Shenlong.\n[Please Await Demigod Shenlong’s reply]\nA new line of text appeared, and now Thorn just needed to wait.\nThe decision behind choosing Shenlong over the other demigods was simple.\nThorn didn’t want other life forms to become like him, forgetting the god who created them, who protected them, and who gave them the strength to fight.\nHe wanted to be like Shenlong, a being who protected the weak and showed them the way to be under the protection of God Cosmos.\nHe wanted to spread the faith of his god and prove that he would do anything for him.\n\"Master, your plan worked like a charm. Do you have a talent for manipulation?\" Thea said, her voice filled with admiration for Sunny’s cunning.\nThea was right; this decision of Thorn’s was not his own.\nIt was a well-thought-out plan of Sunny’s.\nHe wanted a few of his life forms to wander the world and spread the faith to others.\nJust as Shenlong was already doing, he didn’t want to create another demigod for a similar purpose, as this could create conflicts between them in the future.\nBut if there was only one demigod per role, it created a whole ecosystem where they couldn’t use their powers to the fullest without the help of another god.\nIt was not that Thorn was unfaithful towards his god, Cosmos.\nHe prayed multiple times daily and was a devoted believer.\nBut a single comment from Sunny had made him question his faith.\nSunny’s plan was simple: he wanted Thorn to believe that he had been negligent towards his duty to Veridia.\nAnd the best way to do so was to prove him unfaithful towards Sunny.\nThis would make Thorn do everything in his power to prove his faith in Cosmos.\n\"I don’t have such a talent,\" Sunny replied, rejecting Thea’s train of thought. He felt a hint of sadness for Thorn.\n\"I feel slightly bad for him,\" Sunny thought to himself.\nBut it was not his fault; he wanted Thorn to be reborn into the world again, which would surely help the masses.\nHe wanted Thorn to embark on a journey where he could spread the faith of Cosmos to other life forms.\nBut to say it outright would be against his own motto of letting life forms live independently.\nThus, he used this trick to make Thorn feel guilty and take this step on his own.\nA new message from the system arrived.\n[Demigod Shenlong has accepted your request]\n[Congratulations on becoming the first apostle of Shenlong]\nAfter this congratulatory message, the scene shifted in Thorn’s eyes.\nHe was now in front of a huge container, huge enough to drown all the continents in Veridia.\nIt even felt like the container was growing every second.\n\"What is this? Where am I?\" Thorn mustered these words, his mind unable to comprehend where he was.\nSuddenly, the shiny liquid inside the container stirred.\nA small part of it began to move and transform.\nIt quickly morphed into a magnificent dragon.\nIt was similar to Shenlong in size and physical features, but its green scales were replaced by golden ones, which suggested that this was not Shenlong’s real body, but only a temporary form created just to give blessings to Thorn.\n\"I like your dedication to spread faith for my Master, and for this reason, I have accepted your request to become my apostle,\" the figure of Shenlong said in a majestic and deep voice, which produced ripples in the liquid.",

      "content": "Chapter 71: Ch 71 : Loki’s misfortune\nThorn knelt, his eyes fixed on the magnificent figure of the golden dragon.\n\"I greet Demigod Shenlong,\" he said, his voice filled with reverence for this being who could manifest into a powerful dragon from a shiny liquid, seemingly from billions of miles away.\n\"No need for pleasantries,\" Shenlong’s voice boomed, deep and calm.\n\"Dive into this container and absorb as much as you can. The more you absorb, the greater the power you will receive.\"\nWith those words, Shenlong’s form dissolved, mixing back into the remaining liquid in the container.\nThorn’s soul automatically flew to the edge of the container, one more step and he would be inside the liquid.\nThis liquid was the Essence of Hope, filled with the energy of countless prayers and desires.\nWith Shenlong’s blessings, anyone who dived into it would have all their wishes and hopes fulfilled.\nBut every use would consume some of the liquid, a fact that gave Thorn a sense of purpose and responsibility.\nTaking a deep breath, Thorn’s soul plunged into the essence.\nThe next second, his body sank deep into the liquid.\nHis whole form was now surrounded by the essence, working to rebuild his lost body from the ground up.\nSlowly, his bones began to form, followed by muscles, veins, and other body parts.\nSunny watched this scene with pleased eyes, a feeling of fascination washing over him.\nHe hadn’t seen such a sight in his entire life.\nThe creation of a demigod through a divine embryo was not this captivating; it simply morphed into the shape Sunny desired.\nBut the formation of Thorn’s body felt totally different and mesmerizing to Sunny.\nAs Thorn’s new body was forming, and he was gaining talents from Shenlong, constantly fusing these into his soul, Sunny knew this process would take time.\nA few months in real time, which was something Sunny, a being with a lot of patience, still didn’t like.\nSo he acted. He directly created another subspace in Veridia, a space solely for storing the Essence of Hope.\nNow, an entire month of forming the body would just be a small amount of time for Sunny.\nIn another place, in the vast expanse of the Realm of Advancement, a figure laughed, a sound of pure glee echoing through the air.\n\"Finally, I left that hellhole! That silly demon gave me the chance to escape, haha!\" The voice belonged to Loki, currently in the form of the fastest beast he had ever seen in the realm.\nHe was flying with the fastest speed possible.\nHe wanted to find a place to rest and also to take a few apostles, as his merits were more than enough to acquire the talent for giving blessings and even giving blessings to some of the life forms he would find.\nHe flew towards the cities of the life forms from Veridia.\nBut he was oblivious to the fact that an entity, one he had known for a long time, was following him closely.\nBack in Sunny’s God space, the all-knowing Thea said in a calm and laughing tone,\n\"Master, Loki is being followed by the demon demigod he worked under for all these years.\"\n\"Cut down all of his merits. I don’t want any of my life forms blessed by him to cause mischiefs everywhere,\" Sunny said with a laugh.\nHe knew from Thea that the demon was strong, but not strong enough to contend with Nova.\nSo he asked Nova to teleport to Loki’s location and help him capture the demon.\nNova, who would get the merits snatched from Loki, laughed at his misfortune and teleported towards him.\nWhile Loki was running at full speed, he suddenly felt a strong space ripple around him.\nHe stopped dead in his tracks, sensing the familiar aura.\nHis mind began racing. \"Why did my sister visit me?\"ᴛhis ᴜpdated by ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\nHis thoughts quickly went over all the possible mischiefs he had committed.\nThen, he realized the biggest problem he was in and said in a loud voice, \"Sister, kill that fiend!\"\nNova was surprised by Loki’s sudden comment. \"Oh, you knew about that demigod following you?\" she said in a surprised tone.\nLoki sighed and thought. \"Hah, my guess was correct.\"\nThen he said, with a tone filled with reverence for Nova’s strength, \"Sister, I was going to bring it towards Veridia so that you could easily take care of it.\"\n\"Master has already given me all your merits,\" Nova said, a hint of amusement in her voice.\n\"But I will give it back to you once I deal with this bug.\"\nShe then teleported behind an invisible figure.\nThis demigod was good at assassinating others, but he was nothing in front of Nova, who could feel the space fabric moving with every move of the demon.\nShe immediately used her Super Strength talent with her space and time magic to directly crush the demon demigod into a mush of blood and bone.\nUpon the death of his body, the demon’s soul tried to run away but was immediately captured by Nova’s space prison.\n\"I will gift it to Cerberus. He is currently unemployed, anyway,\" Nova said as she looked at the soul of the demon.\nLoki gulped upon realizing the true strength of Nova.\nHe decided to transform into her whenever he was in danger.\nHe was truly happy that he wouldn’t have his merits taken for committing this blunder.\nNova then used her spatial magic to directly teleport back to the God space.\n\"Master, the task is complete,\" Nova said, bowing in Sunny’s direction.\nSunny nodded at her and then looked towards Loki, who was shivering and bowing in front of Sunny.\n\"Oh! Loki, why are you so nervous?\" Sunny said in a tone full of sarcasm.\n\"It’s nothing, Master,\" Loki tried to maintain his composure, but in front of Sunny, he felt that all his secrets were an open book.\n\"Well, you are now growing brazen enough to fool your sister,\" Sunny said, looking at both Nova and Loki.\nNova looked at Loki with a questioning tone. Loki felt his hairs stand all over his body; he felt like crying.\n\"Well, it’s a deal between you two, so I wouldn’t interfere,\" Sunny said and then gestured for them to go away.eqwW",

      "content": "Chapter 72: Ch 72 : Bankrupt Kairos 1\n\"Sister, I bought you a gift,\" Loki said, a mischievous grin on his face as he fiddled with his spatial ring.\nHe was trying to find something from the mountains of loot he had collected over the years from all around the Realm of Advancement.\nNova, currently in her elegant humanoid form, sat across from him at a dining table filled with all kinds of delicious food.\nThe food was a result of Thea’s magic, a service any demigod could buy with their merits.\nNova looked just like the dragon-born race, a beautiful, powerful figure. Loki, now back in his original form, sighed and looked at her.\n\"Just tell me the truth,\" Nova said, her voice soft but firm.\nLoki sighed again, a true sigh this time.\nHe then explained the truth about his master plan of escaping, a plan that had sent him on a wild goose chase.\nNova listened patiently, her expression unreadable.\nWhen he finished, she let out a sigh of relief.\n\"Thank God you’re safe,\" she said, her voice filled with the love and care of an older sister.\nLoki’s eyes filled with tears.\nHe had been ready to give her all his merits as an apology, but upon hearing her worried voice, he was stunned.\nThe two of them then began to talk about all the things that had happened during Loki’s absence.\nHe was aware of most of the things through Thea but still listened to them like a child listening to the same story every day.\nIn Solara, in a grand throne room, a half-orc sat, his ministers gathered around him, listening to every order he gave.\nIt had been 60 years since the Lottery System had bound to him.\nRagnok had been given multiple missions, and by completing them, he had received rewards ranging from A-Grade to SS-Grade.\nThese rewards were not just weapons and armor; they were also knowledge for fighting, medicine making, and array making.\nNot only that, he was even provided with talents, like magic affinity and omni-cognition, through the blessings of the demigods under Sunny.\nThis made Ragnok the strongest among the life forms under his god, Kairos.\nBut Kairos didn’t know that Ragnok held a deep malice toward him.\nWhen he was a child, Kairos had not helped any of the half-orcs.\nThey were constantly killed and made slaves in the empire, but Kairos, their god, turned a blind eye to them.\nIn truth, they were oblivious to the fact that Kairos was not even aware of most of the things happening in his world.\nWith a 10x time acceleration, many things felt like a blur to Kairos.\nOnly when he descended to the world or focus on a single place could he properly interact with it.\nBut descending into the world would cost many faith points, and with the absence of his system, he was unable to ask for faith from his alliance members, which decreased the faith of the life forms under him, which in turn decreased his faith generation.\nHe was now a god in name only.\nHe couldn’t descend, nor could he intervene in anything, as his demigod was lost.\nHis only hope was the current new king of the empire, a dual S-Grade mage and body refiner, well-versed in alchemy, arrays, and weapon refining.\nHe knew that this was the halo of a protagonist, meaning there was a chance of Ragnok becoming a demigod.\nHe even asked his priests to fulfill all the requests from Ragnok.\nThis in turn helped Ragnok increase his strength more freely.\nHe had become the king who united all of Solara, and all the races and spirits listened to his commands.\nKairos thought he was still in control of his world, but the truth was, his world was now controlled by Ragnok.\nEach life form hailed Ragnok as their only king, and they even forgot about their long-lost god, who hadn’t intervened in their lives for a long time.\nIt was Ragnok who stopped slavery, gave many technological ideas to Solara, produced many medicinal recipes, created multiple S-Grade weapons, and protected Solara from demon invasion.\nThey didn’t know that all this was orchestrated by the missions given by Thea.\n[New Mission Unlocked]\n[Title: Redemption\nGrade: SS\nDescription: You need to lead more than 90% or more of the life forms to the Realm of Advancement.\nNote: The more you perform well, the more generous the rewards in the lottery.\nTime Left: 364 days 23 hours 59 minutes]\nRagnok felt that the mission was easy, only if their god, Kairos, did not intervene.\nBut he needed to take the risk.\nHe ordered most of his army and ministers to expand the area around their portal in the Realm of Advancement.ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nIn the first month, four cities were established. Currently, they had six cities there. Kairos felt something was amiss but, upon looking through the eyes of many people, found nothing. They just talked about the prospect of having multiple cities in the Realm of Advancement and how much it helped them earn treasures and other things. Many people left to live in the Realm of Advancement, but it was still just around 40 percent. Kairos didn’t feel a threat, as the faith was still coming to him. For the next phase, Ragnok required many more cities to be built. All of these things needed to be hidden from Kairos, but Ragnok felt that his god was not looking. Only Thea knew that even though Kairos was not able to see all of Solara clearly because of the 10x time acceleration, he could focus on a single place if he wanted to. Thus, Thea felt Kairos’s vision on Ragnok from time to time.\n\"Master, the chances of Ragnok getting caught are high,\" Thea said in a low voice, as Sunny was currently playing chess with a random god.\n\"Well, how many faith points does Kairos have?\" Sunny asked. He knew about Thea’s Omni-Cognition talent, which made her observation skills superb.\n\"When he destroyed me, he had 200 million faith points. And by calculating the rate of faith production and deduction, he should have almost 40 million faith points only,\" Thea said as she looked at the moves her master made in chess.\n\"Oh! Use a single particle of yours to enter the God space of Kairos and then use replication to replicate and then transform into me. I will do the talking,\" Sunny ordered Thea.\nThea acknowledged Sunny’s command and immediately controlled one of her particles to enter the God space, which was not accessible to anyone unless permitted by the gods themselves. But for her, it was just a walk in the park, as she was just an energy particle.",

      "content": "Chapter 73: Ch 73 : Bankrupt Kairos 2\nThea’s single energy particle, a minuscule particle that was not visible to the naked eye, entered the confines of Kairos’s God space.\nIt did not go unnoticed. Kairos immediately sensed the foreign energy and, with a flicker of his own divine power, tried to destroy it.\nBut before his attack could even reach it, Thea used her Replication talent, fueled by Sunny’s faith points.\nThe single particle began to multiply, first into two, then four, then a thousand, a shimmering swarm of energy in the heart of Kairos’s sanctuary.\nKairos hesitated for a second.\nHe was aware of this phenomenon, a unique ability that could only be achieved by a god with a fully functioning system.\nHis urge to chat with other gods, a craving he had suppressed for years, made his desire to destroy the particle weak.\nHe watched as the particles began to form a humanoid shape, with cosmic eyes that swirled with the dust of galaxies and a black robe that absorbed all light.\n\"Hello, Kairos,\" said the deep voice of Sunny from the projection.\nIt was a kind of 3D video call, a spectacle Kairos had never witnessed.\n\"Cosmos, I believe?\" Kairos said, his voice a mix of surprise and a cold, questioning tone.\n\"You are right, but sadly there are no rewards. Well, there’s one, actually,\" Sunny said in a calm tone, a hint of a smirk on his masked face.\n\"What type of reward? I don’t think I did something worthy of a reward,\" Kairos said, his voice laced with annoyance. He still felt the sting of Sunny’s actions.\nSunny was the one who had caught his act of plunder and massacre in the Realm of Advancement, and if it weren’t for him, he would have been the top god in the entire universe.\n\"You certainly did something great, giving me all this fame,\" Sunny laughed, then a system panel appeared in front of Kairos.\nIt was a new design of the God’s chat, with multiple tabs to look at. Chat, private chats, videos, short videos, and many more.\nSunny first opened the chat panel, and it was filled with praises for Sunny for catching Kairos.\nMany even bad-mouthed Kairos, mocking him for his stupidity.\nSunny then opened the videos section, where there were many videos about how Sunny caught Kairos red-handed and what would happen to Kairos after he was left alone.\nSunny then showed some short videos that made fun of Kairos, for example, how he always boasted about everything.\nShowing all this took Sunny two and a half minutes, and he still needed to waste two and a half minutes more.\nThis was because for gods, five minutes were just five minutes, but for life forms in Solara or Veridia, it was a little less than a year.\nSunny wanted to waste Kairos’s time to give Ragnok the time he required to transport every life form to the Realm of Advancement.\nKairos felt his face heat up; he had never been this humiliated in his entire life.\n\"Are you here just to mock me? Then you can just die,\" Kairos said, and was about to attack, but he stopped in his tracks after listening to Sunny’s next words.\n\"No, no, I am not here to mock you. I am here to give you a chance, as a fellow citizen of the Blue Planet,\" Sunny said in a serious tone, his voice devoid of any mockery.\n\"What kind of chance?\" Kairos said in a hurrying voice; he wanted to hear a single answer from Sunny: access to the system.\n\"Well, of course, to join the gods with a new identity. I will create all the data required to prove you were always there in the God’s chat,\" Sunny said, laughing as if he was talking to an old friend.\nIf it had been the old Sunny, he would not have been able to talk so fluently and jokingly with anyone.\nBut now he was not the previous Sunny but the God Cosmos, the God of Manifestation, the God of Entertainment, the God of the New Era, the God of Games, and the God of the Gods.\n\"Why would you do so?\" Kairos asked, thinking logically instead of falling for the addiction to the system.\n\"Because I want to? Isn’t that sufficient? You know how my business works. The more the gods, the better my business is, and I don’t want a top god in my universe to be left alone,\" Sunny said, and he sounded earnest and believable to Kairos.\nThis conversation took another minute from Kairos and brought Sunny closer to his goal. Now he just needed to waste another minute and a half.\n\"I believe you, but what are the conditions?\" Kairos said, not believing for a second that there were no conditions involved.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\n\"10 million faith every day, for eternity,\" Sunny said in a serious tone. He made it sound as if there was no place for bargaining.\nKairos thought for a second.\nHe had already lost a lot of his faith, and the remaining amount would only be sufficient for six days. Still, he readily agreed after thinking for a few seconds.\n\"I don’t think there is a need for a contract, as i believe you would not go back on your words \" Sunny said, trying to waste more of Kairos’s time.\nKairos suddenly felt something was amiss.\nHe was about to look towards his world, but suddenly felt a blinding light coming from Sunny.\nSunny manifested a divine embryo out of thin air and said, \"This is my meeting gift to you.\"\nKairos was momentarily stunned. He just looked at Sunny and then the embryo.\nHe didn’t have a system to appraise the item but knew that it was genuine from all the details that were still available in his memories.\nHe walked towards the embryo, which was floating in front of Sunny.\nKairos quickly came in front of the embryo, touching and caressing it all over.\n\"Master, the mission is completed. And it’s with 100% accuracy. Ragnok left no life forms in Solara; even the beasts and monsters were taken to the Realm of Advancement,\" the system voice sounded in Sunny’s ear, oblivious to Kairos.\n\"Go with Plan B, then,\" Sunny ordered Thea, his voice filled with anticipation.\nIn the Realm of Advancement, in a city nearest to the portal to Solara, a half-orc looked at a system panel which was only visible to him.\n[Mission completed! With 100% accuracy]\n[Rewards enhanced....]\n[Calculating rewards....]\n\"My hard work finnally paid off,\" Ragnok sighed as he looked at the mission completion message.",

      "content": "Chapter 74: Ch 74 : Refusal\nRagnok’s gaze was fixed on the system panel, his mind set on one goal: to complete the mission with one hundred percent accuracy.\nHe knew this would not only provide him with a generous reward from the system but also take him and his people out of God Kairos’s influence forever.\nThus, he not only took all the willing life forms from Solara but also the unwilling people, beasts, and even monsters.\nThe entire two-billion-strong population of Solara was now divided into ten cities, all in different geographical areas of the Realm of Advancement.\nThe land, a new frontier, was ripe for their taking.\n\"Plan B!\" Thea chuckled, a low, satisfied sound.\nShe also wanted to go with Plan B, but her moral values had stopped her from doing so. But now, Ragnok had already cleared the life forms from Solara, and she could follow this plan without much discomfort.\nThe cosmic projection of Sunny looked at the frantic, desperate face of Kairos, who still held the divine embryo in his hands.\n\"Is this really a gift for me?\" Kairos said, his eyes filled with a glimmer of hope.\nHe desperately wanted to believe it, to believe that he hadn’t been tricked, that the deal was genuine.\n\"Of course not!\" Sunny said, his voice ringing with a cold, triumphant finality. \"Look behind me. Your gift is there.\"\nAs Sunny’s form shifted, the projection of Solara came into view. It was a beautiful world, filled with lush greenery and vibrant life, but it was eerily, utterly silent.\nThere was not a single living creature to be seen, not a single light from a city, just an empty, hollow world. Kairos’s heart stopped.\n\"How fresh,\" a voice said in a joyous tone. He looked around, trying to find something to cover his naked body.\nHe was a human with some distinct features like horns and green scales around his hands, back, and legs.\nHis hair was also a vibrant green.\nThis person was Thorn, reborn from the Essence of Hope, and he had inherited multiple traits from Shenlong.\n\"Status,\" Thorn said, his voice filled with anticipation.\nHe could feel his talents, a vibrant energy coursing through his veins, but truly seeing the data was an entirely different thing.\n[Name: Thorn\nProfession: B-Grade Body Refiner\nTalents: Super Strength (S-Grade), Dragon Born (S-Grade), Hope Collector (S-Grade), Miracle Master (S-Grade)]\n\"All S-Grade, and three new talents,\" Thorn felt a wave of shock and awe wash over him.\nHe had expected his innate talent to be upgraded, but this was beyond his wildest dreams.\nThorn then clicked on a talent to check the description.\n[Talent Name: Dragon Born\nGrade: S\nDescription: You have the strength of a dragon born, with high magic affinity and the ability to transform into a dragon.]\nThe talent description was short but highly effective.\nThorn wasn’t sure about the exact level of strength and affinity he possessed, but the ability to transform into a dragon was incredibly practical.\nThorn then checked the descriptions of Hope Collector and Miracle Master, which were the innate talents of Shenlong.\nHe spent a few moments familiarizing himself with his new gifts.\nJust as he finished, a deep, calm voice resonated in his mind, congratulating him.\n\"Congratulations, Thorn. From now on, you are my first apostle, and you will be called Miracle’s Hand, Number 1. There will be many more apostles in the future.\"\nShenlong’s voice was filled with a gentle power that made Thorn feel at ease.\nThorn bowed, his head low in reverence for the demigod who had given him a new life. \"Thank you, Demigod Shenlong.\"\n\"Go on, familiarize yourself with your powers for a year or two, then walk on the path of spreading faith,\" Shenlong said in a calm voice and then dissolved back into the container that collected the hope of billions of life forms.\nCurrently, years passed like flies in Veridia. There was a constant need to provide different buffs to different races every year.\nSo Clone Number 1 was very busy, providing buffs to an entire race.\nRaces like the dragon-born, titans, and giants asked for Fertility buffs, as their innate fertility speed was very low.\nAs for other races, they also asked for buffs that mitigated their limitations.\nBy providing these buffs for almost two hundred years, Sunny’s clones’ understanding of buffing increased even further.\nNow, he could even provide two buffs that balanced each other to a single race.\nSunny also learned a new talent from the three clones who were learning different fighting skills from all over the multiverse.\n[Talent Name: Combat Master\nGrade: SS\nDescription: You possess the mastery of millions of arts in fighting. Your combat awareness is enhanced. Your fighting style is unpredictable.]\nSunny had already learned all the arts of fighting, but upon gaining this talent, his mind was filled with the fighting techniques of the previous era of old gods.Thᴇ link to the origɪn of this information rᴇsts ɪn NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\n\"Is there also a law for fighting?\" Clone Number 4 said as he tried to resonate with the law of fighting.\nThis essence of law felt both violent and defensive, a perfect balance of offense and defense.\nSunny currently possessed three law powers: the Law of Manifestation, the Law of Magic or mana, and now the Law of Fighting.\nBack in the God space of Solara, Kairos felt something was amiss from the way Sunny had pointed toward his world.\nHe tried to focus on a few of the locations, like the capital of the orcs, his primary race, or the humans and spirits.\nBut he found not even a single life form.\nHe chose to look through the eyes of a life form.\nHe decided to look through the eyes of Ragnok, but he wasn’t able to.For a god to look through the eyes of their life forms, one of two things was required: first, the life forms needed to have strong faith in the god, and second, the life forms needed to let the gods watch from their perspective.\nThe second point undermined the authority of a god, but in a realm where gods couldn’t interfere, the demigods and life forms automatically held the highest authority.\nThus, he wasn’t able to look through the eyes of Ragnok. He tried many other life forms and finally was able to connect with one.\nHe saw the giant cities and the happiness of the life forms under the leadership of Ragnok.\nHe knew that even if he decreed the return of the life forms to Solara, it would be pointless.\nBut he still tried his best and gave the divine command to return to Solara.\nBut the life forms, now under the influence of Ragnok, refused to return.\nThese life forms knew that even if they returned to their world now, only torture awaited them.\nThey were much happier in the Realm of Advancement, anyway.",

      "content": "Chapter 75: Ch 75 : Fire-works\n\"Stop wasting your time, no one is going to come back,\" Sunny said to Kairos, his voice filled with a cold, detached amusement.\nHe was having all the fun he could possibly have.\n\"What did you do?\" Kairos snarled, his voice trembling with a mixture of anger and fear.\nHis nostrils flared as he took ragged breaths, his eyes fixed on the empty Solara.\n\"Oh, actually, I did a lot of things, but you didn’t,\" Sunny said, his tone dripping with sarcasm.\n\"That’s the reason those poor souls left you.\" He then laughed, a sound that seemed to echo in the emptiness of Kairos’s God space.\n\"Well, I will show you some fireworks for this joyous occasion.\"\n\"Start Plan B,\" Sunny said with a mental connection to Thea.\n\"Yes, Master,\" Thea replied, her voice filled with anticipation.\nImmediately, all the trillions of particles of Thea that were already present in Solara used replication to multiply further.\nSunny spent about one billion faith points on this act, but he didn’t even feel a sting of pain, as he already possessed more than 70 billion faith points.\nAs the particles spread to every corner of Solara, a chain reaction of explosions began.\nThis was Thea’s new talent, which she called Destruction.\nThis talent was not given by Sunny; it was something Thea had mastered on her own.\nIt allowed Thea to explode her particles to produce an explosion large enough to cover a 100-meter radius.\nThis was possible with just one particle; now imagine the billions of particles currently available in Solara.\nShe could have exploded them at the same time, but she took her time, slowly exploding one area after another, a grand fireworks show.\nKairos’s heart felt the pain of watching his world be devoured by Sunny’s will.\nHe immediately descended upon his world and tried to destroy the energy particles of Thea.\nBut when he destroyed one particle, it still exploded, triggering more explosions in a terrifying chain reaction.\nSunny, in Kairos’s God space, recorded this scene for future use.\nHe looked at the fireworks with a basket full of popcorn and a coke, a perfect picture of a bored spectator.\nIn just a few minutes, the whole of Solara was nothing but dust.\nAll the explosions directly disintegrated the molecules, leaving nothing but a something that looked like an astroid.\nSunny, bored, then stopped the 3D call, and his consciousness returned to his own God space.\nKairos looked at the desolate world and felt his soul crumble.\nHis faith remained at a hundred thousand points, as no more faith was drained because there were no more lives left in Solara.\nTotally crushed, he remained in his world for an hour or so, but then got up and went back to his God space.\nHis blood boiled again upon seeing the popcorn and coke that Sunny had left behind.\n[Can his projection even eat and drink?]\nBut slowly, his gaze wandered toward the embryo floating in his God space.\nHe quickly ran toward it. He didn’t have many faith points left, but he still picked it up, as the weakest demigod was enough to kill all his life forms in the Realm of Advancement.\nHe wanted revenge on them for leaving the god who created them.\nHe used his remaining faith points on the embryo, but no changes occurred. Suddenly, from the inside of the embryo, a blue energy was released, which then manifested into a system panel.\n[Thanks for the faith points, God Kairos]\nBelow this, there was a description of the embryo.\n[Item Name: Explosion Embryo\nGrade: SSʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\nDescription: A detailed copy of a divine embryo, but when faith is poured in, instead of turning into a demigod, it explodes accordingly to the faith points provided.]\nAs Kairos looked at the description, the divine embryo and the system panel exploded with a large boom.\nNothing happened to Kairos, as he was a god, but this was very humiliating. But there was nothing he could do...\nThe next part of the mission was giving system access to all the life forms of Solara who now lived in the Realm of Advancement.\nThis was a walk in the park for Thea. She gave a mission to Ragnok, which was to explain what the system does to the public.\nAnd as all the life forms fully trusted Ragnok, the system was provided to all of them.\nImmediately, they had their own server, which was different from what the people of Veridia used.\nThe first video that was uploaded was by Thea, which showed Kairos using his powers to cause explosions all over the world of Solara.\nThis further enraged the public opinion toward Kairos.\nThose who didn’t believe the system went through the portal to check, only to find their world in ruins.\nThey felt a newfound respect for Ragnok, who was responsible for their departure from Solara.\nIf it weren’t for him, they would have been caught in the explosion.\nNow, even the small faith that was being generated for Kairos was nowhere to be seen.\nHe was not even able to peek at these life forms.\nHe was now truly alone: no gods, no demigods, no life forms.\nSunny, currently in a happy mood, gifted one billion merits to all his demigods, directly reducing his faith points by 20 billion. Currently, the demigods of the races were constantly blessing many of the life forms in their race.\nBut blessings from the other gods like Nova, Umbra, Shenlong, Loki, Thea, Cerberus, Isiah, Mammon, Uranus, and Gaia were difficult to get.\nNova still had a race, so technically, she was a demigod of a race, but she didn’t possess the talent for copying talents from the race.\nSunny gave her the talent of copying talents every 500 years.\nEvery demigod was currently looking for life forms that were a good fit for their personality and strength.\nAs time passed, the true terror of blessings was found.\nNova, who was good at using transformation magic, unlocked a skill of transformation that consumed mana to transform her into a human, a dragon-born, and a dragon.\nAnd as she blessed Thalorax with her blessing of Absolute Defense and Transformation Magic (S-Grade), this made Thalorax able to transform into a dragon form using mana.\nNow, they were not only a dragon-born; they could become a dragon too.",

      "content": "Chapter 76: Ch 76 : New Era\nIn the 12th hour of the 9th day, the cosmic canvas of Veridia’s sky was no longer a blank page.\nFor decades, the world had been remade, not by Sunny’s intervention, but by a spark of demigod’s ingenuity that had ignited a fire of transformation across the very fabric of life.\nThe old races—elves, humans, dwarves, giants—looked up in a state of wonder and awe.\nWhere once only birds soared, now there were majestic and giant dragons weaving through the clouds, their scales shimmering with arcane light.\nBelow them, ethereal angels drifted, their forms radiating a soft, gentle light, and the clanging of armor heralded the flight of fierce Valkyries, their shields polished to a mirror shine.\nThis was the dawn of a new era, born from a profound discovery that a demigod’s blessing could transfer more than just a simple talent; it could transfer a pure magic spell.\nIt had begun with Nova’s blessing to the leader of the dragon-born, Thalorax.\nNova was already well versed in transformation magic, and even developed a magic spells to transform into the dragon born form.\nShe blessesed Thalorax with this magic spells as a test, the result of this test were astonishing.\nThalorax who was Dragon born was now able to use transformation magic to transform into a Dragon.\nThis discovery made all the Gods spend more time trying to discover such spells, many DemiGods even sought Nova for it.\nThe demigods of life, Uranus and Gaia, were quick to act on this revelation.\nTheir goal was simple: to bring a sense of order and purpose to the inevitable end of mortal life.New ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄhapters are published on ɴo(v)elFɪre.ɴet\nThey worked tirelessly, weaving a transformation spell that allowed a being to transform their mortal body and take on the form of an angel by consuming mana.\nIt was a spell of immense complexity, a symphony of light magic and grace.\nThey began blessing lifeforms with this gift, starting with the races whose natural beauty and slender forms were best suited for the role.\nThe elves, with their elegant features, took the transformation effortlessly, as did the fairies, pixies, and certain graceful human, beastfolks and merfolk clans.\nTheir new forms were magnificent, radiating a gentle light that seemed to calm the very air around them.\nBut not every blessing was a perfect fit.\nWhen a towering titan or a burly giant attempted the angelic transformation, the result was... unexpected.\nInstead of an ethereal being of light, they became hulking masses of muscle with massive, feathered wings—powerful, yes, but far from the grace and elegance of their counterparts.\nThis led Uranus and Gaia to select their blessings with careful consideration, ensuring a balance of beauty and strength in their creations.\nEven for Nova, if she blessesed a human or other lifeforms with transformation spell, they wouldn’t be able to use it, because this transformation required the blood of a dragon.\nFor those who were not chosen for the angelic path but still possessed a fiery spirit and a talent for combat, there was another path.\nThe demigods created the Valkyries, warriors blessed with formidable fighting skills and a powerful mastery of light magic.\nTheir purpose was solemn and vital, a necessary counterpoint to the gentle nature of the angels.\nThe angels, which were given the talent of Soul Plucker, had the sacred duty of carrying the souls of the virtuous to a new, ethereal realm—a fledgling heaven.\nThe Valkyries, armed with their courage and a shield of divine light, protected these souls from being devoured by the many lurking monsters on the way.\nThis newfound system of an afterlife, born from the collective will and hardwork of the demigods of life, was a raw, new concept, a path to the heavens that had never existed before.\nIt was a rudementry way, but both of them were working hard on perfecting this way.\nWhile Uranus and Gaia were forging a path for the souls of the righteous, Umbra, the demigod of shadows, followed her own route.\nShe, too, mastered a transformation spell, her transformation magic worked like Loki’s shapeshifter talent, as she could transform into any lifeform.\nBut these transformation were only able to give her the shape of that lifeform, not the colour.\nThus, even after transformation, she was still black as a shadow.\nShe blessed certain races with the ability to become one with the shadows and also the transformation spell, giving rise to a new, mysterious shadow race.\nThey were silent hunters, unseen guardians who moved through the world like whispers in the dark.\nHowever, all of these beings from the demigods were born from blessings.\nTheir powers were an extension of a spell, not an innate part of their being.\nBut this problem was soon solved by a lifeform.\nIt began with a single female dragon-born, a creature already blessed by Nova’s power. She sought to bear a natural-born dragon, a being that would embody the true, untainted power of the dragons.\nFor months, she held her full dragon form, a state that was physically and mentally taxing beyond measure.\nTo sustain the transformation, she consumed countless mana stones, each one a precious crystal of concentrated energy.\nNova, seeing her unwavering resolve, provided a constant supply of energy to her, a silent form of support in this unprecedented endeavor.\nWhen the long, arduous pregnancy was finally complete, the female dragon-born laid a single egg.\nThe months that followed were filled with bated breath and quiet anticipation.\nThe world watched through the constant live stream of the system, as the egg finally cracked and from it emerged the first trueborn dragon—a creature of pure, innate power, its scales already shimmering dark glint.\nThis video spreaded like wildfire, with the title of ’a living testament to the power of the demigods and the resilience of their creations’\nThis single success inspired a new wave of creation.\nSoon, natural-born Angels, Valkyries, and Shadow beings began to appear across Veridia, each one a living miracle that solidified their races’ place in the world.\nAnd with this immense power came a necessary balance.\nThe truly powerful beings, like the true dragons, had an extremely low reproduction rate, a biological limitation that kept their numbers low and their power sacred.\nThey would remain a mythical, revered presence, not an overwhelming force.\nThe fifty years that followed saw the complete transformation of Veridia.\nThe very concept of life and death changed. With angels and Valkyries to guide them, lifeforms no longer feared oblivion; their existence now had a purpose, even in death.\nThis shift in belief created a sense of harmony and structure that had never before existed.\nThe demigods’ newfound mastery of blessings had a profound ripple effect throughout the world.",

      "content": "Chapter 77: Ch 77 : Greed\nThe demonic capital wasn’t a city built; it was a scar on the very face of existence, a place where reality itself had curdled and turned malevolent.\nThe air was a suffocating, hot blanket, thick with the scent of burnt flesh and the cloying sweetness of rot.\nStructures, impossibly tall and jagged, clawed at a sky the color of a deep red.\nThey were not made of stone but of solidified malice, their surfaces slick with a sheen of oily black and their edges sharp enough to tear a soul.\nEvery street hummed with the collective, crushing weight of a million powerful auras,\nIt was a city of predators, where every corner held a silent promise of violence and the only currency was power.\nYet, amidst this landscape of pure terror, a single shop stood as a grotesque monument to a different kind of horror.\nThis was the \"Fresh Meat Corner,\" a shop that catered to the specific appetites of the demigod demons.\nHere, one could find the meat of any race imaginable: elves, humans, titans, giants, and every other life form the multiverse had to offer.\nFor a race whose tastes were as diverse as they were depraved, a source of fresh meat that was never empty was nothing short of a wish come true.\nIt was a place where a demigod could satisfy a craving for a specific species, a place that felt tailor-made for their every need.\nA small, silver bell above the shop’s entrance chimed, a shockingly clear and melodious sound that felt completely out of place in this cacophonous city.\nThe shopkeeper, a small lizard-faced demon with a perpetual nervous twitch, looked up from wiping down his counter.\nA hulking shadow filled the doorway.\n\"Welcome, Mr. Geryon,\" the shopkeeper said, a polite and warm tone carefully masking a deep, bone-weary exhaustion.\nGeryon was a demon from the bull race, a brute with skin the color of scorched earth and a thick, silver ring piercing his broad nose.\nHis eyes were like twin coals, and a contemptuous sneer was a permanent fixture on his face.\n\"Quit with the yapping,\" he grunted, his voice a low, gravelly rumble that seemed to shake the very foundations of the shop.\n\"Bring some of your best wine and dragon meat.\"\n\"Yes, Mr. Geryon,\" the shopkeeper said with a long, drawn-out sigh.\nHe disappeared into the back of the shop, which was more of a cavernous butchery filled with strange hooks, bubbling vats, and the lingering scent of blood.\nSeconds later, a stack of plates and a few bottles of wine floated out of the shadows.\nThe shopkeeper, using his immense mental force, gently guided them to Geryon’s table.\nEach dish settled with a soft clatter, a testament to the proprietor’s careful control.\nGeryon wasted no time. He tore into the food with a ferocity that was almost a blur, a chaotic symphony of chewing and gulping.\nHe devoured different cuts of dragon meat and chugged bottles of wine as if they were water.\nThe shopkeeper watched, a silent, unblinking observer to this grotesque feast.\nWhen the last plate was scraped clean and the last drop of wine was consumed, Geryon wiped his mouth with the back of a calloused hand and looked up, his coal-like eyes settling on the shopkeeper.\n\"Write it on my tab,\" he demanded, his voice a gravelly command.\n\"Of course, Mr. Geryon,\" the shopkeeper said, a forced smile plastered on his face as he saw the customer off.\nHe waited until the massive form of the bull-demon was gone, then let out a deep sigh of frustration that he hadn’t allowed to escape before.\n\"What tab?\" he muttered under his breath, his small, beady eyes narrowing. \"You haven’t paid me in six months.\"\nHe began the tedious work of cleaning the dishes, a quiet, repetitive task.\nHe was lost in his own thoughts, a whirlwind of calculations and quiet satisfaction.\n\"Why is this old demon not looking elsewhere\" Mammon thought, but his body showed no such signs.\nSince the last half an hour, he has been feeling a gaze of some powerful demon demigod.\nIt was the gaze of the demon king, a powerful and suffocating aura that had been focused on him for what felt like an eternity. He waited, his muscles tense, until the pressure finally subsided.\n\"Oh, he finally left me alone,\" the shopkeeper said, a genuine sense of relief in his voice as he shed the mask of the nervous proprietor.\nFor this unassuming lizard-faced demon was none other than Mammon, the sin of Greed.\nHe had been living under different guises for the past 75 years, playing a long, dangerous game of cat and mouse in the heart of the demonic realm.\nHis first five years were spent in the guise of a prominent demon named Xar’gath.\nMammon had spread a cunning lie: that he had returned from a plundering mission on a far-off planet, bringing back a horde of priceless artifacts and the fresh meat of exotic lifeforms.\nIt was a simple ruse, but it was enough to make the demigods close to Xar’gath flock to him like vultures to a carcass.\nHe gave them everything they wanted—the artifacts, the food—without asking for anything in return.\nHis power was both a blessing and a curse to his victims.\nHis unique talent dictated that if someone took something from him without providing something of equal value, then upon their death, Mammon would gain everything from them as compensation.\nBut it wasn’t just a simple trade. His Slow-Poison talent made them more and more addicted to this unfair trade, a psychological trap that lured them deeper and deeper into his web of deceit.\nSlowly, one by one, the demigods close to Xar’gath began to vanish.\nIt would have caused an immediate uproar, but Mammon was always one step ahead.\nAs soon as a few of his victims disappeared, he would seamlessly change his form, becoming a new demon with a new identity. The demon king, suspecting nothing, had no reason to question a new face in the crowd.\nAs more and more demigods vanished, the demon king finally took action, by increasing the patrolling in the capital.Nᴇw novel chapters are publɪshed on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\nBut this didn’t affect Mammon’s killing spree at first.\nHe was too clever, too fast.\nIt was only when the demon king personally began to check all the demigods in the city that Mammon was forced to change his strategy.\nHe needed a cover, something so audacious and simple that no one would ever suspect it.\nHe opened the \"Fresh Meat Corner,\" a shop that sold the meat of every lifeform you could think off.\nIt was the perfect disguise. Most demons paid their dues in mana stones, which didn’t activate Mammon’s talent, as it requires then to not pay for something they took from Mammon.\nBut still, a few demons, like Geryon, were so consumed by their own greed and arrogance that they refused to pay.\nThey were the ones who became hopelessly addicted to the unfair trade, their unpaid tabs kept on stacking his slow-poison talent on them.\n\"I should return home after the death of this blockhead,\" Mammon said to himself, a wicked grin forming on his face.\nHe reached into his storage ring and pulled out a single, unadorned wooden plate.\nIt was a simple vessel, but its purpose was anything but simple.\n\"I should gift this to Brother Cerberus,\" he said, his voice filled with a cold, triumphant glee.\nHe reached into his own form, pulling a soul from his essence and placing it on the plate.\nA number, glowing with a soft, malevolent light, suddenly floated above the plate in his hand.\n[299]\n\"That bull head should be the last soul to fulfill this goal of mine,\" Mammon said, his grin widening into a truly terrifying sight on his lizard face.\nHe was so close to his goal, and the thought of it made his heart thrum with a dark, triumphant joy.",

      "content": "Chapter 78: Ch 78 : Thorn’s Test\nIn the Realm of Advancement, two serpentine dragons, one massive and the other a mere fraction of its size, soared in silent harmony above a sprawling, verdant forest.\nThese were Shenlong and Thorn.\nShenlong, a being of pure grace, moved with the unhurried elegance of a mountain,\nwhile Thorn, though smaller, flew with a newfound strength, the transformation a part of his talent Dragon-born, which consumed the essence of hope.\nBut this consumption was miniscule compared to the essence of hope being collected from billion of lifeforms.\nAs they flew, a system panel flickered to life before Thorn’s eyes, a gentle chiming sound alerting him to an incoming video call.\nIt was from Anaske.\nA genuine smile touched Thorn’s lips, and he quickly accepted the connection.\nIt had been months since he had last spoken with his son, and a pang of fatherly affection mixed with a hint of nostalgia filled him.\n\"Father, where are you right now?\" Anaske’s voice, tinged with a faint worry, came through the screen.\n\"I’m currently in the Verdant Expanse,\" Thorn replied, using the forest’s name he was currently in. \"Why do you ask? Is everything alright?\"\n\"Well, I only wanted to know if you’d be coming back,\" Anaske said, his tone a mixture of longing and understanding. \"But after looking at the distance between us, I don’t think you will be.\"\n\"I want to come back, but I have my duty to follow,\" Thorn explained gently.\nHe was committed to his mission, to help more and more lifeforms.\n\"What do you need me for? You’ve never asked such a thing before.\"\n\"There are many life forms that want Demigod Shenlong’s blessings,\" Anaske explained earnestly.\n\"He’s the only demigod with only one apostle, you see. The others have hundreds of Apostles.\" Anaske’s words carried the weight of a leader.\n\"And I can’t contact Demigod Shenlong myself; that’s why I came to you.\"\n\"And here I was, thinking you were just missing me,\" Thorn chuckled, a warm, fatherly sound that resonated through his reptilian form.\n\"I’m not a kid now, Father,\" Anaske defended, a hint of playful exasperation in his voice. \"I know your responsibilities.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Thorn conceded with a laugh.\n\"Well, he doesn’t need to be there to give his blessings. I already told you how my blessing came to be.\" The blessing, a powerful manifestation of Shenlong’s will, was a gift that could be bestowed from anywhere.\nTheir chat continued for a few more moments, a rare moment of familial connection, but then, Thorn’s senses went on high alert.\nHis expression turned serious.\n\"I’ll call you back later, Anaske,\" he said, his voice now low and urgent. \"There’s something important we need to do.\"\nAfter a quick, heartfelt goodbye, Thorn hung up the call.\nHe looked down toward a small city nestled in a valley below, his heightened draconic perception immediately picking up the detail of approximately four thousand life forms within its walls.\nThe city was currently under attack by a horde of demons, a chaotic storm of malice and violence.\nBoth Shenlong and Thorn gazed toward the one demon who was giving the orders.\nHe was a towering figure, his hunched back giving him a perpetually monstrous silhouette.\nHis arms were long, so long that they almost touched the ground as he moved.\nHis face was a contorted mask of pure, maniacal laughter.\n\"Archers, move your hands faster! Melee fighters, be more bloodthirsty! Take the meat of these weak life forms home, your family is hungry!\" the leader roared, his voice amplified to an unholy, booming sound that was audible to both the demons and the panicked humans in the city.\nThe demon leader’s maniacal laugh deepened, but he suddenly felt a powerful gaze upon him.\nHe also felt the gaze of Thorn, but in his eyes, Thorn was just a weak creature, a mere flying reptile. He paid him no mind.\nA panel manifested in front of Shenlong’s eyes, which had already deduced all the information about this powerful demigod.\n[Name: Shax\nProfession: Sound Mage (SS-Grade)\nTalents: Reality Talk (SS-Grade), Sound Affinity (SS-Grade), Magic Affinity (SS-Grade), Mana Recovery (SS-Grade), Mana Reservoir (SS-Grade)]ɪꜰ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴀɴᴛ ᴛᴏ ʀᴇᴀᴅ ᴍᴏʀᴇ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs, ᴘʟᴇᴀsᴇ ᴠɪsɪᴛ\nThe demon, Shax, looked toward Shenlong, and his laughing face turned serious and arrogant. \"Oh, a flying snake. In my presence, you shouldn’t fly. Come, kneel in front of me!\"\nSuddenly, an invisible, oppressive force pulled the bodies of both Shenlong and Thorn toward the ground.\nThe pressure was immense, But just then, Shenlong used his own powers.\nThe essence of hope that was stored in his body suddenly materialized and covered the bodies of both Shenlong and Thorn.\n\"My master gave me the ability to fly, so you don’t have the right to take it away from me,\" Shenlong said in a calm, cold voice as if he were simply stating a fact.\n\"As for kneeling in front of you? You should kneel to the heavens and repent for your arrogance.\"\n\"Well, you do have some strength, but that isn’t enough in front of me,\" Shax said in his signature arrogant tone.\nAs his words rang out, a subtle magic took hold of Shenlong, and the strength on his body began to visibly decrease.\nShenlong felt his strength draining, but he didn’t panic at all.\nInstead, he looked toward Thorn and said, \"What do you understand by his talents?\"\n\"Master, from his Reality Talk talent and the way his powers work, I guess his powers are related to what he says,\" Thorn analyzed, his mind racing to put the pieces together.\n\"Somehow, whatever he says changes reality itself.\"\nThis type of rapid-fire analysis was common for Thorn now.\nHis powers of deduction had been further enhanced when he gained a new talent named Analyser, which allowed him to easily break down and understand complex concepts.\nAs if listening to Thorn’s analysis, Thea, through the system panel, showed the full talent description of Reality Talk.\n[Talent Name: Reality Talk\nGrade: SS\nDescription: Gives the user the ability to bend reality with their words.\nNote: It consumes mana according to the complexity of the thing you wish to change.]\n\"Well, you are right for once,\" Shenlong said, chuckling at Thorn, his calm demeanor never wavering.\n\"I am learning,\" Thorn replied, still baffled by his master’s ability to find humor in a situation where he himself felt a deep, existential dread.\nThe description of Shax’s talent made him question his very life, as this talent was something only a god should possess.\nThe only drawback, the huge mana consumption, was also not a big deal for Shax, whose other talents—Mana Regeneration and Mana Reservoir—allowed him to store vast amounts of mana and regenerate it at incredible speeds.\nHis talent was further enhanced by his Sound Affinity, which meant his words were not just commands to reality, but lethal weapons in their own right.\n\"Thorn, your second assignment for today is to guess how to beat this demon with only one miracle,\" Shenlong proclaimed, a twinkle in his draconic eye.\nThe battle for the city was about to begin, but first, a god’s apprentice had a riddle to solve.",

      "content": "Chapter 79: Ch 79 : New Goal\n\"Master, the situation is already very bad. Why do you need to test me in this situation?\" Thorn pleaded, his voice tinged with genuine fear.\nHe could feel Shenlong’s strength ebbing away, a slow, terrifying drain.\nThe powerful pressure that Shax had applied was still at work, a testament to the demon’s monstrous talent.\n\"Not to scare you and all,\" Shenlong replied, his voice calm as still water, \"but my strength is still decreasing. In a minute or so, I will not be his match.\"\nHe liked to tease his disciple, but there was also a genuine reason for this.\nHe wanted the brute-force-loving Thorn to learn how to use his mind, not just his muscles. \"Thus, you need to think of the reason, and quick.\"\nThorn didn’t reply this time. His mind was racing, his newfound Analyser talent working at full capacity, dissecting every shred of information he had on Shax’s terrifying ability.\nAfter a few seconds, he blurted out, \"Master, why don’t we just blow him to shreds?\"\n\"It’s possible, but is this the most efficient way?\" Shenlong replied casually, his question a gentle prod.Googlᴇ search ɴovᴇl(F)ɪre.ɴet\nHe wanted Thorn to see beyond the obvious, to find the weak point in an opponent’s defense.\nThorn, who relied on brute strength needed to learn to rely on his brain more, to use Shenlong’s blessings.\nThorn fell silent again, his mind frantically searching for a weakness in Shax’s reality-bending talent.\nWhile all this was happening, in a certain God Space, a god’s face was filled with worry as he looked through the eyes of his lifeforms.\nHe was not idle in the face of this disaster; he had quickly reached out to the God Chat for multiple strategies.\nBut due to the immense time difference between Godly time and planetary time, before anyone could even answer, half of his lifeforms in the Realm of Advancement were already dead.\nHe immediately looked through the eyes of one of his remaining lifeforms, hoping to find a strategy to defend against the demons.\nBut no mortal strategy could tackle the might of a demigod without having a demigod of your own.\nHe felt a wave of despair wash over him upon the death of so many of his creations, but there was nothing he could do.\nThe only thing he could do was provide what little strategy he could to stretch the time as much as possible, a desperate measure to save what little was left.\nJust as this was happening, he gazed at the demigod Shax through the eyes of an archer on the city wall.\nHe noticed Shax was looking up at the sky, his face a mask of pure anger.\n\"Who is this demon talking to?\" the god thought, feeling even more despair now, as he feared that another demon had appeared.\nHe tried to look through the eyes of the watcher in the watchtower of the city. T\nhese watchers possessed a very keen perception and sharp eyes, a talent he had given them to protect his people.\nFrom the watcher’s eyes, this God began to form a shape of the flying creature.\nIt looked like a flying serpent, majestic and imposing.\nBut upon closer inspection, he immediately thought of a mythical being from his home planet.\n\"Shenlong?\" he whispered in an astonished tone. \"Doesn’t that mean it is a demigod of a God?\" he surmised, a flicker of hope now shining in his desperate heart.\nBut he wasn’t able to open the God Chat yet, as even a single second wasted by him would be a thousand second wasted on the Realm of Advancement.\nHe thought of a plan and descended into his home planet, which made his body now match the planetary time.\nHe immediately opened the God Chat and typed.\nApolo: \"The God with Shenlong as a demigod, can you please help my lifeforms survive this misfortune?\"\nHe attached two images to this message. The first image was of Shenlong, and the other image was of the attacking demons.\nHe awaited the reply, and soon the chat flooded with thousands upon thousands of messages.\nThe speed of messages was in thousands per minute, but only for him, who was in his planet.\nFor others, the chat was a blur because of the multiple replies from the gods.\nIn the God Space of Sunny, Thea explained the situation.\nApolo’s message appeared on the screen, detailing the plight of his lifeforms and the terrifying power of the demon demigod Shax.\nSunny replied simply, \"ok.\"\nHe immediately asked Shenlong to finish this battle fast.\nBack on the battlefield, Shenlong looked at Thorn, his voice as calm as still water. \"I guess your time is up, Thorn,\" he said, adding, \"Master wants to finish this battle fast.\"\nThorn was currently in a trance, his mind working and analyzing the possible solutions.\nHe suddenly said, \"What if... what if we turn him into a mute?\" He then looked at Shenlong, who was currently gliding towards the city.\nThe demon demigod was now lying on the ground, unable to move.\nHe was trying to say many things, his mouth opening and closing, but no sound came out.\nThe reason was simple: there was no tongue in his mouth.\n\"Eh! Already finished,\" Thorn said in an astonished voice.\nHe had been so engrossed in his analysis that he had completely missed the final, brutal moment.\n\"Follow up, boy,\" Shenlong said in a loud but calm voice.\nThorn immediately began to use his S-Grade Body Strengthening and Super Strength talent to bash all the remaining demons in the army.\nIn just half an hour, the entire demon army was finished by Thorn alone.\nThe battle was over, and the city was saved.\nIn the God Chat, Apolo typed a message, thanking Sunny for his help.\nApolo: \"Thank you, Lord Cosmos.\"\nThe God Chat immediately erupted in a flurry of comments as gods praised Sunny.\n\"It’s not a big deal,\" Sunny typed, his words a stark contrast to the flurry of praises, and then, with a flicker of his consciousness, he closed the God Chat.\nHe was already fed up with the endless praise and flattery from the other Gods.\nTheir compliments, while meant to be encouraging, felt hollow.\nThey were celebrating a single battle won, while he was looking at the war ahead.\nHis mind was already focused on his true goal: making all the Gods stronger with him.\nThey were too preoccupied with their own planets and spheres of influence to see the larger, more terrifying picture.\nThe demons would only continue to grow stronger, feeding on the despair of dying lifeforms and the power of fallen Gods.\nThe victory over Shax was just a temporary reprieve, a small win in a war that was only just beginning.",

      "content": "Chapter 80: Ch 80 : Subordinates\n\"I guess I know why we delivery men didn’t get as much money as we deserved,\" Sunny muttered to himself, watching the digits of his faith points tick up at a snail’s pace.\nIt was a joke, a tired analogy he often used to describe his current predicament.\nHe was the source, the wellspring of all demigodly power, but he was also the one constantly footing the bill.\nHis faith points, once a rapidly multiplying cascade, were now increasing with frustrating slowness.\nThe reason was simple: he had too many mouths to feed.\nThe merits system, while an incredible tool that made his demigods self-sufficient, was a curse for Sunny.\nFor every bit of merit his demigods earned, it consumed a piece of his divine faith.\nAnd since Thea’s Manifestation talent was designed to consume merit instead of faith for demigods , all of his demigods were currently feasting on his cosmic reserves.\nHe wasn’t too worried about it, though.\nThe more faith they consumed, the stronger they and the lifeforms under his influence would become.\nIt was the 14th hour of the 9th day, two hours had passed since Sunny had aided the struggling God named Apolo.\nApolo, in a moment of utter desperation and profound relief, had offered to come under Sunny’s leadership.\nHis reasoning was sound: once Shenlong left, his city in the Realm of Advancement would once again be vulnerable.Thɪs updatᴇd by No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nIf he could come under Sunny’s banner, his creations—the lifeforms he so deeply cherished—could survive this harsh, unforgiving world.\nSunny had no reason to refuse a God who was submitting to him so readily.\nHe immediately gave the order to Nova.\nThrough the dragon-born people who had received her blessings, an S-Grade teleportation array was swiftly constructed.\nThis array was a marvel of cosmic engineering, capable of transporting beings across the entire Realm of Advancement, but it required a corresponding portal at both ends to function and a huge amount of mana stones.\nThe dragon-born, utilizing their rare Space and Time blessings, completed the task with a speed that defied logic.\nThe connection of the two realms didn’t provide Sunny with any immediate, tangible power, but it did make his sphere of influence a bit larger, which was a small victory in itself.\nThe only remaining concern was the loyalty of this new God. But Sunny didn’t have to worry about that.\nThea, with her all-seeing eye, had been keeping a close watch on the behavior of every God in the God Chat, from their reactions towards their creations to the private conversations they had with other Gods.\nHer analysis of Apolo was nothing short of a divine report.\nApolo was a very kind and hard-working God, who was always worried about his lifeforms.\nHe even blamed himself for the thousands of lives he had lost.\nFrom his words and actions alone, Thea didn’t even need to use her more advanced analytical talents; anyone could tell the nature of Apolo. He was a good soul.\nApart from this alliance, Sunny had also brought back the soul of Shax after the battle and gave it to Cerberus, a powerful soul to be judged.\nCerberus was currently the only demigod without any apostles or a race of his own.\nIt wasn’t because he lacked merits to do so.\nIn fact, he held more than two billion merits, more than enough to bless many lifeforms.\nThe only reason he wasn’t doing this was that there was simply no work for him to do.\nAs the lifeforms had learned about heaven and hell from the holy book, ’The Genesis’, they knew nobody would want to go to hell, especially since it was portrayed as even more torturous than it really was.\nAnd since they were already under the watchful eyes of Thea, the crime rate was effectively zero.\nCerberus was, in essence, a divine anachronism, a god of punishment with nothing to punish.\n\"Two hours left, then I can acquire a new talent,\" Sunny said, looking at the time on his system panel.\nHe wasn’t worried about the talent he would acquire this time.\nHe had already chosen it, a talent that would perfectly complement his grand plans.\nHe was currently thinking of his next moves regarding the other Gods who wished to be under his leadership.\nEvery day, countless Gods talked about this in the God Chat.\nThere wasn’t even a single God who wished to be on the bad side of Sunny.\nMany of them even wished for Sunny to take them as his subordinates, but Sunny politely declined them all.\nHe had nothing to gain from them.\nBut Gods like Apolo were the Gods he could truly benefit from.\nBy making these Gods his subordinates, Sunny could begin to spread his faith far and wide, without having to do the work himself.\nStill, he needed to create a formal position for these Gods, something he would think about later.\n\"I should play some games. It’s been a while since I played games with Nyx, Zir and Reflection,\" Sunny said, a wave of his innate laziness washing over him.\nSometimes Sunny would get hyped up for things, but in the end, his real nature was that of pure, unadulterated idleness.\nThis innate laziness was not only corrupting him but also his demigods.\nApart from Thea, Shenlong, and Nova, all the other demigods were currently enjoying their leisurely lives.\nWe shouldn’t talk about Cerberus, as he was already unemployed.\nUranus and Gaia, the demigods of life, were currently only thinking about how to perfect the way to the heavens for the souls of the dead.\nAll their other duties were left to their many apostles, the Angels and Valkyries, who handled the day-to-day affairs.\nIsiah, the demigod of knowledge, was only responsible for finding worthy lifeforms to be his apostles.\nAll his other tasks were done by the apostles themselves.\nFor example, all the knowledge Isiah gained was directly divided among his hundreds of apostles.\nThese apostles then created multiple light orbs and stored this knowledge in the Divine Library.\nThe souls of the lifeforms to be called to the library were decided by other apostles.\nThus, it created a beautiful, well-oiled structure in the Divine Library, where every apostle had their own work to do, freeing up the demigod for more important, and less strenuous, work.\nMammon was currently back from his long mission and was currently resting, while his apostles were causing a ruckus in the demonic realm.\nHe was a demigod who had truly embraced the life of leisure.\nUmbra, though now having her own race, still worked everywhere at once through her multiple clones.\nShe was a silent predator, present in all the continents and even in the Realm of Advancement at the same time, always watching, always waiting.\nBut her main body always rested in the shadow of the statue of God Cosmos, in the center of the capital city in the Realm of Advancement, a paradox of divine vigilance and profound stillness.\nIn stark contrast, the demigods of the races that were used to competition, worked hard on making their race stand out.\nThey were even currying favors from the other demigods for blessings for their lifeforms.\nThe universe was a battlefield of divine ambition, but for Sunny, it was a long game of cosmic chess, and he was ready to take a break.",

      "content": "Chapter 81: Ch 81 : New Campaign\nIn the demon realm, a place of suffocating dread and brutal, unrelenting ambition, power was the only law.\nSeven demonic empires ruled this twisted landscape, each a monolith of terror with countless kingdoms and cities cowering in its shadow.\nWithin these cities, only a few of the highest-level metropolises were granted the privilege of having a demigod to watch over them.\nIn one such city, a brutal battle was in full swing, shaking the very foundations of the obsidian streets.\nTwo powerful demons, both figures of authority, clashed in a storm of raw magic and physical force. Their fight sent shockwaves rippling through the city, drawing a crowd of other demons who, in their own sadistic way, flocked to witness the violence.\n\"How dare your son try to poison my daughter! I will tear you into shreds!\" one demon roared, his voice thick with a vengeful fury that seemed to set the air ablaze.\n\"Now you’re blaming my son?\" the second demon bellowed in return, his features twisted in a mask of fury. \"Your daughter, that evil witch, tried to seduce my son! This is her fault!\"\nWhile the two fathers ripped into each other, their children, the supposed victims, watched from a distance.\nIn the shadows of a crumbling building, a young male demon watched the chaos with a cold, detached smirk.\nIn a mansion across the city, a young female demon looked down from a balcony, a similar, chilling smile playing on her lips.\nThey were the architects of this bloody feud, the ones who had orchestrated this conflict between their fathers, all for one singular purpose.\nThey were not worried in the slightest; they wanted their fathers to die, as that would give them the position of the family head.\nAfter a long, gruesome battle, one of the two demons finally fell, a sickening crunch echoing in the sudden silence.\nThe other, clearly wounded and breathing heavily, looked down at his daughter running toward him, a rare smile on his face.\n\"Daughter, I have taken revenge for you,\" he rasped, coughing up a mouthful of black blood. \"We will soon destroy their entire family.\"\n\"Father, you should rest,\" the daughter said in a very worried and loving tone, her voice a beautiful lie. \"Take this healing pill to stabilize yourself.\"\nThe father, deeply moved by his daughter’s affection, let his guard down for the first time in his life and immediately swallowed the healing pill she offered.\nUpon taking the pill, his eyes widened, his face twisting in a horrifying mix of betrayal and agony.\n\"What did you feed me?\" he said weakly.\nHis body began to contort, his stomach melting, his flesh corroding, until his entire form melted into a puddle of black, viscous fluid on the ground.\nHis daughter looked down at the gruesome sight, her expression a mix of satisfaction and cold detachment.\n\"Dragon burning pill,\" she whispered to herself.\nShe then turned and walked away into the now-quiet streets of the city, vanishing into thin air as if she had never been there.\nIn a meeting room of a different mansion, many demons sat at a round table, the solemn occasion being the selection of a new head of the family.\nThe same meeting was taking place in some other clan.\nThere was no need for such formality, as both family heads only had one child each.\nThus, without any further mishaps, the son and daughter of the two great demons became the family heads of their respective families.\nA calm, pleasant voice echoed in Sunny’s mind. [Master, the demon cities under our control have reached fifteen]\nA system panel materialized, displaying a detailed map of the demonic realm.\nThe map was a tapestry of colors: green, yellow, orange, and red.\nThe green cities, only fifteen in number, were under Sunny’s direct control.\nThe yellow represented cities in the process of being subjugated.\nThe orange represented cities without demigods, while the red represented cities with demigods.\nIt turned out that the son and daughter were both apostles of the demigod of mischief, Loki.\nMammon’s apostles were only responsible for trading and preying on the demons that didn’t pay for the things they bought, a perfect system for acquiring souls and merit.\nWhile the capturing of entire cities fell to Loki’s apostles.\nThey worked in a slow, deceptive way, picking the heirs of the strongest clans and using their shape-shifting talent to impersonate them.\nThey would either cause discord among rival clans or wait for the heirs to naturally rise to a position of power.\nThis slowly infected the demon realm, bringing multiple strong clans under the direct control of Sunny.\nSunny’s plan was clear and audacious: to bring many strong clans under his control and then begin to subtly change the faith of these demons from their current Gods of Discord to Mammon or Diablo.\nThis would create another path of faith for Sunny, which he really needed at this point, as his faith supply was increasing very slowly.\nEven the God Chat was nowadays a quiet, arid place compared to the bustling, lively exchanges of previous days, as many of the Gods didn’t have much time to chat.\nAnd even Thea’s Manifestation function wasn’t earning as much faith as it did, as the Gods had already manifested whatever they wanted through this function.\nThus, he desperately needed another source of faith points, and the demonic realm was the best possible source.\nAfter all, these seven Demon Lords possessed a whole realm that was even bigger than the multiverse.\nThe fact that only seven powerful demons lords managed this realm would make it impossible for them to find the slow, creeping anomaly of the demons slipping away from their grasp.\nIt was a silent, bloodless coup on a scale that only a God like Sunny could orchestrate.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the\n\"Only fifteen?\" Sunny mused, a casual thought passing through his mind as he looked at the intricate map of the demonic realm.\nThe green spots, representing the cities now under his control, seemed so few and far between on the vast, corrupted landscape.\nThen, he let out a soft chuckle. \"Well, it’s only been two hours since I started this.\"\nFor a mortal, conquering fifteen cities in a bloody campaign would be a generational achievement, a feat of immense military and strategic power.\nBut for Sunny, it was just the beginning of a new project, a minor achievement barely worth noting.\nHis demigods, particularly Loki’s apostles, were a force of pure efficiency, and they were already moving with a speed that defied mortal comprehension.\nIn his mind, the number \"fifteen\" was just the first tiny ripple of a tsunami he was about to unleash upon the demonic realm.",

      "content": "Chapter 82: Ch 82 : Adam’s prediction\n\"Still 30 minutes left for the next talent acquisition,\" Sunny sighed to himself.\nA mere thirty minutes was less than the blink of an eye for a god, but for Sunny, it felt like an eternity.\nHis talent acquisition had already been enhanced to one talent every eight hours, a rate that would make any mortal gasp in disbelief.\nYet, his impatience, a very human trait that had followed him into divinity, still gnawed at him.\nHe wanted it to be even faster, but there was nothing he could do.\nThe reason for this infuriatingly slow pace was the sheer scale of the SSS-Grade treasures that the old Gods had left behind in the Realm of Advancement.\nThis information, along with many other cosmic truths, had been shared by Adam in his three-hour speech on the day the old system had died.\nBecause of the treasures, both Veridia and the Realm of Advancement were equally important in the grand cosmic scheme.\nThis meant that the time difference between the two worlds couldn’t be too vast, as a large discrepancy would negatively affect the lifeforms in both realms.\nBored, and with nothing to do, Sunny decided to visit Adam.\nHe appeared in the modern house that Adam lived in and his eyes immediately fell upon Adam.\nAdam now looked even more ethereal, his form so translucent that it seemed as if at any second, he might simply vanish into the shimmering light of Sunny’s God Space.\nHe wasn’t engrossed in a game as he had been on Sunny’s last visit, but was instead looking at Veridia, a rare expression of quiet contemplation on his face.\nA smile, as luminous as it was fleeting, appeared when he saw Sunny.\n\"So, what does our God Cosmos need to know from this old soul?\" Adam said, his voice a soft echo, a tone so full of humor that it almost made Sunny forget the reason for his visit.\n\"I just came to visit you, as your old soul is about to return into the Cosmos,\" Sunny replied, returning the joke with his own.\n\"Haha, Cosmos, you do have some humor,\" Adam said, his laughter a silent, beautiful light.\n\"Well, let’s cut to the chit-chat. I wanted to know, is there any way to save you?\" Sunny said, his voice now serious, the jesting tone gone.\nAdam thought for a second, the light of his form flickering. \"There is a way, as you know. SSS-Grade treasures can have wondrous effects on a God.\"\nSunny nodded. He hadn’t used any SSS-Grade items yet, but the effect of the SS-Grade treasures he had used was more than enough to make him understand.\n\"And there exists a Pill of Life. It is an SSS-Grade treasure that only appears once every few million years,\" Adam continued, looking at Sunny, trying to read his face for any sign of greed or even hope.\nBut Sunny showed no emotion at all. He just listened and nodded, his expression completely unreadable.\n\"I understand,\" Sunny said, his voice devoid of any emotion.\nAfter a while, he said his farewells to Adam, but a seed of thought had been planted in his mind.\nSunny sat on his throne, his thoughts wandering. He looked at Veridia, the planet now a living, breathing testament to his power, but his thoughts were on his conversation with Adam and his talent, Divine Growth.\nThis talent had a function that allowed it to evolve any talent to SSS-Grade with prolonged and continuous use.\nHis thoughts suddenly drifted towards his affinity for the Law of Manifestation, and he decided to use his Divine Growth talent to evolve this talent.\nHe decided to manifest the base of his future source of income.\nHe first manifested a subspace within his God Space, a pocket of nothingness.\nThen, from the vast cosmic dust and gases, he manifested a huge chunk of a new world, a place of his own creation.\nHe then used his faith to increase the pressure on the dust and gases to form a perfect sphere, a new planet, large enough to accommodate ten billion people.\nHe didn’t stop there. He manifested air, an atmosphere, and planted the seeds of different kinds of fruits and trees.\nThen, in a final, majestic act of creation, he created a fireball from his faith, a never-ending sun burning at around fifteen million degrees Celsius. Sunny made this fireball rotate around the sphere in an elliptical path, bringing light and heat to his new world.\n\"A few more finishing touches,\" Sunny said in a voice filled with a sense of mysterious satisfaction.\nHe then manifested a portal near the subspace, and it consumed around twenty faith points.\nThis portal was a doorway, a link between his God Space and the subspace he had just created.\nThen, Sunny created another portal, but this time, it was far away from the first one. It still costed him twenty faith points.\n\"How strange. It still takes just twenty faith points, even after I doubled the distance between the portal and the subspace,\" Sunny mused, a new question now on his mind.\n\"Does that mean distance is not the key here? So how does it work?\"\nSunny wanted to solve this mystery. He could manifest a portal to any subspace after analyzing the portal to the Realm of Advancement, but he didn’t know the mechanism behind it.\nHe wanted to understand the reason behind it.\nHe called Nova, the demigod of space, to understand the mechanism behind this.\nOnly a painter truly knows how to draw, and only a master of space would know the true nature of such a portal.\nIn a few seconds Nova arrived in the God space of Sunny.\nNova bowed respectfully in front of Sunny and began to analyze the portal according to Sunny’s wishes.\n\"Master, the principle behind this portal is actually very simple. It connects two points of space and joins them. This thing is easy to create if we have the coordinates for both locations,\" she said, her mind currently in a state of epiphany.\nSunny didn’t disturb her. He knew that for a demigod, such an epiphany meant a huge opportunity.\nIt could allow Nova to create a new spell or even an entirely different opportunity.\nAs all this was happening, Adam, floating like a ghost, arrived outside of his house and looked towards Nova.\nHe then turned to Sunny and, with an expression of profound certainty, said, \"Your dragon has a huge chance of becoming a God in the future.\"\nThis statement sounded like a melodious ringing in Sunny’s ears, a divine prophecy.\nHe quickly looked towards Adam and asked him for the meaning of his statement, his mind already racing with the implications.",

      "content": "Chapter 83: Ch 83 : Old ways\n\"You new Gods, you don’t know it yet, but lifeforms can also become a God,\" Adam said, his enthusiastic tone a stark contrast to his vanishing figure.\nSunny’s mind reeled. \"Doesn’t that counter what you told us previously?\" he countered, his voice sharp with a hint of betrayal.\nAdam had told them all that a lifeform couldn’t become a demigod unless they were a hero, and now he was dropping a bombshell that blew a hole in that entire rulebook that the Gods created upon his words.\n\"That was just to save you,\" Adam replied calmly, the wisdom of ages in his voice.\n\"There have been multiple cases where a demigod under a God became a new God and then killed the old one to take his place. It’s a sad, predictable story, but a common one in the old days.\"Googlᴇ search NoᴠᴇFɪre.nᴇt\n\"So why did you only tell me about it?\" Sunny asked, his curiosity now overriding his frustration.\n\"Well, she will still be loyal to you, as she is created using a Divine Embryo,\" Adam said, as if stating a fundamental law of the universe.\n\"That’s why I said to you all that the Divine Embryo is the most important thing to a God. Not only will the creature you create always listen to you, but they can even evolve to become a God while still being bound to you.\"\nSunny felt that Adam was particularly more talkative today.\nIt was as if he were an old man, signing all the property documents for his children because he knew he was going to die soon.\n\"So can she become a God?\" Sunny asked probingly, pushing for more information.\nHe knew that if it were any other time, Adam wouldn’t have told him, but now he could ask many things, and Sunny didn’t want this rare opportunity to go to waste.\n\"Actually, there are two ways to become a God,\" Adam said dramatically, pausing for a few seconds to let the anticipation build before continuing.\n\"The first way is through the sheer comprehension of a law of the world. If your dragon can comprehend the true meaning and function behind any of the laws related to her talent—like space, time, strength, defense, or fighting—she can become a God of that law.\"\nListening to this, Sunny’s thoughts drifted to his own talent.\nThe old system had given him the title of God of Manifestation, which was now converted to Manifestation Affinity upon the system’s demise.\n\"Does that mean I am the God of Manifestation?\" he thought, and then shook his head, pushing the thought aside. He could think about that when he was free.\nAdam continued, blissfully unaware of Sunny’s thoughts. \"This way of becoming a God has its own pros and cons. For example, if there is a God of Fire, then you can’t achieve Godhood unless the God of Fire dies because of something. A law can only be governed by one God.\"\n\"But you guys are also very lucky,\" Adam blabbered on, \"as the old Gods are already dead, so your lifeforms and you have a chance to become a God of any laws.\"\nAfter a few minutes of blabbering about the pros and cons of this, he moved on to the second way of becoming a God.\n\"The second way is through the faith of a race. If billions of lifeforms believe in you as their God, you will start to earn the faith from the lifeforms. This faith is what will help you in becoming a God,\" Adam said, his voice now filled with a strange, otherworldly energy.\n\"Currently, your dragon can become a God through both of these ways. He already possesses a race, the dragon-born, that takes him as their ancestor God, and a new race is being created by his blessings. When the number of lifeforms in these races becomes large enough, he will be able to jump the barrier between a demigod and God. That will be the time your dragon becomes a God.\"\nSunny, with this newfound knowledge, was already on cloud nine.\nThis situation meant that his territory could have multiple Gods in the future, as most of the demigods in his territory had a race under their control.\n\"You can also try to comprehend a law according to your talent and then become a God of that law,\" Adam gave Sunny his suggestions.\n\"The more you delay, the more there is a chance of some other Gods comprehending that talent and becoming a God.\"\n\"What is the difference between the Gods of a law and the Gods of a race?\" Sunny asked.\n\"A God of a race is a God who derives his powers from the faith of his lifeforms. Without this faith, that God is nothing,\" Adam said.\nHe waited for Sunny to digest this knowledge and then added, \"While a God of a law is a powerhouse in its own right. They have a power system of their own. For example, a God of Fire can control any fire in the whole multiverse without consuming anything. But if he wants to build a new fire, he would have to use energy, for example, faith, mana, etc.\"\n\"They are beings capable of overturning the entire universe with just a flick of their hands,\" Adam replied to Sunny’s question.\nSunny, like a curious child, continuously asked multiple questions, and Adam, like a wise elder, replied to all his questions patiently.\n\"I always wanted to ask you, how did you manipulate the Gods to give you their Divine Embryos?\" Adam asked Sunny, a question that had haunted him since the day the old system died.\nIf the part of his soul that was transformed into the system hadn’t died, he would have easily been able to know this.\nBut that part of his soul died, and he knew nothing about any God.\nHe didn’t know any of their talents, what they did during the seven days, or how Sunny had traded so many items that he crashed the system’s warehouse of faith.",

      "content": "Chapter 84: Ch 84 : New Talent\nSunny pondered in his mind, \"Should I tell him the truth?\" He thought, his mind racing through all the possibilities, weighing the pros and cons.\nWas it wise to reveal such a fundamental secret to a soul that was about to vanish?\nHis hand, which was now hovering in the void, clenched in silent contemplation.\n\"If you are not comfortable sharing this, I will not force you,\" Adam’s voice, as wispy as a dying flame, replied. He was already a dying soul anyway.\n\"It’s not like that, actually,\" Sunny said, a faint smile on his face. \"I have an affinity toward the Law of Manifestation, and I manifested these embryos through it.\"ʀᴇᴀᴅ ʟᴀᴛᴇsᴛ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀᴛ No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\nHe didn’t hide this fact, as all the Gods in the chat were already aware of this, though they had no idea of its true significance.\n\"What?\" Adam felt a profound shock upon hearing Sunny’s words.\nHe felt as if he was looking at a ghost, even though he himself was the one who was hovering in the air like a phantom.\n\"You possess the affinity for manifestation?\" Adam said, his thoughts becoming more and more chaotic.\nThis was a truth so fundamental, so rare, that it shouldn’t be possible for a new God.\n\"Is that something rare?\" Sunny asked, a voice filled with a hint of pleasure.\nHe knew that if Adam, an old God with billions of years of experience, reacted this way, it meant this was something truly valuable, something on a level far beyond his current understanding.\nHe could feel the divine energy in Adam’s voice trembling.\n\"You don’t know anything, it’s the blessing from the mother void\" Adam said, his voice now filled with a profound reverence as he mentioned the ’Mother Void’.\n\"The Law of Manifestation, or as many call it, the Law of Creation, was the first law to be made by the Mother Void herself. She is the source of all existence and non-existence.\"\nSunny knew that these old Gods were born through the Void, which was why they called the Void their mother, but he didn’t know that this Void was an entity on its own.\nHe quickly came out of his thoughts as Adam began to mention more cosmic secrets.\n\"This law was the one responsible for the creation of both the Gods and the Void Beasts. Even the demons were created by this Law of Manifestation,\" Adam’s breathing quickened as he looked at Sunny.\n\"It is a blessing of the Void, not just any law. It is the very source of life and creation in the universe.\"\nSunny was also shocked upon listening to the information that Adam provided, his head spinning with the implications.\nHe felt his blood boiling; he knew that if what Adam said was the truth, then this Law of Manifestation was truly a power capable of overturning an entire multiverse.\nHe could create Gods, demons, Void Beasts, and a whole new cosmic hierarchy.\n\"What is the grade of this affinity?\" Adam questioned Sunny, forgetting about his elderly demeanor.\nHe even forgot about his own teaching of not telling anyone their talents.\n\"SS-Grade,\" Sunny said, his voice filled with a hint of pleasure.\nHe was also looking forward to Adam’s analysis.\n\"Oh, it’s still good, but if it were SSS-Grade, you could have a 70 to 80 percent chance of defeating those Demon Lords,\" Adam said, immediately breaking Sunny’s confidence.\nThe vast gulf between SS and SSS was still a grand mystery to Sunny.\n\"Is this the only talent you have?\" Adam questioned, as having multiple talents was not rare among Gods.\n\"No, I have another talent, but I am not telling you about this,\" Sunny said, a hint of playful mischief in his voice.\nHe didn’t want Adam to know of his innate talent.\nIf he told Adam of this talent, Adam would immediately know of Sunny’s motive behind asking him to visit his world.\nAdam didn’t ask further; he just wanted to check a fleeting thought of his, but it seemed he would have to forget about this.\nSunny didn’t know that his decision not to tell Adam of his talent would make him even more shocked in the future.\nAdam returned to his house, the light of his being now flickering and dim.\nHe had only a day or less left; his soul was almost vanishing.\nSuddenly, a new figure arrived outside his house.\nThis figure was a being clad in shining armor.\nThe face of this being felt too handsome to look at, as if a person’s soul would be stuck to him if they didn’t take their eyes off him.\nThe back of this figure held two angelic wings, emitting a divine light whenever they moved.\nThis was the male demigod of life, Uranus. He was a being of pure, serene beauty.\n\"God Adam, I am here on my master’s order,\" Uranus said, his voice as calm and serene as a still lake.\n\"For what?\" Adam replied as quickly as Uranus finished talking.\n\"To take you to heaven,\" Uranus said in a calm tone.\nSunny, after the departure of Adam, sat on his throne and began to ponder about everything that Adam had told him today.\nSuddenly, the voice of Thea came to his ears, and a panel materialized in front of him.\n[Master, the cooldown on your talent is finished]\nIt was not that Thea knew of Sunny’s talent; she couldn’t know any of the talents of a God through her Omni-Cognition talent.\nShe could at most guess. It was just that Sunny had told her to notify him after every 100 years passed on Veridia.\n\"Oh, I can finally acquire a new talent,\" Sunny thought.\nUpon saying this, he used his Skill-Resonance talent on a new guest in his territory.\nThis talent was not used on a lifeform from Veridia, nor from the Realm of Advancement. It was neither Adam nor his demigods.\nHis consciousness drifted towards Veridia, and from there, he found Cerberus, the demigod of death.\nHis consciousness entered Cerberus’s body, not to see the organs of Cerberus, but to enter the Netherworld.\nFrom there, he found the soul of the demon demigod Shax, trapped and bound.\nThis soul possessed the talent of Reality Talk, which uses energy to bend reality.\nSunny used his talent to copy this talent from Shax, and immediately, he felt a familiar sensation, a feeling of pure triumph and victory, as the new power surged through his whole body.",

My, my.\" He immediately willed his God’s Eye to show him the talent’s full description.\n[Talent Name: Divine Command\nGrade: SS\nDescription: The reality bends with your command.\nThe Chances of lifeforms being born with sound affinity increases.\nThe chances of lifeforms having innate regal aura increases.\nNote: The things you wish for decides how much faith will be consumed]\n\"Another leech, sucking on my faith resource,\" Sunny said with a sighing tone.\nHe already had too many talents that devoured his precious faith points.\nBut as he looked at the description again, a wide, appreciative smile spread across his face.\n\"It’s still worth every penny.\" The power to command reality itself was a trade-off he would make every time.\nHe decided to give it a try. He took a deep breath and, with a voice that held the weight of a thousand stars, he uttered four words: \"Let there be light.\"\nAs these words fell from Sunny’s mouth, his entire God Space immediately lit up.\nA blinding, pure light seemingly appeared out of nowhere, turning the entire cosmic void from its initial dark, ethereal vibe to now a brilliant, shining star.\nSunny, not liking the overpowering lighting, immediately said, \"Turn back to normal.\"\nAs soon as the words left his lips, the light vanished, and the calm, cosmic vibe of his God Space returned.\n\"What a great talent,\" Sunny said, his mind already racing with the possibilities.The source of this content ɪs\nThe use cases of this talent were many, and he knew he could now manage many situations with just a simple command.\nHe then started experimenting by using different commands.\nHe willed for the evolution of life in the Subspace of the newly created sphere, and it did.\nHe willed for the time to accelerate thousand of times in the subspace, and it did.\nBy thousand times the time, the seeds that Sunny buried in the ground of the planet began to grow at an alarming pace.\nWhatever he wished for, it bent reality itself to create that thing.\nSunny knew he could now wish for the death of a Demon Lord, like Deimos. And he would die with certainty.\nBut wishing for such a thing was clearly not viable, as it would require a lot of faith points—a resource he was currently struggling to maintain.\nHe now had a talent for basically everything, the only drawback being the massive consumption of faith.\n\"I need to quicken the project of spreading the faith in the Realm of Advancement and in the demonic realm,\" Sunny said to himself.\nHe needed many faith sources to cover the expenses of his creations and talents.\n\"Wait... Can Mana Regeneration evolve into Faith Regeneration?\" Sunny thought, a flicker of pure genius in his mind.\nHe pondered about the evolution of talents upon copying them.\nWhat if he copied Mana Regeneration talent from some lifeform, and it evolved into Faith Regeneration, providing Sunny with a lot of faith points?\nThe potential was staggering. Sunny decided to experiment on it later, as his innate talent was on cooldown.\nSunny decided to focus on upgrading his talent of Manifestation Affinity to SSS-Grade.\nFor this, he needed to know about how manifestation worked—the complex rules required to use this law.\nSunny sat on his throne and focused on manifesting a wooden stick.\nImmediately, a wooden stick appeared in his hand, as if it had always been there.\nSunny didn’t know how it appeared or the mechanism behind it.\nHe needed to learn it, instead of just using it.\nHe began experimenting, noting everything down. But at this moment of his learning, he seemed to have forgotten that Thea also had a talent for manifestation, and she could easily tell him about the things he was trying to learn by himself.\nThea, watching her master learn something, didn’t disturb him.\nShe thought her master was learning something new and didn’t want to get in his way.\nIt took Sunny around three hours to just understand the rules behind this and now he needed to comprehend these rules further.\nAfter three more hours of intense concentration, he finally comprehended the entire law of manifestation up to the SS-Grade.\nThe real challenge would start from this step. Sunny sighed; this was truly a boring and uninteresting thing to do.\n\"How can my clones just sit there and learn magic and fighting techniques the entire day?\" Sunny said with a chuckle and then added, \"Are they even my clones? They are totally different than me\"\nSunny decided that two of his clones would comprehend the Law of Manifestation from now on.\nNow his clones worked as follows: Two for Magic, two for fighting techniques, two for the Law of Manifestation, and three as watchers.\n\"Adam is safe for now, the heaven realm can keep him alive for a while, but I don’t know how much time he can last with that cursed soul of his,\" Sunny said in a worried tone.\nHe knew from Adam that the Demon of Curses had placed a curse on him when he was escaping from the demons.\nAnd this curse was not simple; the restrictions on the heaven realm could keep this curse at bay for a while, but it was a ticking time bomb.\nThat was the reason Sunny asked Uranus to take Adam into the realm of heaven.\nHopefully, Sunny could upgrade his manifestation talent until then.",

      "content": "Chapter 86: Ch 86 : Earth\n\"This world will be called ’Earth’ from now on, a birth ground for talents,\" Sunny declared, his voice a low hum that rippled through the newly formed planet.\nHe was filled with a strange, nostalgic sense of purpose as he surveyed his latest creation.\nThis world was a perfect replica of the Blue Planet he was born on, an exact copy down to its manaless, mundane existence.\nThe time here was ten thousand times accelerated compared to his own perception, a small, brilliant detail he had added to his cosmic blueprint.\nHis purpose for this world was simple and strategically brilliant: a talent farm.\nHe knew from experience that the more powerful the lifeforms, the more difficult it was for them to breed.\nConversely, the weaker a lifeform, the faster they reproduced.\nIn a manaless world, where all the lifeforms would only have a few hundred years to live, they were weak and reproduced at a staggering rate.\nThis, in turn, would multiply the chances of good \"seedlings\" appearing, giving him a constant stream of new, S-Grade or even SS-Grade talents, a source that was far more efficient than anything available on Veridia.\nAnd the beauty of this divine plan was its elegance.\nThere could be many people just like Sunny on this world—people who dreamed of going to a fantasy world, killing demons, and saving beauties.\nSunny, in his infinite benevolence, would fulfill the wishes of these lifeforms by giving them a new life in Veridia or some other world he would create in the future.\nHe would be the hero-maker, the fulfiller of dreams.\nHis first thought after creating this planet was to let other Gods enter this world through the portal that Thea could manifest into their God Space.\nBut he quickly dropped this idea.\nThe virtual Blue Planet that Thea had already created in the game world worked just as well for them.\nIt was already perfectly real, with all the senses similar to a normal human.\nThus, they didn’t require the real Blue Planet for now, but Sunny knew he could create such a planet anytime if the need arose.\nSince the creation of this world, six hours had passed for Sunny, and he had done nothing but sit on his throne, painstakingly learning the manifestation talent.\nIt was now two hours left for the ninth day to end and the tenth day to start.\nIn those six hours, six thousand years had already passed on the Earth he had created.\nHe had specifically created such a time difference through his Divine Command talent.\nIt was not just the accelerated time that had allowed for the development of human towns and cities; it was his Divine Command talent.\nHe had willed for humans to evolve, and they did, blossoming like a butterfly from a caterpillar.\nSunny would give them two thousand more years, and then he would decrease the time difference. He didn’t want such a large time difference, as it could become a problem.\nHe wouldn’t know when a disease occurred and destroyed all the humans.\n\"My talent farm is working just fine,\" Sunny said, as he looked at a few of the lifeforms with S-Grade talent in farming or fishing.\nHe knew that as civilization progressed, there would be many more talents, for example, talent for management, strategy, and more.\nWhy was Sunny doing this instead of just creating a new Demigod?\nWell, it was not that complicated. Yes, Sunny could create a new Demigod, but those demigods should be of a law, and there couldn’t be multiple demigods for a single law.\nAs Sunny now knew the way for his demigods to become Gods, he didn’t want any of his creations to be stuck at being a demigod.\nSecondly, Sunny wanted to see a live novel unfold before his very eyes.\nHe wanted a lifeform to feel like a main character in a novel, to grow from the bottom, use his imagination to develop Veridia, and use his powers to defeat demons.\nYes, demigods could do that, too, but they only fought a demigod of a demon race.\nThere had to be a hero in every generation that took care of the lower-grade demons, too.\nAnd this would be done through the lifeforms that Sunny would transmigrate from the Earth he created.\n\"Sounds good,\" Sunny said, a smile on his face.\nHe then asked Thea to keep an eye on Earth. If any disease or something that endangered the lifeforms occurred, she should inform him immediately.\nHis next plan was to connect the worlds of all the Gods in his Cosmic Alliance.\nThe alliance consisted of just a few hundred members.\nThese were the Gods connected since the beginning of the Cosmic Alliance, as Sunny hadn’t added any other Gods after the initial recruitment. These Gods had everything at 25% off in the system shop.\nSunny first made a video call to Zir, the connection appearing almost instantly.\nOn the other side of the video call, Zir, an elegant and divine figure, appeared.\nHis clothes looked magical and majestic, like an emperor’s.\n\"Quite a nice outfit you’re wearing,\" Sunny said, chuckling, as he knew the source of this dress.\nThey often teased each other while playing, and Zir was quite famous for \"picking\" up good clothes from his lifeforms.\n\"Boss, this time they offered it to me willingly, I swear,\" Zir said with his innocent-looking eyes.The source of thɪs content is N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n\"I believe you, Zir,\" Sunny said, laughing. After joking and chatting for a while, Sunny came to the main point. \"Does your world have a lot of evildoers?\"\n\"There are actually. There are multiple talents that become too arrogant and end up doing something evil,\" Zir shared the design of his world.\nZir’s world was not just any world with mana; it had an S-Grade mana vein, something that very few worlds possessed.\nThus, the talents in his world developed very swiftly.\nHis world only consisted of two races: elves and mermaids.\nThe elves that evolved in Zir’s world were different from the elves that were available in Sunny’s world.\nIn Sunny’s world, the elves evolved through gazelles, but in Zir’s world, elves were born from the mana veins themselves.\nThus, they were beings made to utilize mana; their comprehension and use of mana skills were top-grade.\nOn the other hand, the mermaids were a perfect match for these elves, as a mermaid’s tear could upgrade any magical talent by one grade (up to S-Grade).\nThese mermaids traded these tears with elves, and in return, the elves gave them the magical artifacts and spells they created.\nThis was actually a very powerful world compared to many other Gods’ worlds.",

      "content": "Chapter 87: Ch 87 : The Convertor\nIn Zir’s world, a world of ancient, vibrant magic, the demigod was not a creature of flesh and blood, but a being of immense, unmoving power.\nIt was the World Tree, a colossal, living monument whose roots burrowed deep into the planet’s core, and whose branches scraped the heavens.\nIts consciousness was so vast that it felt less like a mind and more like the heartbeat of the world itself.\nThis demigod was a silent protector, its presence a shield that warded off any demonic incursion.\nAny demon fool enough to attack Zir’s world would not face a sword or a spell, but the full, devastating force of a planet’s will.\n\"You never mentioned your world was this good,\" Sunny said, his voice a genuine whisper of awe.\nHe was not joking.\nZir’s world was a marvel of cosmic synergy, a perfect, self-sustaining ecosystem where every part worked in harmony.\nThe two races were a perfect example.\nThe elves, born from the very mana veins of the World Tree, were masters of magic.\nTheir understanding and use of mana were top-tier, a natural extension of their being.\nThe mermaids, born from the oceans, were their perfect complement.\nA single tear from a mermaid could upgrade any magical talent by one grade, a priceless commodity that they traded with the elves.\nIt was a partnership of immense power, a symbiotic relationship that made Zir’s world a bastion of magical might.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by N(o)vᴇl(F)ire.nᴇt\n\"Thanks, boss,\" Zir said, his voice filled with a hint of coquettish pride.\nAfter discussing many things about their worlds, Sunny came to the reason for his call.\n\"Do you want to implement the concept of heaven and hell into your world?\"\nZir was momentarily stunned. He immediately understood why Sunny was questioning him about the evildoers in his world.\nHe thought for a second, the implications of such a system rippling through his consciousness.\n\"How so, boss?\" he asked, his voice in a hushed tone.\nHe didn’t want to offend Sunny by questioning him, but this was a thing that would affect his entire world, and Zir, as a God, had every right to know this.\nSunny told Zir all about the demigods of life and death, Uranus, Gaia, and Cerberus.\nHe explained their roles in maintaining the balance of life and death, and how they would handle the souls of the righteous and the wicked.\n\"Okay, boss, I understand now. Is there a fee for such a wonderful privilege?\" Zir said, a wide, playful grin on his face.\nIn their friends’ circle, Sunny was quite famous for his money-making skills.\nHe charged faith for everything he offered, so Zir was currently making a joke of Sunny.\n\"No, no, it was free initially, but not anymore for you, Zir. If you want this, you will have to pay a hundred thousand faith daily,\" Sunny said in a calm and authoritative voice, his face unreadable.\n\"Boss, I was just joking. Please, Boss!\" Zir pleaded, his playful tone gone.\nHe knew a hundred thousand faith daily was a large sum for him.\nAfter a few seconds, Sunny laughed aloud and looked at Zir smugly.\nZir immediately knew that Sunny was pulling his leg.\nHe sighed in relief and then said, \"But how can the apostles of your demigods reach my world?\"\n\"Don’t worry about it, just spread this news with the other Gods in the Alliance,\" Sunny ordered Zir, and then cut off the call after a few minutes of talk.\nHe asked Thea to connect heaven and hell to the worlds of the Gods who would agree to Sunny’s proposal.\nThe vision behind this project was simple: the more souls there were in heaven and hell, the more talents Sunny could find.\nAnd at the same time, he could earn faith from the souls of these life forms.\nJust as Sunny was giggling at the thought of his success, Thea’s melodious voice sounded in his ears, a new, exciting message.\n[Master, I have found an overpowered talent among the life forms of a God]\n\"Oh, for you to praise it this much, I have high hopes for such a talent,\" Sunny said, his voice filled with anticipation.\nImmediately, a system display opened in front of Sunny, showing a newborn child with his attributes.\n[Name: unnamed\nProfession: none\nTalents: Convertor (A-Grade), Magic Affinity (C-Grade), mana Reservoir (C-Grade)]\nSunny’s eyes opened wide as he clicked on the talent of Convertor.\n[Talent Name: Convertor\nGrade: A\nDescription: Can convert any item below the grade of S to mana. The excessive mana will help you break through.]\nOn the surface, the talent seemed good but not amazing.\nBut for Sunny, who could evolve any talent he copied, the possibilities were endless.\nA mundane A-Grade talent in the hands of a God was not a simple tool; it was a key.\nWith this talent, he was sure he could evolve it into a talent that can get faith from the items he converts.\n\"Truly a talent worthy of your praise,\" Sunny said, a genuine smile on his face.\n\"Bind System number 459 to him, and help him reach his potential as fast as possible, then create a portal to teleport him here,\" Sunny ordered Thea. \"With me here, he will not have to worry about his limits.\" Sunny’s voice was filled with a full confidence that was palpable.\n[You are truly great, Master. I was thinking of ways to earn faith from the other Gods, while you thought of recruiting such a talent]\n\"Earn faith!?\" Sunny’s ears perked up, a thought so profound that it made his mind go blank for a second.\nHe knew he couldn’t ask Thea about the way to earn faith points, because Thea had just praised him for something he didn’t even know.\nIf he asked her, his image as a God would become a joke among the demigods.\nHe used a spell for enhancing his brain’s thinking process by a hundred times.\nImmediately, his thoughts started wandering towards all the possibilities of earning faith from this talent.\nIn just two seconds, he placed his hand on the forehead of the projection of Thea, and with a thought and a flow of faith points, Thea gained a large amount of knowledge.\nThis knowledge was quickly digested by the countless particles and Omni-Cognition of Thea.\nSunny felt the loss of another eight billion faith points, a hit that would have crippled any other God.\nHe heaved a sigh. \"I hope I recover these faith points soon,\" he said, the sentiment filled with a tired amusement.",

      "content": "Chapter 88: Ch 88 : Thea’s New talent\nThis flow of faith from Sunny had created a new talent for Thea.\nSunny opened the system display as a habit, even though he was the one who had created this talent and knew its content by heart.\n[Talent: Energy Convertor\nGrade: SS\nDescription: Can convert anything of SS and below SS grade into any form of energy according to your wish]\nThe description of the talent was easy to understand and followed the rule of conservation of energy.\nIt was a simple, elegant idea, but its possibilities were endless.\nSunny manifested a divine sword of SS-Grade and gave it to Thea.\nThea, knowing exactly what Sunny wanted, used her new talent, Energy Convertor.\nImmediately, the sword vanished into thin air, a flash of energy that seemed to be absorbed by Thea.\nSunny felt his faith increasing, a powerful surge of energy that made his heart thrum with a new, divine rhythm.\n\"It worked!\" he exclaimed, a triumphant smile on his face.\nThis talent, this simple, elegant idea, had opened up a new way to earn faith for him.\n\"Introduce a new tab to all the Gods. It should be called ’Bin’. You know the remaining work,\" Sunny said to Thea in a mysterious tone.\nThea nodded, and immediately, all the system panels for every God stopped working, and a few words were written on the system:\n[Maintenance break...59 seconds]\nThe countdown was ticking, but the God Chat was still open, and this created a wave of excitement in all the Gods.\nThey began to speculate, billions upon billions of messages flowed one by one.\nIn this short span of one minute, Sunny earned more than ten billion faith points, as these Gods spammed message after message.\nThis was not an act of annoyance, but their way of showing gratitude to Sunny.\nBecause of him, families and friends were able to meet each other in a virtual world.\nAs the minute ended, the excitement in the Gods’ hearts died like a tsunami crashing.\nThe name of the new tab, ’Bin’, was not much appealing to them.\nMany even cursed Sunny in their minds, but were afraid of being kicked from the system access, so they silently watched the God Chat.\nThe God Chat was now completely empty, no messages, no excitement.\nJust then, a new message popped into the God Chat.\n\"Haha, what a wonderful feature,\" a God typed. Upon reading this message, the Gods were jolted awake from their initial disappointment and quickly opened the tab.\nThe tab consisted of just a single black hole and a line of text that said,\n[Put all the unwanted things in this hole]\nOnce again, all the Gods were disappointed.\nThey were about to vent their frustration in the God Chat, but just then, a few more Gods typed praises.\nThis made the Gods who were about to complain stop in their tracks and try the effect of this new feature.\nThe God Chat went into an uproar once again, as they all realized the true genius of this new feature.\nWhat the Gods lacked the most was faith, as it was required to do everything.\nSunny knew they were Gods created by Adam, and their path to Godhood was the path of faith.\nThus,faith was the most important thing.\nThis was what raised his evaluation for this new talent of Thea.\nThis would not only give Sunny a new faith source but at the same time, it would help the other Gods survive.\nThis was Sunny’s first step to making the other Gods powerful.\nOnce again, Sunny felt a huge amount of faith flowing into his being. \"I missed this feeling,\" he said.\nHis faith directly crossed two hundred billion.\nWhy so many?\nBecause every time a God used the Bin feature of Thea, half of the faith would go to Sunny while the remaining half would go to the God.\nWhen billions of Gods used this feature of Thea, half of the amount from billions of Gods was transferred to Sunny.\n\"With this, my problem of not having faith points is solved for now,\" Sunny said, a feeling of satisfaction washing over him.\nHe could finally lay back and let his demigods and clones do all the work. If he wanted something, he could just ask Thea.\nThis dream sounded good in Sunny’s ears, but it was a far-fetched thing.\nHe was aware of the demon lords, and he knew he couldn’t be too complacent. He needed to improve constantly.\nCurrently in Veridia, apart from magic, technology was also on the rise, a beautiful and powerful fusion of the two.\nThe Machina race, which were like working robots, created wonderful machines with the help of the dwarves.\nTheir latest invention was a machine that could create mana stones.\nIt worked by pressuring mana to transform into a solid state, similar to how mana veins generate mana stones.\nBecause of this invention, the demigods of both the Machina race and the Dwarf race earned a huge amount of merits.\nA new era of travel had also dawned in Veridia. Majestic Mana-Powered Skyships, colossal airships born from the collaboration of human engineering and elven magic, now sailed through the clouds. Instead of conventional fuel, these ships were powered by mana engines, drawing energy from captured mana stones.\nThey were reinforced with magically enhanced dwarven steel and equipped with elf-made teleportation arrays for long-distance travel, making the prospect of interstellar journeys a tangible reality.\nIn response to the constant demonic threat, the mages of Veridia had developed a sophisticated network of magical defenses.\nArcane Wards, powerful, transparent energy fields, now protected the cities from external magical attacks.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\nAt key points along these wards stood Arcane Sentinels, towering, crystalline structures that acted as a backup.\nIf the ward was ever breached, the sentinels could unleash a concentrated blast of pure mana, powerful enough to obliterate any demon below S-Grade.\nThe Machina race and dwarves also collaborated to create a new form of defense: Automated Artificer’s Golems.\nThese golems were not mindless automatons; they were programmed with a basic form of intelligence and patrolled the cities’ walls, ready to defend against any demonic incursion.\nOn the other hand, humans also began to develop modern firearms, like AKs, Macs, shotguns, and more.\nThere was no need for such firearms for the Body Refiners or Mages, who had their own powerful abilities.\nBut for ordinary people, it was a must-have item. As life forms in Veridia didn’t commit any crimes, Sunny didn’t object to the life forms having weapons for their safety, as demons could attack anytime. And these weapons could at least kill the weaker demons.",

      "content": "Chapter 89: Ch 89 : Fear\n\"It’s time to select a talent already,\" Sunny said, a small, satisfied smile playing on his lips as he looked at the system panel, which showed that the cooldown for his innate talent was over.\nHis mind was already set on the next talent he would copy.\nIt was a common talent, one that was the very foundation of the new races of Veridia.\nIt was the talent of blessings, a power that could give a life form a talent, a spell, or even memories.\nHe quickly looked towards Cerberus, who was so unemployed that he just sat all day long in the same place, a patient but bored guardian of hell.\nSunny used his Skill-Resonance talent on Cerberus and copied the talent of blessings. Immediately, a familiar sensation filled Sunny. He was now connected to a new power.\nSunny used his God’s Eye to look at the talent he had just copied.\n[Talent Name: Divine Blessing\nGrade: SS\nDescription: You can bless your life forms with any of your talents, spells that you know, or your memories.\nThe lifeforms you bless, will immediately know who is the one that blessed them and they would slowly become your loyal believer.\nNote: As a God, your blessings can’t be below SS-Grade]\nThe first part of this talent was what Sunny had expected, but the second part was out of his imagination.\nThis was something that could truly help Sunny increase his influence far and wide.\nHe imagined a future where he blessed a life form with an SS-Grade talent, and it became a demigod, a demigod of some other God, but taking orders from Sunny and providing faith to Sunny.\nAnd how can Sunny bless a life form billions of light years away?\nThrough Thea, of course.\nAs Sunny was basking in the joy of gaining another overpowered talent, Thea notified him of another thousand years passing on Earth, the world that Sunny had created himself.\n\"Oh, it’s already been eight thousand years in this world?\" Sunny said with a curious tone.\nHe then used his Divine Command talent to decrease the time difference of Earth and made it similar to Veridia.ᴛhis ᴜpdated by\nThe talents among these life forms from Earth were good, but still not to the standards of transmigrating them.\nSunny gazed towards Earth, a world that was now a vibrant hub of human civilization.\nHe earned a few million faith points from Earth hourly; this was possible because many of these life forms believed in the five elements like fire, water, earth, air, and space.\nAnd since it was Sunny who created these elements, their belief was converted to faith.\nBut a million in an hour was nothing to Sunny, and also they were not creted as a faith source; instead they were there for the talent and ambition like the new Gods.\nIn Earth, as eight thousand years had already passed, human civilization had already flourished very far.\nThe technological advancements were even greater than Veridia.\nBig cities, large buildings, strong roads, drainage systems, and high-tech technologies.\nIt was even to the point that their technology even surpassed Endor.\n[A/N : Blue planet is changed to Endor]\nSunny now didn’t even need to read the novels from the other Gods; he could just read them from the humans of this world.\nAs in these eight thousand years, these life forms had created multiple such games and hobbies.\n\"Thea, start copying all the good movies, songs, and novels and enlist them in the system for the Gods,\" Sunny said, hoping to earn some small change from this.\nApart from all these benefits, there were multiple downsides of Sunny not intervening in this world. Similar to Endor, there were many poor souls in this world.\nThere was no one like Thea on Earth who could be everywhere and with everyone, which could stop crimes from happening.\nBecause of which crime rates were somewhat high in this world, Sunny wanted to do something but decided against it.\nAs he knew he wasn’t a mortal now, and this world was a fair for all, there was no intervention from the Gods or Demons.\nAnd he didn’t know how many times he would have to intervene on Earth if he wanted to save every lifeform there.\nThus Sunny decided to close his eyes to the defects of his newly created world.\nHe decided that this world of his would be without any God or demigods; this world would be a world devoid of any magic and demons.\nThus in a sense, these humans had no one but themselves.\n\"Am I doing injustice?\" Sunny’s head spun with these thoughts, but his goal was clear: it was to create a world similar to his home planet, Endor.\nIn a desolate, ruined world, a voice sounded in a mysterious and mocking tone.\n\"You don’t have any life forms? And your talent is also average. Are you even a God?\" This voice rang in the ear of a God from Endor. This God’s world was destroyed, and all life forms escaped from his planet.\n\"Who is there?\" said Kairos in a voice filled with anger. He was already angry with what Cosmos had done to his world. And now someone else was also mocking him. But upon using his brain, a thought crossed his mind.\n\"How can someone enter my God space? Even Cosmos wouldn’t go unnoticed if he entered. Then who is this?\" His mind was filled with many questions but no answers.\n\"Oh, I sense fear in you. You aren’t as arrogant as I thought you would be. Phobos would have been much happier to find you with that much fear in your heart,\" the voice mocked Kairos again.\n\"Show yourself, instead of running your mouth,\" Kairos said in a voice filled with anger and a tinge of fear.\nSuddenly, a figure appeared in front of Kairos.\nA horrifying sensation crawled over him the instant his eyes fell on this creature.\nIt was a spiritual rust, a corrosion of the soul.\nHis divine body and will, the very essence of his being, began to fray at the edges as if being eaten away by a potent acid.\nThe fear in Kairos’s mind deepend more and more.",

This was something infinitely more powerful, a demon lord.\nThe Demon Lord had the height of around 10 feet, and it maintained a humanoid form, but if one looked at it closely, they would find its body was disturbingly slimy.\nThe slime was concentrated to the point that it became a solid body, yet it still secreted this foul substance wherever it walked, leaving a trail of decay in its wake.\nKairos’s body shuddered involuntarily; he knew that if this demon wanted, he would be killed in a single second.\nAnd his faith points were not enough to even harm a single inch of this demon.\n\"My name is Ichor, the Demon Lord of Corrosion,\" the creature said, his voice a low, menacing hiss that seemed to scrape against the fabric of the universe.\nAs if listening to his words, the whole universe shook, bowing in front of the presence of this demon lord.\nAs if it was afraid of this demon, like this demon kord could just corrode the entire universe if it wanted.\nKairos, who was the nearest to this demon, was the most shocked; he almost cried because of the fear.\nHis divine body was being corroded at a visible pace. He used his remaining faith points just to survive a little longer.\nAdam, currently in the heaven realm created by Sunny, felt this tremor, and his face turned grim.Tʜe sourcᴇ of thɪs content ɪs NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt\n\"It is too soon,\" he said, \"why are they out so soon?\" A worry for all the Gods began to develop in his mind.\n\"I hope you can do something about it, Mother Void has chosen you.\" Adam thought, as he gazed at the sky of the heaven.\nBut his eyes reflected the visage of Sunny sitting in his throne with a similar worried face.\n\"Our hopes lie on you, young man,\" his words not only came from his mouth but were also spoken by all the Gods who had died in the battle a million years ago.\nIn Sunny’s God space:\n\"It is similar... it is that aura. Though somewhat different, it is that aura.\" Sunny said, as he immediately understood from these tremors that a demon lord had entered the multiverse and it was outside the demonic realm.\n[Master, my particles near Solara have been destroyed by some unknown force. The analysis shows that it was Corrosion, not just any normal Corrosion, it was a rapid Corrosion of both body and soul...]\n\"Is your soul hurt?\" Sunny asked in a worried voice.\n[No Master, these particles don’t have any soul, only the particle that is linked with you has a soul, all others are just replications]\n\"It’s a relief then,\" Sunny heaved a sigh of relief and then questioned, \"was it done by Kairos?\"\n[Before I could process anything, all my particles died suddenly]\n\"Well, it doesn’t matter... He is too far away anyway\" Sunny said, but his mind was still engulfed by the pressure he had felt just now.\nThe God Chat was also in chaos because of this sudden anomaly.\n\"What was that just now, did you guys feel it?\" a God typed; he was from Sunny’s universe, thus he also felt the anomaly that happened because of Ichor.\n\"What happened?\" typed another God, curious to know what the other Gods felt.\n\"It was a sudden pressure, it was suffocating, I almost peed,\" replied another God from Sunny’s universe.\n\"+1, except for the peeing part\" typed another God.\n\"+2\"\n\"+213000\"\nImmediately, around two hundred thirteen thousand people upvoted this message.\nStrategist: \"I think this anomaly only happened in our universe. That’s why mainly the Gods from our universe felt it.\"\nAll the Gods agreed with this reasoning, and the game of speculating for the reason of this anomaly started.\n\"What if some type of divine creature is being born? Through its sheer force, it shook a whole universe,\" a God typed, conveying what he felt as the cause of this anomaly.\n\"It could be a birth of a treasure, too,\" another God typed.\nSpeculations were everywhere, but no accurate answer was found.\nSunny closed the God Chat; he found no information there, and no God had vanished from the group either.\nThis meant that the demon lord did not attack anyone.\n\"What is their motive?\" Sunny frowned. A known danger was far better than an unknown danger.\nSunny decided to focus on growing stronger instead of worrying about the danger from an unknown. As all dangers could be solved with strength alone.\nAs if listening to his words, a large amount of magical power emitted from his body.\nSunny had felt this type of feeling many times. It was a breakthrough; he had already become an A-Grade mage.\n\"This feels great...\" Sunny said, as the mana flowing in his body became much denser. He tested his powers, and the result was astounding.\nFirstly, his control over mana and the amount of mana stored in his body increased exponentially.\nThis was expected, but Sunny found his spells powered by faith were also much easier to control now; he could perform miracles with less faith required.\nThis didn’t apply to the manifestation as well as creating demigods, but it was still a great achievement.\nNow, his attack powered with faith could even destroy a whole solar system.\nSunny felt surreal; he, once a delivery man on Endor, turned into a God and climbed all the way to the top of all the other Gods.\nNow his faith even crossed the two hundred billion points, and it was still increasing with the new addition of multiple novels, songs, and movies from his newly created Earth.\nIn a world, a young boy of around 10 years, looked at a digital panel floating in front of him with big round eyes.\n[The Devourer System is pairing with the host.....]",

      "content": "Chapter 91: Ch 91 : The Devourer system\nIn a world governed by a God named Asura, a grand city-sized academy stood as a beacon of hope and ambition.\nThis was the Royal Academy, a sprawling institution dedicated to the cultivation of talent.\nWithin its ancient walls, the most promising young minds were rigorously tested on everything from body strength and magical power to strategic thinking.\nCurrently, in the heart of a vast, domed test hall, a talent assessment was underway, and the atmosphere was thick with the silent expectations of a thousand onlookers.\nOn the main stage, a glowing blue orb of pure magic energy pulsed with a unique charm.\nIt was the final test, the arbiter of a young student’s fate.\nWalking towards it was a handsome, cute-looking boy named Lux.\nAt just 10 years old, he was already considered a prodigy, a once-in-a-century genius whose potential was whispered about in the halls of power.\nHe had already cleared all the previous rounds with the highest scores, and this was the final step to solidify his place in the annals of history.\nLux placed his hand on the glowing ball, and a brilliant light erupted, shimmering for a second before revealing its verdict.\nThe ball showed only two words: \"Magic Affinity (C-Grade).\"\nLux’s shock was palpable. The verdict was a soul-shattering blow that echoed in the silence of the hall.\nHe stood frozen, his mind unable to process the words.\nFor the crowd, the initial shock gave way to a collective sigh of disappointment.\nThe prodigy, the genius, was nothing but a C-Grade talent.\n\"How can that be...\" Lux’s voice was a weak whisper, his mind reeling.The latest_epɪ_sodes are on_the NovᴇlFɪre.nᴇt\nHe was just 10 years old, and everyone—his mother, his relatives, his friends—had all looked at his talent assessment and shaken their heads in silent pity.\nSuddenly, a figure appeared on the stage as if from nowhere.\nThe head minister of the Royal Empire, the father of Lux, a powerful S-Grade powerhouse, stood in front of his son.\nHis presence was so overwhelming that the normal people in the test hall didn’t even notice him until he was right in front of Lux.\n\"Don’t worry, child,\" he said, his voice deep and comforting as he gently patted Lux’s head. \"Talent isn’t everything. Just enjoy your life. Your father can protect you.\"\nThe words were meant to console, but the minister’s eyes were filled with unshed tears.\nHe knew the fate of a lower-grade talent. His son could not break through past the C-Grade, which meant that he, an S-Grade powerhouse, would have to see his own son die in the future.\nIt was something no parent would ever want to see.\nLux, understanding his father’s pain, tightly hugged him, his own eyes filled with tears.\nThis scene changed the entire mood of the test hall, from initial shock to the envy of having such a supportive father.\nEven after the talent assessment test, Lux was still admitted to the Royal Academy, a testament to his father’s immense power and merits for the empire.\nIn the dormitory of the Royal Academy, where every student had their own room, Lux sat alone.\nHe was diligently practicing mana guiding, a boring, repetitive process he had been doing since childhood.\nHe was not a C-Grade mage yet; he was just an F-Grade, and even with his talent, the process was slow.\nSuddenly, a voice sounded in his ears, and a digital panel appeared in front of him.\n[The Devourer System is pairing with the host....]\n[Pairing Complete!]\n\"What is this?\" Lux said, his mind buzzing with a ten-year-old’s curiosity.\nHe tried to touch the panel, his finger hovering over the strange, glowing screen.\nHe had never seen anything like it. As he watched, a status panel materialized, showing him his information.\n[Name: Lux\nRace: Human\nProfession: Mage (F-Grade)\nTalent: Magic Affinity (C-Grade)\nDevourer points: 0]\nThe system was from Thea, and she was the one who had changed the talent appraisal ball to a new, false version that only showed a C-Grade.\nThis was done because Sunny wanted Lux to feel that his talent was a gift given to him by God Cosmos, which would make him follow Sunny in the future.\nAs Lux was seeing his status panel, he immediately understood the features of this system because of his sharp mind.\nHe even asked questions about the Devourer points, which Thea replied to patiently.\n[You can gain devourer points through devouring materials below S-Grade]\nLux tried this out, picking an empty notebook from the shelf and asking the system to devour it.\nThea immediately did so, and a stream of energy flowed from the notebook and into Lux. She converted all the energy into mana and filled it inside Lux.\n\"Woah... What a magical feeling!\" Lux said, his body trembling with the sudden influx of power. \"I think my days of practice feel short in front of this cheat.\" He was oblivious to the fact that he also possessed this talent; Thea wanted to make Lux think that she was the one who had gifted him with this talent, not the other way around.\nLux immediately started using the devourer talent on all the useless items in his dorm.\nHe devoured his old clothes, his empty inkpot, and even his useless notes about cultivation insights.\nHis body began to swell with energy. He sat down and began circulating the mana around his mana veins.\nAfter an hour of digesting all the mana, he broke through and became an E-Grade mage.\n[Congratulations on breaking through the F-Grade, host!]\n[You have received the reward]\nLux, who was just immersed in the feeling of gaining sudden strength, was even more surprised by the message from the system. He immediately clicked on the \"open\" button, and a new message popped up.\n[Congratulations on getting 6 ’Tear of Mermaid’]\nLux didn’t know the use of this reward, but he was certain that this tear was filled with a lot of magic power, as it was understandable by its visuals alone.\nHe immediately claimed the reward, and six shimmering drops of mermaid tears manifested in his hands.\nA digital panel manifested again in front of Lux, showing the uses of this item.\n[Item Name: Tear of Mermaid\nGrade: S\nDescription: Can increase the Grade of talent related to magic.]\n[Note: Only works on talent below S-Grade.]\nThe shame of his C-Grade talent slowly faded away, replaced by a fierce determination.\nHe had a way to fight his fate, and he was not going to give up.\nHe looked at the six shimmering drops in his hands and smiled. The path to power was now open.",

      "content": "Chapter 92: Ch 92 : Talk among DemiGods\n\"Sister, can you open up the space to the demonic realm for me?\" Mammon asked, his voice soft, a rare note of vulnerability in his tone, as he looked at the humanoid body of Nova.\n\"You are the master of the void, Mammon,\" Nova replied, her own voice filled with the wisdom of ages.\n\"Why would you need me to tear the space for you? You can just travel there through the void.\"\n\"It’s not about that,\" Mammon said earnestly, a faraway look in his eyes.\nHe wasn’t the cruel merchant he was with his enemies, but a complex, caring figure with his family.\n\"It makes me remember the day master created me. I want to feel the excitement of a new journey, the kind I felt when I first arrived in Veridia, when I first saw your mighty dragon figure, when I first ventured into the demonic realm.\"\n\"That’s also true,\" Nova said, a gentle smile on her face. She too was remembering the old days.\n\"When master created me, there were no such fancy things on Veridia as there are now. There were only a few humans and some elves, whom I didn’t interact with much at the start. But later, when I got to know them, it was really fun.\"\n\"Oh, then why are you so aloof now?\" Mammon asked curiously. \"You don’t interact with many people nowadays, only some life forms\"\n\"It’s not that I don’t like them. I saw the birth of many life forms on Veridia during my patrols. I even played with many children by becoming as small as a kitten,\" she said, her face showing the emotions of a mother. \"But as these life forms grew, many of them died one way or another, as they were supposed to as a mortal, while I, a demigod, am still alive with their memories.\" Her voice was calm, but the sadness was palpable.\nShe looked toward the dragons that were patrolling the skies of Veridia, a new generation that had no idea of her past.\n\"Well, you can now, can’t you?\" Mammon said, trying to change Nova’s mind. \"With master’s grace, now every life form has a chance to become a demigod, so your initial worries are already solved by master.\"\n\"I also thought of that, but now most of the life forms are the grandsons or granddaughters of the life forms that I protected back then,\" Nova shared her views. \"They don’t even see me as a fellow life form. For them, I am a mighty figure, a mythical dragon.\"\n\"That’s true,\" Mammon said, as he understood the meaning behind Nova’s words. \"A mortal can’t perceive a demigod as a similar entity, just like we can’t perceive our master as similar to us.\"\n\"By the way, you seem eager to go to the demonic realm?\" Nova inquired, her expression now shifting to one of curiosity. \"Last time you stayed in Veridia for five years, but nowadays you only stay for a few days, while the remaining time you spend in the demonic realm.\"\n\"It’s nothing,\" Mammon said, a subtle, smile on his face. \"I have just made a few friends in the demonic realm.\" He didn’t have any plans of hiding this fact.\nHe considered all the other demigods as his brothers and sisters, and he was permitted to do so by his master.Thɪs NovᴇlFirᴇ.ɴet\n\"But aren’t they aggressive, with the constant nagging voice in their head?\" Nova said, as she knew about this from the Veilborn race.\n\"That’s only applicable for the demons living in the empire of Demon Lord Deimos and the demons of the Realm of Advancement, as they are sent there by Deimos,\" Mammon explained. \"But for the demons of the other six empires, there are no such voices\"\n\"But that doesn’t mean they are not aggressive or fierce, but some of them are nice, too. And through my constant travels, I came to know of many demons that are similar to us in many ways,\" Mammon said.\nHe then told many of the stories of the demonic realm to Nova, and she listened to all of them with rapt curiosity.\n\"Sister, I will meet you next time when I visit. It’s time for me to go back, as the time difference between Veridia and the demonic realm is ten times,\" Mammon said after hours of talk with Nova.\nBut just as Nova was about to open up the portal to the demon realm, a loud sound of an animal walking sounded in the ears of both Nova and Mammon.\nThey looked in the direction of the sound and saw Cerberus walking towards them.\n\"Little brother, why didn’t you bring me the souls of the demon demigods this time? You know, earning merits is tough for me,\" Cerberus said, his voice laced with unending boredom.\n\"My apostles are providing you with souls, are they not?\" Mammon inquired, as his apostles worked on their own and weren’t specifically monitored, he thought they were slacking.\n\"No, no, they are, but you know how merits work. The more powerful the soul, the more the merits,\" Cerberus said, his tone was filled with greed for the merits.\n\"Why do you need so many merits? You don’t even have a race to take care of,\" Mammon joked.\n\"I was thinking of creating one. I have decided to create Grim Reapers, and currently, I am working on a spell to transform into a grim reaper,\" Cerberus said, as he told Mammon about his grand plan.\nNova was already aware of this plan, as she was the one who was teaching Cerberus the transformation magic.\n\"That’s actually nice, I was always worried, when will you have a race under you\" Mammon said, as apart from Thea, only Cerberus had no race under him.\n\"I have only 158 demigod souls for now, I will bring more in the future\" Mammon said, as he handed the soul plate, that held the souls of these DemiGods.\nCerberus opened his mouth and sucked all the souls in one gulp and said,\"sweet 158 million merits\"\nAfter saying there Goodbyes, every Demigod returned back to their own work.",

      "content": "Chapter 93: Ch 93 : Successor of the cosmic Empire\nA voice, melodious and clear, echoed through the vast Citadel of Veridia, a sound that seemed to carry with it the very essence of a bygone era.\n\"Demigod Umbra,\" the voice called out, filled with an immense gratitude that resonated in the hearts of all who heard it.\nIt was the voice of Thorn, the first leader of humans, the first apostle, and the sole apostle of the mighty Shenlong.\nFrom the shadows of the Citadel, a wisp of darkness coalesced and formed into a figure of quiet grace.\nUmbra, the demigod of shadows, looked at Thorn, a soft smile on her face. \"Oh, Thorn, you’re back,\" she said, her voice like a gentle whisper of the wind.\n\"Is Shenlong also back with you?\" Though it was their first time truly talking, Umbra spoke as if she had known Thorn for ages.\n\"He is not,\" Thorn replied, a hint of pride in his voice. \"His only thought is to give all the life forms a chance. A chance for them to correct their lives.\"\n\"That’s so him,\" Umbra sighed, a wistful look on her face. \"I was thinking of sending one of my clones with him, but he just never returns.\"\nShe had only met Shenlong once, but in that brief meeting, she had understood the virtue and kindness of the dragon.\n\"So, why did you come to meet me?\" Umbra asked, the question that was lingering in her mind.\n\"Actually, I always wanted to thank you for saving me during the revolt that happened centuries ago,\" Thorn said, his tone filled with immense gratitude.\n\"But I had nothing to gift you as my thanks. But during my travels, I found an item for you that I really think you would like.\" Thorn said, and then brought out a ring from his pocket.\nThis ring looked ordinary to others, but for Umbra, it was not.\nShe looked at this ring with surprise. Even Thea, with her all-seeing Omni-Cognition talent, wasn’t able to show the description of this ring.\nThe system panel only showed question marks, a clear sign that this was no ordinary artifact.\nUmbra immediately understood the importance of this ring. As only the SSS-Grade artifacts and Gods were capable of escaping the Omni-Cognition of Thea.\n\"Is this an SSS-Grade artifact?\" Umbra asked, even though she already knew the answer.\n\"Yes, this is the first artifact that is found in the Realm of Advancement, and according to the God, there are many more to find,\" Thorn said.\n\"I can’t use such a powerful artifact. I am just a demigod, and this is an artifact of a God,\" Umbra tried to change Thorn’s mind.\nSunny, in his God space, looked at the first SSS-Grade artifact that was found in the Realm of Advancement and used his God’s Eye on it, but it didn’t work.\n\"How can I forget,\" Sunny said, \"my powers don’t work in this Realm of Advancement.\" He immediately asked Umbra to return to Veridia with the ring.\nUmbra followed the instructions and returned to Veridia with Thorn.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs\nSunny then again used his God’s Eye talent on the ring that Thorn had bought.\nBut this time, all the information of the ring appeared in his mind.\n[Item Name: Ring of Shadow\nGrade: SSS\nDescription: A gateway to the Shadow Realm, in this realm the progress of techniques related to shadows increases by a hundred times.\nThe person who wears this ring will have all their shadow-related attacks deal twice the damage.\nThe effects of shadow-related abilities increase by two times.\nNote: can only be worn by a creature of shadow]\nSunny gave this description to Thea, who in turn showed it to Umbra.\nUmbra, upon reading the description, became even more surprised.\nThorn also saw the information, and his eyes lit up upon seeing the description.\nHe felt that his decision to gift this ring to Demigod Umbra was the right choice.\nAfter a few more negotiations, Umbra finally accepted the gift from Thorn, and in return, she would give Thorn a clone of hers, which would always stay by his side.\nAnd this return gift from Umbra was not a trivial thing; it was the protection of a demigod.\nIn Veridia, in the Southern Continent, where the elves lived peacefully, a young boy of around sixteen years of age was practicing. \"Grandpa, I finally got the archery skill,\" he said, as he showed his grandfather the talent appraisal ball.\n[Magic Affinity (S-Grade), Comprehension (S-Grade), Elementalist (S-Grade), Magic Swordsmanship (S-Grade), Magic Archery (C-Grade)]\nThis child was a half-elf, a grandson of both Anaske and Vel.\nWhen the elves and humans joined hands to venture into the Realm of Advancement, marriage was the key to solving the feud between the two races.\nThus, the children of Anaske and Vel married each other.\nThis child was named Light, and he was chosen as the successor to the throne of the Cosmic Empire. In the start, he was just born with two talents, Magic Affinity and Comprehension.\nAs both of them were at S-Grade, he held a very high position even among the children in the royal family of the empire.\nBut slowly, his Comprehension talent began to shine, brighter and brighter.\nHe learned the talent of his grandfather, Vel, Elementalist, from the scratch and comprehended it to the S-Grade.\nHe then learned swordsmanship from his grandfather Vel and combined it with magic to become the first magic swordsman.\nAnd currently, he was learning archery from the other grandfather, and he had already become a C-Grade magic archer.\nMind you all, he is just a sixteen-year-old child, and he has achieved something that took decades for even Vel to learn.\n\"You are really a talented fellow. May God Cosmos bless you in your future path,\" Vel said, his eyes showing the love and warmth of a grandparent.\n\"Grandpa, why does God Cosmos not visit Veridia anymore? I want to see him, too,\" Light said aloud.\nHe was born by listening to the teachings in the Genesis and by both his grandfathers.\nHis respect for God Cosmos was immense, thus he also wanted to see the divine grace of God Cosmos that both his grandfathers mentioned every now and then.\nJust then, a digital panel appeared in front of him, and he received a notification.\n\"Who is sending me a message this late?\" Light said, as he opened the personal message tab. There it was, a message by an ID named ’Seer Rem’.",

      "content": "Chapter 94: Ch 94 : The Divine Library\n​\"Seer Rem?\" Light whispered the name to himself, his voice a quiet murmur in the stillness of his room.\nHe had seen the system panel flash with the name of the sender, and a wave of profound hope washed over him.\n\"Did I finally gain a chance to enter that place?\" He slowly opened the chat, a sense of anticipation building in his chest.\n​[Seer Rem: \"You are chosen to enter the divine library. I will be your host and caretaker during this time]\n​Light immediately replied, his fingers trembling with a mix of excitement and reverence. \"Thanks for giving me this chance. I would follow all of your arrangements, Seer Rem.\"\n​He knew who the seers were. They were a special race created by the demigod of knowledge, Isiah, and were further divided into three parts.\nThe Managing Seers handled the immense library, sorting out knowledge, arranging it in order, and keeping it safe.\nThe Host Seers, like Rem, were blessed with the talent of Soul Plucker, and were responsible for bringing the souls of life forms to the Divine Library and guiding them.\nThe Knowledgeable Seers were the ones who tirelessly collected knowledge from all over Veridia with the help of the Preserver of Knowledge talent.\n​With high hopes, Light lay down on his bed and awaited the seer.\nAll life forms in Veridia were aware of this process; the seers only took the souls, while the body remained on Veridia.\nIt was a norm for them to select a comfortable position for their body while their soul was away.\nThus, Light was also doing things according to the tradition, laying himself down in a calm, peaceful state, his mind already racing with the possibilities.\n​A cool, unseen breeze entered his room, and with it, he suddenly felt a gentle pull.\nIt was not a physical force, but a spiritual one, a strange tugging sensation that lifted him out of his body.\nHe looked down and saw himself lying there, his body a familiar, sleeping form.\nThen he looked at his hands and feet; they looked ethereal, made of shimmering light, like a small breeze could blow him away.\nHe looked up, and a beautiful girl, with one hand on her waist, her other hand emitting a strange force, was pulling him towards her.\n​\"Greetings, Light. You are the first life form to be so calm in the soul state,\" Rem said, her voice a melodious whisper.\nBut Light didn’t listen to a single thing she said. His mind was in a state of epiphany, a new and profound understanding of the soul.\n\"What a strange and gifted child,\" Rem said, a genuine smile on her face. \"Thank God, I was the one who found this guy first.\"\nThe reason for Rem’s happiness was simple: as a host seer, it was her task to find and host the best possible candidate, a candidate who was going to contribute to Veridia and the empire.\nThe more he performed well, the better her merits would be.\nYes, Sunny allowed even the apostles to earn merits from their work.\nHis goal was also to allow the life forms to earn merits through their contributions, but decided against it as it would take away all his faith points.\nInstead, he created another method for the life forms, which was the system currency.\n​There were currently three currencies to use in the system.\nThe first was the Faith Points, a currency of Gods. The second was the Merits, a currency of demigods and apostles.\nThe third was the Cosmic Coins, a currency for the mortals.\nThe key difference between these was simple and easy to understand.\nThe Faith Points were used by Gods to manifest anything or buy different services through Thea.\nThe Merits were used by demigods to buy new talents, manifested items, and movies, novels, and other stuff to increase their imagination for the new powers they would choose.\nThe third and latest currency, the Cosmic Coin, was like online money to buy stuff from each other.\nThey were set in such a way that one cosmic coin was equal to one mana stones, with the circulation of more than ten billion cosmic coins.\nAnd they can exchange for more cosmic coins from Thea using mana stones.\nThis system was many times more portable and easy than bartering and using mana stones.\n​\nBack to Rem and Light.\nRem carried the soul of Light to the Divine Library. The library was filled with glowing orbs all over the hall, and the ends of the hall were not even visible, as if it was a never-ending hall.\nAfter an hour or so, Light opened his eyes and looked all around him. His eyes stopped at Rem, and he said, \"Greetings, Seer Rem. I apologize for all the wait.\"\n​\"No worries, you had eight hours in the library and you already used an hour, so you now have 7 hours left,\" Rem said, chuckling.\n​\"Damn, I should get moving then,\" Light said, and started moving towards the shelves.Googlᴇ search NovᴇlFɪre.ɴet\nRem kept her eyes on him and laughed in her mind.\nAfter a few minutes, Light returned and said, \"Seer Rem, can you help me find these books?\" He then told her the topics, and Rem, this time, listened to each and every request and took Light there.\n​After seven hours of collecting knowledge on all kinds of techniques and spells, Light finally heaved a sigh.\n\"The knowledge here is so vast, even my lifetime would fall short to learn all these,\" Light said, as he looked at the time on the system panel.\n\"The seven hours already ended. Where is Seer Rem?\" He said and looked around the library.\n​Today, he had learned over 50 spells and many fighting techniques in just seven hours.\nHe walked around the library, and after a few minutes of walking, he found a door.\nHe didn’t wanted to touch something in the divine library, but curiosity got the better of him, and he knocked on the door.\nSuddenly, a deep and calm voice sounded from the inside, \"You may enter, Light.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 95: Ch 95 : what do you want?\nLight Celestine, the successor of the royal family of Celestine and the future leader of the Cosmic Empire, entered the room after receiving permission from the man inside.\nAs the heavy door swung open, the first thing Light saw was a human male with a flowing white beard and a pristine white blindfold with golden patterns.\nThere was a unique, scholarly charm to this senior, as if he knew everything and was not surprised by anything.\nBoth of them looked at each other, one looked with his eyes while the other with his heart.\n\"Greetings, senior,\" Light said, his voice respectful. He wasn’t sure who this man was, but he could feel a profound sense of knowledge radiating from him.\n\"Greetings, Light Celestine,\" the senior replied, his voice calm and deep. \"What made you knock on the door to my room?\" He said as he picked an empty sheet from a drawer.\n\"I apologize for disturbing you, senior. I was just curious about the existence of a room in the divine library,\" Light said, but just then, his mind noticed something.\n\"How did you know my name, senior?\" Light questioned. It wasn’t an inquiry or anything; he was just genuinely curious about the methods of this mysterious senior.\n\"Oh, that’s just a minor trick,\" the senior replied, a soft chuckle escaping his lips.\n\"Are you a Knowledgeable Seer? You seem to know everything, just like the myths go for the knowledgeable seers,\" Light asked curiously.\nHe was just sixteen years old, thus his mind was always filled with a desire to learn.\n\"You can say so if you want to. I am actually more interested about knowing your future plans, like what do you want?\" the senior said, a glint of curiosity in his eye.\n\"What I want?\" Light pondered, his thoughts wandering from the expectations of his father and mother to the teachings of his grandfathers.\n\"You don’t need to give an immediate reply. Just start thinking about it slowly, and when you have an answer, just message Rem about it,\" the senior said, and then clapped his hands.\nImmediately upon this gesture, Rem entered the room and used her Soul Plucker talent to take the soul of Light back to Veridia.\nOn the way, Light said to Rem, \"Seer Rem, who was that senior?\" His mind was still filled with the memories of this senior who both looked and sounded mysterious.\n\"Oh, that senior you say? He is my master, the demigod of knowledge, Isiah,\" Rem said, chuckling.\nShe hadn’t realized that Light was unaware of the person he was talking with.\nLight felt shocked, as he hadn’t seen all the demigods yet.\nHe had only seen the demigods of humans and elves. Other than that, he had only taken a glance of the guardian of Veridia and the demigod of dragons, Nova.\nApart from them, he was oblivious to the other demigods, that’s why he didn’t realize it was Isiah all along.\n\"Aren’t you a lucky fellow, having a chat with a demigod?\" Rem said as she placed her hand on the ethereal shoulder of Light.\nIn just a few minutes, both of them were back at Veridia.\nRem was about to place the soul back into the body, but just then, Light moved on his own and entered his body himself.\nIn just a few seconds, he woke up, this time through his body.\n\"How did you do that?\" Rem questioned, as it was not possible for anyone to connect back to the body from the soul form without a soul talent.\nAnd the last time she checked, Light only had the talents for Magic Affinity, Comprehension, Magic Swordsmanship, and Elementalist.\nHe didn’t possess any talent for souls. \"Unless...\" Rem trailed off, the realization hitting her like a thunderbolt.\n\"Did you comprehend a talent related to the soul during your epiphany?\" Rem questioned in a shocked gaze.\n\"Yes, I guess. I need to check it, though,\" he said as he shook his head.\nRem, still in shock, said her good-byes and went back to the divine library.\nBack in Light’s room, he sat on his bed, his mind replaying the conversation with Isiah.\n\"What is my future path? What do I want?\" He kept repeating these questions.\nThe answer could be simple for many, like they needed power or money, but for Light, who was not an ordinary person, it was much more complicated.\nHe was from the royal family of Celestine and had a high chance of becoming the next leader of the Cosmic Empire.\nHis goals couldn’t be ordinary; he needed to know what he wanted the most.\nHe kept on pondering and finally, after an hour or so, he fell asleep.\nBack in the Divine Library, Isiah, the demigod of knowledge, looked at the sheet of paper he had picked up earlier.\nIt was now no longer empty; it contained an image that depicted a person having two ways. One led him to a desolate, dark place, which looked a lot like hell, while the other led him to a beautiful, sun-drenched place, which looked a lot like heaven.\n\"What a talented fellow,\" Isiah said, his voice filled with admiration. \"I hope you take the right path in this life.\"\nSomewhere else, in a different world, a half-orc looked at a digital panel that appeared in front of him.\n[Mission accomplished..]\n[You have gained a lottery chance]\n\"Spin it,\" he said, and then prayed to the Gods to bless him with good luck.\nUpon his command, the system panel showed the wheel rotating, and it finally landed on the button of blessings.\n[Congratulations! You have received a blessing from God Cosmos]\n[The blessing of Reality Talk (SS-Grade)]\nThe half-orc looked at the SS-Grade with wide eyes, as this was the first talent that he had gotten from the system that was SS-Grade.\nAccording to the knowledge he had gained from the system, this SS-Grade talent meant his limits had been increased to the demigod realm.\nAnd also this was his first time to gain a talent from a God, while the other time he only got the talent from a demigod or so.\n\"System, what even are you?\" Ragnok, the half-orc and the leader of all the life forms from Solara, questioned this entity, which had been with him for decades, a sudden doubt now entering his mind.\nNᴇw ɴovel chaptᴇrs are published on NovᴇlFir(e).nᴇt",

He knew that they were only alive until now because of this system and the God Cosmos behind it.\nIf they weren’t here, Kairos would have killed them sooner or later with that monstrous personality of his.\n\"Status,\" Ragnok said, his voice now filled with a newfound sense of purpose.

I wanted to taste a God, as it has been ages since I have eaten one,\" Ichor, the demon lord of Corrosion, said.\nKairos’s whole body trembled upon listening to these words; his human emotions that had been covered after he became a God began to reemerge.\n\"Stop scaring him, Ichor,\" a voice sounded in the God space of Kairos again.\n\"Maledictus,\" Ichor said, as he gazed at the empty vacuum.\nSuddenly, the space where Ichor gazed at turned hazy, and then a beautiful woman appeared, who looked similar to a human apart from the bat wings and fangs.\n\"You know, Maledictus, I have every right to kill you for invading my territory,\" Ichor said as he looked at the beautiful woman.\n\"You sure talk big, even though you are the weakest among us,\" Maledictus said as she laughed.\nThis statement made Kairos even more afraid, as a single demon lord was enough to kill him a thousand times, but now there were two.\n\"Come, let’s fight then, let’s see who is stronger,\" Ichor said in anger.\nMaledictus walked towards Ichor and took out a flag from her spatial ring.\nUpon looking at the flag, the color from Ichor’s face faded, and he said, \"Okay, okay, you won, put that cursed thing away.\"\nMaledictus laughed and stored the flag back in her spatial ring.\n\"You continue what you are doing, after you are done, we both should leave for Ashgar,\" Maledictus said, and lay down in the vacuum, like she was going to sleep.\n\"It’s that time already\" Ichor said in a serious tone and then his gaze landed on Kairos again.\n\"So, are you ready to be my slave?\" Ichor said to Kairos, who was having a mental breakdown.\nBut upon listening to these words, it was like his soul had returned back to his body.\nHe quickly nodded and kneeled in front of Ichor as he said, \"Master, I will follow you wholeheartedly.\"\n\"Aren’t you a good dog,\" Ichor laughed, and then he dropped some of his slime into Solara. Immediately, this mass of slime dissolved all the remaining planet into nothingness.\nAnd then the slime began to turn into a sphere, multiplying and hardening. Slowly, the shape began to form, and a new planet was created.\nAnd that was not all; there were even some life forms in this newly created world; they were all demons.\n\"Take it as a gift from your master, this planet and these life forms are yours from now on. Be a good dog and take good care of it,\" Ichor said, while laughing.\nHis laugh sent shivers through Kairos.\n\"Yes, master,\" Kairos said. He was still kneeling as he was afraid he would die if he looked at these demon lords again.\n\"Let me put a leash on your new dog then,\" Maledictus said and pointed her finger in the direction of Kairos.\nImmediately, a thread appeared out from her finger and bound the neck of Kairos.\nThis thread slowly increased in thickness and appeared as a dog leash. The other end of this leash was handed to Ichor.\nIchor didn’t resist Maledictus as he was already aware of what she was doing.\nMaledictus then snapped, and immediately this leash vanished into thin air.\nKairos felt like his life was now in the hands of Ichor, not that it was any different previously.\nBut now it was like Ichor could kill him from any distance, with just a single thought.\n\"Worthy of the demon lord of Curses,\" Ichor laughed, and both the demon lords vanished, leaving behind a scared Kairos who didn’t understand what happened.",

      "content": "Chapter 97: Ch 97 : Fortune!?\n\"A calamity is going to befall,\" Sunny muttered to himself, a cold dread washing over him.\nHe knew this thought was not his own, but a warning from his Intuition talent.\nHe tried to sense the threat, to pinpoint its location, but he couldn’t.\nIt was an unseen enemy, a shadow that moved with a quiet, lethal efficiency.\nSuddenly, Thea’s figure materialized from a swirling mixture of energy.\n[Master, I have lost connection with three Gods]\n\"Oh? How can that be?\" Sunny wasn’t shocked, for he had already surmised that there were multiple powerful demon gods working under the supervision of the demon lords.\nThese Demon Gods were the ones responsible for the vanishing of Gods.\n[The thing is, all my particles died due to Corrosion. It was probably done by a single person.]\n\"So first Kairos’s world, then these three? Open up the map,\" Sunny said, his voice now a low, commanding hum.\nThea, with her omnipresent connection across the multiverse, immediately displayed a map.\nIt was a chaotic but beautiful web of spheres, a celestial tapestry of universes.\n[Master, the big spheres are different universes, and the gap inside the universe is the area unexplored by my particles.]\n[And the red dot shows the Gods where the connection is lost, and the blue dots show the position of other Gods.]\n\"Whoever is doing this, he is just moving in a single line,\" Sunny said, his eyes tracing the path of the broken links. \"There are many more Gods in his way.\" He closed his eyes, a plan forming in his mind.\n\"Notify these other Gods, and give them two options: either die from this murderer or submit to me.\" Sunny’s decision was harsh, but absolute. He was a God, and a God’s decisions were final.\n[Yes, master] Thea replied calmly, the voice in his head now a reflection of his own ruthless efficiency.\nImmediately all these Gods recieved a message from Thea about the calamity that was about to befall them.\n\"Three hours left until my cooldown is over. What type of talent should I pick this time?\" Sunny pondered.\nHe wanted this talent to be helpful in his current predicament. \"Gods are going to join me? So I need a talent for leadership?\"\nHe quickly shook his head. He could easily learn such common talents through his Divine Growth talent.\n\"Should I create a new demigod?\" After thinking for a few minutes and finding no solution, Sunny’s mind finally settled on this approach. \"If I don’t have something, I can just create it.\"\nSunny manifested a divine embryo and began shaping it. The embryo twisted and contorted, slowly forming into a human figure with a bald head and hands clasped together, in the form of a monk from Sunny’s home planet.\nThis demigod looked like a being of peace and tranquility.\nAs for talents, the first talent was something that could help Sunny in his current predicament.\nThe first talent was Contract (SS-Grade), this talent forms a contract with two parties.\nBoth parties can choose the terms and conditions by themselves and find a middle ground where they both agree.\nAnd in the end, when both parties sign the contract, it will start taking effect.\nThis talent was not affected by the grade or power of a person; if you signed the contract in your right mind, then you need to follow the terms; otherwise, the one who breaks the contract will face a backlash.\nSunny liked this talent that he created, as it was not creating a master-slave contract, because both parties should agree wholeheartedly.\nThough there was a possibility of creating such a slave contract, Sunny decided not to do so.\nThe second talent Sunny thought of was the prime reason he created this demigod as a monk.\nVirtues Body (SS-Grade) this talent allows this demigod to have an enhanced luck or fortune and presence that can affect the life forms near it, change their minds, and let their beastly and devious nature vanish.\nThis talent was helpful to decrease the number of souls present in hell, as this demigod can make them let go of their evil nature and turn over a new leaf.\nAnd if they are not evil anymore, then there is no point in keeping them in hell.\nThe third talent that Sunny chose for this demigod was the talent of Loyal Beads, which allows this demigod to turn anyone he kills into a bead.\nThese beads were not a normal bead; they can be converted back to their original bodies as per the orders from their master and do many tasks.\nWith these three talents, Sunny began to think of a name for this demigod.Googlᴇ search\nAnd after a few seconds, he decided to go with the name ’Sugata’, a name that means ’The Fortunate one’.\nWith the name and talents selected, Sunny wished for this demigod to turn alive. And immediately the body of Sugata twitched, as his lips opened before his eyes could, and he said, \"Amitabha\". Finally, the glowing eyes of Sugata opened, and his gaze fell on Sunny.\n\"Greetings, creator,\" he said, bowing his head.\nSunny told Sugata the duties he needed to do and the benefits of doing so.\nSugata was pleased by the duties that Sunny mentioned but didn’t show much emotion for the benefits and rewards.\nWith a single leap, he exited the God space and jumped into Veridia to perform his duties.\n[Master, all the Gods have agreed to be your subordinate]\nSunny opened the God Chat, and it was filled with messages related to this new development. Currently, 34 Gods were in the way of this murderer, and these 34 Gods boasted about joining under the tutelage of God Cosmos.\nAs if it was not a shame to work under someone; instead, it was their luck and fortune to be the subordinate of God Cosmos.\nThe other Gods felt envious of them joining the God Cosmos and pleaded in the God Chat for God Cosmos to take them in.",

      "content": "Chapter 98: Ch 98 : A single Glance\nSunny had finally made his decision to become a God among Gods.\nHe would take in all the Gods who wished to be his subordinates, a strategic move to create a unified front against the looming demonic threat.\nWith the Contract talent from Sugata, he had a solution to the age-old problem of backstabbing and betrayal from the other Gods or any such entity that threatens Sunny.\nThe terms of their allegiance would be sealed with a contract, ensuring their loyalty.\nBut some of the Gods, who had been offered this place of sanctuary, started to have second thoughts.\nThey were reluctant to leave behind their worlds, their creations, but keeping them in the Realm of Advancement was not feasible.\nSunny, seeing their hesitation in the God Chat, simply replied with two words, \"don’t worry.\"\nThese two words, coming from God Cosmos himself, did not feel like an empty promise. They were a divine decree, an assurance to all the Gods who were having second thoughts.\nSunny was already planning for it, and his plan, in his mind, was already theoretically correct.\nThe first priority was to save these 34 Gods one by one.\nSunny asked Thea to manifest a portal and connect it with the God space of these Gods.\nIn just a few seconds, the portals were completed. Sunny placed his mask on his face, a cosmic robe covering his body, and entered the portal.\nOn the other end was a God who looked very fat and was still eating chips, a perfect picture of a being who had given up on his life.\nUpon noticing Sunny, he lazily stood up from his manifested sofa and greeted him, \"Hello, God Cosmos,\" he said, slightly bowing his head.\nSunny nodded and handed this God a sheet of paper. This was a contract written by Sugata using his Contract talent.\nThe chubby God looked at the contract and without much thought signed it.\nThe terms in the contract were simple: 25% of the faith generated from your world will be taken by God Cosmos.\nThe chubby guy didn’t say anything else and just awaited Sunny’s next command.\nSunny also didn’t say anything and directly created a portal huge enough to swallow a whole planet.\nHe passed this portal through the planet of the chubby God and in just a small fraction of a millisecond there was no planet to be seen.Follow current novels on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nThen Sunny finally opened his mouth for the first time in front of the chubby God and said, \"Move to the portal, I have other Gods to save too.\"\nSunny chose to do it by himself rather than asking Thea to do so was because of two reasons, the first, he wanted to show his powers to the other God and second was that both parties should be present for the contract.\nBoth Sunny and the chubby guy moved through the portal and arrived in the God space of Sunny.\nThere Nova was already present, her task was to stop the time for the lifeforms and the planet, so they do not feel this anomaly.\nOne by one Sunny helped these Gods, by teleporting both there planet and them back to Sunny’s God space.\nThere Nova kept on freezing the time of every planet.\nThe sight of Nova sent chills down the spines of these Gods, they were stronger and could kill her easily, but it was only because of the Godhood and the divine body that they possess.\nIf these things were taken away from them, they wouldn’t even be able to see how Nova killed them.\nAs Sunny was helping these Gods, in the previous location of the chubby God’s planet, two beings filled with a bottomless malevolent aura arrived.\nThese were the demon lords of Curses and Corrosion, Maledictus and Ichor.\nIchor smelled the empty space and said, \"No doubt about it, I smell two Gods and a few hundred thousand lifeforms.\"\n\"How can these Gods communicate so fast? Do they have uncovered the universal wormhole?\" Maledictus said, her thoughts coming from her billions of years of living.\n\"Even if they develop it, it is impossible to teleport an entire planet without even living a trace behind,\" Ichor said, stroking his chin.\n\"We shouldn’t stay idle here, let’s move in with full speed, we should be able to catch a God or two,\" Maledictus replied to Ichor and turned to leave.\n\"We should’ve inquired from the four dogs we have caught,\" Ichor said in disappointment and followed Maledictus.\nBoth of them entered the demonic realm and started traveling there.\nOnly when they smell some lifeforms from the other side (which is multiverse), do they come out to make them slaves.\nAfter travelling from the location of 32 gods, Sunny was just asking the 33rd God to enter the portal, when his intuition kicked in and he felt a life-threatening danger.\nImmediately he pushed the God inside the portal and he used his God’s eye to peer towards the direction where the threat was coming from.\nImmediately he saw, two entities with a slightly less pressure than the demon lord of discord, Deimos. That he felt a long time ago.\nHe used his God’s eye to the utmost, immediately using ten billion faith points, but still no description or information about them was visible.\nThe pressure of these two beings increased more and more on him, Sunny sighed and entered the portal, this single glance and infinite pressure showed him the grand difference between him and the demon lords.\n\"Portals?\" Maledictus said, as she looked at a location that was millions of light years away, without even using a skill.\nBut as they both reached there, there was no sign of these portals there, no sign of life, only a little fragrance of Gods and their lifeforms that caught Ichor’s eyes.\n\"It’s the 32nd God that escaped our hand today,\" Ichor shouted at the top of his lungs.\n\"Don’t shout like a ghost, there would be many more ahead, we just need to be faster,\" Maledictus said, as she rubbed her ears.\nIchor grinned and shot towards the direction of Ashgar, their destination with even more speed.",

      "content": "Chapter 99: Ch 99 : A new Universe\nSunny, not wanting to get caught by the demon lords, decided against going to the location of the last God himself. \"It will only take me more time,\" he reasoned, his thoughts were swiftly ordered to Thea.\nThea, with her omnipresent nature, could do it much faster, a testament to her efficiency.\nSunny opened the God Chat and typed simple message that rang in the system panel of every God.\nCosmos: \"The 32 Gods with their planet are safe and currently are in my God space.\"\nImmediately, a huge wave of admiration and praises washed over him, with these flood of messages, a torrent of divine energy entered his body, but for him it was barely a tickle.\nStill he didn’t stop there. He typed again, a new message, this time a clear invitation.\nCosmos: \"If any other Gods want to be my subordinate God, they can DM me.\"\nAs if this was a war horn, the entire army of Gods marched forward into Sunny’s DMs.\nImmediately, around a billion requests were made to Sunny. Sunny just smirked when Thea told him the numbers. This was expected.Follow current novels on ɴovel(ꜰ)ɪre.nᴇt\n\"Manifest a subspace, and I will create multiple stars on it. Just put the planets in the orbit of these stars, around one hundred and twenty-six planets per star,\" Sunny commanded, his voice filled with a sense of grand design.\nHis plan was to create a universe of his own. This was not an easy feat, but the shimmering structure in his God space said otherwise.\nIn his God space, there was now a giant fireball, with a size that was hundreds of times that of Veridia.\nSurrounding it were 34 planets. In the first orbit, there were two planets. In the second, there were four, then eight, and so on.\nThe size of these planets was in increasing order, meaning the largest planet was at the very end.\nImmediately, Sunny’s faith started to consume at a rapid pace.\nHis two hundred billion faith reserves were already at one hundred eighty billion because of creating Sugata.\nAnd now it was decreasing even more rapidly. \"It is a one-time purchase only, and I will be getting even more back soon,\" he thought, a sense of confidence in his twenty five percent income from the Gods.\nSlowly, the faith reserves of Sunny shrank to 30 billion.\nAround one billion Gods were now directly under Sunny.\nThere were multiple solar systems in this new subspace that Sunny created.\nEach solar system contained a single star and more than one hundred planets.\nAnd these were not distributed randomly; instead, the Gods that wanted to be together had their planets teleported to the same solar system.\nThis created a huge web of multiple planets in Sunny’s subspace.\nAround a billion planets, each with more than a hundred thousand life forms.\nEven if a God only earned a million in one day, Sunny would be getting twenty-five percent of that, which is two hundred fifty thousand faith points.\nAnd now imagine these faith points multiplied by one billion. It was an astronomical amount.\nNow, faith was not an issue for Sunny. He could now consume it as he pleased.\nBut his current goal was entirely different. It was not to be a laid-back God, only intervening during a crisis.\nInstead he wanted to become a God through the Law, not just faith.\nHe wanted both, like Adam and all the other previous Gods.\nAnd this path was even tougher than the path of faith, as this required a comprehension so vast that it was out of Sunny’s reach currently.\nAnd even with clones, it would require him many years to just comprehend the beginning of the Law of Manifestation.\n\"Can I increase the time acceleration for my clones?\" Sunny said, as he knew that time acceleration on his real body was not possible, as he had already tried it using Nova and his Divine Command.\nDivine Command would’ve been effective but it was very costly, and Nova’s magic, as it was SS-Grade, thus it was ineffective.\nBut he could try to use Divine Command on his clones.\nHe said, \"Time accelerate by ten times for my clones responsible for learning\" Immediately he felt a drain, a huge amount of faith vanished in that instant.\nAround twenty billion, but the good thing was, Divine Command had changed the laws of time for these clones, and now the time would always be ten times accelerated for them.\n\"Only ten billion left, I am poor again,\" Sunny sighed, a small smile on his face.\nHe should be thankful that no other Gods were present in his God space, otherwise even with his status as a top most God, they would have fought with him even if that costed there life.\n[Master, the cooldown for your innate talent is over]\n\"Oh? Three hours passed just like that?\" Sunny said, as these three hours of his went by pretty fast.\nThese hours were mostly spent on helping other Gods and creating a whole small universe for them (a subspace).\n\"What talent to choose?\" Sunny pondered, his thoughts which were initially deadset on buying the Contract talent faded, as he knew that the current contract talent was already good, as it doesn’t get affected by someone’s grade.\nThe Time Affinity and any other affinity were also unnecessary, as his Divine Command could even command the laws.\n\"Should I copy, Light’s talent?\" Sunny said, his thoughts were simple. Light had a Comprehension talent of S-Grade, which helps him in learning many other talents.\nSimilarly, Sunny could also learn many talents, or even better, he could comprehend his Manifestation Affinity, which would take centuries otherwise.\nThe only problem was the grade of this talent, which was just S-Grade, and for Sunny, who didn’t possess any talent below S-Grade, it was not up to his standards.\n\"Well, whatever, with this many life forms currently in Veridia, in the billion planets in the newly created subspace, and even the billion of Gods, I could easily find something worthwhile for the next talent acquisition\" Sunny said. He then used a small portion of his will to enter Veridia and copied the talent of Light Celestine.",

Only a day is left for the meeting to start.\" She added, and once again flew away with a flap of her wings.\n\"Ya, ya,\" Ichor snorted, a plume of acrid smoke escaping his nostrils, and followed the woman with bat wings.\nSunny, on the other hand, was having a taste of the best sensation he had felt in his entire life.\nThe sensation of acquiring a new talent, a current of energy flowing through his body, was one of pure, unadulterated joy.\nWith that, Sunny’s talent acquisition was complete.\nHe used his God’s Eye on himself, and a detailed status panel materialized, showing the description of his new talent.\n[Talent Name: Divine Comprehension\nGrade: S\nDescription: Increase your Comprehension by ten times. The life forms in your territory will have their comprehension increased by five times. The probability of life forms being born with innate comprehension talent increases]\n\"Acquiring a talent is still the best,\" Sunny grinned, the pleasure of the new power still coursing through his veins.\n\"No cost or anything and only rewards.\" He understood the profound importance of this talent.\nNot only did it give him ten times the comprehension, but it also increased the comprehension of his life forms by five times.\nAnd as a bonus, it even gave his life forms a high probability of being born with this talent.\nSunny was already aware of this statement through the previous Magic Affinity and Sound Affinity talents.\nAs a result of these, more than seventy-five percent of life forms in Veridia now had magic affinity, and around five percent had a sound affinity.\nThe number of people with sound affinity was totally dependent upon the law, as having an affinity for some laws is much easier than others.\nTake the Law of Time for an example; not a single life form since the start of Veridia had ever had an affinity for time law.\n\"Strategist’s talent of Children of Wisdom is only similar in grade, but if we look at the effects of a talent, my talent, divine comprehension could easily surpass Children of Wisdom by a long margin,\" Sunny said, a wide grin etched on his face.\n[Master, I have analyzed many Gods and any anomaly in their world compared to other worlds]\n\"Oh? So what’s the result of this analysis?\" Sunny asked curiously.\n[There are a few SS-Grade talent holders among these six billion Gods, but they are very few in numbers]\nSunny felt a jolt of shock upon this realization. \"A few? Around ten thousand?\" he asked, trying to comprehend the sheer scale.\n[No, Master, I have already analyzed the talent of around 5 billion Gods]\n[The remaining, I am not sure, they could be talentless or have hidden their talent really deep]\n[And the number of Gods with SS-Grade talent are around one hundred and seven, the remaining Gods are all of lower grade]\nSunny was dumbfounded upon listening to Thea’s analysis.\nHe had tasked her to do so, as a lot of her computing power wasn’t being used.\nSo he asked her to try and analyze the talent of other Gods while also keeping a keen eye on their world.\nBut he didn’t imagine even in his wildest dream that Thea, the system he created himself, would be so fast that it could analyze the talents of five billion Gods in just two days and eight hours.\nThe second thing that made him dumbfounded was that only one hundred and seven Gods had an SS-Grade talent, while the remaining had a talent below SS-Grade.\nAnd the third, and most important thing, was that no other Gods possessed an SSS-Grade talent.\n\"Am I special?\" Sunny thought, a sense of awe and wonder filling him as he looked at the list of talents that Thea had analyzed.\n[God name: Joker\nTalent: gain faith by making fun of others, faith gained will differ by strength]\n[God name: Kitsune\nTalent: Every male life form Demigod or below grade will be infatuated by her, to the point of madness, they will always be loyal to her and provide a large amount of faith]\nThe list went on and on with one hundred and seven talents.\nThese talents were more inclined towards faith, as most of them helped the Gods in earning faith through one way or another.\nAnd the talents of Gods below the grade of SS were mostly similar to life forms.\nLike Sunny’s friend Reflection, who had an A-Grade talent called Comprehension, but in Veridia, Light had an S-Grade Comprehension.\nThe only difference between both was that one was the talent of a God and had an effect on all the life forms, while the other had an effect on himself.\nSunny, with a single question in his mind, knew that only one soul had the knowledge to answer it. Sunny created a portal to the heaven realm and entered it without any second thoughts.\nThere he immediately found a soul, entirely different from the other souls.\nThis soul shone much brighter, but at the same time, it held a deep-seated demonic curse in its body.\nThe powers of heaven suppressed this curse for now, but no one knew when this curse was going to lift.\n\"Cosmos, long time no see,\" Adam said as he floated to the location where Sunny was standing. Adam manifested two chairs and a table out of thin air; the table was filled with many delicacies from multiple eras.\n\"Taste some of the best dishes I have created in my lifetime,\" Adam said, puffing his chest out.\n\"Oh, your Overgrowth talent really was something, to even teach you talents like cooking,\" Sunny said, trying to look jealous of Adam.\n\"Just some tricks, just some tricks,\" Adam quickly replied, but immediately his brows frowned as he sensed a familiar aura from Sunny.\n\"Did you by any chance saw a demon lord?\" Adam asked with a frown on his brows.",

He possesses the talent to break the barrier of the multiverse and increase our territory to other multiverses.\"\n\"Finally,\" a mighty and deep voice, with the might of a God, sounded in the surrounding. \"I can achieve something that no previous God has ever achieved.\"\n\"Insect God, but what about the Demon Lords and their lackeys?\" the other insect, which had the aura of a demigod, said with a slight hesitation.\n\"Yes, I also need to think of them while expanding. Too much of our force can’t be scattered, otherwise, the demon race would attack us,\" the Insect God said, as he sighed.\nIt turned out they were using a weakness of the demon race, and this weakness turned out to be the strength of the insect race.\nJust like how a God consumes faith while descending or intervening with the life forms, similarly a demon lord or demon God will consume their powers when they intervene.\nThus, they need to intervene in such a manner that it doesn’t negatively affect them, like how the demon of corrosion did.\nFirst, he didn’t intervene much with any life forms in Solara (not that it had any), and even used his law of corrosion to corrode Solara, which in turn increased his power though by a minuscule amount.\nAnd this weakness was exploited by the insect race.\nUsing their higher breeding rate, they multiplied swiftly and covered the entire multiverse.\nDue to their high numbers, the demon gods needed to consume a lot of their power to intervene and attack them.\nAnd due to the insect race being spread across the whole multiverse, it was very difficult to eradicate them.\nThus, the demon race gave up on the insect race for the time being.\nAnd if the insect race began to expand, they would be dividing their population, which would make them a much easier target for the demons.\nThis problem haunted the Insect God. He wanted to expand, but the demons wouldn’t let him.Thɪs No(ᴠ)ᴇlFire.nᴇt\n\"Sigh, just send a small force at first to test the water,\" the Insect God said, and then added, \"we haven’t seen that feind Magar for quite a while now, what if he is already dead?\" He knew this was a wishful thinking, but it didn’t cost him anything, so why fret.\n[A/N : Magar is a Demon God not lord, but below lord and above DemiGod]\nBack in Sunny’s heaven realm:\nSunny recounted the story of his recent brush with death, telling Adam about how he had rescued thirty-four gods and their planets from the path of two demon lords.\nHe ended the tale with the immense pressure he had felt, a suffocating force that had made him retreat in a panic.\n\"You are lucky you survived that,\" Adam said, his voice a grim whisper. \"With your current strength, not to mention fighting, even surviving for a second would be impossible.\" Adam then closed his eyes, his ethereal form flickering as he tried to sense the aura of the demon lords Sunny had encountered.\nHis anger flared by another degree. \"The Demon Lord of Curses,\" he said, as he looked at the corrupted part of his soul.\nIn this moment, the curse hurted him even more than it usually did.\nSunny, understanding the memories and pain from this old god, sighed and said, as he tried to change the conversation, \"And who is the second demon lord?\"\n\"It’s the Demon Lord of Corrosion, a corrosive slime demon which is as hard to kill as a cockroach,\" Adam said, a hint of bitterness in his voice.\nHe remembered the days when many of the Gods hunted the clones of this demon lord, but it’s real body always remained out of their reach.\n\"He is as hard to kill as he is annoying.\" He then talked about the different demon lords and demon gods, their powers, and their weaknesses.\n\"Adam, i always wanted to know, why is that You billions of Gods died by just seven demon lords, even after knowing so many of their weaknesses\" Sunny asked curiously.\nAdam looked at Sunny for a while then shook his head and said,\"actually they were pretty weak when they first faught, but as I have told you earlier they always return even after death\"\n\"Thus after billions of years of fighting, we made an oath that we Gods and those demons will keep on ruling there realms and don’t interfere with each others realm\"\n\"In the end they broke this oath by letting our lifeforms a touch of their power, slowly Discord, hunger for power, Fear, Lies, Corrosion, Curses and Despair began to take there roots in the lifeforms, and this was the starting point and main reason of our lose\" Adam said, he felt both the frustration and embarrassment of the lose against the demons, but a lose was a lose.\n\"You shouldn’t delve on the past that much, if i sense something similar, I will notify you\" Adam said, as he slipped the red wine.\nSunny nodded and then looked toward his faith points, it had decreased by another five billion points.\nWhy? Because every time Sunny left his God space and interacted with life forms, it would consume faith.\nAnd currently, he was in the heaven realm, which was not in his God space, so the cost was even more. Even entering the subspace would cost a hefty sum.\nBut why was the cost so low compared to Veridia?\nDescending on Veridia would cost him one billion faith per second, and that was still at the time when Xar’gath invaded Veridia.\nCurrently, the life forms were even stronger, so the faith would be consumed at an even faster speed.\nBut in the heaven realm, only souls were present, which were weak compared to the combination of soul and body, thus the faith consumption was not so high.\nLooking at Sunny’s face, Adam chuckled and said, \"I didn’t expect your faith reserves to be so grand. You were able to descend into this realm for an entire hour, a feat that would have taken most new gods a month or even more. You are truly a top god among the new gods.\"\n\"I don’t have much faith left, so I will come to the main point of my visit,\" Sunny said, immediately his previous joking and easygoing demeanor vanished, and an unending seriousness enveloped his mind.\n\"Ask whatever is on your mind,\" Adam said, with a face that showed his confidence in his knowledge of billions of years.\n\"Why are there no Gods with SSS-Grade talent?\" Sunny asked, his mind etching to find the truth.\n\"SSS-Grade? You all are descendants of my life forms, so technically you all are also my life forms, my creations,\" Adam said, his mind went back to the time when he first created a life.\n\"What’s the point of thinking this now, you fool?\" He thought and then looked at the curious face of Sunny.\nHe smiled and said, \"And as I have already told you, a life form can’t possess an SSS-Grade talent.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 102: Ch 102 : A shocking truth\n\"Is there no chance for a life form to have SSS-Grade talent?\" Sunny asked, his voice filled with a quiet curiosity.\nHe had many questions swirling in his mind, but this one felt like the most important.\n\"No, in my lifetime, I have not seen any God mention this, and not even my life forms possessed an SSS-Grade talent,\" Adam said, his voice so confident and firm that for a second, Sunny felt that he was telling the truth.\nHe knew of Adam’s lifetime, which was not of hundred, thousand, million, not even a billion, it was more than tension of billions of years or possibly even more.\nBut then, the weight of his own existence struck him, and he said, \"What if there is a God among us that possesses an SSS-Grade Talent?\"\n\"I would slap myself and wake up from that dream,\" Adam joked, a laugh escaping his lips.\nBut then he saw Sunny’s serious face and coughed lightly.\n\"You know, Cosmos, every universe is made up of its own rules and laws, but still, the fundamental laws will remain the same.\" He paused and looked at Sunny, as if waiting for Sunny to digest this information.\nBut Sunny just nodded, his face clearly explaining that he understood everything that Adam said.\nHe coughed once more and added, \"These fundamental laws are Void, Creation, Space, Time, Elementals, Grades, and Destruction.\"\n\"So that means there are other universes with different laws, thus different power systems?\" Sunny said, hoping for a positive answer.\nHe currently knew that even if he becomes and SSS-Grade mage or body Refiner, he would be no match for a demon lord, thus he required multiple power systems, then he would integrate them and increase his powers through every system.\n\"Yes,\" Adam acknowledged and then praised Sunny by saying, \"Your comprehension is really making me envious. I think even if I don’t tell you, you will be able to uncover every secret yourself.\"\nSunny didn’t reply, but he was aware that it was due to the talent of Divine Comprehension, which increased his comprehension by ten times.\n\"So, where was I?\" Adam said, as if trying to remember something.\n\"Laws,\" Sunny said, a hint of exasperation in his voice.\nHe was already regretting asking this old God, who liked to have fun in everything, but he also knew that he didn’t have any other choice, as no one other than Adam could give him the answers he required.\n\"Yes, laws. So one of these laws dictates that no life form can be born with an SSS-Grade talent, and these laws are eternal and can’t be broken, even by Gods,\" Adam said in a serious tone.\nThis knowledge was not something that could be shared casually.\nBut Sunny was the pillar of hope for Adam and all the previous Gods that died by the hands of these demon lords.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ NovᴇlFirenᴇt\nThus, he was ready to share everything that he knew.\n\"That’s why, I am sure no life form could possess an SSS-Grade talent,\" Adam said and then began to drink the red wine that was placed on the table.\nSunny also picked up the glass of wine casually, his mind still filled with questions, but he thought of a mischief and said, \"You know, Adam, I possess an SSS-Grade talent.\"\nAdam choked on the wine that he was drinking. It was a kind of wine made for souls, thus Sunny was safe from this splash of soul wine, which passed through him.\n\"Don’t joke, can’t you see I am drinking?\" he said as he coughed up a few more times, but upon looking at Sunny again, his eyes opened wide.\n\"You are not lying?\" he said, a talent he possessed to know if someone was lying, and currently he knew that Sunny was telling the truth.\n\"I never do,\" Sunny said and then sipped the glass of wine and added, \"So any theories?\"\n\"No theories are required. You are also born through the Mother Void, as there is no other way for anyone to be born with SSS-Grade talent,\" Adam said, currently he was more shocked than Sunny.\nHe was currently thinking about the hierarchy between Sunny and him, as he always thought of Sunny as a descendant from one of his creations, but now it turned out, they were brothers.\n\"So why was I born on Endor, and not in the void?\" Sunny asked another question; he had already digested the fact that he was born through the Mother Void.\n\"As I already told you earlier that the void is connected to every inch of all the multiverses, similar to the demon realm, thus it is not impossible for you to be left in Endor,\" Adam reasoned.\n\"That’s why I was an orphan and the only God with an SSS-Grade talent,\" Sunny said, as he tried to connect the dots since his childhood.\n\"So is there any other benefits of being a God born from the Void, other than this SSS-Grade talent?\" Sunny asked curiously; he wanted to know everything there is to know about the Gods.\n\"There are, the life forms you create progress much faster than others. The talents you acquire will be upgraded to a better version, and many more,\" Adam said.\nHe was currently truly in a chaotic mood.\nOn one side he was sad that he lost the hierarchy that he thought he possessed in front of Sunny, and on the other hand, he was happy, because his only hope, Cosmos, turned out to be a God born through the Void, which made the situation of the Gods a little better in front of the colossals like demon lords.\nThey again talked for half an hour, draining three billion faith again, which left Sunny’s faith reserves to three billion only.\n\"My faith reserves are about to dry, I should get going,\" Sunny said, as he stood up from his seat.\n\"Oh, I forgot another bonus,You will gain more faith compared to other Gods.\" Adam said, and entered his house in the heaven realm.\nSunny nodded in acknowledgment and exited the heaven realm.",

      "content": "Chapter 103: Ch 103 : An Academy\n\"So now I know who my mother is, huh,\" Sunny said, a sigh escaping his lips.\n\"Let’s focus on increasing strength. Now I know why other Gods are so behind me. I need to give them some strength too, otherwise fighting demons would only be harder in the future,\" Sunny thought.\n\"For that, I need faith,\" he whispered, a hint of playful exasperation in his tone.\nThis entire venture has cost him a lot; he only had three billion faith points left, a meager sum for a being of his stature.\n\"Time to go AFK,\" he said, and then sat on his throne to comprehend the Law of Manifestation.\nIn the seventh hour of the ninth day, Veridia was not just flourishing; it was thriving on an almost unimaginable scale.\nThe humans, whose population had now reached the two billion mark, were a testament to this growth.\nMany would say it’s too much, but they had been on Veridia for around 650 years, and many old humans with high talent were still alive.\nSo instead of life and death being in a natural balance, life was flourishing very fast, thus every year, many humans were transferred to the Realm of Advancement to expand the area there too.\nThe elves, with a slightly less rapid breeding rate, were around a billion in population.\nSunny had mixed the elves of Zir into his own world, a calculated move to adapt and evolve them into a more formidable race by mixing the talents of both.\nIn return for Zir’s help, Sunny gave him faith points, which can help Zir to strengthen the world tree, or intervene in his world if needed.\nBut it was not like slaves trading or so, Zir’s world was met with demon invasion every now and then, and sometimes the elves there died fighting these demons.\nAnd the elves that Sunny took from Zir, were the Children who became orphan at a young age, they were given to the Demigod of Elves to take care of.\nAs it had already been hundreds of years in Veridia since the elves from Zir’s world were integrated.\nThey had been flourishing well, they had started their own families, and these families were truly having the best possible talent.\nAll the children in their family possessed magic affinity of high grade, multiple magic-related talents, and even the talents of Sunny’s native elves.\nThrough these talents, the comprehension of new magic spells and complex arrays were created every now and then.\nAnd Sunny already possessed the talent, Divine Comprehension, which would further increase the probability of life forms having comprehension talent and a full five times comprehension for every life form.\nThese would now further increase the creation of new spells and arrays in the future.\nSimilar to elves, humans were also continuously advancing.\nNow, apart from the mana-powered pistons, engines, and vehicles like mana-powered trains, cars, and airships, they also created a scrybing-orb, which worked like a camera to record anything.\nApart from them, mana lasers were now quite popular among all the races.\nCurrently they were working on a mana heart, which could work similar to how mana veins work, produce mana infinitely.\nFor this venture, The demigod of Humans, even gave these researchers a manifested mana veins that could help them in this research of theirs.\nThe best discovery was still by the dwarves. They created a mana reservoir, which could absorb the mana from the surrounding, which is usable by any life form.\nThe mana absorption and usage were similar to an E-Grade mage for now, but as the technology advances more, this could be upgraded.\nThe use cases of this mana reservoir were infinite, as any life form, even without a mana affinity, could use mana.\nThe Machina race was currently upgrading the Golems sentinels, their strength was now comparable to a D-Grade body refiner.\nThey were creating and selling these Golems to different races, as these were a hot commodity for manual labor and heavy-duty work.\nThe beastfolks didn’t rely on technology like the other races.\nTheir primary focus was on body refining and magic.The most update n0vels are published on ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\nBut that doesn’t mean they didn’t have anything of value; they created many primal armors from the monsters and beasts that they slayed.\nFrom these monsters and beasts, they also were developing many potions, totemic charms, and many other things.\nThe remaining races were also flourishing and trading many of the specialties of their races.\nThe merfolks, the only race in the grand ocean of Veridia, though not so useful for now in the Realm of Advancement, still maintained their usefulness.\nAll the demons that invaded through the water were slain by the merfolks and dragon borns. They also sold many herbs or items that were only available in the oceans.\nIn the central continent, which was the biggest among all the continents, in a bustling city surrounding the portal that led to the Realm of Advancement.\nThe city was called ’Haven’, a city filled with all kinds of races, from tiny pixies to the hulking giants.\nEven the merfolks were present in this city, through the canals that these life forms created, while some merfolks even had oxygen masks, created by the dwarves.\nExcept for the colossal Titans, all other races were present.\nAnd this city was connected with the capital of all the races, through the teleportation array, thus it was jokingly called the capital of Veridia.\nThis city possessed a grand academy, which was only open for those with good talents. For life forms with poor talent, there were other academies in the capital of their races respectively.\nAnd currently in this academy, a half-elf was teaching a thousand students how to sense mana in the surroundings. \"You all close your eyes, and concentrate,\" he said, his voice carrying the authority of a veteran mage.\n\"If you concentrate deep enough and apply the technique that I just taught, you will sense mana much sooner than the other traditional methods.\"\nThen he began to check on the students one by one.\n\"And also, the one who sensed mana the fastest will win a secret hidden spell that I created myself,\" as he said this, the concentration of all the students broke, and they looked at their teacher with wide eyes.",

      "content": "Chapter 104: Ch 104 : Epiphany\nThe teacher was a young man who looked around twenty years old, his face a perfect blend of handsome and cute.\nHe stood at the front of a grand classroom, a man whose grace and composure made him seem far older than his years.\n\"Prince, are you telling the truth? Will we really get a spell created by you if we sense mana?\" a young boy, his voice filled with an infectious enthusiasm, asked, his eyes wide with hope.\n\"First of all, I am your teacher here, not the prince,\" the teacher said with a gentle smile. \"And yes, as your teacher, if I promise something, I will fulfill that promise.\" The teacher was none other than Light, the half-elf prodigy, and the successor to the throne of the Cosmic Empire.\nIt had been around 50 years since he had met with the Demigod of knowledge, Isiah, and still, he had no idea about his true path.\nThough he was now 66 years old, for a talent like him, who was already at S-Grade when he was 30, age was just a number.\nHe had a higher chance of becoming a demigod than even the S-Grade leaders of the empire.\nAnd this was because of his high comprehension talent, through which he had created many spells and created many different ways to increase the power and also the way to use the talents.\nBut as he was teaching his students, his mind raced towards the question Isiah had asked him years ago.\nHis Comprehension talent started working at full speed, and he immediately went into a trance, a state of profound meditation.\nAll the students felt this anomaly and looked at him in awe as Light’s body floated in the air, a sign that he was comprehending a new power or skill.\n[Congratulations, Your Soul Awakener talent has been upgraded to S-Grade]\nLight, currently in a state of epiphany, was not even able to see this notification.Google seaʀᴄh\nHis mind was having a battle of its own, as his mind was currently being overflowed by memories.\nHe wasn’t sure what it was, but Thea immediately became aware of it.\nShe manifested a mind-stabilizing pill, and through her Energy Convertor talent, she converted it into an energy with a similar function.\nShe then infused this energy into the brain of Light. As this energy began to stabilize the overflow, the pale face of Light returned to its original elegance.\nAfter an hour, Light’s eyes fluttered open, but his eyes, which were once filled with the innocence of a child, were now looking with a strange, almost murderous glint.\nThe children in the classroom and the other teachers who had come to see the commotion all felt a pressure that was not possible for a mortal to exude. It was a pressure that was similar to that of the demigods.\nIn the Divine Library, Isiah looked towards Veridia and said, \"What will you choose, child?\" He took out the piece of paper that he had drawn years ago.\nHe folded the paper in such a way that it became a butterfly.\nHe then instilled his mana into this paper butterfly, and in a few seconds, the butterfly came to life.\n\"Go, help him,\" Isiah said. Immediately, the butterfly flew away, exited the divine library, and entered Veridia.\nIn the classroom, the pressure was still there, but no one felt it as Thea had neutralized this pressure for them.\nLight noticed the paper butterfly flying towards him, but his mind was currently unable to process anything.\nBoth the Soul Awakener and Comprehension talents were already running at full speed.\nThe butterfly immediately fused with the body of Light, and all the memories that he had just gained were immediately stabilized in his mind.\nLight’s eyes twitched slightly as he fell back and went into a deep slumber.\nAfter a month, in a hospital, Light opened his eyes. The previous pressure was nowhere to be seen.\nHe saw Anaske and Vel standing in front of him with worry etched into their faces.\n\"Grandfather...\" the memories that were stabilized by the paper butterfly resurfaced, but this time it was not painful.\nIn this month of deep slumber, Light had already understood the cause of these memories.\nThese were the memories from his previous life, a life of a ruler of an entire realm, a life of a ruler who became a slave to a God and then mercilessly killed millions of life forms without batting an eye.\n\"I am not him,\" the only sentence that kept Light’s mentality in check.\nHe was not Aerion, the demigod and leader of the spirit race.\nIt turns out it was all Sunny’s experiments. He let the soul of Aerion go and kept his eyes on Veridia to see if this soul would be reincarnated.\nAnd it surely did, into the body of a small, newborn child named Light, with two of his previous talents, like Magic Affinity and Comprehension.\nThe result of these experiments were clear: that the souls of the evil could also become a pure life form in the next life, and similarly, a pure soul from heaven could also become evil in its next life.\nBut now, to tackle that, Sunny had Sugata, whose task would be to visit both heaven and hell to give the teachings of benevolence to all the souls.\n\"What happened to you, Light?\" Anaske said in worry.\n\"Why did you faint? Did you overwork?\" Vel added, his worry also similar to Anaske.\n\"Grandfather, I am alright, it’s just that one of my talents got upgraded,\" Light said.\nThrough the memories of his past life, he knew how many crimes he had committed and the torture that was done in hell.\n\"Grandfather, I don’t want to be a leader, I just hope to advance the children of our Empire to greatness,\" Light said, his eyes filled with his vision for the future.\n\"Do as you see fit, our old bones are still strong and sturdy,\" Anaske said, and the room immediately filled with laughter.",

He would become a teacher.\nThe weight of his past life as Aerion, a demigod of spirit race and bloodshed, was a ghost that no longer haunted him but instead served as a solemn guide.\nThe grace shown to him by God Cosmos was a cleansing light, a second chance at redemption that he would not spoil.\nHe would repay that grace not with tribute or monuments, but by nurturing the seeds of greatness in others.\nArmed with his profound S-Grade Comprehension, he would forge geniuses.\nHe would craft methods and techniques so elegant and intuitive that even the most ordinary lifeform could rise to become an expert, ensuring the future of the empire was built on a foundation of shared strength, not just the power of a select few.\nThat night, as promised, a cool, unseen breeze drifted through his chambers.\nLight felt a gentle but irresistible pull, not on his body, but on his very soul.\nHe looked down to see his physical form resting peacefully on the bed as his ethereal, shimmering self was drawn upward.\nBefore him stood Rem, the Host Seer, a gentle smile on her face.\nWithout a word, the world dissolved around him, replaced by the silent, star-dusted majesty of the Divine Library.\nHe was led to a quiet chamber deep within the celestial archives, where a figure sat in quiet contemplation.\n\"So, you have chosen the path of a teacher,\" the senior said, his voice echoing the wisdom of ages. \"It is your own choice, and I am pleased you have chosen a path of creation in this life, not destruction.\" It was Isiah, the demigod of knowledge.\nLight knowing who this senior was, bowed and greeted him gently.\nIsiah nodded and With a slow, deliberate movement, the he reached up and opened his blindfold.\nLight braced himself, but what he saw was not terrifying, but awe-inspiring. Isiah’s eye sockets were voids of pure, milky-white light, containing no pupils, no irises, only the serene glow of infinite knowledge.\nA brilliant ray of this light emanated from those eyes, piercing Light’s ethereal form.\nIt was not a physical sensation, but a torrent of pure information flooding his soul, a blessing of unparalleled value that felt like having the entire library’s index downloaded directly into his consciousness.\n\"From this day forward, you only need to think of the knowledge you seek within this library, and it shall be yours,\" Isiah explained, describing the downgraded but still potent version of his own ’Preserver of Knowledge’ talent.\n\"It will, of course, consume some of your mana, a small price for infinite wisdom.\"\n\"I thank you, Demigod of Knowledge, for this wonderful gift,\" Light said, his gratitude genuine and overwhelming.\nThis blessing was not just a tool; it was the key to his very soul’s desire, the ultimate instrument to fulfill his newfound purpose.\nWhile one soul found its noble purpose in the pursuit of knowledge, another, billions of light-years away in a different corner of the multiverse, wrestled with the very nature of his divine existence.\n\"What can I do? My very talent is a monument to evil,\" a God sighed, the sound heavy with a weariness that transcended time.\nHe was Asura, one of the few whose power Thea had not yet fully analyzed, for his talent was as secretive as it was potent.\nShe had, however, marked him as an SS-Grade holder, a classification deduced from his unusual and inexplicable faith generation.\nIn Thea’s vast analytical matrix, talents below SS-Grade were largely mortal in scope—they enhanced physical performance or accelerated progress.\nBut SS-Grade talents were a different beast entirely.\nThey were engines that produce faith at an alarming pace, powers that altered the fundamental mechanics of faith generation itself.\nJoker’s ’Roaster’ talent, which turned mockery into faith, was a prime example.\nAsura’s faith gain showed a similar secondary source that Thea’s logic could not yet place.\nHis talent was called ’Evildoer’. As an SS-Grade ability, it was terrifyingly simple: it generated faith points from the evil deeds committed by his lifeforms.\nA murder, a betrayal, a simple act of cruelty—each was a drop of fuel for his divine engine. He could have become one of the most powerful Gods in existence.\nBut Asura, despite his ferocious name, was a gentle soul.\nJust yesterday, he had watched two of the clans in his world prepare for a bloody war over a fertile piece of land.\nThe ensuing conflict would have filled his coffers with faith, but he couldn’t bear it.\nHe sent a subtle divine revelation, a dream of a shared harvest, that steered them toward peace and cooperation.\nHe was a soft-hearted being who chose to teach his creations morals, a paradox of divine existence.\n\"Should I join Cosmos?\" he thought, the idea a constant, tempting whisper.\nHis primary concern was not power, but the protection of his people.\nThe looming threat of demon invasions was a shadow that fell over every independent God.\nThe worlds nestled within Sunny’s subspace, however, were a sanctuary.\nThey were disconnected from the demonic realm, a safe harbor in a cosmic storm.\nThis single perk had turned Sunny’s small universe into the most sought-after destination in the multiverse.\nThe two billion requests still pending in Sunny’s private messages were a testament to that.\nSunny himself was currently preoccupied, his faith reserves nearly depleted and as his clones tirelessly worked to comprehend the profound laws of manifestation.\nAll these requests for sanctuary remained, for the moment, unanswered.\nIn the end, finding no other path that guaranteed the safety of his people, Asura made his choice.\nHe, too, sent a request to God Cosmos, a plea to become his subordinate.\nHe was not alone. Countless other Gods, seeing the initiative of more than half of the Gods, were doing the same.\nBeing a subordinate to Cosmos offered two things no other alliance could: absolute protection and continued sovereignty over their own worlds. It was a deal too good to refuse.\nIn Sunny’s God space, a shimmering projection of Thea watched the influx of a billion new requests.\nA small, knowing smile graced her ethereal lips. \"In a few more days,\" she mused to herself, \"most of these remaining Gods will become subordinates of my master. The pantheon that he wished for will be complete before the tenth day ends.\"\nHer projection then dissolved, melting back into the vast, silent expanse of the God space, leaving only the quiet hum of the Sunny, comprehending the law of manifestation.",

      "content": "Chapter 106: Ch 106 : A Teacher’s Path\nFrom a vantage point of the God space, one of Sunny’s nine clones observed the figure of Light Celestine.\nThe clone, tasked with watching over Veridia, allowed a small, knowing smile to form on its lips.\n\"This intuition talent is truly something,\" Sunny’s consciousness mused through the clone. \"I wouldn’t have let Aerion’s soul go otherwise.\"\nThe decision to allow the reincarnation of a being so powerful and destructive had been a gamble, one guided by a subtle, almost imperceptible nudge from his divine intuition talent.\nNow, Sunny watched, waiting to see if that gamble, that seed of hope planted in the soul of a former tyrant, would finally begin to bear fruit.\n​Down below, in the academy’s immaculate central courtyard, Light stood amidst pillars of shimmering crystal and fountains that danced with enchanted water.\nHe watched the students, the so-called \"geniuses\" of the Cosmic Empire.\nA young elf effortlessly wove complex light magic, his fingers dancing as if plucking strings on an invisible harp, a bored expression on his face. Nearby, a dwarf prodigy sketched out plans for a new mana conduit, his mind a whirlwind of gears and runes, casually complaining to a friend that the assignment was far too simple.\nThey were brilliant, the pinnacle of their generation, and they moved with an easy confidence that came from knowing their path to greatness was already paved with gold and prestige.\n​But as Light watched them, his mind drifted. He thought of the thousands of remote villages he had learned of from the Divine Library, disconnected from the empire’s vibrant heart.\nHe pictured the children there, whose greatest ambition was a full belly, whose talents, if they existed, would remain forever undiscovered, like gems buried under a mountain of dirt.\nHe knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his soul, that his purpose was not here, among the gifted who would succeed with or without him. It was out there, with the forgotten.\n​With his resolve hardened into unbreakable steel, he returned to his lavish chambers in the royal palace.\n\"Full again?\" he murmured, looking at the A-Grade storage ring on his finger that refused to accept another item. \"I should have asked for an S-Grade ring instead of this A-Grade.\" He sighed, pulling a third, then a fourth ring from an ornate drawer.\nHe worked methodically, storing not just essentials, but the tools of a new life: simple farming implements, basic medical supplies, blank scrolls, and mana-infused ink. He was not packing for a prince’s journey, but for a teacher’s mission.\n​A short while later, he stood before the heavy, magically-warded door of the academy’s dean. Before his knuckles could even touch the wood, a warm, familiar voice echoed in his mind, carrying on the ambient mana of the room. \"You don’t need to knock, Light. Just come in.\"\n​The door swung open on its own, revealing a room filled with scrolls, trophies, and artifacts from generations of prodigies.\nBehind a grand desk crafted from the heartwood of an ancient tree sat Gunnar, the dean of the academy. His face was etched with the wisdom of centuries, but his eyes still held the fiery spark of a warrior.\n​\"So, what does my little Light want to say?\" Gunnar asked, his tone radiating the warmth he reserved only for Light, a boy he had watched grow and considered his own grandson.\n​\"Grandpa Gunnar,\" Light began, his voice steady and respectful, \"I’ve come to talk to you about my resignation.\"\n​Gunnar’s friendly demeanor vanished, replaced by the sharp authority of the dean. His back straightened, and the air in the room crackled with a sudden intensity. \"What happened? Is someone giving you trouble?\" His voice was a low growl. \"If anyone in this empire has the guts to cause problems for you, they had better clean their neck in advance, because I will personally separate it from their shoulders.\"\n​Light held up a hand to calm the old man’s famous temper. \"No, no, Grandpa. With you here, and with my identity, I don’t think anyone would be that foolish.\" He offered a placating smile. \"I just... I want to adventure. To explore our world and find my own purpose.\"\n​He knew it was a half-truth. His true purpose was to teach those the academy would never accept, but he also knew Gunnar’s immense pride in his institution. An argument about the academy’s philosophy would serve no one.\n​Gunnar studied him for a long moment, the fiery anger in his eyes softening into a deep, familiar concern. He saw the unwavering resolve in Light’s expression and knew no argument would sway him. He sighed heavily, the sound echoing in the grand office.ɴᴇᴡ ɴᴏᴠᴇʟ ᴄʜᴀᴘᴛᴇʀs ᴀʀᴇ ᴘᴜʙʟɪsʜᴇᴅ ᴏɴ\nHe took the resignation letter Light offered and signed it with a flourish of his quill.\n​\"An empire whose strength rests only on a few geniuses is a tower built on needles, Grandpa,\" Light said softly, finally voicing the core of his belief. \"I want to help build a foundation of stone.\"\n​Gunnar looked up, a newfound respect in his eyes. \"Be careful while traveling, Light,\" he warned, his voice now heavy with a grandfather’s love. \"The incident with Xar’gath’s invasion and the death of your great grandfather, Thorn is still fresh in all our minds. Your great grandfather was reborn, a divine chance others may not get. Your life is precious.\"\n​\"Don’t worry, Grandpa. I am also an S-Grade powerhouse,\" Light said with a flash of confidence. It wasn’t arrogance. With his talents and the battle-honed instincts of Aerion, he feared little short of a demigod.\n​After their farewells, Light walked out of the city gates. The towering spires of Haven, a marvel of magic and engineering, were at his back. Before him lay the vast, untamed wilderness of Veridia. He took a deep breath of the wild, clean air. This was freedom. This was his path.\n​He closed his eyes, focusing his mind. \"Show me the disconnected villages of the Central Continent,\" he thought, calling upon the blessing of Isiah.\nA huge portion of his mana vanished in an instant, a sensation like a sudden, icy void opening within him. But in its place, a torrent of information flooded his soul—not just maps, but the feelings, histories, and the quiet desperation of thousands of settlements flashing through his mind in a dizzying, overwhelming instant.\nHe absorbed the knowledge smoothly, his soul already accustomed to such influxes from the memories of his past life.\n​The nearest village was a hundred thousand kilometers away. A daunting distance, but not for him.\nLight opened his pet bag, and with a flash of light, a magnificent creature appeared before him. It was a giant, colorful bird, twice his size, with plumage that shimmered with every color of the dawn and a crest of feathers that burned like a gentle flame.\n​\"Lily,\" Light said, stroking the bird’s sleek neck. \"It’s time for an adventure.\"\n​The bird, Lily, let out a joyous cry and lowered her back. Light mounted her with practiced ease. With a powerful beat of her wings, they launched into the sky, climbing at a terrifying speed that would cover the immense distance in a day.\nLight lay back against her warm feathers, gazing at the endless blue sky, his heart finally at peace. His path, the true path of his redemption, had finally begun.",

      "content": "Chapter 107: Ch 107 : The Humble One\nThe village of Taewe was nestled in a rugged valley, a small pocket of resilience carved out of the vast, untamed wilderness.\nIts buildings were sturdy but simple, crafted from the dark timber of the surrounding forest and reinforced with river stones.\nHere lived the porcine folk—a hardy, pig-faced race known for their immense physical strength and a stubborn pride that was as unyielding as the mountains themselves.\n​By the river that fed the village, a young pigman named Bolg swirled the water with his hand, his brow furrowed in concentration as he looked at the system panel only he could see.\n\"Father,\" he began, turning to the large, muscular figure beside him, \"shouldn’t we build something like a purifier? Look at this purifier from the system.\"\n​His father, a seasoned warrior with scars crisscrossing his thick forearms, took a long, noisy gulp of water straight from the river. He let out a satisfied grunt, wiping his snout with the back of his hand.\n\"Purifier?\" he scoffed, his voice a deep rumble of amusement. \"Are you questioning our immune system, boy? The stomachs of our people can digest rocks. A little mud in the water just adds flavor.\" He flexed a bicep, a proud gesture of his race’s inherent power.\n​\"I was just saying... it looks cool,\" Bolg mumbled, his deep-set eyes filled with a child’s unwavering curiosity.\n​The father’s expression softened. He sighed, the sound heavy with a truth he rarely spoke aloud. \"It sure does, son. But who knows how to build it? The blueprints cost cosmic coins, and coins are something our village doesn’t have.\" He hoisted the young boy onto his broad shoulders, his earlier pride replaced by a quiet resignation. \"Come, let’s head back.\"\n​As they entered the village, Bolg wriggled free and ran towards a group of children gleefully playing in a large mud puddle. Their laughter filled the air, a simple, joyous sound in the otherwise quiet village.\n​\"Bolg! Did you know?\" another young pigman shouted, his face spattered with mud. \"In the capital, there are flying ships so massive they could carry our entire village!\"\n​Bolg’s eyes shimmered with a familiar, ambitious light. \"I know!\" he boasted to his friends. \"And one day, I’m going to build an airship even bigger than that!\"\n​\"Then I’ll be the pilot!\" his friend declared, waving his arms like a soaring ship. \"Zuuuuu! Zuuuu!\"\n​The elders of the village, sitting by a communal fire, watched the children’s game with fond, weary smiles. \"Listen to them,\" one elder sighed, his gaze distant. \"They dream of the same things we once did.\"\n​\"What a pity we are trapped here,\" another added, poking the fire with a stick. \"We can’t afford to live in the capital, and we can’t do any real business here. The Tiger Clan controls the entire trade route\"\n​The discussion continued, a familiar lament that offered no solutions, only a shared sense of helplessness. But their conversation was abruptly cut short by a sound that made every head in the village snap towards the sky.\nIt was the cry of a bird, but it was no ordinary call. It was a piercing, powerful shriek that echoed off the mountains, a sound that spoke of a creature of immense size and power—an A-Grade, perhaps even an S-Grade monster.\n​Panic erupted. Villagers scrambled for their homes, their faces pale with fear. A group of elders rushed towards the largest hut in the village, their fists hammering on the thick wooden door. \"Chief! Chief, wake up! A monster bird is about to attack!\"\n​The door flew open with a resounding crash. A hulking, giant pigman stood framed in the doorway, a simple towel wrapped around his waist. The thick scent of alcohol wafted from inside the hut. \"Who gave you the courage to shout at my door?\" the chief, Gulata, bellowed, his face flushed with a mixture of drink and anger.\n​\"Chief Gulata, a monster bird!\" an elder stammered, pointing a trembling finger towards the horizon.\n​Gulata squinted in the direction the elder was pointing. A vibrant, multi-colored bird was descending from the sky, its size was twice the size of them.\nIn an instant, the drunken haze in his eyes vanished, replaced by the sharp, lethal focus of a warrior. The lazy, intoxicated aura around him solidified into the oppressive pressure of a mighty S-Grade powerhouse. He charged towards the village entrance, his fists clenched, ready for battle.\n​The bird, unlike the savage beasts he was used to, landed with a surprising quietness. A figure, slender and graceful, leaped from its back. The half-elf patted the magnificent creature’s neck before turning his gaze to the village.\n​\"Finally reached,\" Light said to himself, his body aching from the long, two-day journey. He could have arrived in one, but the untamed beauty of the wilderness and the strange monsters he encountered along the way had been too captivating to ignore.Tʜe source of this ᴄontent ɪs ɴoᴠel Fɪre.nᴇt\n​\"Who are you?\" Gulata’s voice was a low growl, his massive frame blocking the entrance to the village. He sized up the half-elf, his senses screaming that this newcomer was just as powerful as he was. An old saying echoed in his mind: two swords can’t share one sheath. This village, this territory, was his.\n​\"I am just a passerby,\" Light said, offering a calm and friendly greeting to the tense villagers who peeked from behind their homes. \"I have traveled far. Might I trouble you for a place to rest for a time?\"\n​Gulata’s eyes narrowed. \"No,\" he said, his stance clear and uncompromising. \"Outsiders aren’t allowed in our village. Especially not someone from another race.\" His voice was laced with a deep, instinctual threat. This half-elf was a variable he didn’t want, a power he couldn’t control.\n​\"That’s alright,\" Light replied, his tone still humble and without a hint of offense. He was here as a teacher, a guide. He had to be a man of peace, not the murderous Aerion from his past life.\n​With a polite nod, Light turned and walked about a kilometer away from the village. He stopped in a small clearing and, to the astonishment of the watching pigmen, took a small, intricately carved wooden cube from one of his space rings.\nHe placed it on the ground, and with a soft whisper of mana, the cube began to expand and unfold, transforming seamlessly into a small but elegant wooden house, complete with a door, windows, and a smoking chimney.\n​\"Home sweet home,\" Light sighed as he stepped inside and lay down on the comfortable bed within. The simple pleasure of a soft mattress was a luxury he had missed for two days. He closed his eyes, his mind already formulating a plan.\n​\"The elders and the chief are too proud and suspicious,\" he thought, a wave of exhaustion finally washing over him. \"I’ll have to start with the children. Their hearts and minds are easier to win over.\" With that final, strategic thought, he drifted into a deep and peaceful sleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 108: Ch 108 : The Aroma of Trust\nLight awoke to the soft, golden light of dawn filtering through the window of his wooden house. He sat up, the aches from his long journey were now gone.\nOutside, he could hear the distant, joyful shouts of children at play. A small, strategic smile touched his lips. His past life as Aerion had taught him many things about conquest, and one lesson stood out above all others:\nA siege is won not with catapults, but with a single cart of bread thrown over the wall. Hunger for kindness is stronger than the hunger for battle.\nHe moved with a quiet purpose, grinding the dark, shimmering tea leaves with a stone mortar and pestle.\nThese were A-Grade leaves, a luxury from the capital, infused with a faint hint of mana. As he boiled the clean water he had summoned, he thought about his plan.\nThe adults were suspicious, their pride a fortress wall. But the children... their curiosity was the unguarded gate.\nAs he poured the steaming water over the leaves, an incredible aroma began to unfurl from the small cottage. It was a scent unlike any the valley had ever known—not the familiar smell of woodsmoke, damp earth, and roasting meat, but something far more magical.\nIt was a fragrance of wild blossoms, sun-warmed herbs, and a clean, sharp note of mountain air that cut through the morning mist, spreading like an invisible, irresistible invitation.\nThe scent drifted into the village of Taewe, a fragrant ghost that stopped the children in their tracks. They paused their game in the mud puddle, their snouts twitching, their deep-set eyes wide with wonder.\n\"What is that?\" one of the young pigmen whispered, his long nose twitching with excitement.\nTheir parents had warned them, their voices stern and absolute. \"Stay away from the outsider. He is not our kind. He is dangerous.\" But their fear was a fragile thing against a scent so enchanting, so full of promise.\n\"Let’s follow it and see,\" Bolg said, his innate curiosity overriding his caution. He broke into a run, his friends splashing through the mud as they followed him, a small, determined troop drawn by an invisible thread.\nThey soon found themselves at the edge of the clearing, standing before the strange wooden house that had appeared out of nowhere. Through the window, they could see the half-elf, the outsider, sitting calmly and sipping a dark liquid from a delicate white cup.\nLight, who had been watching their approach in the reflection of the window, turned his head and offered a gentle smile. \"Hello there,\" he asked, his voice calm and friendly. \"What brings you all this way?\"\nHis kind tone and the incredible aroma should have been welcoming, but the children jolted back as if struck. Their parents’ warnings echoed in their ears. They wanted to flee, to run back to the safety of the village, but their feet felt as if they were rooted to the ground, held captive by the fragrant air.\nSeeing their fear, Light chuckled softly. \"Are you all mute, or is it just my face?\" he joked, taking another slow sip of tea.\nHis relaxed demeanor seemed to disarm them slightly. Bolg, braver than the rest, took a hesitant step forward. \"What... what are you drinking, mister?\" he stammered.\n\"Oh, this?\" Light held up the cup. \"This is called tea. It is a drink from my hometown.\"\n\"Is that tea?\" another child gasped in astonishment. He had seen pictures of it on the system panel, a luxury item from the far-off capital that cost an impossible number of cosmic coins. But the flat, digital images had done no justice to the reality of this scent.\n\"There is only one true tea in Veridia, and this is it,\" Light said, a knowing glint in his eye. He then added, \"That is, according to my knowledge, and my knowledge is vast.\"\nThe other children were still mesmerized by the cup in his hand, but Bolg’s ears perked up at that last word. Knowledge. The outsider knew things. He knew about tea, and perhaps he knew about airships and water purifiers, too. The fear in Bolg’s heart was swiftly being replaced by a burning desire to learn.\nFrom the back of the small crowd, a timid voice squeaked, \"Mister... can I get a sip, please?\" The child who spoke immediately tried to hide behind his friends, but Light’s sharp senses had already pinpointed him.\nLight’s smile widened. \"Yes, you can,\" he said, his voice warm and generous.\nSlowly all the children asked for a sip and Bolg wasn’t an exception.\nHe disappeared from the window and, in a flash of silent movement, reappeared outside the door. With a graceful wave of his hand, a small wooden table and a complete set of tea-making equipment materialized beside him. It was a simple act of taking things out of the space ring, but to the children, it was pure magic.\nHis hands moved with a precision and elegance that was captivating. He measured the leaves, poured the water, and steeped the tea in a flowing, dance-like ritual.\nFor the children of Taewe, who were used to the rough, practical movements of warriors and farmers, watching him was like seeing a master mage perform a sacred ceremony.\nUnseen by them, from the edge of the village, the hulking figure of Chief Gulata watched from the shadows of a large hut. His arms were crossed over his massive chest, his expression a mask of deep suspicion and confusion.\nHe had expected a threat, a rival powerhouse. Instead, he was watching this stranger perform an act of gentle, inexplicable kindness.\nIn just a few minutes, twelve small, steaming cups of tea were ready. Light handed one to each child, his smile never wavering. Timidly, they took their first sips.\nThe effect was instantaneous. An explosion of flavor erupted in their mouths—sweet, earthy, and unbelievably complex. It was nothing like the muddy river water they were used to.\nA gentle warmth spread from their chests, chasing away the fatigue of playing and making their minds feel sharp and clear. It was the most wonderful thing any of them had ever tasted.\nThey stared at Light, their initial fear now completely gone, replaced by a wide-eyed, silent awe. This half-elf wasn’t dangerous. He was magical.\nAnd from the edge of the village, Chief Gulata continued to watch, his brow furrowed, a seed of doubt planted in his stubborn, wary heart.",

      "content": "Chapter 109: Ch 109 : Seeds of Change\nIn the week that followed, a quiet transformation took place in the village of Taewe. The children, once wary and fearful of the outsider, now flocked to him.\nLight had become their favorite person, a source of endless wonder and fascinating new games. He didn’t lecture them from a book; he taught them by doing, turning lessons into joyful activities.\nToday’s lesson was pottery. Light sat with a dozen eager children by the riverbank, their hands and faces smeared with wet clay. He watched them work, his eyes filled with a patient warmth.\nSome, he noted, had a natural feel for the craft, their small hands expertly coaxing bowls and cups from the shapeless mud. Others struggled, their creations lopsided and clumsy.\nThrough his knowledge from the divine library, he was aware of all their talents; none were extraordinary, ordinary at best. They were the kind of children who would never be accepted into even the lowest of the formal academies.\nFor any other teacher, this would be an arduous task. But Light was different. His own S-Grade Comprehension talent, which enhanced his understanding tenfold, was already a formidable tool. Layered on top of that was the passive blessing from God Cosmos’s Divine Comprehension, granting all lifeforms under his domain a fivefold increase.\nFor Light, this meant he possessed a staggering fifty times the normal rate of comprehension. He could look at a complex technique, instantly break it down into its simplest components, and then guide his students through the process with an ease that felt like magic.\n\"No, Bolg, not like that,\" he said gently, moving behind the young pigman who was struggling to form the lip of a small pot. \"You’re fighting the clay. Let it follow your hands. Feel the spin, and guide it, don’t force it.\" Light placed his hands over Bolg’s, and in that simple touch, the boy suddenly understood.\nThe clay yielded, and a perfectly formed rim rose under his fingers. Bolg gasped, looking from the pot to Light with wide, astonished eyes.\nThis was Light’s method. With his access to the Divine Library, he could call upon any technique in the multiverse, comprehend its essence in a heartbeat, and translate it into a lesson a child could understand.\nHe taught them archery not with drills, but by turning it into a game of hitting swinging fruit. He taught them swordsmanship with sticks, framing it as a dance of balance and movement. For those with no aptitude for combat, he led them on walks through the forest, teaching them basic alchemy by identifying different plants, their effects, and the parts of monsters that held value.\nThe village, which had once been a wall of suspicion, began to thaw. The adults saw their children returning home each day, not just happy, but smarter, more skilled.\nWarriors watched in silent amazement as their sons and daughters demonstrated a proper archery stance they had never been taught.\nMothers were gifted crude but functional clay bowls, the first utensils their children had ever made. The change was undeniable.\nFrom the doorway of his hut, Chief Gulata watched, his massive arms crossed, his face a mask of conflicted emotions. He saw the joy, he saw the progress, but his ingrained suspicion was a stubborn beast. \"You can win the trust of these kids,\" he growled under his breath, \"but you can’t fool me. I will reveal your true nature soon.\" With a snort, he vanished back into the shadows of his home.\nLight had noticed him eavesdropping multiple times but said nothing. Through the Divine Library, he knew Gulata’s heart. The chief was a proud, hot-tempered warrior, but his every action was driven by a fierce love for his village. He was a man who saved every spare cosmic coin in the hopes of one day sending a single talented child to a proper academy.\n\"You worry too much, old chief,\" Light chuckled to himself, turning his attention back to the triumphant look on Bolg’s face. He was planting seeds, and he knew, with a teacher’s patience, that they would eventually grow.\nFar beyond the mortal plane, a clone of Sunny observed this quiet scene in Taewe, a pleasant expression on his face. The gamble of letting Aerion reincarnate had succeeded beyond his wildest expectations.\nLight was walking a path of creation and redemption, a far cry from his past life of conquest. \"Lux is also on the verge of conquering his own world,\" the clone mused. \"But with Asura ready to join as my subordinate, it matters little. Soon, all the Gods will be ready to come under my protection.\"\nSuddenly, he felt a strange and unexpected wave of faith. Such surges were ordinary for Sunny, whose reserves were now counted in the tens of billions, but this was different. What fascinated him was the source. This faith was not generated by a mortal lifeform. It was coming directly from Zir, another God.\n\"A God can generate faith?\" The thought sent a jolt through his consciousness. \"Didn’t Adam deny that? Is it because of my origin as a child of the Void?\" His mind filled with a million questions, but the answers were mere speculation. \"I will have to consult Adam again,\" Sunny decided, the mystery too profound to ignore.\nWhile Sunny pondered this cosmic anomaly, his will was already at work across the multiverse.\nThea’s particles, fueled by Sunny’s immense faith, spread like a celestial nervous system, her consciousness expanding into every corner of the Realm of Advancement and the known universes. She was a silent, omnipresent collector of knowledge.\nInformation about new treasures became the basis for quests given to chosen individuals through her systems. Data on alien plants and strange monsters was cataloged and sent directly to Isiah, enriching the Divine Library.\nThea had become a goddess in her own right, finding talented beings like Lux and Ragnok, and gifting them with systems that would guide them to greatness.\nHer strategy was a self-perpetuating cycle of power. These chosen champions would become beacons of hope in their own worlds. The lifeforms who believed in them, who followed them, would offer up their faith.\nAnd that faith, through the invisible link of the system, would flow directly back to Thea, and in turn, to Sunny. Thea then used that faith as she saw fit: to expand her network ever further, her particles reaching into new, uncharted realms, forever seeking more knowledge and more power for her master.",

His voice was a low hiss that seemed to scrape against the very air, causing the jagged, red rocks around him to weep a foul, acidic slime. \"Not one.\"\nFor a day, he and Maledictus had followed the trail of the new Gods, only to find empty space where planets once orbited. The faint, tantalizing scent of divine energy lingered, a ghostly reminder of the prey that had slipped through his grasp.\nMaledictus, the Demon Lord of Curses, glided beside him, her bat-like wings stirring the sulfurous air with an effortless grace. \"They are not simply running, Ichor. They are being moved,\" she mused, her voice a melodious hum that was far more chilling than any demonic roar. \"I am more interested in this masked God, the one who weaves portals and spirits entire worlds away. Such a talent for evasion is... noteworthy\".\n\"Bah! He is just someone with a slightly better talent for running,\" Ichor scoffed, kicking a loose rock and watching it dissolve into bubbling sludge before it hit the ground.\n\"These single-trick whelps are nothing. They wouldn’t be able to even scratch us.\" His maniacal laughter echoed across the desolate landscape, but it died in his throat as a new figure appeared on the horizon, a silhouette of absolute authority against the blood-red sky.\nThe figure was humanoid but radiated a power that warped the very air around him. His skin was deep charcoal, and two wickedly curved horns jutted from his brow, complementing unsettling, pitch-black eyes that glowed with a malevolent amusement.\nIt was Deimos, the Demon Lord of Discord. He paid the other two no heed, his gaze fixed on the city in the outside world as he strode past them, an emperor entering his domain.\nThe city of Ashgar, This was the City of Beginning and Conquer, the holy land where the first demons, the seven demon lords were released by their Void Beast creators, had taken root.\nThis city was where they created the demonic realm, a realm that was so vast that it connected to all the multiverses.\nAs the three Demon Lords entered, the two thousand Demon Gods standing guard—handpicked champions of by these demons lords—bowed their heads in silent, instinctual reverence. Their path led to a colossal castle at the city’s heart, a fortress carved from a single, mountain-sized obsidian stone.\nInside, in a grand, circular hall, a massive table of polished bone awaited them. Four other figures were already seated, each a monolith of ancient evil.\nThere was Phobos, the Lord of Fear, a being of shifting shadows and countless screaming faces. Belial, the Lord of Lies, a handsome, smiling demon whose eyes held no warmth.\nA shrouded, silent figure sat hunched over, a being whose very presence seemed to drain the hope from the air—the Demon of Despair. Opposite him, a gaunt, skeletal demon with a perpetually distended stomach gnawed on a blackened bone, its eyes burning with an endless, gnawing hunger—the Demon of Gluttony.\nThe seven Demon Lords were assembled.\n\"Shall we begin?\" Deimos asked, his voice calm but carrying an authority that left no room for dissent.\nSix voices replied in unison. \"Yes\".\n\"The Lord’s meeting is officially open,\" Deimos declared, his black eyes sweeping over his peers. \"If any of you have information of value, share it now\".\nIchor slammed a corroded fist on the table, his eagerness palpable. \"We should speak of the new Gods\".\n\"New Gods?\" Belial, the Lord of Lies, leaned forward, a look of genuine surprise on his deceptively charming face. The others turned to him, their expressions a mixture of disbelief and amusement. \"Don’t you know about this?\"\n\"I have been busy,\" Belial replied smoothly, a hint of annoyance flickering in his eyes at being so out of the loop. \"How many multiverses have they conquered?\"\nA wave of derisive laughter erupted around the table. It was a harsh, grating sound that echoed through the castle. Belial’s smile tightened, his curiosity about the situation increased even more.\nIchor finally took pity on him. \"Conquered? They are not conquerors, Belial. They are prey. Many of them are running and hiding from us as we speak\". He puffed out his chest with pride. \"I myself have already taken four of them as my personal slaves.\"\n\"Oh?\" Belial’s interest was piqued. \"Slaves? Then you must possess some valuable information, no?\" He was dumbfounded. The old Gods were formidable foes who had fought to their last breath. Killing many demons gods, and even killing the demon lords for millions of times, if these new Gods turned out to be weak, he would really be disappointed.\nIchor’s boastful expression faltered for a second. \"I... actually forgot to ask any questions because of the meeting,\" he admitted, a wave of regret washing over him. That simple oversight might have cost him thirty-four more planets.\n\"My territory is connected to a few million of them,\" a raspy voice whispered. It was Phobos, the Lord of Fear. \"Apart from a few with SS-Grade talents, the others are pathetically weak.\" He licked his lips, the grotesque sound echoing in the hall. \"But their fear... their fear is truly tasty.\"\n\"I know,\" Ichor agreed eagerly. \"The four I caught were crying buckets of tears. Such a delightful vintage.\"\nA deep, resonant voice cut through their boasting, silencing the room instantly. It was Deimos. \"One of these new Gods has caught my eye,\" he said, his tone casual, yet every Lord at the table leaned in, their full attention captured. \"You may have all the others.\"\n\"Oh?\" The other lords spoke almost in unison, their ears perked like predators sensing a worthy challenge after millennia of boredom. \"Is he strong?\"\nDeimos leaned back in his throne of bone, a slow, ancient smile spreading across his face. \"Perhaps,\" he replied, his eyes gazing into a distance only he could see. \"It has been centuries since I last saw him. He was just a fly back then.\"\nHe paused, letting the silence hang in the air, thick with anticipation.\n\"Now,\" Deimos continued, a dark, hungry amusement in his voice, \"I only hope he has grown into a dragon\".",

      "content": "Chapter 111: Ch 111 : Intuition\n\"Deimos, you have already chosen your prey this early?\" a weary voice echoed in the grand hall. It was Malakai, the Demon Lord of Despair, a shrouded figure whose very presence seemed to make the shadows in the room deeper. He spoke with a playful tone, but beneath it lay a profound, nihilistic boredom. \"Why choose one? In the end, they will all fall into despair anyway. The outcome is predetermined.\"\n\"You surely have a plan,\" Belial, the Lord of Lies, added, his gentle voice a stark contrast to the oppressive atmosphere. \"My gut feeling is screaming that this is more than a simple hunt.\"\n\"Plan?\" Ichor, the Lord of Corrosion, slammed his slimy hand on the bone table, leaving a sizzling, acidic mark. \"We can kill them all outright! What’s the point in waiting?\"\n\"What’s the fun in that?\" rasped Phobos, the Lord of Fear, a hundred terrified faces swirling within his shadowy form. \"A quick death offers a fleeting spark of terror. A long, slow decline... a civilization crumbling under paranoia and suspicion... that is a feast that can last for eons. These new Gods are fragile things; their fear is a delightful vintage I wish to savor.\"\n\"You are only trying to increase your own power here! You think we are fools?\" Ichor snapped back, his corrosive aura flaring.\n\"Shut up, both of you,\" Maledictus, the Lord of Curses, commanded, her melodic voice cutting through the argument with the sharpness of glass. \"Deimos, you continue.\"\nDeimos, the Lord of Discord, remained impassive. \"What Phobos says is right, but not for the reasons he thinks,\" he began, his voice calm and absolute. \"We must think of the future. What if, in a million years, new Gods emerge who are stronger than these? A cornered animal fights with all its might. A prosperous animal, made to fight its own brother for a bigger share of the spoils, bleeds itself dry without ever seeing the hunter’s knife.\" He let the sinister wisdom of his words settle over them.\n\"Thus, we will use our previous arrangement. We will sow discord. We will encourage infighting and plunder. We will make them their own executioners.\"\nHis declaration was not a suggestion; it was a verdict. In that moment, the fate of billions of new Gods was sealed.\nIn the serene void of his personal God space, Sunny was ripped from a state of profound comprehension. He had been on the very precipice of a breakthrough, a single step away from grasping the beginning stages of SSS-Grade mastery over the Law of Manifestation. He had been touching the very fabric of creation.\nThen, his Divine Intuition talent screamed.\nIt was not a thought or a feeling, but a violent, visceral shock to his divine soul. It was a cold, alien pressure, a premonition not of a single battle, but of an age of ruin. His entire being trembled with a dread so profound it felt as if the cosmos itself was holding its breath, waiting for an inevitable, catastrophic end.\nHe forced himself to calm the storm in his soul, his mind racing to identify the source. \"Thea!\" his voice was sharp, impatient, stripped of its usual calm. \"Analyze everything. Every universe, every planet, every particle. If you find a single thing amiss, contact me immediately!\"\n[Yes, Master,] Thea’s voice replied in his mind, and he could feel her consciousness expand in an instant. Her countless particles, a celestial nervous system spread across the multiverse, began their scan, a shockwave of pure analysis. A death of a single particle, a flicker of energy—nothing would escape her notice.\nSunny breathed a sigh of relief, but the cold feeling lingered. \"What are you demons up to?\" he whispered to the void, his senses already pointing him toward the source of this existential dread.\nIn the castle in Ashgar, a deep and maniacal laugh echoed from Deimos. \"He already sensed us. What an interesting God you are.\"\n\"Sensed us? A talent for intuition and a talent for evasion?\" Ichor scoffed, his fist beating a rhythm on the bone table. \"What is he? A Rat God?\"\n\"It is actually a good combination,\" Maledictus interjected, her analytical mind piecing together the puzzle. \"The main thing you didn’t notice, Ichor, is that he possesses at least two distinct high-grade talents, while the other Gods we’ve encountered possess only one.\"\n\"That is precisely why he is interesting,\" Deimos replied, leaning back in his throne. \"The first time I saw him, centuries ago, I couldn’t tell he was a new God. His aura... it felt ancient, far too similar to the old ones.\" He remembered the moment clearly—a brief tear in the fabric of space, and through it, the gaze of a masked being that held the weight of eons. \"I thought him a reincarnation, but that cannot be. We have all their souls in the Well of No Return.\"\n\"The last time I checked, all twenty-five billion souls were still stuck in the well of no return\" Phobos confirmed, a flicker of disappointment in his voice. \"Only Adam was missing. They were quite boring, I must say. Not a single scream of fear could I harvest from them.\"\n\"Do not worry about Adam,\" Maledictus said, a cruel pride in her voice. \"His soul is bound by my masterpiece, a curse so perfect that not even the God of Growth can outgrow it. He cannot be reborn, nor can he survive much longer.\" She smiled. \"I believe these new Gods are his last, desperate hope, created with that SSS-Grade artifact he managed to hide from us.\"\n\"So that artifact is now gone?\" a new voice rumbled. It was Beelzebub, the Demon of Gluttony, who had been silently gnawing on a petrified star throughout the meeting. \"A pity. I was always curious to find it.\"\n\"Oh, want to eat some Demon Gods?\" Ichor asked, knowing the Glutton’s habits.\n\"The taste of Gods is far better than eating planets or stars,\" Beelzebub replied, his voice a low, hollow groan. \"They have a unique flavor... a complex bouquet of power, belief, and eons of existence. Stars are so... bland in comparison.\" His talent, the ability to gain power by devouring matter and energy, made him potentially the strongest among them.\nThe only reason he wasn’t was because the other six Demon Lords worked together to keep his insatiable hunger in check, lest he devour the entire multiverse.",

      "content": "Chapter 112: Ch 112 : Discord among Gods?\n\"So, Deimos, what is your master plan this time?\" Maledictus asked, a silkiness to her voice that belied the venomous power she commanded. Deimos’s schemes were the very reason they had triumphed over the old Gods, and she was eager to see what poison he had concocted for the new ones.\nDeimos, the Lord of Discord, allowed a slow, predatory smile to spread across his face. \"I have sent some of the demon gods under my command to observe the unity among these new whelps. And I have found something... truly interesting.\"\n\"What?\" the other Demon Lords replied almost in unison, their collective attention now focused entirely on him.\n\"There is a demigod under this ’God Cosmos’,\" Deimos began, projecting a shimmering, ethereal image of Thea’s interconnected particles above the bone table. It looked like a beautiful, blue web of captured starlight. \"She is a being of pure energy, with talents like thought sharing and replication. Her particles are a network, a web that connects these new Gods across the entire multiverse. It is their greatest tool, the source of their newfound unity.\"\n\"Then let us simply corrode this network of his!\" Ichor, the Lord of Corrosion, snarled, his impatience evident.\n\"No,\" Maledictus countered, her eyes gleaming with cunning. \"This is far better. A curse must be woven into the victim’s greatest strength. We will not destroy their web, Deimos. We shall turn it into a poison.\"\n\"Precisely,\" Deimos affirmed, his smile widening. \"We need to sow discord through this demigod of his.\" He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper as he dictated his plan. \"We need to divide them and then conquer them\"\n[Master, an SS-Grade talent-holder is requesting to join as your subordinate,] Thea’s voice chimed in Sunny’s mind.\n\"Oh? Who is it?\" Sunny asked, his curiosity piqued. He was always interested in SS-Grade talents for their unique methods of faith generation.\n[It’s Asura, the God of the planet where the lifeform Lux resides.]\n\"What’s his talent? Have you analyzed it?\" Sunny asked curiously, he was intrested in talent of SS-Grade because of their faith generation.\n[I was not able to, Master. His talent is truly mysterious, I wasn’t able to find a link. I believe I need to increase the scope of the analysis.]\n\"No need,\" Sunny replied. \"Focus on your task of finding any anomalies in the multiverse. I will check his talent myself when I meet him.\" He sent the call to Asura.\nIn his own God space, Asura jolted as the divine summons arrived. To show his sincerity, he accepted it without a second’s hesitation. An image materialized before him—a figure cloaked in a robe of cosmic energy, a black mask hiding his face, but his eyes were two swirling galaxies that radiated a calm, absolute power. The aura was so immense that Asura felt an involuntary urge to bow.\n\"Greetings, God Cosmos,\" Asura said, his voice trembling slightly.\n\"Greetings, God Asura. I received your message. Are you ready to move your world?\" Sunny’s voice was even and direct, holding no judgment, only purpose.\n\"Yes,\" Asura replied, a genuine smile of relief spreading across his face. With that single word, his long-held wish to protect his people would finally be fulfilled.\nSunny nodded, and a shimmering portal tore open in Asura’s God space. It expanded, engulfing his entire planet. Asura felt his world, his entire reality, being gently but irresistibly lifted and moved through the cosmos.\nWhen the light subsided, he found himself in a new, vibrant solar system, surrounded by dozens of other planets.\nA figure was already floating toward his God space. Knowing no one would be foolish enough to cause trouble under Cosmos’s protection, Asura opened his domain.\n\"Hello, newcomer!\" the God said, puffing out his chest with pride. \"I am Zir, one of the top subordinates of God Cosmos!\"\n\"Hello, Zir. I am Asura,\" he replied politely. \"I have just joined. I hope you can tell me how things work here.\" He had heard good things, but he was still prepared for underlying conditions.\n\"Things work pretty smoothly here,\" Zir began, his voice filled with the zealous loyalty of a true believer. \"No demons to worry about. Your only job is to strengthen your lifeforms. The best ones even get a chance to go to Veridia for special nourishment. It has thousands of mana veins; even a fool could become a dragon there!\"\n\"And what are the other costs? Apart from the 25% faith tithe?\" Asura asked, bracing himself for the catch.\nZir looked at him, genuinely confused, and then laughed. \"What other costs? That’s it! That’s the only term. You give 25% faith, you get absolute protection, and you get access to all the benefits.\"\n\"Benefits?\" Asura asked, his mind still trying to process the simplicity of the deal.\nZir’s grin widened. \"Oh, you have no idea. Every God and lifeform in this subspace gets a five-fold increase in their comprehension. The chances of being born with powerful talents like magic affinity, sound affinity, and intuition are dramatically increased. Many lifeforms are even born with a natural regal aura.\"\nZir continued to list the buffs, but Asura’s mind had stopped working after the first one. Five times the comprehension? For everyone? The value of such a gift was immeasurable. The 25% faith that he needs to give now seemed laughably small. He would have gladly offered 99%.\n\"Are we even in the same league as him? Doesn’t this 5 times comprehension alone makes his talent an S-Grade, similar to Strategist the God of wisdom\" Asura whispered, his mind reeling from the sheer scale of God Cosmos’s power and generosity.\n\"The same league?\" Zir chuckled. \"We never were. And my friend, you haven’t even heard about the main dish that God Cosmos is serving us.\" He gave Asura a mysterious, knowing smile, leaving the newcomer utterly dumbfounded and hungry for more.\nIn his God space, Sunny listened to the conversation between the two Gods, a small smirk playing on his lips.\nDeciding it was time to solve the mystery that had eluded even Thea, Sunny focused his will and activated his God’s Eye talent on Asura.",

      "content": "Chapter 113: Ch 113 : Greatest Choice\nIn his God space, Sunny watched the interaction between his two subordinates, a faint smirk hidden behind his cosmic mask. Zir’s zealous pride was an amusing, yet valuable, sign of loyalty. But it was Asura, the newcomer, who held his complete attention.\nThis was a God with an unreadable SS-Grade talent, a mystery that even Thea’s vast analytical power could not solve. Sunny decided it was time to get a clearer picture. He focused his will, and a few thousand of his faith vanished from his reserves as he directed the full, penetrating power of his God’s Eye upon Asura.\nThe universe of information that flooded his mind was staggering.\n[God Name: Asura]\n[Planet Name: Kshara]\n[Lifeforms: 834 Million]\n[Talent: Evildoer (SS-Grade)]\n[Faith: 1,210,324,578]\nSunny’s focus immediately locked onto the talent’s description, and for a moment, even he felt a chill.\n[Talent Name: Evildoer]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: Faith is generated through the evil deeds committed by the lifeforms in your territory. The amount of faith is proportional to the severity of the evil act. Acts such as murder, betrayal, and causing widespread suffering generate immense faith.]\n\"A terrifying talent,\" Sunny thought, his initial reaction cold and strategic. \"A double-edged sword. At one moment, you could be earning faith by the second; the next, your world could be a ruin of your own making.\" He glanced at Asura’s faith reserve. One billion points. A respectable sum. \"Did he use it?\"\nHe was not Asura’s judge. As long as a subordinate God did not threaten his empire, their methods were their own. Yet, a deep curiosity, an instinct honed by his own unique nature, took over. The knowledge was worth the price. His God’s Eye delved deeper, peeling back the layers of Asura’s existence, showing him everything.\nHe saw flashes of Asura’s mortal life on Endor: a loving family, a quiet life, dreams of a peaceful future. He saw the heart-wrenching moment of transmigration, the frantic search for his loved ones in the early chaos of the God Chat, and the crushing silence when he realized they were gone forever.\nHe witnessed the profound horror on Asura’s face the moment he understood the nature of his \"blessing\"—a cursed talent that ran contrary to his very soul.\n\"What a pitiful fellow,\" Sunny’s thoughts softened, the cold analysis replaced by a wave of genuine empathy. He saw a memory play out with vivid clarity: two of clans in Asura’s world stood on the brink of a bloody war over a fertile valley. Asura could feel the potential faith, a torrent of power waiting to be unleashed by the impending slaughter. He could have become immensely powerful in that single moment.\nBut instead, Sunny watched as Asura, with a pained expression, sent a subtle divine revelation—a shared dream of a bountiful harvest—that guided the two clans toward peace.\n\"He didn’t use his talent once,\" Sunny gasped, a newfound respect dawning. \"Not once.\" He knew that if he were in that position, starved for power and desperate for security, he might have made a different choice.\nAsura’s discipline, his unwavering adherence to his own morality in the face of such temptation, was a strength far greater than any talent.\nA new plan began to formulate in Sunny’s mind, a way to harness the immense power of Asura’s talent without corrupting his soul.\n\"The main dish? What is left?\" Asura asked, his mind already numb. Safety, a comprehension boost, new talents for his people—what more could there possibly be?\n\"First, let’s sit,\" Zir said with a mysterious smile, manifesting two comfortable chairs and a table laden with exotic foods and drinks from the entire cosmos \"You’re going to need to be sitting for this.\"\nHe started digging into a plate of what looked like roasted celestial fowl, understanding these benifits would take a while. \"The first benefit is the Cosmic Shop.\"\nAsura’s brow furrowed. \"We already had a System Shop. What’s the difference? A discount?\"\n\"See for yourself,\" Zir shrugged, gesturing for Asura to open his system panel.\nAsura did so instinctively and saw a notification: [Update Available]. He pressed the button, and the familiar icon for the System Shop transformed, its name changing to ’Cosmic Shop.’ He looked at the application’s description:\n[A marketplace of wonders, exclusively for the subordinates of God Cosmos].\nHe opened it. The interface that greeted him was breathtaking. The background was not a simple blue screen but a living starfield of swirling nebulas and distant galaxies.\nHe navigated to the listings, and his eyes widened in utter disbelief. The items here were on a completely different level from the old shop.\nThere were Divine Embryos. There were SS-Grade weapons shimmering with unimaginable power. There were rare, otherworldly herbs from every corner of the multiverse, techniques for mana control, advanced technology blueprints, and even an SS-Grade Navigator Orb.\n\"Is this... real?\" Asura whispered, the words catching in his throat. He felt an urge to pinch himself, to check if he was dreaming. Before he could, Zir reached over and gave his shoulder a firm squeeze.\n\"Ouch!\" Asura cried out, the sharp sting of reality confirming he was awake. He was too stunned to even snap back at Zir.\nHis gaze returned to the shop. He clicked on the [Divine Embryo], priced at thirty thousand faith points, and, on a whim, pressed ’buy’. In the space between one heartbeat and the next, a pulsating, ethereal embryo materialized from thin air, hovering silently before him. It was real. Tangible. The potential for a loyal demigod, a power that others only dreamed of, was now his for a price he could actually afford.\nAsura’s eyes became bloodshot with overwhelming emotion. He finally understood. He understood Zir’s unshakable loyalty. The benefits of serving God Cosmos were truly endless.\n\"So now you get it?\" Zir said between bites. \"And that’s not all. There’s also the concept of Heaven and Hell. The souls of your righteous lifeforms will find peace in Heaven, while the wicked will be taken to Hell for judgment\"\nAsura’s mind, already stretched to its limit, simply went blank. He held up a hand in surrender. \"Just... just tell me everything at once,\" he said, his voice weak with awe. \"I’ll try to digest it all later.\" He now knew, with absolute certainty, that his decision to become a subordinate was the greatest choice he had ever made.",

And with continuous practice, you can increase the grade of that talent all the way to SS-Grade.\" Even now, after witnessing it for himself, the concept still filled Zir with a profound sense of awe.\n\"What?\" The single word escaped Asura’s lips, but his mouth remained open, his mind completely short-circuiting. Even if a fly entered his mouth, he wouldn’t have noticed it, thankfully there were none in the God Chat.\nThe universe, as he understood it, had just shattered. For a God whose entire existence had been defined by the cruel, unchangeable nature of his talent, the idea that limits could be broken was aprofound revelation .\nCould I... learn a different talent?\nhe thought, his heart pounding.\nSeeing Asura’s stuck state, Zir couldn’t help but joke. \"You don’t understand? Let’s say you love archery, but you have no talent for it. In any other world, you could practice for a million years and only become skilled. Here, if you truly master it, a talent for archery will bloom within your very soul.\"\n\"I know of it... it is similar to the talent of the old God, Adam,\" Asura managed to say, his voice a hoarse whisper. He had heard Adam describe it during those final hours, but he had never dreamed he would have something so out of reach in his hand now.\n\"Good then,\" Zir said, holding back a laugh. He stood up from his chair. \"I think you understand how things work here. I should get going. My elves will probably cook all the mermaids if I don’t check on them.\" He winked, then vanished in a flicker of light as quickly as he had come.\nLeft alone in his new God space, Asura gazed at the pulsating divine embryo that still hovered before him. A week ago, this would have been an impossible dream. Now, it was not just a dream; it was th seed of a future he never thought he could have, a symbol of boundless, unimaginable hope.\nHe was not able to buy the divine embryo from the system shop because of low faith points, but now the same Divine embryo was floating in front of him, this feeling was magical for him.\n\"Thea, I am getting a bad feeling,\" Sunny’s voice was a low hum in the vastness of his God space. \"Let’s teleport all the Gods who are ready to become my subordinate. Now.\"\nHis intuition was screaming, of the incoming danger, His faith reserves were overflowing; with billions of Gods now using the Cosmic Shop, his earnings had skyrocketed to over three hundred billion. He could afford to be decisive.\n[Initiating contact, Master,] Thea’s voice replied, her efficiency absolute. [Permission is required for planetary and divine body translocation.]\nThea began her work, sending out the formal invitations and preparing the immense portals. But within minutes, an anomaly was detected. A cascade of refusals began to flood the network.\n[Master, many of the Gods who were willing to join are now stepping back. They are canceling their requests,] Thea reported, a hint of digital confusion in her tone.\n\"What? How can that be?\" Sunny demanded. He knew Thea’s network was secure; any attempt to spread lies or dissent would be instantly fact-checked and neutralized. Something else was at play.\n[Master, I seem to have lost connection with some of my particles,] Thea’s voice became grave. [I can feel their existence, but I can no longer control them. They are... acting on their own.]\n\"Hijacked,\" Sunny breathed, the word like ice in his consciousness.\n[Just a few minutes ago, an anonymous post began circulating in the God Chat,] Thea continued, a new panel materializing before Sunny. [It contains the precise locations of numerous SSS-Grade treasures within the Realm of Advancement.]\nSunny scanned the list, the names themselves a were call of an ultimate power: The Spear of Titans. The Pill of Life. The God Maker Fruit. It was a map to godhood itself, and it had been broadcast to every corner of the multiverse.\n\"Can you self-destruct those rogue particles?\" Sunny asked, his voice cold and hard.\n[Yes, Master. I am on it.]\nAcross the multiverse, a silent, cosmic tremor was felt as a third of Thea’s network a trillion faith points worth of energy particles simply ceased to exist. It was a massive, self-inflicted wound, a necessary amputation to stop the spread of a deadly infection.\n\"A huge loss,\" Sunny said, his jaw tight. \"Thea, from now on, if you detect any particle has been disconnected from your control, destroy it instantly.\" He knew who was behind this. \"The demons.\"\nBut this was not a time for despair. A God does not lose hope. \"Accept any God who is still willing to join,\" he commanded. \"And notify all the others. The offer to join the Cosmic Empire is a one-time opportunity. Those who do not accept it now will not be given a second chance.\"\nHe needed loyalty, not just numbers. In a few thousands years, Veridia would birth its own new Gods. He did not need allies who would abandon a fortress for some treasures.\n[Master, you are right,] Thea affirmed. [In the face of greed, they have forgotten your grace.]\nSunny nodded, then called a meeting. In a vast, virtual hall, the projections of over a billion subordinate Gods appeared, their faces a mixture of confusion, loyalty, and curiosity. Sunny materialized before them, his masked visage and cosmic robe radiating an aura of absolute authority.\n\"Greetings God Cosmos\" immediately the voice of over billion God shook the small universe that Sunny created.\n\"Greetings,\" his voice echoed, silencing the hall instantly. \"As you have no doubt seen in the God Chat, the topic of today’s meeting is the treasures of the Realm of Advancement.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 115: Ch 115 : The Pantheon Of Gods\nAcross billions of God spaces, the universe fell silent. The chaotic, hopeful chatter about SSS-Grade treasures was abruptly cut short as a new panel materialized before every God who had not yet pledged allegiance to Cosmos.\nIt was a stark, un-closable interface, a divine decree that filled their entire perception. There was no room for negotiation, no option to delay. Only one question and a simple, terrifying choice to make.\n[Do you wish to join the Pantheon of Gods?]\n[YES / NO]\n[Note: This is a one-time offer. After this, you will not be able to join the Pantheon of Gods. You may still use the system as you see fit.]\nThe choice was absolute: a mad, desperate gamble for mythical treasures, or the guaranteed protection of the most powerful God in their multiverse.\n\"Damn it, why can’t I close this panel?\" a God shouted into the emptiness of his space, his frustration echoing the thoughts of millions.\n[You must choose one option before you can use the system,] Thea’s calm, dispassionate voice replied in his mind.\n\"System, I need to discuss this with my family first!\" another God pleaded, his voice cracking with urgency.\nThea, who knew the nature and habit of each of the Gods like a back of her hands, she his plea was genuine. She immediately opened a private channel for his family.\nIn the end, their choice was simple. \"Forget the treasure!\" a mother said to her husband, their children’s divine projections huddled around them. \"I just want our family to be safe and together. What more could we ask for?\" They pressed [YES].\nMillions of similar conversations took place across the cosmos. Those with families, those who valued security over ambition, chose the sanctuary of the Cosmic Empire.\nThe only ones who hesitated were the proud, the powerful, and those whose worlds happened to be in a very close proximity to the rumored treasure locations.\nIn a God space filled with cherry blossom trees and the gentle sound of flowing water, a beautiful woman with nine fluffy fox tails and twitching ears looked at the panel with pure disdain. \"You think far too highly of yourself, Cosmos,\" she purred, her voice dripping with an arrogant confidence.\nShe hugged the handsome, emotionless demigod at her side and, without a second thought, pressed [NO]. The panel vanished.\nKitsune, a holder of a powerful SS-Grade talent, was certain she needed no one. \"With my power and the treasures of the realm,\" she laughed, \"I will surpass you in no time.\"\nElsewhere, Strategist stared at the panel, his mind a whirlwind of cold, hard logic. \"Independence is irrelevant if it leads to annihilation,\" he reasoned to himself. \"Subordination under an overwhelmingly powerful entity is the correct path to achieving my own objectives.\"\nHis lifelong goal was to create lifeforms capable of reaching the demigod realm, and he knew Sunny’s manifestation talent could be the key. With a sigh of he pressed [YES]. \"Well,\" he murmured, \"I am an employee again. But at least I am still a God.\"\nSimilar scenes played out across the Multiverse. In the end, when the final choice was tallied, an astonishing four and a half billion new Gods had chosen to join Sunny’s empire.\nIt was more than he had ever expected. But Sunny didn’t know the depth of his own legend. To the billions of Gods who were about to be left isolated after the System’s demise, he was not just another powerhouse. He was the one who had connected them, the benevolent, if unapologetically capitalist, God who had brought light back into their lonely existences.\nIn Sunny’s God space, he watched the final number settle on his own panel. 5.5 billion subordinate Gods. A smirk played on his lips.\nHe was in a video call with his original one billion followers, but he raised a hand to pause the conversation. \"Wait a minute, everyone,\" he said. \"The meeting will be delayed due to some... new arrivals.\"\nThe Gods in the call began to speculate the numbers of new arrival, but none dared to speak.\n\"Thea, add all 4.5 billion new members to this call,\" Sunny commanded.\n[Yes, Master.]\nAcross the multiverse, the newly agreed subordinates were jolted as a video call notification appeared on their panels. The caller ID was simple and awe-inspiring: [Pantheon of Gods].\nThey accepted, and their view was immediately filled with the sight of the masked God Cosmos, presiding over a cosmic assembly of billions.\n\"Greetings to you all,\" Sunny’s voice boomed, carrying a weight that commanded absolute attention. \"Our Pantheon of Gods now numbers five and a half billion. This is a cause for celebration.\" He paused, letting the weight of that number sink in.\n\"But celebrations can wait. We must first focus on the matter at hand: the so-called SSS-Grade treasures.\"\nHis voice hardened, turning from welcoming to glacial. \"Let me be clear. This map you have seen is not a gift. It is a lure. It is poison disguised as honey, laid for you by the Demon Lords themselves.\"\nA wave of palpable fear rippled through the 5.5 billion divine projections. The name ’Demon Lords’ carried a horror that even their godhood could not diminish.\n\"But they are cowards,\" Sunny continued, his tone shifting, becoming a source of strength. \"The Demon Lords cannot set foot in that realm, just as we cannot. The guardians of this ’treasure’ are not gods, but demigods. They are powerful, yes. But they can bleed. And they can die.\"\nThe fear in the hall began to transform, hardening into a collective, grim resolve. In that moment, a single God, unafraid to speak before the billions, activated his microphone. It was Strategist. \"God Cosmos, may I ask something?\"\nSunny inclined his head, his gaze from behind the mask seeming to pierce through Strategist’s very soul. \"You may,\" he replied, his voice echoing with the majesty of an emperor. \"This pantheon is not mine alone. My decision is final, that is true. But you all have every right to convince me.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 116: Ch 116 : A new Player\nStrategist cleared his throat, the sound a subtle but effective call for silence in the vast, virtual call. \"First of all,\" he began, his voice calm and measured, \"it is a distinct pleasure to speak before you all, and especially before you, God Cosmos.\" He gave a respectful nod, a gesture that immediately captured the attention of the 5.5 billion Gods present.\n\"My question is a simple one,\" he continued, framing his words not as a complaint, but as a concern, a concern that every God should agree with. \"Many of us in this pantheon lack the vanguard demigods necessary for a direct assault on fortified demonic positions where the treasures are kept. My own demigod, for instance, is a being of pure intellect, not combat. How do we, as a unified force, address this strategic disparity?\"\nThe question hung in the air, a perfect articulation of the fear lingering in the hearts of the four and a half billion newcomers. In response, a wave of quiet, knowing chuckles rippled through the ranks of Sunny’s original one billion followers.\nSunny’s voice, hiding a smirk, echoed through the hall. \"A valid point, Strategist. I wouldn’t want to spoil the fun for your seniors, however. I suggest you discuss that particular matter with them after this meeting.\"\nThe newcomers looked at each other in confusion, while the \"seniors\" felt a surge of pride. It was a subtle gesture from Sunny, a way of acknowledging their loyalty and giving them a place of honor. Before anyone else could speak, Zir’s projection beamed, his avatar practically preening.\n\"You can all just come to me!\" he announced with the swagger of a man who owned the place. \"I am the right-hand man of the Boss. I’ll get you all up to speed.\"\n\"Let’s postpone these questions for now,\" Sunny interjected, his voice a majestic hum that effortlessly reclaimed control of the meeting. \"You will have time for such discussions later. Our focus, for now, is the treasure.\"\nHe turned his masked gaze to the void beside him. \"Thea, open the map.\"\n[Yes, Master,] Thea’s voice replied, and a new panel materialized before every God. It was a living, three-dimensional map of the Realm of Advancement, a breathtaking holographic display where pulsating red icons marked the treasure locations and shimmering blue threads connected the portals of every world.\n\"As you can see,\" Sunny began, his voice resonating with the tone of a commander, which was possible because of his immense knowledge from the combat master talent, \"there are approximately one hundred treasures. And there are six billion Gods. It is a masterpiece of temptation. The Demon Lords are not asking us to fight them. They are asking us to fight each other.\"\nHe let that sink in before continuing, imparting the wisdom he’d gained from Adam. \"Like us, they pay a price for their intervention. Every direct intervention drains their power. It is far cheaper to hand a mortal a knife and whisper poisonous thoughts in his ear than it is to strike the blow yourself. That is their strategy.\" He paused, his cosmic eyes sweeping across the billions of divine faces. \"But now, we are together. I will not say this fight will be easy, but the pressure is far less than it was before.\"\nA palpable shift occurred in the atmosphere of the grand meeting. The anxiety and fear that had been simmering beneath the surface began to evaporate, replaced by a grim, unified resolve. They had a leader, they had a plan, and for the first time, they had hope.\nAfter laying out the initial strategies for scouting and resource sharing, Sunny quietly left the video call. He heaved a sigh of relief, a surprisingly human sound in the divine silence of his God space.\nEverything had gone well. He had turned a demonic plot into a catalyst for unity.\nBut just as a feeling of satisfaction began to settle over him, his intuition jolted him with a violence that made his form shudder. It wasn’t the vast, looming dread of the Demon Lords; this was different. It was a splinter of alien wrongness, a single, sharp note of dissonance in the cosmic symphony. It felt... Wrony. A Calculated lie.\n\"What... How...\"\nIn a forgotten corner of the Realm of Advancement, in a squalid camp filled with the lifeforms of a God who had foolishly chosen treasure over sanctuary, a boy lay dying.\nAt seventeen, he was a skeletal figure, his body ravaged by malnutrition and a festering infection in his leg. He looked at the gray, unforgiving sky, his breath coming in shallow, ragged gasps.\nSuddenly, a cold, mechanical voice sounded directly inside his skull.\n[Interdimensional System #1423, is connecting with host...]\nThe boy, whose name was Kael, flinched. A shimmering, unfamiliar panel appeared before his eyes. \"What is this...?\" he whispered weakly, trying to push himself away from the pain that his body felt.\n[Host is suffering from critical malnutrition and septic infection. A Full Body Recovery Pill has been gifted.]\nA pill, shimmering with a cold, golden light, materialized out of thin air and hovered before his face. Kael stared at it, his mind clouded with the pain and fear. After a moment of desperate contemplation, he realized he had nothing left to lose. He was dying anyway. Why not try? With a final, desperate effort, he lunged forward and swallowed the pill whole.\nAn intense heat erupted in his stomach, spreading through his veins like fire. Steam hissed from his skin. \"What is happening?!\" he screamed, a surge of adrenaline so powerful that he forgot he had been too weak to even move moments before. His body convulsed on the dirty ground, the pain excruciating.\n[Host, you are currently undergoing cellular reconstruction. Kindly move with caution.]\n\"Oh...\" Kael gasped, the pain subsiding as quickly as it had come. He looked down at his body. The grotesque infection on his leg was gone, replaced by smooth, healthy skin. The gnawing hunger in his belly had vanished. He felt... strong. Stronger than he had ever felt in his life.",

      "content": "Chapter 117: Ch 117 : The scent of Lies\nIn the grand cosmic game between gods, a demigod is like a queen on a chessboard. It’s powerful, and its presence can change the entire board, but its every move is watched. Sometimes, a god doesn’t need a queen. Sometimes, what they need is a pawn, hidden in the chaos, with the potential to cross the board and become a queen on its own.\n​This was the core idea behind Thea’s most ambitious secret project: the Interdimensional Heroes program. Scattered across the multiverse were countless worlds, each with millions of lifeforms. Among them were individuals with great potential who were overlooked, oppressed, or simply unlucky. These were Thea’s targets. She would find them and gift them a unique, personalized \"system\", a tool to guide their growth and give them a fighting chance.\n​These chosen lifeforms were not aware they were serving a greater purpose. They simply saw a miraculous chance to escape their grim reality. They were given missions, and with each completed task, they grew stronger, earning rewards that seemed like divine gifts. They became legends in their own worlds, champions of the downtrodden. But in reality, they were Sunny’s scalpels, subtle, silent agents who could be guided to perform tasks in places where a demigod’s presence would be too loud, too obvious. Kael, a boy once starving in a refugee camp, was the 1,423rd such hero. And he wouldn’t be the last.\n​Sunny sat on his throne, a rare moment of peace settling over him. His new universe of subordinate gods was stabilizing, his demigods were handling their duties, and Veridia was flourishing. For a moment, it felt like everything was under control.\n​But peace is a fragile thing. As a sudden jolt from his divine intuition shattered the calm.\n​It wasn’t a loud alarm or a vision of impending doom, but a quieter, more unsettling feeling—a subtle wrongness that made the hairs on his divine form stand on end. His focus immediately narrowed, and the feeling latched onto one thing: the treasure map that had sent the entire multiverse into a frenzy.\n​An old saying from his life on Endor echoed in his mind:\n’If you’re getting something for free, you are the product.’\n​The new Gods, blinded by their greed for SSS-Grade power, had forgotten that simple, human truth. They saw a free gift and sprinted towards it without a single question. Even he had been focused on the consequences of their greed, not the source of the information itself. He knew not all the Gods were foolish, because even he, a cautious God, had fallen for this greed...\n​\"No, it isn’t greed. It’s something else...\" he thought, as his mind raced back to Adam’s description of the seven Demon Lords, their personalities, and their domains of power. One name clicked into place with horrifying clarity.\n​\"Belial... the Demon Lord of Lies.\"\n​He finally understood. This wasn’t just a trap. Belial’s power wasn’t about telling simple lies; it was about rewriting reality in the minds of his victims. He could hold up a rock, call it the sun, and billions would feel its warmth on their skin. The treasure map wasn’t just bait; it was a mass hallucination, a lie so perfect that it felt more real than the truth. The whisper of doubt from his intuition was the only reason he could see through it.\n​\"Thea,\" he commanded, his voice sharp. \"Replicate. Send particles to every treasure location on that map. I want to know if they are truly there or not.\" He didn’t hesitate, pushing ten billion faith points into her replication talent. Instantly, a torrent of new energy particles burst forth, shooting out into the cosmos on their verification mission.\nHe heaved a sigh of relief as he awaited Thea’s analysis of the situation, but instead of the report a new notification poped in.\n​[Master, a century has passed in Veridia,]\n​\"Already?\" Sunny exclaimed. He was so consumed by the recent events that he hadn’t even noticed the time. Eight hours had vanished in a flash, and with them, the ninth day of his godhood. The tenth day had begun.\n​He began thinking of the next talent to copy, his thoughts wandering to the current situation. \"If Nova goes to the Realm of Advancement, it will be difficult for her to maintain focus on both places,\" Sunny said to himself. Nova’s focus was always on maintaining the time flow for Veridia, but he didn’t want her to spend all her energy on that single task. It was a burden he should carry himself.\n​With this thought in mind, he focused his will and used his Skill-Resonance talent to copy the Time Affinity from Nova.\n​A familiar, exhilarating rush surged through him as the new power settled into his being. It was the feeling of cosmic clockwork, the silent, immutable rhythm of time, flowing into and becoming a part of his very soul. He checked his status with his God’s Eye.\n​[Talent Name: Time Affinity]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: You can now perceive and manipulate the Law of Time to create and use time-based magic. The chance of lifeforms in your territory being born with time-based talents is increased.]\n​He immediately informed his subordinate Gods and demigods of this new passive benefit, then turned his attention back to Nova. ’You are relieved of your duty to maintain Veridia’s time flow,’ he commanded her through their mental connection. ’Your place is in the Realm of Advancement. Unearth these treasures, and kill any demon demigods you find waiting in ambush.’\n​Nova acknowledged the command and immediately let go of her time acceleration magic on Veridia.\n​Sunny then turned his own gaze to Veridia. He took over the time acceleration spell himself, feeling the drain on his faith. \"Only twenty faith points for a full planetary year?\" he mused. \"What a steal.\" It was a cheap price, and a far more flexible solution than using his Divine Command to permanently alter the world’s laws, which was much more costly.\n​A new sense of purpose settled over him. He had a new power, a new understanding of the enemy’s insidious strategy, and a plan to strengthen his demigods for the battles to come. The tenth day was going to be a long one for Sunny and all the Gods.",

      "content": "Chapter 118: Ch 118 : Strength You Desire\n[Master, the treasures look real, and the energy emitted from them is many times stronger than any SS-Grade item,] Thea’s melodious voice reported. A system panel materialized before Sunny, showing shimmering images of the artifacts. [But as my Omni-Cognition talent is just SS-Grade, I cannot check the status of these items. Portals also do not work on them; we will need to pick these treasures up manually.]\n\"Hmm... It looks real,\" Sunny murmured, his gaze lingering on the image of a single, luminous pill. In his mind’s eye, he didn’t see an artifact; he saw a vision of a healthy, restored Adam, the old god’s weary soul finally freed from the curse that was slowly erasing him.\n\"If it is real, I want this pill before any other treasure,\" Sunny said, his voice firm. \"Who has the portal closest to it?\"\n[Master, the closest God is named Maneken, an S-Grade talent holder. Kitsune is also at some distance. The bad thing is, both of them are not in the Pantheon.]\n\"Truly bad luck,\" Sunny sighed. \"Who is the closest to this treasure in our Pantheon then?\" The portal of that God would be their gateway, their first step to securing the pill.\n[Master, God Reflection has the portal nearest to this treasure.]\n\"Oh, Reflection,\" Sunny said. He sent a direct, private message to him, notifying him to keep his eyes on the treasure from a distance with the help of a demigod. With his scout in place, Sunny turned his attention to his own forces.\n\"Thea, call all the demigods back from wherever they are. It’s time for a meeting,\" Sunny commanded, his voice echoing with urgency. \"Use the portals to call them. We don’t have much time.\" His prime focus now was to increase the strength of his demigods.\nIn just five minutes, they began to arrive. From every corner of the cosmos they served, the demigods of races and the demigods of laws appeared in the God space of Sunny. They stood in a silent, reverent line before his throne, arranged according to the hierarchy of their creation—a tradition born not from Sunny’s command, but from their own deep-seated respect.\nAt the head of the line, magnificent and magestic, stood Nova, the Guardian of Veridia. As the demigod of space and time, and the mother of dragons and the Dragonborn, her presence was a calm, steady anchor in the swirling cosmos.\nBeside her, Umbra coalesced from the very shadows of the God space. The SSS-Grade Ring of Shadow on her shadowy finger pulsed with a quiet menace. She was the Demigod of Shadows, a silent assassin, a supportive power that could provide any buff at a whim.\nThen came Shenlong, the demigod of miracles and hope, his serpentine form radiating a gentle, benevolent power, a being who could achieve anything if you held hope in your heart. He was followed by the grinning, ever-shifting form of Loki, the demigod of mischief and deception. His illusions were so perfect that no demigod, other than Nova and Mammon with their profound talents in perception, could hope to see through them.\nA shimmering projection of pure energy solidified into the form of Thea, the demigod of communication and connection, the living system who bound them all together.\nNext stood Isiah, the Demigod of Knowledge and caretaker of the Divine Library. His knowledge was so vast it felt as if he knew everything, and he truly did; every new talent, technique, or spell born in the multiverse was known to him and stored in his library. He was followed by the hulking, menacing form of Cerberus, the demigod of death and torture, the sole caretaker of the Netherworld.\nEighth in line was the divine pair, Uranus and Gaia, the Demigods of Life, rebirth, and reincarnation, their angelic wings folded serenely behind them. After them stood Mammon, the demigod of Greed, a trader whose debts must always be paid in full, and who was currently the strongest among them because of his unique talent.\nThe tenth and final demigod of a law was Sugata, the newest entry to their army, a being of peace whose contracts bound even gods.\nBehind these great powers stood the progenitors of the races, a living testament to Veridia’s diversity. There was the human demigod, Aethel, a tall and burly man from whom an aura of pure strength radiated. Beside him was the beautiful elven demigod, Valeria, whose every graceful move crackled with mana.\nThe demigod of titans, Goliath, sat in a lotus position, yet his size was large enough to match Nova’s, the power clear in his coiled muscles. Then came Broc, the demigod of giants, five times the size of a human, his tusks sending chills into the surrounding space.\nThe chimera Kaelan, demigod of the Beastfolks, looked agile, dangerous, and strong all at once. From a summoned pool of water rose the seven-headed serpentine form of Hydra, demigod of the merfolks, its predatory gaze silent and watchful.\nThere was the dwarf demigod Magnus, tiny in stature but with a hammer in hand and an aura that spoke of an all-consuming passion for crafting.\nThe robot Nexus of the Machina race stood with him, each of his body parts hiding a lethal weapon. Then came Flicker, the demigod of the pixies, small enough to be caught in a human’s hand but agile enough to never be caught; the radiant Lumina, demigod of the fairies, an embodiment of light magic; the powerful, green-skinned Kargath, the demigod of the orcs; and finally, Diabolo, the demigod of demons, his black eye sockets and crimson pupils marking him unique to the humans and elves.\nThis was the army of demigods under Sunny’s command.\nHe glanced at his faith points, the number shimmering at a staggering 25 trillion, a testament to the faith spent by all the new Gods in his Pantheon. The net profit would have been far greater, but the consumption was also enormous, the main drain being his demigods and the lifeforms Thea was nurturing.\nHe rose from his throne, his cosmic robe swirling around him as he looked upon his creations. \"It’s time to give you the strength you desire,\" he commanded, his voice echoing with purpose and power. \"Speak your mind.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 119: Ch 119 : Daddy is Rich\n\"So?\" Sunny’s voice echoed in the silent, cosmic expanse of his God space, addressing the twenty-three demigods assembled before his throne. \"Any wishes? Any modifications to your talents?\" ’Your Daddy is loaded’, he thought, a flicker of human amusement hidden behind the inscrutable mask. He had a reputation to maintain, after all.\nAn absolute silence answered him. The demigods stood motionless, their heads bowed. It wasn’t fear that kept them quiet, but a profound, unwavering respect. To them, whatever their creator gave was a fortune, a gift to be cherished. They held no complaints, and their humility prevented them from being the first to ask for more.\nSeeing their hesitation, Sunny let out a soft chuckle, the sound echoing in the vast hall. \"You guys don’t like speaking? Should I take away your tongues then?\" The joke, delivered with a lighthearted tone, finally broke the tension. A few of the demigods shifted, their stiff postures relaxing slightly.\nIn the end, it was Loki who broke the silence. With skin as thick as a dragon’s hide and a shamelessness that could reach the stars, he swaggered forward. \"Master,\" he began with a dramatic flourish, \"since you’re offering... could I perhaps get a talent for assassination?\"\n\"Sure,\" Sunny replied instantly, relieved. He had been wondering how he was going to convince them to speak their minds. With Loki leading the charge, he knew the others would surely follow.\n\"You can learn it on your own, so why waste master’s resources?\" a calm, firm voice interjected. It was Nova, the eldest, her tone that of a responsible older sister.\nLoki turned to her with a theatrical pout. \"Sister Nova, it’s not like I didn’t try! I practiced for years and only got a talent for using knives. It’s not the same as the art of assassination, like that elf Rina had. I liked her style of fighting.\" He then grinned mischievously and pointed a thumb toward the stoic guardian of the Netherworld. \"I even asked her soul to teach me, but she outright refused. Brother Cerberus, you are not doing your job properly! Your prisoners are far too defiant.\"\n\"Master told me not to torture her soul,\" Cerberus rumbled, his voice like grinding stones, defending himself from Loki’s accusation. \"It wouldn’t matter anyway. She is loyal to Kairos.\"\n\"Alright, alright, stop it,\" Sunny said, raising a hand. He gestured in the air, and as he willed it, a sliver of his colossal power, a thread of pure faith, detached from his being. It shimmered for a moment before sinking into Loki’s form, etching the art of the assassin directly into his soul.\nLoki bowed deeply. \"Thank you, Master!\" He then immediately asked Thea to check the description of his new talent.\n[Talent Name: Assassination Master]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: You are a master in the art of assassination. You know all the techniques related to stealth and hidden weapons.]\n\"Hehe, now my apostles can cause even more havoc in the demonic realm,\" Loki said to himself. He then turned back to Sunny, his face a mask of shameless hope. \"Master, will you only be giving one talent per demigod today?\"\nSunny facepalmed internally. With a sigh, he replied, \"Wait in line, Loki. If you have anything else in mind, you can ask for it today.\"\nThe next to step forward was Umbra. She moved like a whisper, her request practical and direct. She asked for a modification to her buffing talent; the restriction of only two buffs at a time was a huge drawback. She wanted to increase the count to five, or perhaps more.\n\"Your thinking is good,\" Sunny said, considering her request. \"But let me modify it a bit more.\" With a snap of his fingers and a small pulse of faith from his grand reserves, Umbra’s talent was rewritten.\n[Talent Name: Buffer]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: You can buff anyone with any number of buffs. Each new buff will cost slightly more.]\nThe improvement was immense. The arbitrary limit was gone, replaced only by the cost of energy. Umbra bowed, her gratitude silent but deeply felt, and retreated back into the shadows.\nThen came the Demigods of Life, Uranus and Gaia. \"Master, can I ask for a talent for fighting? I am so bored of just sitting around, my soul aches for a good fight!\" Uranus said, rubbing his hands together in excitement.\n\"That’s why you created those Valkyries!\" Gaia scolded him, her expression like a disappointed wife. \"Master, don’t listen to him. Please bestow upon us the talent to create new life.\" In her eyes, as demigods of life, their path should be one of peace and creation, not conflict.\n\"Well, as I said, one for everyone at a time,\" Sunny declared, an indulgent tone in his voice. His faith reserves ran deep enough to spoil his \"children.\" \"Since you are two... I will give you both a new talent.\"\nWith a flicker of his hands, two distinct streams of faith flowed forth, etching new powers into their shared souls. For Uranus, Sunny blessed him with his own Combat Master talent.\nFor Gaia, he granted a new ability called Aura of Life, which created a field around her where no lifeform could die of disease or old age. With a thought, she could even create new life like animals, plants, even mythical beings, though it would cost a large amount of mana. Gaia was ecstatic, her mind already filled with creatures from the comics and novels she had been reading in her free time.\nOne by one, the others came forward. Shenlong asked for a direct attack talent, and Sunny gave him Dragon Words, a power where a single spoken word could unleash immense magical force.\nMammon asked for Talent-Synthesizer, an ability to combine the thousands of talents he had already collected into something new and grand.\nWhen it was finally Isiah’s turn, the wise demigod of knowledge stepped forward, and the hall fell silent. \"Master,\" he said, his voice calm and ancient. \"I do not wish for any talent for myself. I only wish that more people could be summoned to the Divine Library to gain the knowledge they need.\"\nA slow, proud smirk formed on Sunny’s face, hidden behind his cosmic mask. He had been waiting for this. \"I have been thinking about this as well,\" he replied. \"But the number of apostles under you is still small. I didn’t order it earlier because I feared the responsibility would be too great.\" He leaned forward on his throne. \"But if you are ready to take this on, then there are 5.5 billion worlds waiting for you to share your knowledge.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 120: Ch 120 : An Exquisite Teacups\nIsiah’s face lit up with a joy so pure it seemed to make the very God space around him brighter. The permission from his master was everything he had ever wanted. Uranus, Gaia, and Cerberus were already extending their influence to the billions of new worlds, but his own domain, the Divine Library, had remained isolated. Now, that was about to change.\n\"That was already in my mind, so your wish doesn’t count. You can make another one,\" Sunny said, an indulgent, fatherly tone in his voice. He wanted to spend the faith he had accumulated, and with reserves in the trillions, he could afford to be generous. I’ll have to create more demigods, I guess, he thought, his mind already picturing new creations; a fiery phoenix, a noble qilin, a graceful unicorn.\n\"Master,\" Isiah began, his voice filled with a new, fervent hope, \"I am a sea of knowledge, but I am a sea without shores. I can hold the knowledge of everything, but I cannot give it form. I wish for a talent to not just know, but to do—to learn anything I have knowledge of and be able to share that practical learning.\"\n\"That is feasible, I guess,\" Sunny said. He raised a hand, and a river of pure, shimmering faith—a hundred billion points worth—flowed from him. It was a sum that would have bankrupted the old Sunny a dozen times over, but for the current one, it was a calculated investment. The river of energy surged towards Isiah, ready to etch a new, god-like power into his very being.\nAnd then, it simply vanished.\nThe faith touched Isiah’s form and disappeared into thin air, leaving no trace, no new power, only a profound and unnerving emptiness.\n\"What?\" Sunny said aloud, jolting forward on his throne. He focused his God’s Eye on Isiah, scanning for the new talent, but found nothing. \"How is that possible?\" he exclaimed in his mind.\nHe didn’t waste a moment. \"Thea, call Adam.\"\nA video call connected instantly. On the screen, the old god appeared, still relaxing in the serene bliss of the Heaven realm. \"What? You spent a hundred billion faith points? And it just... vanished?\" Adam exclaimed after Sunny explained what had happened.\n\"Yes... Do you know the reason?\" Sunny asked, a sliver of curiosity in his voice. The demigods watched the exchange in stunned silence.\nAdam thought for a moment, then a slow, knowing smile spread across his face as he tried, and failed, to suppress a chuckle. \"Yes, the reason is quite simple, actually. Think of it this way, Cosmos: you can’t pour an ocean into a teacup. The talent you tried to create was an ocean of power. Isiah, for all his greatness, is still an SS-Grade vessel—a teacup. An exquisite, priceless teacup, mind you, but a teacup nonetheless.\"\nHe paused, letting his analogy sink in. \"The power had nowhere to go, so it simply... ceased to be. And no, that faith is non-refundable. It’s gone forever.\"\n\"It’s alright,\" Sunny said, his tone surprisingly calm. The loss of a hundred billion faith points was a sting, but an affordable one. Instead the knowledge he’d just gained was priceless. He had been formulating a much grander plan that would have cost trillions; this failed experiment had just saved him from a catastrophic mistake. \"Adam, I wanted to ask you about something else too.\"\n\"Ask away,\" Adam replied, his demeanor instantly shifting back to serious.\n\"I have found the location of the Pill of Life,\" Sunny stated, \"but there are two points to note...\"\nBefore he could continue, Adam held up a hand. \"If it is in a dangerous location, then leave it. I have nothing to gain from living, anyway. My only wish is to see you kill those demons and avenge me and all your other brothers and sisters.\"\n\"Stop with the melodrama,\" Sunny gestured dismissively. \"Listen carefully. First, the information about this location was leaked by the Demon Lords themselves. Second, the location is in the Realm of Advancement.\"\nAdam’s eyebrows rose. \"Hmm... so they want to cause discord among you all.\" He stroked his ethereal beard. \"Well, if you’re asking if the treasure is real, then yes, it should be. I’d say there’s a 99% chance it is. First, they don’t need these ’low-end’ SSS-Grade items; their own artifacts are far more powerful. Second, for their plan to sow discord to work, the bait must be real. If the gods find only lies, they will unite against their common enemy. The demons are evil, not stupid.\"\nThe clarity of his analysis, born from billions of years of experience, was undeniable.\n\"Okay, thanks for the information,\" Sunny said. \"I won’t guarantee anything, but if I get my hands on it, I will surely give it to you.\" After a few more words, he cut the call.\nHe turned back to his assembled demigods. \"So, as you have heard, there are some restrictions on the talents I can give you all. It isn’t because my pockets are empty,\" he said, a smirk in his voice, \"it’s because your grade is too low.\"\nHe leaned forward on his throne, his cosmic eyes seeming to pierce through each of them. \"So, when are you all going to become a God? I have been awaiting that moment for a long time.\"\nThe statement landed with the force of a physical blow. The demigods stared, their minds reeling. Only Thea and Isiah had been aware of such a possibility.\n\"Master,\" Nova was the first to speak, her voice filled with a hopeful tremor. \"Can we... can we really become Gods?\" For her, godhood wasn’t about status; it was about becoming more helpful to her creator.\n\"Yes,\" Sunny’s voice resonated with power. \"But for that, you must comprehend a Law and become its master. Be aware, a Law can only have a single God. While there are other Gods in the multiverse, their Laws are different from the fundamental ones of this reality. The old Gods are gone. Their thrones are empty.\"\nHe looked at them, his creations, his army. \"The path to godhood is open. You can dive into any Law you like and claim it by comprehending its very essence.\"\nThis knowledge was not just information; it was a key, unlocking a door to a future they had never dared to imagine. A spark ignited in the eyes of every demigod present— a spark of divine ambition, a spark of a desire for greater power, a spark of a need to become even more helpful to their master.",

      "content": "Chapter 121: Ch 121 : The desires of Demigod\n\"Master, which law should I learn?\" Nova asked, her voice, usually so full of calm authority, now held a note of genuine curiosity. As a being of Space, Time, Strength, and Defense, she had many paths to godhood, and she looked to her creator for guidance.\nSunny offered a calm, knowing smile from behind his mask. \"Just follow your heart, Nova. That is a path only you can choose.\" He turned his gaze to Isiah, who was still basking in the purpose of his new grand duty. \"Since I couldn’t grant your last wish, let me modify it a bit.\"\nWith a wave of his hand, a new talent formed in the deepest part of Isiah’s being.\n[Talent Name: Learning Teacher]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: The more knowledge you possess on a subject, the easier it becomes for you to learn its practical application. You can also teach this practical knowledge to others at a thousand times the normal learning speed.]\nIsiah bowed with a heartfelt gesture, the gap between his theoretical knowledge and practical ability now bridged. He was about to return to the line, but Sunny stopped him. \"Isiah, do you know what a seer is best at?\"\nThe ancient demigod pondered for a moment. \"Knowledge,\" he replied.\n\"You are right, but also wrong,\" Sunny said, a glint in his cosmic eyes. \"A Seer is best at knowledge, yes, but specifically, knowledge of the future.\" This had been his original vision for Isiah, a plan he’d put aside when his pockets were not so deep. Now, however, things were different.\nSunny waved his hand again, and another, even more profound talent etched itself into Isiah’s soul.\n[Talent Name: Oracle]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: Allows you to see glimpses of the future, focusing on opportunities, dangers, or the fate of someone you wish to observe.]\nIsiah beamed with a happiness that seemed to light up his entire ethereal form. He didn’t know why, but he had always been drawn to the art of fortune-telling, a subject he had studied endlessly in his library. Now, his master had bestowed upon him the very talent he had yearned for. He started to kneel, but a simple, gentle wave of power from Sunny lifted him back up.\n\"Stop kneeling every time I do something,\" Sunny joked. \"It’s not good for the back.\" He gestured to the line. \"Next.\"\nThe next to step forward was the hulking, menacing form of Cerberus. He asked for a talent that no one, not even Sunny, had considered. \"Master,\" the hound of hell rumbled, his voice a chorus of deep growls, \"can I get a talent to copy all the talents of a soul that arrives in my realm?\"\n\"I can try,\" Sunny mused, \"but that sounds like an SSS-Grade ability. It will likely need some restrictions, like a cooldown or a condition like I used for Mammon’s talent.\"\nAs Sunny began to focus his will, channeling the faith to etch the new talent, his intuition suddenly rang with a sharp warning. He paused, instantly changing the very nature of the talent he was creating.\nThis intuition is really something\n, he thought. Previously, I didn’t have the time to act on it. Now, it can probably save me mountains of faith in the future.\nHe completed the act, and Cerberus felt the new power settle within him.\n[Talent Name: Talent Harvester]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: As the Guardian of the Netherworld, all souls must pay a toll of something they own for you to house them.]\nThe description was simple, but its usefulness was immense. What could a disembodied soul possibly own? Its talents. In short, every wicked soul entering the Netherworld would now have to surrender one or more of their abilities to Cerberus as payment. A small, cruel smile etched itself onto Cerberus’s hound-like face. He glanced over at Mammon, who was still the strongest demigod, and licked his lips as if seeing his next meal.\nMammon felt a sudden chill run down his spine. \"Brother Cerberus, don’t eat me. I am not tasty,\" he laughed nervously. A silent competition had just begun.\n\"Alright, alright, stop your talks,\" Sunny said, bringing the focus back. \"Who is next?\"\nSugata, the demigod of peace, walked forward, his hands clasped, prayer beads wrapped around his wrists. \"Master, I wish for a talent to bless my beads with the talents that I possess. I tried to use the standard Blessing talent, but it does not work on inanimate objects.\" His goal was simple; he needed to be in Heaven, Hell, and Veridia, and this talent would allow his blessed beads to act as his proxies, warding off evil in his absence.\nWhy are they all trying to become even lazier than they usually are?\nSunny screamed internally, though his outward expression remained calm. \"Good thinking,\" he said, and with another flick of his wrist, etched the talent into Sugata’s being.\nThe next demigod was Thea. \"I was going to wish for you to modify my Thought Sharing and remove the faith cost,\" she began, \"but I surmise my vessel would not be able to handle such an SSS-Grade power.\"\n\"True,\" Sunny agreed. \"So, what else do you have in mind?\"\n\"Master, my Replication talent requires a God to first give me faith to create particles. Can you change it so that I can use ambient mana to replicate myself?\" Thea asked, her mind already running simulations on the advantages of such a change.\n\"Granted,\" Sunny said. With a single word, Thea’s talent was modified, a change she had wished for since her creation.\n\"Nova, do you need something too?\" Sunny asked, turning to the last of his major demigods.\nThe great dragon, in her humanoid form, shook her head, her gaze filled with unwavering loyalty. \"Master, I already have Absolute Defense and Absolute Strength, along with the laws of Time and Space. I am already very strong. I don’t think I need anything else.\"\n\"Still, you should take something,\" Sunny insisted, unable to leave his eldest out. \"What do you think of the Dragon Words talent?\"",

Yet, she gently shook her head, her expression a mixture of guilt and firm resolve.\n\"Master, your gifts are a blessing, but Brother Shenlong’s power is his own. I wish to forge my own path, one that is unique to me and my children,\" she said, her voice respectful but unwavering. She felt the pang of guilt by disagreeing with her creator, but her heart was set.\n\"Fair enough,\" Sunny replied, a hint of curiosity in his voice. \"So, what did you have in mind?\"\nNova’s eyes lit up with a passionate fire. \"Master, I wish for a talent that connects my strength to the destiny of my race. A power that stacks within me every time a Dragonborn or a true dragon learns a new skill or advances to a higher realm. Then, when the need is greatest, I can unleash all of that stored power at once.\"\nSunny listened, a slow, proud smile spreading across his face, hidden behind his mask. She wasn’t just asking for a weapon; she was asking for a responsibility, a way to tie her own power to the prosperity of her people. To collect so much power that even the gods would shudder in fear, he thought, and nodded. With a flick of his finger, he granted her wish.\n[Talent Name: Charged Explosion]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: Every advancement in your race will accumulate a power inside you. You can release this power at any time to boost any of your talents or your physical strength for a short duration]\nNova bowed deeply and returned to her position, while Sunny made a mental note to copy that incredible talent as soon as he could. Only seven and a half more hours to wait, he thought.\n\"It’s your turn, Demigods of the Races,\" Sunny announced, his gaze sweeping over the diverse line of progenitors. \"What do you all want? Ask away, one by one.\"\nAethel, the demigod of humans, stepped forward, his presence solid and dependable. He bowed. \"Master, we speak with one voice. We wish for the cooldown time to be decreased for our innate talent.\"\n\"Do all of you have the same request?\" Sunny asked. A chorus of determined nods answered him. He smirked. Their unity was impressive. With a grand wave of his hand, he altered their very nature. \"The cooldown for copying a new talent is now two hundred years.\"\nA collective gasp of pure joy erupted from the race demigods. They had hoped for a reduction of maybe fifty or a hundred years, but their master had directly cut it down by three hundred. They bowed as one, their gratitude immense.\n\"If anyone wants anything else, speak now,\" Sunny said. \"You may not get this chance again anytime soon.\"\nAs expected, a familiar, shameless figure stepped forward. \"Master...\" Loki began, a roguish grin already on his face. \"Please modify my Master of Stealing talent. I wish to steal any talent not temporarily, but... permanently.\"\n\"Let’s see if that’s an SS or SSS-Grade wish,\" Sunny mused. He began to focus his will, but as he was etching the talent, his intuition screamed a sharp warning. He saw his faith entering a black hole and never returning back or being used in this future vision. He immediately changed the concept, adding a crucial restriction.\n[Talent Name: Master of Stealing]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: You can steal anything a person possesses, be it an item, skill, or talent. However, you must kill the target within 10 minutes, otherwise, the stolen property will be returned. Note: You can only steal one thing from each of category from a person at a time.]\n\"Hehe, this talent matches my Master of Assassination perfectly!\" Loki laughed. \"Ten minutes is far too long. I will kill them in one!\"\nSunny ignored him and his boastings and said \"Anyone else?\"\nThea’s shimmering form drifted forward. \"Master, can you modify my Manifestation and Thought Sharing talents to consume any form of energy, not just Faith? This would reduce the consumption of faith and in turn make my convertor talent shine even more.\" Her reasoning was, as always, flawless. Making her network self-sustaining would be a massive boon.\n\"Granted.\" With a word and a wave, Sunny modified Thea’s core talents. Now, she could draw on the ambient mana of Veridia or any other energy source, a change that would allow her to expand her network to the farthest corners of the multiverse.\nSunny asked for the next demigod, but a respectful silence filled the hall. Seeing that no one else was approaching, Aethel, the human demigod, stepped forward once more.\n\"Master,\" he began, his voice ringing with a newfound, visionary confidence. \"As demigods of the races, we believe our purpose shouldn’t be limited to the lifeforms on Veridia alone. There are humans, elves, dwarves, and countless others races across the 5.5 billion worlds of your new universe. Let us extend our guidance to them. Let us help all our kin soar like dragons.\"\nSunny paused, considering the grand suggestion. His demigods of races were still weak compared to the Demigods of law, but with a 200-year cooldown, they could grow strong very quickly by finding high-grade talents among the trillions of lifeforms now under his rule. He agreed, his mind already racing ahead.\nThea’s analysis flashed in his mind: to cover every known sentient race in his new universe, he would need 136 new demigods. Without batting an eye, Sunny gave the command of manifesting 136 new divine embrys. He felt no drain on his own faith. Instead, he felt Thea draw upon the immense, ambient mana of Veridia, its hundreds of mana veins pulsing as she siphoned off the required energy. One by one, 136 new divine embryos materialized in the God space, a silent, powerful testament to the empire’s new, self-sustaining power.\n\"​Well, well, things have started to get interesting,\" Sunny said, as he saw his power take another boost with the increase in strength of his demiggds.",

      "content": "Chapter 123: Ch 123 : New Entries ²\nWith a single, focused thought, Sunny’s will surged through the 136 divine embryos. They twitched in unison, their formless energy coalescing into the shapes of their destined races.\nInto each, he etched the talent to copy the powers of their kin every two hundred years, a gift for accelerated growth and the talents to give blessings. With another thought, he sent them through portals to the billion new worlds under his protection, each to a planet that housed their respective people. The demigods already on Veridia also returned to their duties, now tasked with guiding not just one world, but an entire universe of lifeforms.\nSunny leaned back on his throne and glanced at his faith reserves. He let out a low whistle. \"If being rich is a crime,\" he chuckled to himself, \"then I’d already be in jail for life.\"\n[Faith Points: 26,021,562,123,423]\nThe twenty-five trillion he had before creating the new demigods hadn’t dropped at all. In fact, it had increased by a trillion. The sheer spending power of 5.5 billion subordinate Gods using his Cosmic Shop was a revenue stream so vast it was almost absurd.\n\"It’s really lonely at the top,\" he was about to boast more about his richness in his empty God space, but the thought was suddenly cut short by a flash of memory: the slimy, corrosive aura of Ichor, the Demon Lord. \"Why does that bastard have to pop into my head and ruin my mood?\" Sunny screamed internally. He knew it was his intuition, a sharp, unwelcome reminder that he couldn’t afford to rest. Power was a shield, and his wasn’t nearly thick enough yet.\n\"But what can I even do?\" A long-lost idea, born in the early days of his godhood, resurfaced. \"Demigods for every element...\" Back then, he didn’t have the capital. Now, he had the capital and a terrifyingly good reason.\nHe didn’t hesitate. He reached into the very concepts of the cosmos. He created multiple divine embryos and etched them with the elements present in Veridia and the other 5.5 billion world.\nHe gathered the essence of Fire, and from it, pulled a being of pure, sentient flame. He whispered to the oceans of a billion worlds, and a consciousness of the deep awakened, a demigod of Water. He did the same for Earth and Air, giving form to the unformed. Then he continued, creating demigods for Light, Lightning, Ice, Darkness, Metal, Nature, Sound, Poison, Chaos, Gravity, and Blood.\nThey were not beings of flesh, but ethereal entities like Umbra, formless and omnipresent. Wherever there was fire in his territory, the demigod of fire would be there. Wherever there was water, the demigod of water would be there. He gave each of them two innate talents: absolute control over their element, and the ability to grant blessings.\nHe checked his faith. \"Only 2 trillions used? I still have 24 trillion,\" he sighed. He needed to think bigger.\nHis eyes fell upon the worlds below. He looked at the majestic mountains of Veridia, the sprawling forests, the winding rivers. His mind, now a storm of creative energy, began to wander. He raised his hand again. He created a demigod for the Forests; a guardian made up of the ancient woods. He created one for the Deserts, a spirit of the sun-scorched sands. He forged demigods for the Rivers, the Lakes, the Oceans, the Swamps, and the Glaciers, giving each a consciousness and a purpose.\nThen, an epiphany struck him. A world needed more than just fire and mountains. A civilization needed concepts. He waved his hand again, and more demigods sprang into existence: a demigod of the Harvest, of Rain, of Travel, of Blizzards. His mind and hands worked like a divine machine, pumping out demigods as if they were candies being made in a factory.\nIn a matter of minutes, he had added 37 elemental demigods, 22 domain demigods, and 46 auxiliary demigods into his demigod list. He checked his faith again. Only another 2 trillion lost. He still had over 20 trillion left.\n\"Now what should I do?\" he wondered, a strange sense of emptiness settling in. His thoughts drifted to the past, to the great war Adam had spoken of, and his new Time Affinity talent. \"Can I see the past?\"\nHe focused his mind, pulling on the threads of his new power. Instantly, his soul felt like it was being pulled through a vortex, ripped from his physical form.\nHe opened his spiritual eyes and found himself floating in a river. But it wasn’t a river of water; it was a river of moments. He saw everything: the creation of the multiverse, the rise and fall of ancient stars, the birth of his own lifeforms, and even fleeting, confusing glimpses of futures yet to come.\nBut it was a chaotic torrent of images, a story without order. He tried to focus on the war between the old Gods and the Demon Lords, but the scenes were fragmented, meaningless.\nSuddenly, an idea sparked in his consciousness. What if I use... the God’s Eye on the river of time itself?\nEntering this river had already costed him 700 billion faith points. He didn’t know what the cost of this new experiment would be, but he didn’t care. He focused his God’s Eye onto the chaotic torrent of the river of Time.\nInstantly, the chaos resolved. The river became a coherent stream, flowing backward at his command. He saw his own recent creations, then the moment he first opened his eyes in front of Veridia. He checked the faith consumption: for every year he traveled back, it cost a mere 100 faith points. The great war was 1.2 million years ago.\n\"I just need to spend a few hundred million faith to see the entire war?\" he thought, a triumphant grin spreading across his face. \"Isn’t that a steal?\"\nSunny wasn’t able to hide his curiosity to know of the reason behind the fall of the old gods and the schemes of demons, as it will help him in the future by a lot.",

      "content": "Chapter 124: Ch 124 : Responsibilities\nBefore Sunny prepared to plunge his soul into the chaotic currents of the River of Time, he first had to set his new creations to their grand tasks, as they were still present in his God space.\nThe 136 demigods of the races had already departed, their purpose clear and their connection to their kin established. But before him now stood a new, silent army: the formless, ethereal demigods of elements, the guardians and demigods of domains, and the subtle, auxiliary demigods for stability and order.\nTheir roles and workings were not yet defined, a blank canvas upon which Sunny, the divine architect, would now paint his masterpiece.\nHe first addressed the elementals, the thirty-seven beings of pure, untamed energy. \"You are the embodiment of the world’s core forces,\" his voice echoed in their minds. \"But you are not slaves to your nature. You are its shepherds. Fire will not harm the innocent in my worlds. Water will not drown the undeserving. Darkness will not be a cloak for terror, but a blanket for peaceful rest. In every element, my people will find you, and in you, they will find a guardian.\"\nHe gave them their second directive. \"You will also be a source of power. Through your blessings, you will grant affinities to my lifeforms. You can nurture a new generation of heroes, beings who command the very fabric of this world. Do not be shy with your gifts.\"\nThen came their ultimate purpose, a task of truly cosmic scale. \"Your most important duty is to grow our home. Veridia is but a cradle; it must become a cosmos of its own.\"\nHis will flowed out, assigning each a role in this grand terraforming project. \"Demigod of Earth, you will raise new continents from the sea. Demigod of Water, you will fill the new oceans and maintain the balance between land and sea. You demigods of Nature and Wood will work together to seed these new lands with forests.\" He turned his attention to two others. \"Demigod of Gravity, you are the anchor. You will maintain the stability of our expanding world, ensuring it does not collapse under its own weight. And Demigod of Fire, as Veridia grows, so too must its sun. You will be its keeper.\"\nFinally, he addressed the most powerful among them, a being he had created to be their king. \"And you, the Demigod of Spirits, will be their conductor. Your talent of Elemental Switch makes you master of all. You will keep the others in check, and through your power to combine their essences, you will create new wonders for our world.\" His vision was clear: a future where each elemental demigod could become a true God of their domain, with the Spirit King as their rightful sovereign.\nWith their grand purpose set, he turned to the demigods of domains. \"The elementals will give you a spark,\" he commanded. \"You will turn it into a fire. They will give you a single tree; you, Demigod of the Forest, will grow it into a sprawling woodland. They will give you a handful of sand; you, Demigod of the Desert, will shape it into a vast, majestic dune sea. They will give you a drop of water; you, demigods of Rivers and Lakes, will carve the arteries of this new world.\"\nLastly, he addressed the auxiliary demigods, the sustainers. \"A domain cannot thrive without balance. You are that balance. Demigod of Rain, you will ensure the forests remain vibrant. Demigod of the Harvest, you will ensure the fields are forever fertile.\"\nThese beings were not created merely to spend the excess faith that Sunny possessed. They were the gears in a divine machine, a complex ecosystem of power designed to maintain order and balance across his entire territory—everywhere except Earth, which would forever remain a godless world.\n\"Now, all is set,\" Sunny said with satisfaction as he watched his new creations disperse, each moving to begin their monumental tasks.\nHe watched as the first new landmass began to rise from Veridia’s oceans, a testament to their immediate obedience. As the world expanded, however, a new problem arose in his mind. It would need more mana veins, a task that would constantly drain Thea’s energy. His thoughts drifted to Zir’s world, and the memory of its demigod, a single, magnificent World Tree that served as the planet’s heart. His eyes sparkled with a newfound idea.\nHe reached out, manifesting a new divine embryo. He did not shape it into a grand or terrifying form. Instead, it coalesced into a simple, humble sapling, barely a foot tall, with just two perfect leaves sprouting from its top and a single, pure white root at its base. Even in this simple form, the divine energy it contained was immense.\nIt was time to choose the talents for this cute, unassuming demigod, a being destined to become the very soul of his new Veridia.\n\"Magic affinity is a must\" Sunny whispered as he etched magic affinity in the very being of the world tree.\nThe second talent he added was ’One with World’, this talent would create a symbiotic link between the World Tree and every living thing on the planet. It would feel the \"health\" of the world and emit a constant, subtle aura of vitality. This aura would passively boost the health, resilience, and fertility of all plants, animals, and lifeforms, making the entire world more vibrant and robust.\nThe third talent he added was Fruit of evolution, To make the world tree a truly sacred and central part of the world’s culture, this talent would allow it to bear special fruits once every 25 years.\nAny lifeform who is deemed worthy and consumes this fruit could have one of their talents instantly evolve to a higher grade or gain a completely new and unique ability.\nThis would make a pilgrimage to the World Tree a lifelong goal for Veridia’s greatest heroes, the goal to get a new skill or even upgrade the previous one.",

      "content": "Chapter 125: Ch 125 : Chaos in Pantheon\nSunny looked at the tiny, perfect sapling floating before him, the culmination of his grand plan for Veridia’s future. But he wasn’t finished. His mentality had always been simple, a holdover from his mortal days on Endor: if you’re rich, you should definitely spoil your closed ones. He didn’t had any closed once in Endor, but he always gifted his savings on the author he truly liked\nAnd in this new cosmic existence, his demigods were his closed once. He had gifted them power, but now he would gift this newest, most vital child the very best of foundations.\nThe forth talent he gave the world tree was whispering leaves, this talents allows the world tree to absorbs the memories of those in Sunny’s territory, allowing the worthy individual to recieve visions of the techniques or spells from all over the world.\nThe fifth talent was heartwood blessing, this talent allows the branch of this tree to holds the power of different elements, and their could be a chance that a branch is born with the power of multiple elements.\nThese branches could be given to the lifeforms to create weapons, wands or artifact, which will be at the grade of SS, and imbued with the elemental power according to the given branch.\nThe next talent he gave was the ’Aegis of the Grove’, as a protector of the world, this demigod needed a defensive talent, this talent would allow the World Tree to project a shield of life energy sorrounding the whole territory. This shield wouldn’t only stop the physical attacks but also actively weaken and purge demonic energy, corruption, and widespread curses, acting as the entire planet’s immune system.\nThe last talent Sunny gave the World tree was the core talent of it, ’The Genisis Root’ , this would be its primary talent. The tree’s roots would grow deep into the planet’s core, acting as living, self-replicating mana veins. They would naturally draw in cosmic energy and convert it into pure mana, spreading it throughout the entire world. As the tree grows, so does its mana network, ensuring Veridia’s magical energy is boundless and self-sustaining.\nWith the final talent in place, it was time for a name. He chose Veylara, a name that suggested gentle growth and branches reaching for the stars. With a final thought, the tiny sapling sprang to life. Its two leaves twitched, a silent, innocent greeting.\n\"I only wanted to make you grow from a sapling,\" Sunny said with a soft chuckle. \"I didn’t know your consciousness would also be that of a child.\" He didn’t know how this infant demigod would control such immense power, but he trusted the process. With a gentle push of his will, he planted Veylara in the very heart of Veridia’s central continent. He watched for a moment as the fledgling sapling took its first breath, absorbing the energy of the universe and releasing it as the world’s first pulse of natural mana. Satisfied, he turned his attention to his wider empire.\nHe sent out a single notification to all 5.5 billion of his subordinate Gods, informing them of the legions of races, elemental, domain, and auxiliary demigods that would now be at their service.\nThe chat group for the Pantheon of Gods, which had been in a state of quiet, industrious discussion, immediately erupted into absolute chaos.\nIn his opulent God space, Zir nearly dropped his glass of celestial nectar, his eyes wide with disbelief as he re-read the notification. His fingers trembled slightly as he typed.\nZir: \"Bigboss, what was that number again? I think my system is bugged.\"\nFrom his own quiet, minimalist space, Reflection saw Zir’s message and let a rare, wry smile touch his lips. He typed his reply with calm amusement.\nReflection: \"It is clearly written. Do you need glasses even after becoming a God, Zir?\"\nA goddess named Nyx, lounging on a throne of enchanted flowers, saw an opportunity and typed with a playful, hopeful pout.\nNyx: \"Boss, can you gift me one of those new demigods? Pretty please?\"\nAnother God, Raven, chimed in, his message typed with a shameless, hopeful grin.\nRaven: \"These demigods are for all of us, Nyx. But Boss, if you happen to be gifting one to a single God, please choose me.\"\nJoker, who had been waiting for just such an opportunity, began laughing as he rubbed his hands with the thought of earning another chunk of faith with his talent of Roaster.\nJoker: \"I’ve seen a lot of shameless Gods in my time, but your shamelessness, Raven, is at the absolute peak.\"\nA God named Builder found himself nodding in agreement with joker for the first time.\nBuilder: \"I agree with Joker for the first time in my life.\"\nThanos: \"Me too.\"\nRaven: \"I want you all to sign a petition to remove Joker from the Pantheon!\"\nJoker: \"Cry about it.\"\nThe lighthearted bickering was suddenly cut short by a new message by Strategist, he typed with an air of weary frustration, trying to get his unruly peers to focus.\nStrategist: \"Stop with the jokes, everyone. Be serious. Have you all made at least one demigod for your own worlds yet?\"\nZir leaned back on his throne and boasted with renewed confidence.\nZir: \"Hehe, behold my greatness. I have four demigods in my world.\"\nJoker: \"Just four? I have nine demigods under me. Just waiting to collect a few more million before I create another one.\"\nZir: \"@Raven, you have my support. I sign the petition.\"\nThe Gods laughed, the tension broken. But another message from Strategist jolted them back to reality.\nStrategist: \"For those of you who are making progress, good. You can afford to have fun. But for the Gods who still have no demigods, please wake up. There is a long fight ahead of us. The opportunity given by God Cosmos shouldn’t go to waste. Do not become a burden to those of us who are taking this seriously.\"\nA wave of collective, sheepish agreement washed over the chat as billions of lesser Gods began to chime in.\nRaven : \"I have two DemiGods under me currently, and will have one more tomorrow\"\nGod A: \"+1, I have two demigods, but I’m not sure about a third one tomorrow.\"\n...\nGod ZZZ: \"+1.3 billion\"\nGod I: \"I only have one demigod. Sorry I couldn’t add more to your count.\"\n...\nGod X: \"+3.2 billion\"\nZir, seeing that the Gods were indeed making progress, tried to smooth things over.\nZir: \"If we sum it all up, I guess most of us have at least one demigod. So chill, Strategist. A little fun isn’t a bad thing.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 126: Ch 126 : A 1.2 million years old Movie\nA rare and precious quietness had settled over Sunny’s God space. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, there were no urgent crises, no impending demonic invasions, and no clamoring requests from his billions of subordinates.\nHis clones were diligently working, his demigods were handling their duties, and his faith reserves were climbing steadily. He leaned back on his throne, a sigh of relief escaping him. This, he thought, was the life he had envisioned—a peaceful, carefree life.\nBut just as the comfortable blanket of idleness began to settle over him, a nagging thought, a memory from his recent whirlwind of activity, pricked at his consciousness. The war. The ancient, cataclysmic war between the old Gods and the Demon Lords that Adam had described.\nThe thought of it wasn’t painful or draining; instead, it felt like an unopened history book, a story of epic proportions just waiting to be read.\n’Should I watch a movie that’s 1.2 million years old?’ he mused, a flicker of his old human self, the shut-in novel reader, sparking to life. The idea was too tempting to resist.\nWith a focused will, Sunny called upon his Time Affinity, and the very fabric of his God space seemed to shimmer and dissolve. His soul was gently but irresistibly pulled from his physical form, plunging into a liquid cosmos, the River of Time.\nThis time, there was no disorientation. He moved through the silent torrent of moments with a newfound confidence, the chaotic stream of past, present, and future now feeling like a familiar current.\nHe navigated with purpose, his soul swimming against the flow, seeking a single, specific point in the endless river: the moment 1.2 million years ago when the first seeds of the great war were sown.\nOnce he found this specific point in the river of time, he activated his God’s Eye. The fragmented, chaotic images of the past, shards of shattered timelines and half-formed memories, instantly combined. The river transformed into a coherent, flowing narrative, a movie projected in front of his eyes.\nHe released his direct control, allowing the river to move at its natural pace, but what he saw was only darkness, because a million years ago, there was no Veridia in existence. Thus, he began his journey toward the heart of the old multiverse, to the world that had served as the throne of the God of Growth, Adam.\nAs he drifted through the ancient past, the sights that unfolded before him were beyond anything he could have imagined. He witnessed civilizations that had risen and fallen a million years before his own birth. He saw technologies that were many times more advanced then the most advanced blueprints in his Divine Library.\nEntire solar systems encased in shimmering Dyson spheres, harnessing the total energy of their stars; fleets of warships that could manipulate the gravity of entire galaxies; and other marvels that made the technological tiers of Endor seem like a child’s scribbles. He saw worlds teeming with races he had never encountered, and magic so ancient and powerful it felt like the raw, untamed will of the universe itself.\nHis journey was a silent, solitary one, a ghost drifting through a frozen history. Then, one sight made him stop. It was an aircraft, paused in mid-flight, hanging in the silent void between universes.\nIts design was breathtaking, a sleek shape that seemed to be carved from the most advanced metal, its wings flowing like the wings of a dragon.\nFor a moment, it was a dream come true, the ultimate sci-fi fantasy made real before his eyes. He drew closer, his spiritual form phasing through the hull to examine every detail. His gaze fell upon a digital screen in the cockpit, and the numbers displayed there sent a jolt of pure adrenaline through his soul, a feeling so intense it was almost physical.\n[Speed: 265 Light Years / Second]\nTwo hundred and sixty-five light years. Per second. The number was so absurd, so far beyond his own world’s capabilities, that it made his own creations feel like primitive toys.\nA sudden, powerful urge washed over him, to un-pause time for just a moment, to feel the raw, exhilarating rush of such impossible speed. But his curiosity to witness the war, to see the old Gods in their prime, was stronger. He would see these marvels in action soon enough.\nHe pushed the thought aside and, drawing on the ambient mana of the past, boosted his own speed, continuing his journey to the center of the multiverse.\nDays passed in the River of Time. The solitude was immense, a profound emptiness that made him feel like the sole observer in a dead cosmos.\nHe even tried to contact Thea, but there was no reply. As he had discovered before, time outside this river was completely frozen for him; when he returned, not a single second would have passed in his own God space.\n\"What a magical feeling,\" he murmured, the concept of time still a beautiful, terrifying mystery.\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity of wandering through the darkness, he saw it. A world. But it was a world on a scale that shattered his understanding. It was so massive that the stars he passed seemed like tiny specks of dust in comparison, like ants crawling before a mountain.\nHe entered its atmosphere and was immediately met with a low, constant hum of power—the collective aura of hundreds of thousands of Gods. Their power was still weaker than his own or Adam’s, a clear sign they were not born of the Void, but had achieved godhood through mastering a Law under Adam’s reign.\nHe flew towards the grandest structure on the planet, a palace so vast that the whole Endor could fit within its walls. He looked at its magnificent architecture and then thought of his own God space, with its single, throne and some walking soace.\n\"And here I am, only having a God space... Should I create a world specially for Gods?\" he mused. The thought brought a fresh wave of complications. The Gods in his pantheon were now his lifeforms; they provided him faith, which meant interacting with them would be costly. His head began to ache. This journey into the past was proving to be far more mentally taxing than he had anticipated. The constant travel, the labor of it all, was very taxing to his very nature as the God of Sloth.\nAfter searching for a full minute, he finally found him. In the heart of the palace, lounging on a throne of pure light, was Adam. He was surrounded by beautiful heavenly maids who fed him grapes and massaged his feet.\nSunny watched, a flicker of envy in his soul.\nThis\n, he thought,\nthis is the life I envisioned. A life where all the work was handled by the powerful beings under his command.\nSuddenly, a large, ornate mirror on a nearby wall began to vibrate. One of the maids gracefully picked it up and presented it to Adam.\n\"Who is disturbing my peace?\" Adam’s voice was a majestic blend of divinity and pure arrogance, a sound that spoke of his absolute power. But as he gazed into the mirror, his expression melted. The arrogance vanished, replaced by a warm, genuine smile.\nHe hurriedly dismissed the maids, then drew a complex magical circle on the mirror’s surface. The glass shimmered, and the image of a young and breathtakingly beautiful female elf appeared.\nSunny’s eyes widened. He had seen beauty of heroines, the beauty from the lifeforms on his planet. He had seen Thea, a being crafted to his own perfect specifications. But this elf... she was on another level entirely, a living embodiment of celestial grace.",

      "content": "Chapter 127: Ch 127 : Peace Treaty\n\"Greetings, Lady Freya,\" Adam said, his voice, once booming with the authority of the strongest God, was now soft and filled with a love that seemed to melt his divine form. He leaned closer to the ornate mirror, his gaze fixed on the beautiful elf projected within.\n\"Greetings, Gentleman Adam,\" she joked back, her laugh like the chiming of celestial bells. It was their private way, a gentle banter between two beings who held the weight of universes on their shoulders.\n\"When are you coming to my multiverse? I am so lonely here,\" Adam pleaded, his expression entirely unlike the arrogant and dignified God he had been moments before. He was a king reduced to a lovesick boy.\n\"I am transferring my entire universe into a movable realm. Soon, I will be able to live in your multiverse forever,\" Freya replied, her tone calm and reassuring. But then, her gaze drifted past his shoulder to the table behind him. Her warm expression tightened, and a dangerous smile appeared on her lips. \"Adam,\" she said, her voice now laced with a clear, cold annoyance, \"I see that your face is itching for a massage from my fist.\"\nAdam’s divine form visibly flinched. He hurriedly snatched the basket of grapes from the table and began stuffing them into his mouth. \"What are you even saying?\" he mumbled through a mouthful of fruit, his voice suddenly sounding like that of a chicken about to be slaughtered. \"I was just eating. I don’t know what you’re talking about.\"\n\"Hmph. I will not spoil you from now on,\" she said, though the warmth was already returning to her eyes. \"I will come to the main point. The Demon Lords are reborn again.\" Her mood instantly shifted from loving to that of a cold, serious ruler.\n\"Don’t let them spoil your mood,\" Adam replied quickly, trying to change the subject away from his misdeeds. \"We will kill them in no time.\"\nFreya sighed and said \"On second thought, those demons... they are surrendering this time. They are ready to sign a contract.\"\n\"They are surrendering?\" Adam roared, the sound shaking the very foundations of his grand palace. \"After killing so many of our lifeforms and even few of the Gods of laws? They are the embodiment of evil!\" The memory of the war, the loss was a wound that had never truly healed.\n\"But they are ready to sign a contract stating they will never enter our side of the cosmos ever again,\" Freya reasoned. \"It’s not like we haven’t killed them millions of times. They harmed our people, yes, but that was the first time. In their millions of lives since, they have not raised a hand against us.\"\n\"Why are you speaking so naively today, Freya?\" Adam said, his anger giving way to a deep worry. \"The only reason they haven’t harmed us since is because we have always been strong enough to kill them before their evil could take root!\"\n\"Still, many of the Gods, and even I, believe that this endless bloodshed is meaningless,\" Freya replied. A small, wry smile formed on her lips. \"If we do not give them this chance for peace, then what is the real difference between us and the Void Beasts?\"\nThe name, Void Beasts jolted Adam’s consciousness. The memory of that ancient terror, of those fiends who had corrupted their very birthplace, was a horror that made him forget even his hatred for the demons for a second. He fell silent, his rage extinguished by a deeper, colder fear.\n\"I... I think you are right,\" Adam finally said, his voice heavy as he tried to erasethe hatred he had carried for a million years. \"When and where do we need to go to sign the contract?\"\n\"In the demonic realm. Belial will come to pick you up,\" Freya said. \"Please, Adam... don’t kill him.\" She knew that Adam’s signature would be the signature of all the Gods; as the eldest and strongest, his decision was final.\n\"Okay,\" Adam agreed. \"Integrate your universe soon. If you need any help, just poke me, and I will be there,\" he said, his eyes once again filled with the pure, unwavering light of a man in love.\n\"What an interesting story,\" Sunny mused, eating a piece of manifested popcorn from a bowl resting on the arm of his throne. \"Starting directly with the the long distance lovers.\" He, a silent ghost in the River of Time, had just witnessed a pivotal, long-forgotten moment in history. \"I should see the demons’ side of things, too.\"\nWith a simple command, his Divine Command talent tore open the fabric of space, creating a rift that led directly into the demonic realm of 1.2 million years ago. He stepped through and found... nothing. No lifeforms, no demons, only a vast, primordial emptiness under a blood-red sky.\n\"Where should I go?\" He manifested a special navigator orb, one designed to track the living across an entire multiverse. But the demonic realm was larger than a single multiverse; it was a sprawling, chaotic expanse. He sighed in annoyance. \"Anything for the future,\" he thought, knowing that to understand his enemy, he had to see their origins firsthand.\nHe picked a random direction and began to travel. The time outside the river was paused, so he flew for what felt like months, a lonely god wandering through an ancient, alien dimension. Finally, after an eternity of searching, his eyes, now red with fatigue, saw them: six brilliant red dots, pulsing on the navigator orb.\nHe shot towards them, his spirit soaring with relief and anticipation. Soon, a structure came into view. It was a fortress, a monolithic structure that seemed to drink the very light from the sky. It was carved from a single, mountain-sized obsidian stone, with impossible, jagged towers that clawed at the heavens. It radiated an aura of ancient, slumbering evil, a place of profound dread and immense power. Sunny hovered before it, a ghost about to witness the other side of a peace treaty that would shape the fate of the cosmos.",

      "content": "Chapter 128: Ch 128 : Beginning of the End\nHovering as an unseen ghost in the oppressive meeting room, Sunny found the six Demon Lords seated around a massive table of polished bone, deep in a heated debate. The very air was thick with the scent of ancient malice, and the bone table seemed to whisper with the memories of the colossal beings it was crafted from.\n\"I am still against this treaty. I don’t know why you all agreed to it,\" Ichor, the Lord of Corrosion, snarled, his voice a wet, scraping sound. He tapped a slimy claw on the table, leaving a sizzling, acidic mark that ate into the ancient bone. He yearned to spread his decay to the worlds of the living, but he knew that to do so now would be a death sentence, and he was not ready to die again just yet.\n\"Ichor, do you have another option? Because I certainly don’t,\" Maledictus said, her voice a weary sigh that felt ancient and tired. \"It’s either this treaty or another hundred thousand or even million years of slumber to reborn. I, for one, am tired of the cycle. It has become... boring.\"\n\"But it goes against our very nature to simply bow our heads,\" Phobos, the Lord of Fear, added, his whisper making the shadows in the corners of the room deepen. The faces swirling within his form contorted with unease. \"What are you all thinking?\"\n\"You should understand that this is just a tactical retreat,\" Deimos interjected, his voice calm and calculating. He had been silent until now, running every possible outcome through his brilliant, scheming mind. \"Their strength is in their unity and their faith. A direct assault is pointless. But a peace treaty... that gives us time. Time to let them grow complacent. Time to let our influence seep into their worlds like a slow poison. We will wait. We will grow. And when the time is right, we will kill those Gods in a single, glorious swoop.\"\n\"Still, I can’t just behave like a dog in front of them,\" Ichor seethed, pushing his chair back as if to leave.\n\"Sit down, Ichor,\" a deep, gut-rumbling voice commanded. It was the Demon of Gluttony, Beelzebub, the strongest and most feared among them during that era. He hadn’t moved, but his gaze was a physical weight, a promise of absolute annihilation that made even the Lord of Corrosion shrink back.\n\"Tch,\" Ichor clicked his tongue and sank back into his seat. Beelzebub’s authority was absolute.\n\"The decision has been made,\" Beelzebub said, his voice a low growl of finality. \"If you wish to die, be my guest. But I assure you, when you are reborn in a miliion years, you will find us ruling both this realm and theirs.\"\nIchor gulped, a visible ripple of fear passing through him. He knew death at the hands of the Gods was quick compared to the fate Beelzebub would inflict upon him. The Glutton would chew him alive. \"If you say so,\" Ichor conceded, \"I will believe you. For once.\"\n\"Then listen carefully,\" Deimos said, retaking control of the meeting. \"Belial is already on his way to retrieve Adam. He will be back in a few days. At that time, I will tell you the next phase of our plan.\" A fleeting, sinister smile crossed his face. This treaty was his idea, a grand deception that would take a hundred thousand years to come to fruition.\nA hundred thousand to million years to reborn\n, Sunny thought from his vantage point of one of the towers of the fortress.\nSo that’s how long it takes.\nHe also noted that Beelzebub seemed to be the true power here, not Deimos.\nWith a flicker of his will, he accelerated the flow of time, the days blurring into a single moment until he felt the familiar, powerful aura of Adam approaching from the distance.\nHe floated towards the aura and saw them: Belial, the charming Lord of Lies, escorting Adam, the majestic God of Growth, toward the fortress.\nSunny watched, his soul held in a state of pure awe. He saw Adam walk alone into the den of the seven most powerful demons in existence, his posture straight, his aura an unwavering pillar of golden light in a realm of pure chaos.\nSunny felt a flicker of shame for his own cautious, scheming nature. This was a true God-King. The boastings by Adam were not exaggerated. Adam’s strength was so immense that he truly did not fear them.\nMaybe Freya is right\n, Adam thought to himself, observing the demons’ surprisingly civil behavior.\nMaybe we should give them a chance.\nHe looked at the seven lords and spoke, his voice ringing with the authority. \"Now that you all have decided to turn over a new leaf, I, as the spokesperson for all the Gods, express my heartfelt invitation for you to sign this treaty.\"\nThe seven Demon Lords nodded. One by one, they each released a single drop of their blood. Ichor’s was acidic and smoking, Maledictus’s was viscous and black, and Beelzebub’s was thick like tar. The crimson drops floated in the air, dancing and weaving together in a violent, unnatural process before merging and flattening into a pulsating, living document of blood. Adam followed suit, adding his own drop of pure, liquid gold essence to the pact.\nIn a chorus of booming, resonant voices, the demons made their pledge. \"We, the Demon Lords, pledge to the Void that we will not enter the world of the living in our current life.\"\nAdam heard the carefully chosen words, the crucial loophole. In our current life. It meant this peace was only temporary. But it was a start.\n\"Fair enough,\" Adam said, his own voice stern and unyielding. \"I, God Adam, as the spokesperson of the Gods, pledge to the Mother Void that we Gods will not hurt or kill you, until you break this oath of yours.\" His meaning was just as clear: if you don’t fight, we won’t fight. The pact was sealed.\nSunny watched it all, a silent witness to history. He had seen the treaty signed, but he had also seen the cold, calculating look in Deimos’s eyes. He knew, with the chilling clarity of a time traveler, that he had just witnessed the beginning of the end for the old Gods, not the start of a lasting peace.",

      "content": "Chapter 129: Ch 129 : The start of the bloody feud\nThe saying was ancient, a piece of mortal wisdom that had echoed through countless worlds:\nin the schemes of gods, mortals suffer.\nSunny had always understood it as a concept, a distant truth from a novel.\nNow, floating in the endless River of Time, he was watching it as a memory. The faith he spent to witness this history was a small price to pay for the horrifying clarity it provided. This was not a story; it was a lesson, written in the blood and tears for hundred thousand years.\nThis seeds of this bloody feud were sown just a few short years after the signing of the peace treaty. The old Gods honored their pledge with a heavy but sincere heart. The Demon Lords honored theirs as well, but in a way so twisted, so utterly manipulative, that it made a mockery of the very concept of peace.\nThey did not invade the worlds of the living, just as they had promised. Instead, their influence began to seep through the cracks of reality like a slow, creeping poison. From the very essence of their own malevolence, they each birthed a new demonic race, seven living plagues designed to be the perfect, power generators for them.\nFrom Deimos, the Lord of Discord, came demons who were whispers in the dark, creatures that could turn a loving glance into a suspicious glare, and a minor disagreement into a bloody feud.\nFrom Belial, the Lord of Lies, came demons with silver tongues, capable of twisting truth so perfectly that a victim would thank them for their own damnation.\nPhobos unleashed demons of Fear, formless things that fed on paranoia, while the Lord of Despair birthed shadows that drained all hope.\nBeelzebub’s children were a beings that spreaded Hunger everywhere, not just for food, but for power, for wealth, for more.\nIchor’s creations were a living Corrosion, and Maledictus spawned demons of Curses, weavers of plagues and misfortune.\nThese seven races were unleashed upon the multiverses, their only purpose to corrupt, to divide, and to harvest the suffering of mortals, sending a river of power back to their creators.\nSunny watched one such tragedy unfold on a small world. He saw two brothers, their faces etched with the grief of their recently passed parents, standing over a map of their family’s land.\n\"Brother, why did you do this?\" the older one whispered, his voice trembling. He looked down at the dagger buried in his stomach, then up at the face of his younger brother, the one he had taught to walk.\n\"You took the larger portion,\" the younger brother replied, his face a mask of cold fury. There was no guilt in his eyes, only a chilling certainty.\nA Lie-Demon’s whisper had been his only counsel for weeks, telling him that his older brother had always looked down on him, had always seen him as lesser. \"What did you expect me to do?\"\nFrom a tear in reality that only the younger brother could perceive, a Discord-Demon hissed, its voice like scraping stone. \"You did the right thing. He disrespected you. Now, finish the job. His family shares his greed. They are part of this betrayal.\"\n\"Yes... I didn’t do anything wrong,\" younger brother repeated, the words a hollow mantra. He entered his brother’s house. He saw the faces of his young niece and nephew, their eyes wide with confusion. For a fleeting moment, tears pricked at his own eyes, a ghost of the man he used to be. But the demonic whispers were louder than his conscience.\n\"I didn’t do anything wrong,\" he whispered again, standing over the still bodies of his brother, his sister-in-law, and their six children. The tragic scene fed a minuscule trickle of power back to the demonic realm, a single drop in an ocean of malice, but a drop nonetheless.\nAcross the cosmos, Ichor roared with laughter. \"This is the right way, Deimos, you are a genius!\" he bellowed, as he watched one of his corrosive plagues dissolve an entire planet at the edge of a distant multiverse, a place where the God’s vision was weakest. The world didn’t die in fire and fury, but in a silent, bubbling sludge, its oceans turning to acid and its mountains crumbling to gray dust.\n\"This is just the start,\" Deimos’s calm, chilling voice echoed in the minds of the other Demon Lords. \"In a hundred thousand years, we will be strong enough to crush them like ants.\"\nSunny watched another world fall, this one to a more insidious attack. A plague, born from a Curse-Demon, swept through the population like a wildfire. It was a disease that didn’t just kill the body; it attacked the mind.\nThe Despair-demon followed in its wake, amplifying the grief, while the Fear-demon turned every shadow into a monster. The lifeforms died like flies, their last moments not of peace, but of pure, undiluted terror.\nThe Demon Lords’ strategy was flawless. They targeted the weakest Gods, the ones whose multiverses were small and isolated, far from the central powers. Their demonic children were the perfect tools, their actions too subtle and scattered for the Gods to notice until it was too late, and even if they notice it, they wouldn’t know that it was a doing of the demons.\nIn the heart of the demonic realm, in a fortress carved from a single, mountain-sized obsidian stone, Beelzebub and Phobos played a game of chess. The pieces were not wood or ivory, but the trapped, screaming souls of fallen lifeforms.\n\"My race just devoured another planet,\" Beelzebub rumbled, moving a soul-pawn forward.\n\"The rook moves diagonally, Beelzebub,\" Belial, the Lord of Lies, said with a charming smile as he appeared beside the board, casually nudging a piece into a checkmate position.\n\"Do you think your power is the only one growing?\" Beelzebub said, not even looking at Belial. With a single thought, he reverted the board to its state before the cheat. \"You are forgetting I am also getting stronger with each passing second. Your lies wouldn’t work on me\"\n\"You are no fun,\" Phobos rasped. \"At least you could have agreed to the lie, like Deimos would have.\"\n\"He is just too cunning,\" Beelzebub replied, a hint of admiration in his voice. \"This plan of his... I believe it will make these Gods kneel before us and beg for mercy.\"\nFar from the game, Deimos sat on his own seat, his eyes closed. He could feel the threads of discord weaving through the cosmos, the sweet symphony of chaos growing louder with each passing moment. \"My power is increasing, better than all the other demons, but it’s still not upto to my expectations,\" he mused. A slow, cruel smirk spread across his face.\n\"Perhaps... it will increase when Gods themselves would join this little game of mine.\" He knew that the true, exponential surge in his power would only come when the divine beings themselves began to turn on one another. The discord of mortals was an appetizer. The discord of Gods would be the main course.",

      "content": "Chapter 130: Ch 130 : Unbounded by Rules\nThe scene of the past reached its grim conclusion. From his vantage point in the River of Time, Sunny had witnessed the slow, agonizing decay of a hundred thousand years. He had seen the suffering, a poison that had seeped into the very soul of trillions of worlds and countless lifeforms, all orchestrated by an enemy that never once broke their promise.\nHe felt a profound weariness, the exhaustion that was as high as a mountain and as deep as the ocean, because he was constantly watching the trauma of all these lifeforms. he could’ve skipped it, but he didn’t. he wanted these scene to etch into his heart, as this will be the motivation he needs to not let his lifeforms go through the same fate.\n\"Why?\" Sunny whispered, his voice a ghost in the river of time. \"Why did the Void create such evil? Without the Void Beasts, there would be no demons, and none of this suffering would have ever happened.\" He watched as the old Gods, after a hundred thousand years of ignorance, finally began to grasp the true, insidious nature of the demonic game.\nThe scene shifted to a somber council of light. The ornate mirror in Adam’s throne room now connected to dozens of other divine beings, their ethereal forms shimmering across the cosmos. Freya’s beautiful face was etched with a guilt so profound it seemed to dim her natural radiance.\n\"Adam... I was wrong,\" she confessed, her voice trembling. The treaty she had once labelled as a path to peace had become the very weapon used to bleed their creations dry. She felt the weight of every mortal life lost, a burden too heavy even for a goddess.\nThe oath they had all sworn now felt less like a shield and more like a cage. If they broke it, their own divine talents would shatter, leaving them as gods in name only. To watch their people suffer and die was a bitter pill, but to become powerless was to invite an even swifter annihilation, as the demon lords could return, but they couldn’t.\n\"It’s not your fault, Freya,\" another God’s voice rumbled through the connection, his form a being of pure, starlit energy. \"We all agreed to that flawed treaty. We all walked into their trap.\"\n\"Our only option now is to develop a God so powerful that they can contend with the Demon Lords directly,\" Adam declared, his voice ringing with the grim resolve of a king who had just accepted a devastating defeat. The arrogance was gone, replaced by the heavy burden of leadership. \"As for their demonic children, we Gods can hold them back.\"\nThe reason behind creating a new God was simple, the oath was only applicable to the old Gods, if they can create a new God, more powerful then the current Gods and the counter to the power of Demons, that would be able to stop this suffering of the lifeforms.\nHe issued a command that sent a ripple of divine power across the multiverses. \"Use every bit of your faith. Shrink your worlds. Pull your borders inward to a space where you can watch every corner, where no invading demon can go unchecked!\"\nAcross the cosmos, a great retreat began. Entire multiverses, once sprawling tapestries of galaxies, began to fold in on themselves. The light of a billion stars was drawn inward, coalescing into smaller, denser, more defensible realms. It was a desperate, monumental act of self-preservation.\nBut the Demon Lords were watching.\nIn their fortress of malice, Deimos smiled. \"Keep maintaining the pressure,\" he said to the other lords. \"I will be right back.\"\n\"Is that necessary?\" Maledictus asked, she knew that the question was unnecessary, but she still asked in worry, Deimos simply nodded, and the hall fell silent.\nAnd then, something impossible happened. Deimos, the most powerful and cunning of the seven, the architect of their victory, simply... ceased to be. His body did not fall or explode; it unraveled, his physical form dissolving into a wave of pure, chaotic discord that washed over the entire demonic realm. He had, with a simple thought, killed himself.\nIt was not an end. It was a masterstroke.\nSunny, watching this from the River of Time, felt a jolt of ice-cold realization. He finally understood the horrifying brilliance of their enemy.\nDemon Lords were not like Gods; they were living concepts. As long as discord existed in the universe, a Demon Lord of Discord would always be born.\nHis death was merely a strategic reset. The oath he had sworn was for his current life. By ending that life, he had freed himself from its bonds. The current chaos, the grand discord he had orchestrated, would fuel his rebirth, shortening the process from a hundred thousand years to a mere fraction of that. When he returned, he would be reborn, a new being, completely unbound by any promise, free to walk the worlds of the living as he pleased.\nSunny felt a mix of terror and a grudging, horrified admiration. \"He played them all,\" he breathed. \"The Gods, and even his own kind.\" Deimos was already the strongest among the demons; now he would return even stronger, while the other six lords remained leashed by the treaty. He wasn’t just aiming for victory; he was aiming for absolute, unrivaled power. An old saying from Endor came to mind:\na being with a brain is far more dangerous than one with just strength.\nThe next few hundred years of the past played out in a blur of cold, grinding warfare. The Gods, now huddled in their shrunken multiverses, fought a defensive battle against the endless tide of demonic influence. Casualties were lower, but the pressure was constant.\nThen, in the 786th year, Sunny felt a shift in the cosmos. In the heart of the demonic realm, a new, but at the same time an ancient, terrifying consciousness snapped into existence. Deimos was back. Weaker, perhaps, but now he was a predator without a leash.\nThe game of cosmic chess continued, but the rules had changed. Deimos had just sacrificed himself to bring himslef back as an all-powerful piece, and the Gods were still playing by the old rules, completely unaware that their opponent was no longer bound by the board.",

      "content": "Chapter 131: Ch 131 : The Hunt Begins\nThe movie of the past continued to play before Sunny’s soul, a silent, relentless film of cosmic tragedy. He was now watching the beginning of the end, the first moves in a game so vast and cruel that it would ultimately consume billions of gods.\n\"It’s time to hunt Gods like dogs,\" Deimos whispered to the void, his form newly reborn, unbound by any oath. His eyes, burning with ancient malice, scanned the swirling tapestry of the multiverses.\nHe did not seek the strongest, not yet. His power, though immense, fed on weakness. He was a predator who targeted the fringes of the herd.\n\"Let’s start with the weakest,\" he mused, a cruel smile twisting his lips, \"and let the discord begin.\"\nHe slipped into a multiverse so small it was barely a flicker of light in the grand cosmos. He knew a smaller realm meant weaker Gods, and weaker Gods had souls filled with cracks for his poison to seep into. Within hours, the capital world of this small universe, a place that had known peace for millennia, was in flames.\n\"How? What are you all doing?!\" the True God of this multiverse screamed, his voice a chorus of rage and heartbreak. He stood on the balcony of his celestial palace, watching in horror as his own subordinate Gods tore each other apart in the streets below. A third of his pantheon had descended into a rabid, chaotic madness.\nA God, his closest and most trusted advisor, appeared behind him, his head bowed respectfully. \"Master, they fight because of old grudges. They fear the coming war with the demon gods and wish to settle their scores before they are sent to die.\"\nAs he spoke, the advisor’s hand moved with imperceptible speed. A tiny worm, a creature of pure shadow, dropped from his sleeve and burrowed into the True God’s divine form.\n\"From now on, I am the True God of this multiverse,\" the advisor declared, his voice suddenly echoing with the manic laughter of the other traitors.\n\"Do you think this little parasite can kill me?\" the True God said, his voice dropping to a low, dangerous calm. He turned, his eyes filled not with fear, but with a profound, weary sadness. Another of his most beloved students appeared behind the first, her hands dripping with a sizzling, green liquid. She hurled it at him.\n\"And do you think this little essence of Corrosion is enough?\" he sighed, the acidic substance dissolving harmlessly against his radiant aura. He looked past his treacherous students, his gaze seeming to pierce through reality itself, locking onto the hidden form of Deimos.\n\"And to the demon god who caused this,\" he said, his voice now resonating with a power that Deimos had not anticipated. \"Even though I can’t see you, I know you are listening. So listen carefully. This is my multiverse, and your cheap tricks will not work here.\"\nAn aura of pure peace erupted from the True God. It was not a weapon of force, but a wave of absolute serenity that washed over the entire multiverse. The rage in the battling Gods evaporated, replaced by confusion and shame. The whispers of discord in their minds were silenced, drowned out by a feeling of profound tranquility.\nFrom the shadows between universes, Deimos clicked his tongue in annoyance. \"Tch, a bad matchup from the start.\" A God whose very nature was a direct counter to his own. He wasted no more time and vanished, leaving the True God to mend his fractured kingdom.\nThe God immediately sent a warning through an ancient artifact, a message that rippled out to the neighboring multiverses: Beware a demon god who can turn brother against brother. They heard the warning, but they could not possibly comprehend the truth. They assumed it was a powerful demon God, never dreaming that a Demon Lord, a being they believed bound by an unbreakable oath, was once again walking among them.\n\"Just a little more power,\" Deimos mused as he sought his next target, \"and I will be strong enough to cause discord even among the True Gods.\"\nSunny watched this, a cold knot forming in his soul. He saw Deimos’s strategy with terrifying clarity. It was a slow, methodical infection. The demon lord visited one multiverse after another, planting seeds of doubt and paranoia, then leaving before the true chaos erupted.\nThe Gods, sensing a new threat, did exactly what Deimos had hoped. They began to merge their multiverses, combining their strength, huddling together for safety. They built a grand fortress of unity, unaware that Deimos had already placed a traitor inside every wall.\n\"Now, for phase two of my plan,\" Deimos laughed, and slipped into a newly merged multiverse, a powerful realm now ruled by a council of four True Gods.\nHe chose his target: a God whose pride was as vast as his power. For an entire day, Deimos whispered into his soul, his voice a subtle poison that fed the God’s deepest insecurities. \"Who among you four is the strongest?\" the whisper began.\n\"Of course, it is I,\" the God replied to the empty air, his voice full of casual arrogance.\n\"I don’t believe it. The other three look much tougher.\"\n\"Why don’t you believe me?!\" the God roared, his pride stung.\nThe conversation went on for a full day, the longest and most patient seduction in the history of the cosmos. By the second day, the God was fully corrupted.\nDuring a high council meeting, as his three brothers discussed strategies against the demons, he struck. He moved with the speed of a striking viper, his divine weapon piercing the heart of another True God before anyone could even react.\nThe moment the True God died, the entire cosmos shook. It was not a physical tremor, but a spiritual one, the sound of a pillar of reality collapsing. In the Heaven realm, Adam felt it, his face turning grim. \"It has been billions of years since I last felt the cosmos weep,\" he whispered.\nThe corrupted God stood over the body of his fallen brother, his own power surging as he absorbed the dead God’s essence. But the whispers of Deimos were not finished. \"You are really strong. But what about the other two? Are you afraid of them?\"\n\"Afraid?\" the God snarled, his eyes burning with a new, terrifying madness. \"I am not afraid of anyone. Just you watch. Watch how I kill them all.\" He turned, his gaze falling upon the two remaining True Gods, who could only stare in horror, their minds unable to process the sudden, brutal betrayal. The real war had just begun.",

      "content": "Chapter 132: Ch 132 : The King’s Gambit\nThe movie had lost its novelty. What had begun as a fascinating historical epic for Sunny had, over the last one hundred thousand years of viewing, become a grueling spectacle of decay. The initial shock had faded, replaced by a cold, analytical dread. He was watching a slow, grinding infection consume the entire cosmos.\nThe Demon Lords’ strategy was brutally effective. After Deimos, the Lord of Discord, was reborn, Beelzebub, the Lord of Gluttony, soon followed. The chaos in the multiverses, the raw hunger for power among the warring Gods, was a feast that had called him back from oblivion.\nThe two worked in perfect, horrifying harmony. Deimos would whisper the poison of discord into a God’s ear, and Beelzebub would amplify it with a fever of greed, a ravenous hunger for more power, more territory, more everything.\nThe rate at which the Gods fell accelerated. They knew they were being hunted, cornered by an enemy they couldn’t see and an oath they couldn’t break. They could fight the lesser demon gods, but their true foes remained untouchable, ghosts pulling strings from a realm beyond their reach.\nThe river of time flowed on, and the two-hundred-thousand-year-long film was now nearing its final act. Only fifty thousand years remained. Sunny, a silent witness to this entire forgotten history, now knew more about the old Gods’ downfall than all of them combined.\n\"I suppose it’s time,\" Sunny whispered to the void, a grim understanding settling in his soul. \"Time for the desperate, final stand.\"\nHe watched a scene from 40,000 years before the end. Adam was speaking to Freya through the ornate mirror. \"It’s not safe out there,\" Adam pleaded, his voice stripped of a king’s authority, leaving only the raw worry of a man speaking to his love. \"When will you come back?\"\n\"Just a few thousand more years, my love,\" Freya replied, the background behind her a swirling vortex of creation. It was her movable realm, her personal universe, nearly complete. \"My project is almost finished.\" They spoke for a while longer, their conversation a small, fragile island of warmth in a sea of impending doom.\nAnother ten thousand years flashed by in the movie. The number of Gods had been cut in half. The infection had reached a critical point. Adam could wait no longer. He sent out a summons, a call that echoed through the dying embers of the cosmos, calling every remaining God to his multiverse for one last, desperate meeting.\nThe grand meeting hall was haunted by empty thrones. Where once billions had gathered, now only a fraction remained, their auras flickering with exhaustion and fear.\n\"I have made my decision,\" Adam’s voice boomed, leaving no room for argument. \"And it is final. Do not forget that I am the leader of all Gods.\"\nFreya’s image shimmered into existence on the mirror, her face a mask of worry. \"Adam, at least let me return first!\"\n\"Your realm is too slow,\" Adam countered gently but firmly. \"It would take you a thousand years to reach us. We do not have that kind of time. Do you think I cannot do this alone?\"\n\"I know you can, but...\" Freya began, but he cut her off.\n\"No buts. I was the one who signed that cursed treaty. I will be the one to end the suffering it has caused. I will not let the worlds we built with our own blood and sweat fall to ruin because of my mistake.\"\nFreya just nodded, her eyes welling with tears. She knew what his decision meant, the terrible price he was willing to pay.\nThis all started with the start of the meeting of the Gods:\n\"As you know,\" Adam had addressed the somber assembly, \"half of our brothers and sisters are gone. We can do nothing while these demon lords hide behind their oath, using their creations to bleed us dry. They are too good at hiding, and they always pick the easiest targets.\" His gaze swept over the remaining Gods. \"This cannot go on. If we wait, they will grow strong enough to kill us all like ants.\"\n\"What can we even do, Adam?\" a God cried out in despair. \"We are bound by the oath!\"\n\"I have a way,\" Adam replied, his voice a sudden, sharp blade of certainty in the despairing silence. He knew there was no going back from this.\n\"What way?\" Freya had asked, her voice trembling, already sensing the terrible nature of his plan.\n\"The first step is to force the Demon Lords out of the demonic realm and into the cosmos,\" Adam said, so casually that for a moment, the Gods just nodded. Then, the implication hit them. \"What about the oath?!\" they shouted in unison.\nA grim, humorless smile touched Adam’s lips. \"You think I was a fool to sign such a contract? Yes, perhaps a little. But I was not without a backup.\" He leaned forward. \"If you all can remember, what was the exact wording of the oath the Demon Lords pledged?\"\n\"They will not enter the world of the living in their current life,\" a God recited, and then his eyes, along with every other eye in the hall, widened in a flash of dawning, terrifying understanding.\n\"Exactly,\" Adam said. \"And if I kick them out of their realm, what happens?\"\n\"The oath is broken,\" Freya whispered, her voice barely audible. \"Both you and the Demon Lords... will lose your divine talents.\"\n\"Precisely,\" Adam confirmed. \"But you do not need to be scared. I will split my soul. Even if the first half of my soul loses its talents, the second half will retain them.\" He rubbed his nose smugly, as if expecting praise for his genius. What he got was a collective scream of horror.\n\"NO!\" Freya’s voice was a shriek that seemed to tear through the cosmos. \"That is a path to madness, Adam! Don’t you remember the God who tried to split his soul? He died in agony, his screams echoing for a thousand years!\"\n\"I know,\" Adam said, his smugness gone, replaced by a quiet, unshakeable resolve. \"But you seem to be forgetting my talent.\"\n\"Your talent...\" Freya trailed off, and then her eyes widened even further as she understood. \"So... you mean you’ve already gained that power?\"\nAdam nodded. The God of Growth had been growing, preparing for this very moment. He had already mastered the forbidden, agonizing art of tearing his own soul in subparts.",

The very air in the grand hall was thick with the sweet, cloying scent of suffering, a perfume they had savored for a hundred thousand years. They were winning, and they were enjoying every moment of it.\n\"So, Deimos, what’s next on our agenda?\" Ichor, the Lord of Corrosion, hissed, his slimy form restlessly shifting on his throne of bone. He was a creature of action, and his patience was wearing thin. \"We are strong enough now. Let us crush these remaining Gods and be done with it.\"\n\"We can’t just kill them outright,\" Deimos replied, his voice a calm, chilling counterpoint to Ichor’s eagerness. He was playing a much longer game. \"If we do, we will expend too much of our own power. No, we must continue to exhaust them, break their spirits, and make them so desperate that they either charge blindly into our realm to their doom, or simply wait in their shrinking worlds and die of despair.\"\n\"He is right,\" Maledictus, the Lord of Curses, added, her melodic voice weaving through the hall. \"If we continue on this path, in another two hundred thousand years, their last embers of hope will be extinguished, and they will fall by our hands.\"\n\"We don’t need to wait that long,\" Deimos said, a slow, predatory smile spreading across his face as he stood and gazed into a distance only he could see. \"Their king should be coming to us very soon.\"\n’Does this demon have a talent to see the future?’ Sunny thought, a shiver running through his soul form as he watched from the River of Time. Deimos’s foresight was unnervingly precise.\n\"Oh, Adam is coming?\" Ichor slammed a corrosive fist on the table, the bone sizzling under his touch. \"I want to punch that smug face of his until it’s nothing but dust!\"\n\"Even now, Adam could still snap you in half with ease,\" Beelzebub, the Lord of Gluttony, rumbled from behind a pile of gnawed-on cosmic stones. \"Let Deimos handle him. He is the strongest, after all.\"\nDeimos simply shook his head. He knew Adam was no simple opponent. He was one of the few beings in existence whose power seemed to grow with every passing day.\nSuddenly, an aura erupted outside their fortress, a force so pure and overwhelmingly powerful that it shook both the cosmos and the entire demonic realm. The very foundations of their obsidian castle groaned under the pressure.\n\"You rats! Come out!\"\nThe voice was a thunderclap of divine fury, filled with the pride of a king, the grief for his fallen brothers and sisters, and a burning desire for absolute revenge. The Demon Lords looked at each other, their amusement vanishing. They knew that voice. They vanished from the hall and reappeared a mile away from the source, standing before the radiant, furious form of Adam.\n\"Are you going back on your words, Adam?\" Belial, the Lord of Lies, asked, his voice a silken taunt.\n\"Do not teach me what to do,\" Adam snarled. In an instant, he moved. A teleportation spell, woven with a speed and complexity that defied understanding, ripped open the space beneath the Demon Lords’ feet. Before they could even react, the tear in reality swallowed them whole, spitting them out of their native realm and into the cold, empty void of the cosmos.\nThe oath was broken.\nSizzle! A sharp, burning sensation erupted on Adam’s hand, the point of contact where his magic had touched them. The sickening smell of corroding flesh filled the air. But with a casual shake of his hand, the wound vanished, his divine regeneration instantly knitting his form back together. He looked down at his hand, and then at the seven stunned Demon Lords, and his mind went utterly still.\n\"My powers... they are still with me?\" he whispered, the realization chilling him to the bone. There were only two possibilities. The first was that these were not the true Demon Lords, but fakes. The second, far more terrifying possibility, was that they had broken the oath first. \"Did you... did you all kill yourselves and get reborn?\" he asked, his voice low and dangerous, hitting the nail directly on the head.\nThe seven Demon Lords stared at each other, their faces a mask of pure terror. This was the one thing they had feared. Adam’s power was absolute; even a hundred of them would be helpless before him if he was unbound.\n\"I should have come sooner,\" Adam said, a deep regret in his voice. \"I wasted so much time learning that soul-tearing technique.\" He now understood. These demons were not just whispering in the ears of mortals; they were the whispers, reborn and free.\n\"Adam, don’t push us to the corner! You will regret it!\" Ichor stammered, his earlier bravado completely gone. \"Why don’t we just shake hands and let bygones be bygones?\"\nAdam simply cracked his knuckles, the sound echoing like thunder in the silent void. \"Today,\" he declared, his voice a low growl of promised pain, \"I will show you what suffering truly is.\"\nHe vanished. The first punch landed on Ichor’s face with the force of a collapsing galaxy. Ichor’s hand sizzled with corrosive energy, but Adam’s own recovery was so fast the wound healed in the same millisecond it appeared. \"You are the most irritating one,\" Adam said calmly. \"You deserve some special treatment.\"\nBefore Ichor could even register the pain, a second punch followed. Then a third. Then a storm, a relentless barrage of thousands of blows per second that beat the Demon Lord of Corrosion like a drum.\nThe other six Demon Lords could only watch, paralyzed by a fear so profound it froze their very souls. They had planned for everything, but they had never planned for this, for the full, unrestrained fury of the firstborn God.\nAdam kicked Ichor in the gut, and the demon’s scream of pure agony echoed across the entire cosmos. But as his scream faded; a faint, distant screams, a chorus of terror from a million different mouthd that Adam, in his righteous fury, did not notice.\nAfter Ichor was a broken, whimpering mess, Adam turned to Beelzebub. He delivered another devastating punch. And then, it happened again.\nSizzle.\nThe exact same corrosive burn appeared on his hand.\nAdam froze, his fist stopped inches from Beelzebub’s terrified face. His mind, once a storm of fury, went numb. The righteous fire in his eyes died, replaced by the cold, gray ash of a horrifying understanding.\nIt was a trap.\n\"Poor Adam,\" Sunny whispered from the River of Time, his own heart aching for the doomed king.\n\"Now I know the real reason for your loss.\" He saw the scheming nature of the demons and the tragic fall of a noble God who had walked directly into their perfectly laid trap. The Demon Lords Adam was fighting were just decoys. And while the king was distracted, their real armies were slaughtering his leaderless people across the multiverse.",

      "content": "Chapter 134: Ch 134 : Live and remember Us, My king\nThe seven decoys of the Demon Lords dissolved into puddles of foul, corrosive slime and vanished without a trace. In that same instant, across a billion light-years, the real massacre began.\n\"He is returning,\" Ichor’s true form snarled, his voice a guttural roar as his corrosive touch reduced a True God to screaming dust. \"Finish this quickly!\"\nThe heart of Adam’s multiverse had become a slaughterhouse. This was no longer a subtle war of whispers and corruption; this was a brutal, overwhelming purge.\nBeelzebub, the Lord of Gluttony, moved through the battlefield like a walking apocalypse. He plucked panicked, fleeing Gods from the sky as if they were ripe fruit, stuffing them into his gaping maw five or six at a time, their divine screams muffled as he swallowed them whole.\nMaledictus, the Lord of Curses, danced through the chaos, her laughter a melodic poison. With every graceful gesture, she wove curses that turned Gods blind, made their own power turn against them, or simply corrupted their souls until they fell from the sky as twisted, weeping abominations.\nPhobos fed on the rampant terror, his shadowy form swelling with power as he drowned the few remaining Pockets of resistance in waves of pure fear.\nMalakai, the Lord of Despair, simply drifted through the battlefield, his presence alone enough to make gods drop their weapons and surrender to oblivion. And Belial, the Lord of Lies, was perhaps the cruelest of all. He would whisper a single, perfect lie into a God’s ear, \"You are a demon, fight the Gods\" and watch with detached amusement as the God, their mind shattered, would turn and savagely attack their closest ally.\nMeanwhile, Adam was locked in a desperate battle, a king fighting for a kingdom that was already burning to the ground behind him. He was stopped midway on his return journey by an entity radiating a power that was growing with every passing second. It was Deimos.\n\"Deimos!\" Adam roared, his voice a thunderclap of pure fury. He didn’t waste a single moment on words. His brothers and sisters were dying. He threw a punch, a blow that carried the force of a collapsing star, aimed directly at his nemesis.\nBut Deimos, his strength fueled by the very chaos he had unleashed, was no longer the same being Adam had faced before. He met the blow, the impact sending a shockwave that cracked the fabric of space itself.\nHe was still weaker than Adam, but he was strong enough to stall, to hold the line, to buy his brethren the precious time they needed to complete their slaughter.\nAdam pressed the attack, his every move a cataclysm, but Deimos was a rising tide of pure discord, deflecting and dodging, his only goal to keep the king trapped while his kingdom fell.\nAdam, stronger but unable to land a decisive blow, felt a cold dread creep into his soul. He was being stalled, and he knew it was a death sentence for his people. He remembered his final, desperate gambit, the second part of his soul, the backup he had saved in a hidden treasure. He splited his consciousness, a feat othat was agonizing even for him, and activated it.\nBack in his home multiverse, a new sun ignited. The second soul of Adam, smaller but burning with the same righteous fire, emerged from a hidden container outside his palace. He was met with a scene of absolute carnage. He saw the six Demon Lords and their millions of demon gods slaughtering his kin like cattle.\nWithout a word, he unleashed his power. He moved like a comet, killing six or seven demon gods with every single blow.\n\"It’s Adam! Retreat, you all!\" Beelzebub screamed, his feast interrupted. He tore open a rift in space and fled back to the demonic realm, the other Demon Lords following close behind. They had done their part. The demon gods, however, were not so lucky. Only a handful managed to escape before Adam’s fists found them.\nThe tide of the battle turned in an instant. The remaining Gods, seeing their king, rallied behind him, cutting down the lesser demons. But it was a hollow victory.\nAdam looked at the few million Gods who remained from the original billions, and he knew the war was lost. His main body was still locked in a desperate struggle with a rapidly strengthening Deimos. His other soul was about to be beaten to a pulp by that monster.\nWhen the last demon god fell, Adam’s second soul addressed the survivors, his voice heavy with the weight of their defeat. \"You all must retreat. Hide. Gather your strength. We... we have lost.\" Tears shimmered in his ethereal eyes, but a king had to give the final order, even if it was to abandon everything.\nThe Gods scattered, fleeing into the vastness of the cosmos. But Adam’s second soul did not flee. It turned and flew back towards the battle, back towards Deimos. It was his turn to stall, to buy his people the one thing he no longer had: time.\nDeimos felt the death of his demon gods, but he didn’t care. His smile only widened. The more death, the more chaos, the stronger he became. \"Oh? Two Adams?\" he mused as the second soul appeared. \"So that’s how they died so suddenly.\"\nAdam’s main body and his second soul lunged at Deimos together. But Deimos, now brimming with near-absolute power, simply toyed with them, dodging their attacks as if playing with children.\nThe space tore open again, and the six other Demon Lords emerged, their faces alight with triumphant malice. The trap was closing.\nBut the drama was not yet over.\nSunny, watching this from his throne, facepalmed. \"Why don’t these people just listen to their king?\" he groaned. He watched as the fleeing Gods, the ones who were supposed to scatter and hide, stopped. They looked back. They saw their king, both of his souls, fighting a hopeless battle against seven Demon Lords. And in a single, silent, collective decision, they turned back.\nA river of light, millions Gods, flew back towards the darkness, surrounding the seven Demon Lords and their embattled king. Adam looked at them, his eyes wide with disbelief. \"Why?\" he roared, his voice cracking with anguish. \"Why did I take such a risk if you were just going to follow me to your deaths?!\"\nA mental message, a chorus from a million loyal souls, answered him. \"To give you time to run away, my king. You are our only hope. Even if we run, they will find us. But if you escape, with your talents, you can one day take revenge.\"\nAnother voice joined the chorus. \"For us, my king. For the revenge. For all this humiliation. Live, and remember us.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 135: Ch 135 : A Final Gift, A Gaze Across Time\nThe cosmos held its breath. Adam stood surrounded by the last remaining of his people, a king preparing to die with his kingdom. The pleas of his followers to flee were a distant echo; a king does not run. His gaze was fixed on Deimos, a fire of pure, unyielding resolve in his eyes. He would fight until his last breath.\n\"This is getting boring,\" Deimos sighed, he sounded like an overpowered villan killing civilians. He raised a hand, preparing to deliver the final, killing blow, to extinguish the last great light of the old Gods.\nBut then, a pure, brilliant light tore through the void. It moved with a speed that defied the laws of the cosmos, a streak of impossible grace that placed itself directly between Adam and his doom.\nIt was Freya. She had arrived, and she took the full, devastating force of Deimos’s attack.\nA gaping hole appeared in her stomach, and divine blood, shimmering like liquid starlight, gushed forth like a fountain.\n\"Freya... why did you...?\" Adam’s roar of anguish was cut short. A powerful, irresistible force, born from Freya’s dying will, enveloped him. Both his main body and the fragment of his soul were pulled, dragged from the battlefield into an entirely new reality.\n\"Survive, my love,\" Freya’s voice was a soft whisper that echoed directly in his soul, a final, heartbreaking gift. \"This realm is the first and last gift of mine to you. Its name is the Realm of Advancement. Use it well, Adam.\"\nWith those final words, her body, as if it were a pane of shattered glass, dissolved into a billion motes of fading light.\nAs if answering her final wish, a cosmic symphony began. The bodies of all the Gods who had fallen in the great war began to twitch. From their silent forms, their most prized possessions, shimmering pills of immense power, divine artifacts that hummed with ancient energy—rose into the void and shot like falling stars towards the new realm, a final inheritance for the future.\nThe six other Demon Lords moved to intercept the treasures, but Deimos held up a hand. \"Let them go,\" he commanded. \"There is a restriction on this realm. A God cannot enter it without that goddess’s permission. Now that she is dead, the door is sealed to us.\"\n\"At least my curses can enter,\" Maledictus purred. With a flick of her wrist, she sent a single, SS-Grade curse, a thread of pure malice, hurtling into the Realm of Advancement. It struck the already half-dead form of Adam, a final act of spite. \"I couldn’t use a more potent curse, as it would not have been able to pass the restriction,\" she explained. \"Still, with his condition, he should die in a few hundred thousand years.\"\n\"Not bad,\" Deimos acknowledged. The battle was won. The great discord was over. The torrent of power that had been flooding into him slowed to a trickle.\nBut then, the cosmos itself seemed to sigh in appreciation for his masterpiece of chaos. A new wave of pure, law-bending power washed over him, and his aura became even stronger than before.\nFrom the River of Time, Sunny watched this final, tragic act, and a killing intent so pure and cold erupted from his soul that the very river around him seemed to freeze.\n\"Who goes there?\" this voice was not from the present. It was from the past. Deimos’s head snapped up from his victory, his gaze piercing through the veil of a million years, through the fabric of time itself, and locking directly onto Sunny’s soul.\n\"What?!\" Sunny screamed internally. This was just a projection, a memory! How could he be seen? How could he be attacked?\nThere was no time to think. Deimos swatted at the air in his direction, and reality itself began to tear apart where Sunny’s soul floated. Sunny didn’t hesitate. He plunged deeper into the chaotic currents of the River of Time, fleeing from a ghost that could somehow touch him.\n\"It isn’t time to fight you yet,\" Sunny said aloud, his voice shaking with a mixture of rage and shock. \"But don’t worry. You will die one day for sure.\"\nA slow, malicious grin spread across the face of the Deimos from a million years ago. \"I am waiting, then,\" his voice echoed across time.\nHe can even hear me\n, Sunny thought, a profound chill settling into his being. He finally understood. He knew their tricks, their weaknesses, but he was facing an enemy whose power defied the very laws of reality he was just beginning to comprehend.\nHe decided not to risk another look at Deimos and instead turned his attention to the newly created Realm of Advancement. But as his soul approached it, a shimmering barrier blocked his path.\n\"Is this restriction applied to me, too? I am just a soul!\" Sunny cried out in frustration. If the entry is denied, then he will chose another path. He would watch its creation.\nHe dived back into the river, traveling to a time before the final battle. He saw Freya, a being of breathtaking beauty and power, at work.\nAt first, the process was fascinating. She was like a divine weaver, taking entire worlds and sewing them together like clothes. But the process was slow, painstaking. As centuries passed in a blur, it became boring, and Sunny skipped ahead, searching for something to understand this restriction.\nSuddenly, he saw her pause. She held a small, crystalline object in her hand, a token that pulsed with a gentle, inviting light. \"Oh, Adam,\" she whispered to herself, a conversation of love across a distance of multiverses. \"This token is for you. When I finally visit, you can have it. With it, you can enter this realm anytime you wish.\"\nShe flew to a specific, hidden valley within the new realm and placed the token within a stone altar, concealing it from all but the most determined eyes. Sunny burned the location, the shape of the valley, and the look of the altar into his memory. He had found it. The key.\nWith his mission accomplished, Sunny pulled his soul from the River of Time. The journey had been costly. Four trillion faith points had vanished—a small fraction for the journey itself, but the acts of pausing, playing, and fast-forwarding history had drained his reserves. And the single, terrifying glance from Deimos had cost him the most. But the knowledge was worth it.\n\"Nova. Mammon,\" Sunny’s voice echoed through the minds of his two most powerful demigods. \"You have a duty to perform.\"\nHe sent them the location, the image of the valley, the vision of the token. He wasn’t worried about demons finding it; Freya was the Goddess of Restrictions, and her final work would be unassailable by lesser beings.\nImmediately, the two demigods began their journey. Nova tore a rift in space, stepping directly through reality, while Mammon dissolved into the shadows, traveling through the endless, silent Void.\n\"Sister Nova,\" Mammon’s voice echoed through their private connection, \"what do you think this treasure is, that the Master himself has asked us to find?\"\n\"I do not know,\" Nova replied, her own voice filled with a sense of profound purpose. \"But it must be something special. Master has never asked us to find something like this before.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 136: Ch 136 : A New Understanding\nThe void was a place of absolute silence, a cold, starless black that stretched between all the multiverses. It was here, in this perfect emptiness, that Nova and Mammon traveled, two points of divine light on a journey set by their master.\n\"By the way, what happened to your friends in the demonic realm?\" Nova’s voice was a gentle hum in the silence, a casual question meant to pass the immeasurable time.\nMammon, who was currently guiding them through the currents of the void, hesitated for a moment. \"The situation there is dire,\" he finally said, his usually smooth and confident voice laced with a conflict he rarely showed. \"They spoke of the demon king creating a new army, a force meant to attack the multiverse directly.\"\n\"Mammon, you have to remember, our master doesn’t care if a soul is born a demon or an angel,\" Nova said, her tone taking on the gentle wisdom of the eldest. \"The only thing that matters is the heart. Why don’t you persuade them to join us in Veridia? They could live here in peace. Diablo would surely welcome another race under his guidance.\"\nA heavy sigh escaped Mammon. \"And you think I didn’t try? I offered them sanctuary, a new life. But they refused. They told me to leave the demonic realm for good, and in return, they would not report my existence to the higher authorities.\" He fell silent, his thoughts turning inward. A cold knot of worry tightened in his chest, a single, persistent fear.\nWhat if, one day, they stand on the other side of the battlefield?\nWhile one demigod wrestled with the loyalty of his friends, a mortal on Veridia was nearing the end of a legendary journey.\nFor eighty years, Light Celestine had walked the world. He had left the glittering capital of Haven behind, trading a prince’s life for a teacher’s simple robes. Now, as his magnificent bird Lily soared towards the last disconnected village on his map, he let his mind drift back over the decades.\nHis first real test had been the village of Taewe, and the stubborn porcine chief, Gulata. He smiled at the memory. He had returned a few years after his first visit to find the village transformed. The children he had taught were now young adults.\nBolg, the curious boy who had been fascinated by Light’s knowledge, was now the village’s first true engineer, proudly overseeing a complex system of clay pipes and charcoal filters that provided clean water for everyone. And Gulata, the hulking chief who had once threatened him, now greeted him with a gruff but respectful nod, his suspicion replaced by a hard-won trust.\nHe remembered the dusty, forge-lit halls of the dwarves in the Ironpeak Mountains. They were masters of their craft, proud and unyielding. He hadn’t dared to teach them about smithing.\nInstead, he had shared blueprints from elven libraries, showing them how to weave mana into their steel, creating alloys that were not just strong, but alive with magic. He had spent a month there, the air ringing with the sound of hammers and the hum of newly learned runes, bridging a gap between two prideful races.\nHe remembered the shimmering, coral cities of the merfolk. He couldn’t teach them on land, so with a simple use of magic, he had created a bubble of air and descended into their silent, blue world. He had taught them about the healing properties of deep-sea algae he’d learned of from the Divine Library, a knowledge that revolutionized their medicine. The lessons were written in glowing phosphorescence on the cavern walls, a strange and beautiful classroom at the bottom of the world.\nEighty years. Dozens of villages. He had taught beastfolk how to read the stars, giants how to build with precision instead of just brute force, and orcs the discipline of an army. His journey was finally coming to an end.\nAs he landed near the last village, a wave of melancholy washed over him. His life’s purpose, it seemed, was almost complete.\n\"Divine Library,\" he asked through his system panel, a final, hopeful query. \"Are there any more such villages under God Cosmos’s rule that require aid?\"\nHe expected the answer to be zero. He expected his long journey to finally be over after this last village.\nThe answer that appeared on his panel was not a word, but a number. A number so vast, so cosmically impossible, that he thought the system itself must be broken. It was a staggering figure, a number that his mind could barely comprehend: five trillion.\n\"Five... trillion?\" Light whispered, his voice catching in his throat. \"That can’t be right. Veridia is growing, I know, the landmasses increase with our God’s grace... but five trillion villages cannot possibly fit on this world.\"\nIt had to be a bug, a glitch in the system or the knowledge from divine library. He immediately sent a message to the Host Seer, Rem, detailing the impossible number, certain she would confirm the error.\nRem’s reply came back swiftly. It was not a confirmation of a bug, but a gentle, profound correction, a message that shattered his entire perception of reality.\nMaster Isiah says the Divine Library is never wrong,\nLight Celestine. It is your thinking which is flawed. How can you say that our God only has one world under his command?\nLight’s eyes widened, his heart pounding in his chest. A single world? His thoughts, which had felt so grand and worldly just moments before, now seemed impossibly small, like a child trying to map the ocean from a single puddle. With trembling hands, he posed a new question to the Divine Library, a question that would redefine everything he thought he knew.\n’How many worlds are under the rule of God Cosmos?’\nThe answer appeared. It was a smaller number than the last, but the scale of it was infinitely greater. It was not a number of villages, but a number of entire, populated worlds. It was a number so vast, so utterly outrageous, that it stole the very breath from his soul and left him staring into the future, a future whose true, cosmic scale he was only just beginning to comprehend.",

      "content": "Chapter 137: Ch 137 : second thoughts\nIn a forgotten, mist-shrouded corner of the Realm of Advancement, a single, luminous pearl rested upon a pedestal of black, unearthly stone. It was the True Beauty Pill, an SSS-Grade treasure that pulsed with a soft, irresistible light, promising absolute perfection to whoever consumed it.\n\"Master, my sights are on the pill. It appears completely unguarded,\" a handsome and charming voice whispered through a divine connection. It belonged to ’Sparrow’, the demigod of Kitsune. He stood cloaked in shadows a distance away, his form a statue of chiseled perfection, his upper body bare to show the canvas of his well-defined muscles. His heart hammered with a greedy rhythm. The prize was right there for the taking.\n\"Just observe for now,\" Kitsune’s voice replied in his mind, a command laced with caution. In her own God space, her nine fluffy tails twitched with anticipation. Luck had favored her; two of the treasures had appeared near her portal. But she was no fool. A prize this great, left so openly, smelled of a trap.\nShe was not the only one watching. Some distance away, a shimmer in the air, a distortion that looked like heat haze, was all that marked the presence of another demigod. It was a creature of pure air, a silent observer sent by a God named Snatcher, another ambitious soul who had refused to bend the knee to Cosmos.\nMeanwhile, in a different patch of shadows near a different treasure, two of Reflection’s demigods kept a patient vigil. Their eyes were fixed on the Pill of Life, an artifact that shimmered with a gentle, life-giving aura of gold and green.\n\"Master, my senses detect nothing amiss. Should we not take it?\" one of them asked, his belief in his own perception unwavering.\n\"We wait,\" Reflection’s voice commanded. \"We are talking about demons. Their greatest weapon is our own impatience.\" The two demigods nodded in unison, their discipline absolute as they continued their watch. The treasures remained untouched, hidden from the world by a divine glamour that only those with prior knowledge, or those who stumbled upon them by sheer, impossible luck, could perceive.\nSunny observed this silent, three-way standoff from the comfort of his throne, Thea’s network feeding him a perfect, real-time view. He saw the greed, the ambition, and the caution, all swirling around the demons’ perfectly laid bait. The God Chat, once a chaotic river of messages, had grown quiet since the great partition between those in his Pantheon and those who remained outside. It was time to stir the waters.\nCosmos: \"Hello, Gods. A word of advice for those of you hunting for treasure: do not take them until you are absolutely certain of your strength. These artifacts are protected by a restriction that prevents any demon from touching them. Only our lifeforms and demigods can claim them. Taking the treasure is not the difficult part.\"\nHe paused, letting his words sink in across billions of God spaces.\nCosmos: \"The difficult part is surviving what comes next. The moment you touch that treasure, and the restriction is lifted, you will be ambushed. There could be fifty demon demigods waiting. There could be a hundred. There could be a thousand. Take care of your demigods. For most of you, once they are gone, you will not get another.\"\nZir, ever the loyal and enthusiastic subordinate, immediately jumped in to support his boss.\nZir: \"The Boss is right. You guys can’t get any more demigods after your first one is gone. You’ll have to wait for a hero to be born, and who knows how long that will take.\"\nZir’s message was meant to be helpful, but one of the independent Gods, a powerful S-Grade talent holder named Halios, caught the nuance in his phrasing.\nHalios: \"What do you mean by ’you guys’? Are you implying that you can have multiple demigods?\"\nZir’s avatar in the chat seemed to puff out its chest. He replied with a sentence that dripped with smug satisfaction.\nZir: \"My elders taught me that actions speak louder than words.\"\nFive images, posted by Zir, suddenly appeared in the God Chat, and a collective, cosmic gasp was heard across the multiverse.\nThe first image depicted a World Tree so colossal its roots seemed to encompass an entire planet, crushing S-Grade demons beneath them as if they were mere insects.\nThe second image showed a majestic, serpentine water dragon, its blue scales shimmering as it commanded the oceans of an entire world.\nThe third and fourth images showed an elegant elf demigod and a beautiful mermaid demigod, both radiating immense power.\nThe Gods outside the Pantheon stared in confusion. Four demigods? How was that possible? They assumed the images were from different worlds, a clever trick.\nThen came the fifth image. The one that shattered their reality.\nIt showed five pulsating, unused Divine Embryos, lined up in a row like priceless jewels in a king’s vault.\nThe God Chat fell into a stunned, absolute silence. The previous images could be faked, they could be from different allied Gods. But five Divine Embryos, the single most coveted and rarest item in existence, lined up for a photo? That was a statement of wealth and power so absolute it defied comprehension.\nHalios: \"-_-... Please tell me this is an AI-generated image.\" He typed, his hands trembling. He, an S-Grade talent holder, one of the elite, who still only had one DemiGod. And here was Zir, a God he had never even considered a rival, casually displaying four demigods and five more in reserve. The universe, as he knew it, felt like a cruel joke.\nGod 1: \"+1\"\nGod 2: \"+2\"\nGod 3: \"+451234\"\nThe upvotes flooded in, a tidal wave of shattered pride and dawning horror.\nZir: \"I feel sad to tell you all, but this is the truth. These images are all real. And this... this is only one of the benefits of joining the Pantheon.\"\nIn that moment, the focus of every independent God snapped to the name of the one being who could make this possible. God of Manifestation.\nThe title, which they had once thought impressive, now felt like a cosmic understatement. It wasn’t just a talent; it was a key, a key that had unlocked a vault of infinite power.\nHalios: \"Boss Cosmos... is it too late to join the Pantheon?\" He asked, his voice in the chat stripped of all its previous pride, replaced by the desperate, pleading tone of a man who had just realized he had made the biggest mistake of his life.",

      "content": "Chapter 138: Ch 138 : The breakthrough of a God\nThe God Chat, once a chaotic river of speculation and hope, was now a silent, desolate landscape of shattered pride. Halios’s desperate plea to join the Pantheon hung in the air, unanswered by the God it was addressed to. Instead, it was Zir who delivered the final, crushing verdict.\nZir: \"Not happening. The Boss already said it was a one-time offer. You all had your chance. Now, you can only pray your demigods don’t die.\"\nA wave of humiliation and rage washed over the independent Gods. They lashed out, their messages a torrent of accusations. They lectured Cosmos on humanity, on fairness, on the privilege he should be granting them. Their goal was simple and transparent: if you can’t get what you want through strength, try to get it through emotional blackmail.\nBut Sunny was not the god they thought he was. He was not one of them. He was a being born of the Void, a natural force who had just witnessed a two-hundred-thousand-year-long film of betrayal and suffering. He knew a backstabbing dog when he saw one, and he had no intention of letting them into his home.\nCosmos: \"Say whatever you want. I gave you a choice, and you did not take it. Your mistake is not my responsibility.\"\nHis message was a wave of cold, cosmic pressure that instantly silenced the chat. This was a side of Cosmos they had never seen, not the witty profiteer, but the absolute, unyielding emperor.\nCosmos: \"And a gentle reminder. If I see any more such comments in this God Chat, I won’t just take your system access. I know where you are. And if I can make entire planets vanish, you are still just tiny, fragile beings.\"\nA roar of approval erupted from the members of the Pantheon. They cheered their leader, their loyalty a thunderous chorus that only served to deepen the bitter humiliation of those left outside.\nSatisfied, Sunny turned his attention to a more productive task. \"Thea,\" he commanded, \"I am sharing with you the data of millions of demon gods; their abilities, their weaknesses, their fighting styles. Analyze it. Implement these demons into the gaming simulations. It is time all the Gods learned what they are truly fighting.\"\nA torrent of knowledge, the grim history he had just witnessed, flowed from his mind to Thea’s. Instantly, through her connection to Isiah, the information was cataloged, becoming millions of new, glowing orbs of light in the Divine Library, a priceless training manual for all the worlds under his protection.\nHis work done, Sunny finally allowed himself a moment of rest. The hundred thousand years he had just lived through had left his soul weary. He was about to close his eyes, to drift into a well-deserved moment of peace, but the multiverse had other plans.\nIn an instant, he felt it. A breakthrough. One of his clones, the one who had been tirelessly practicing magic for what amounted to days of accelerated time, had just shattered its limits and reached the S-Grade. The torrent of refined power and comprehension flooded back into Sunny’s main body, igniting his own breakthrough from A-Grade to S-Grade Mage.\nHis body became a vortex, an insatiable black hole of magical hunger. It first devoured all the ambient mana within his God space, draining it dry in a nanosecond. But it wasn’t enough. The hunger reached out, its jaws piercing through the fabric of reality and latching onto the closest, richest source of power: Veridia.\nAcross the entire planet, the world’s lifeblood vanished. A mage in the capital city of Haven, in the middle of casting a complex light spell, watched in horror as it fizzled into nothingness. The magical lights that illuminated the city flickered and died, plunging millions into a sudden, shocking darkness. The lifeforms panicked, believing it was the wrath of their God.\nThea’s calm, reassuring voice immediately echoed through their system panels, explaining the situation and quelling their fear. But no one could quell the terror of the beasts and monsters.\nFor them, mana was not a tool; it was the air they breathed, the very essence of their existence. Its sudden absence was like being thrown into a vacuum, a primal, suffocating terror that ignited their deepest survival instincts. A collective, planet-wide roar of panic and pain erupted from the forests, mountains, and oceans. The beast tide had begun.\nMassive, tusked boars, their eyes wild with fear, stampeded through farmlands. Griffins, their magical flight failing, fell from the sky, crashing into villages in a destructive panic. In the oceans, colossal sea serpents thrashed in the water, their rage creating tidal waves that battered the coastlines. The lifeforms, their own mana gone, were helpless.\nIn this moment of absolute chaos, the demigods descended.\nGoliath, the demigod of Titans, appeared before a stampede of thousand-ton behemoths. He did not fight them. He simply stood, a living mountain of flesh and stone, his massive form an unmovable wall that brought the tide to a crashing halt.\nValeria, the elven demigod, floated above a panicked forest, her own personal mana reserves glowing like a gentle star. She wove a song of calming light, a melody that soothed the savage hearts of the rampaging beasts, their roars of terror softening into confused whimpers.\nAll the newly created DemiGods followed suite, the Demigod of forest began to control the trees to trap the beasts and monsters, similarly all the other DemiGods helped to quell this disaster.\nBut Sunny’s hunger was not yet satisfied. Unbeknownst to him, his breakthrough had reached beyond Veridia, its jaw sinking into the 5.5 billion worlds of his new subordinates.\nAcross a billion solar systems, planets began to dim, their mana being siphoned away by their new, unseen emperor. The subordinate Gods watched in helpless horror, unable to do a thing.\nIn her own silent, cosmic realm, Thea’s consciousness became a galaxy of screaming red alarms. 5.5 billion distress signals flashed at once, a universe crying out in pain.\nHer mind, a supercomputer in it’s own, processed the logistical nightmare in a microsecond. She couldn’t stop her master, but she could mitigate the damage. A new directive flashed across her network, a call to arms for her hidden agents.\nAcross the multiverse, heroes who thought they were fighting for their own destiny received a new mission, their systems chiming with a single directive from a demigod they had never met. It was time to quell the tide.",

      "content": "Chapter 139: Ch 139 : Unity Across the Universe\nAcross billions of worlds, a silent, urgent call went out. In the grand libraries of Veridia, in the throne rooms of newly forged kingdoms, and in the desolate camps of forgotten refugees, a shimmering panel materialized before the eyes of the chosen.\n[Mission Name: Save a World]\n[Mission Grade: SS]\n[Description: The beasts are running rampant across the cosmos. You are called to stop them. Quell the tide, calm the chaos, but do not make them extinct. Their panic is not born of malice, but of fear.]\n[Mission Reward: ??]\n[Do you wish to join this mission?]\n[YES / NO]\nFor Lux, the prodigy of Asura’s world, the notification appeared as he was meditating, the ambient mana of his palace’s quiet chamber swirling around him. An SS-Grade mission. A task of cosmic importance. He didn’t hesitate for a second. His finger pressed [YES].\nFor Ragnok, now the undisputed king of the displaced people of Solara, the message appeared in the middle of a war council, a war with a demon city. He looked at the description, his face grim. It was not a request; it was a duty. He pressed [YES].\nFor Kael, the boy who had been saved from the brink of death, the mission was a chance to repay an immeasurable debt. He stood, his body now strong and confident, and pressed [YES].\nMillions of others across the multiverse did the same. Not a single one refused the call. A second message appeared, simple and direct.\n[Do you wish to teleport now?]\n[YES / NO]\nFrom her vantage point within the cosmic network, Thea’s consciousness was a celestial war room. Before her, a holographic map of 5.5 billion worlds shimmered, a sea of screaming alerts. With the cold, flawless logic of a supercomputer through her Omni-Cognition talent, she began her duty.\nThe worlds were categorized, their status denoted by a simple color. Green, for the few thousand worlds whose own lifeforms were strong enough to handle the crisis. Red, for the planets on the absolute brink of collapse, where the beast tides were an apocalyptic force. And in between, billions of worlds colored Orange and Yellow, teetering on the edge.\nHer strategy was instant and absolute. The Red worlds were a task for the demigods. The Orange and Yellow worlds would be the proving ground for her chosen heroes.\nOn a world of molten rock and obsidian mountains, the beast tide was a living earthquake. Colossal, magma-skinned creatures, driven mad by the vanishing mana, trampled cities of stone under their burning hooves. Here, there was no need for wits or strength. This world needed a grand presence to overwrite the fear in their mind.\nCerberus, the Guardian of the Netherworld, appeared. He did not fight. He did not speak. He simply stood, and the very air around him grew cold and heavy with the scent of death and judgment. A wave of pure, primal terror, far more potent than their own panicked fear, washed over the rampaging beasts.\nThe stampede faltered, the roars of rage turning into whimpers of submission. They were a force of nature, but he was the embodiment of its end. The chaos froze in its tracks, quelled not by force, but by a fear so profound it overwrote all others fear.\nOn a different Red world, one of beautiful, crystalline forests being shattered by stampeding diamond-shelled behemoths, the solution was the polar opposite.\nSugata, the demigod of peace, appeared, sitting in a simple lotus position in the path of the charge. He did not exude terror, but a boundless, all-encompassing serenity.\nHis Virtuous Body emitted an aura of such profound peace that it soothed the world’s frantic, terrified heartbeat. The rampaging beasts slowed, their eyes losing their panicked red glow, and the apocalyptic stampede gently settled into a grazing herd, their fear forgotten.\nAs the demigods handled the most extreme cases, the apostles were also helping in stopping the beasts from destroying the planets. The chosen heroes arrived on the front lines of a billion other worlds.\nLux materialized in a world of breathtaking jungles. The beasts here were elegant, panther-like creatures whose fur shimmered with magical energy. They were beautiful, but their panic was turning their home into a whirlwind of destructive light.\nLux didn’t fight the stampede; he conducted it. With a graceful wave of his hands, he wove grand illusions. Shimmering walls of light rose from the jungle floor, gently herding the creatures away from populated settlements.\nHe conjured the phantom scent of a flower that induced calm, its magical pollen settling over the panicked beasts like a gentle rain. His was a battle of finesse and control, a symphony of magic that saved a world without shedding a single drop of blood.\nRagnok appeared on a rugged, volcanic world, where brutish, rock-skinned monsters were tearing down mountainsides in their terror. His approach was not subtle. It was the approach of a king. He did not fight alone; he created an army.\nHis voice, empowered by his Reality Talk talent, was not a suggestion; it was a law. \"STAND YOUR GROUND! FORM A LINE!\" he roared at the terrified local lifeforms. His words were a spell of pure command, overriding their fear with a surge of courage and discipline.\nHe organized them, turning a panicked mob into a shield wall, and led them in a direct, brutal confrontation that pushed the tide of monsters back into the volcanic wastes where they could do no harm.\nAnd in a murky swamp world teeming with venomous, skittering creatures, Kael arrived. He was not a mage-prince or a king. He was a survivor. He melted into the environment, a ghost in the marsh. He used the terrain to his advantage, setting cunning traps, creating diversions, and fighting with a gritty, desperate efficiency.\nHe was not elegant; he was brutally effective, a lone hunter who understood that survival was not about grand gestures, but about doing whatever it takes to win.\nAcross a billion worlds, the tide was turning. A million different heroes, each with their own unique talents and methods, were pushing back the chaos.\nThis all was happening, when Sunny was still absorbing all the mana from the surroundings, if he stopped, then the problem would have solved very easily, as Thea can just manifest mana into these worlds, but no, Sunny was still absorbing, even if she manifested mana, it will just be sucked dry by him.",

      "content": "Chapter 140: Ch 140 : The price of Power\nThe Pantheon’s private God Chat was a storm of panicked messages and frantic strategizing. The sudden, universe wide mana drain had thrown billions of worlds into chaos.\nZir: \"Thea confirmed it. The Boss is breaking through to the next grade!\" Zir’s message landed like a thunderclap, bringing a moment of stunned silence to the chat.\nAsura: \"Thea?\" he questioned, the name unfamiliar to him as a newcomer.\nReflection: \"It’s the name of the system we all use,\" Reflection clarified patiently.\nApolo: \"What kind of breakthrough causes a cataclysm of this scale?!\" Apolo asked, his mind reeling. He couldn’t imagine a power so vast it could suffocate a billion worlds just by a breakthrough.\nZir: \"It’s the Boss, breaking through from A-Grade to S-Grade Mage.\" As one of Sunny’s closest associates, Zir spoke with an air of authority and inside knowledge.\nAsura: \"Just from A-Grade to S-Grade can cause such a disaster?\" Asura typed, his tone a mix of awe and dark humor. \"Then what happens when he reaches SS-Grade? Will he absorb the mana from the entire multiverse?\" He meant it as a joke, but as he reread his own words, a chilling thought settled in his mind: it was entirely possible.\nZir: \"My demigods are already working on containing the beast tides on my worlds. What about you all?\"\nThe chat flooded with stories of struggle.\nHerem: \"I have only a single demigod, and she’s overwhelmed. My world is a world with a lots of floating islands, and the flying monsters are crashing into them like living meteors. But just as a city was about to fall, five heroes appeared from a portal. They said they were believers of the Boss, sent to help.\"\nMaya: \"Same here! My world is subterranean, a network of glowing crystal caverns. The beast tide is a swarm of giant burrowing insects, and they caused a cave-in, trapping thousands of my people. I was about to spend my own faith to save them, but these heroes arrived just in time.\"\nRoman: \"I was also thinking of using my faith, but I guess I will wait for these heroes to arrive. I need to save what I have for my next demigod.\"\nAs tales of heroism and relief filled the chat, a single message cut through the cooperative spirit like a splash of cold, cynical acid.\nJoker: \"Can’t even handle this much trouble? And you all call yourselves Gods?\"\nThe chat fell silent. In his private, isolated solar system, Joker felt it. It wasn’t a trickle of faith; it was a tsunami. A trillion points of divine energy, harvested from the frustration and indignation of the million Gods he had just mocked, crashed into his soul.\n\"A trillion?\" Joker whispered, a grin spreading across his face. He looked out at his single, lonely planet. \"Will those million Gods try to kill me by invading my territory now?\" This was precisely why he had demanded an isolated system when joining the Pantheon; his talent was a magnet for enemies.\nRoman: \"@Raven, is your petition to remove Joker still active? I’m signing it right now. This big mouth should be removed!\"\nBut Joker had already closed the chat. His mind was consumed by the intoxicating rush of his newfound fortune. He would create more demigods, powerful warriors to send into the Realm of Advancement, and he would do it with the faith of the very people he had just insulted.\nWhile the chosen ones battled across billions of worlds, and the demigods held the beasts down in the planets marked with red color, their creator finally stirred.\nSunny opened his eyes. The universe seemed to snap into a new, sharper focus. The raw, untamed power of an S-Grade Mage now hummed in his veins, a deep and resonant chord.\nIn the same instant, the memories of his three watcher clones flooded his mind, a perfect, instant replay of the chaos his breakthrough had unleashed.\nHe was shocked for a second, a flicker of his old human self taken aback by the sheer scale of the disruption. Then, a slow, responsible smile spread across his face.\n\"Thea,\" he commanded, his voice calm and absolute, \"I am transferring five trillion faith points to you. Use them. For every world they protected, gift each of the chosen ones an SS-Grade artifact of their own choice. For the demigods of Veridia, give them one billion merits for every world they personally saved. I will take care of the Gods myself.\"\n[Yes, Master.] Thea replied, and like a perfect machine, her consciousness began executing the complex web of transactions.\nSunny opened the Pantheon chat.\nCosmos: \"I am sorry for the disturbance my breakthrough caused to your worlds.\"\nHis simple apology immediately quelled the lingering chaos.\nAsura: \"It was not a big thing, Boss. The demons have caused us far more disturbance than this. At least, apart from some beasts and monsters, no other lifeform lost their life in my world.\"\nEster: \"Yes, Boss. My world suffered a few casualties, but it is nothing we cannot handle. We will give them a good place in the afterlife.\" Two more Gods quickly shared their stories. One, a God whose world was a vast desert, explained how his scorpion-like people had bravely defended their oasis cities.\nAnother, whose world was a single, planet-spanning ocean, described how her aquatic lifeforms had fought off enraged sea leviathans. The sentiment was the same: they had suffered, but they had endured.\nCosmos: \"Thea will calculate all of your losses and offer you discounts in the Cosmic Shop accordingly for the entire next day. As for the lifeforms who perished, they will be given the chance to be reborn. They can even choose to become an apostle under a demigod, if the demigod is willing.\"\nHe typed his final message and closed the chat. The group once again erupted, not with panic, but with joyous praise. The petition to remove Joker was lost in a sea of gratitude. The benefits of their leader’s grace far outweighed the sting of a single god’s mockery.\nSunny leaned back on his throne. He had compensated the Gods and the fallen lifeforms. But a final thought nagged at him. ’What about the beasts and monsters that suffered the most during all this?’ They were his creations too. With a quiet sigh and a simple wave of his hand, he unleashed ten trillion of his faith points.\nIt was not a violent surge, but a gentle, divine rain that fell across Veridia and the 5.5 billion worlds of his Pantheon. It was a wave of pure life energy that refilled the mana of every planet, soothed every panicked heart, and healed the very worlds themselves.\nThis was the price of Power, a price that Sunny paid without any second thoughts.",

      "content": "Chapter 141: Ch 141 : Monopoly Once again\n\"Fifteen trillion faith points,\" Sunny murmured in the quietness of his God space, a low whistle escaped his lips.\nHe ran the numbers again. Five trillion for the rewards to his demigods and heroes, and another ten trillion to pour the stolen lifeblood of mana back into a billion worlds. \"This breakthrough costed me a fortune.\"\nHe leaned back on his throne, a thoughtful expression on his masked face. His income from the Cosmic Shop and the God Chat was immense, but the discount he had offered to the Pantheon as compensation was now slowing his earnings. He needed a new, massive revenue stream to fund his ever-growing ambitions.\n\"I didn’t realize a simple breakthrough would be so catastrophic,\" he mused. \"Otherwise, I would have just used a portal and done it in Kairos’s abandoned world.\" He chuckled at the petty, vengeful thought, but then the joke sparked something else. A thought, sharp and brilliant as a shard of a shattered star, pierced his mind.\n\"Magic Affinity... Blessings...\" he whispered, the two concepts beginning to connect in a way they never had before.\nHe knew the fundamental rule of his Blessing talent: it only worked down the ladder of power. A God could bless a demigod, and a demigod could bless a mortal.\nIt was a one-way street. For the longest time, Sunny had assumed that meant Gods themselves could not be blessed.\nBut the movie of the past, his journey through the age of Adam, had taught him something crucial. There was a hierarchy even among the Gods. The ancient, Void-born Gods like Adam and himself stood at the absolute pinnacle. Below them were the countless Gods of Laws and Faith.\nIf the Blessing talent worked on hierarchy, then he, a natural God born from the Void, stood at the very top of the pyramid. The implications of that simple fact were staggering. A grand, audacious, and ridiculously profitable plan began to form in his mind.\nHe needed a test subject.\n\"Zir,\" he said, his voice echoing through Thea’s network. A portal, shimmering with cosmic energy, tore open in his God space.\nA moment later, Zir tumbled through with all the grace of an excited puppy chasing a ball. \"Greetings, Big Boss!\" he chirped, his eyes already darting around, trying to guess the reason for the summons. \"Is it a new game? A gift? Or do you need me to go rough someone up for you in the God Chat?\"\nSunny couldn’t help but laugh at his friend’s shameless enthusiasm. He knew Zir was only half-joking. But this was no game. This was an experiment that could change the very fabric of their universe.\n\"Zir, my friend, I am very happy with everything you’ve done,\" Sunny began, his tone warm and sincere. \"You supported me from the start, you fought for my reputation, and you’ve helped maintain order in the Pantheon. You are a true brother.\"\nZir’s playful demeanor softened, a genuine warmth spreading across his face.\n\"So today,\" Sunny continued, a mysterious smile in his voice, \"I want to give you something in return.\"\n\"A gift? For me?\" Zir’s eyes widened, his shameless excitement returning in full force. \"What is it? A new demigod? An SSS-Grade artifact? Don’t keep me in suspense, Boss, give it to me!\"\nSunny simply shook his head and gestured for Zir to come closer. He placed a hand on Zir’s head, closed his eyes as if chanting a silent, sacred mantra, and unleashed his Divine Blessing talent, pouring a single, potent concept into his friend’s soul: Magic Affinity.\nFor Zir, the world dissolved. It wasn’t a physical touch; it was as if the universe had reached into his very being with a gentle but irresistible hand and rewritten a fundamental line of his code.\nA tidal wave of pure, conceptual energy washed over him. When the sensation faded, he opened his eyes, and the world was... more. He could see the shimmering threads of mana that wove through the cosmos, the faint, glowing auras of distant planets, and the vibrant life energy pulsing from Veridia.\n\"What is this?\" he gasped, his voice filled with awe. \"Some kind of perception talent?\"\n\"It worked,\" Sunny said, a note of pure triumph in his voice as he watched the hundred million faith points vanish from his reserves.\n\"What worked? You mean you weren’t sure?\" Zir’s face turned pale, his eyes wide with a comical look of terror.\n\"No, no, I was just expressing my excitement that it worked so well,\" Sunny lied smoothly, trying to divert his friend’s attention. \"So, what do you think?\"\n\"I can see... everything,\" Zir whispered. \"But I don’t feel anything else. What talent did you give me?\" He already knew about the concept of blessings from Sunny’s explanation of Heaven and Hell, but he couldn’t guess what this was.\n\"It’s Magic Affinity,\" Sunny said, watching his friend’s reaction closely. \"Now you can learn the techniques of your elves. You can truly walk the path of a mage.\"\nZir was dumbfounded. His mouth fell open, his mind completely unable to process the words. He, a God, who had never been born with the ability, could now learn magic? It was a miracle, a gift so profound it shattered his understanding of his own limitations.\n\"Close your mouth, you look stupid,\" Sunny chuckled. While Zir was rebooting his divine consciousness, Sunny was already scaling up his operation.\nHe used his Cloning ability, the faith cost a distant concern. First, the tenth clone for one hundred billion. Then, the eleventh for a staggering one trillion.\nHe then addressed one of his magic-practicing clones. His own S-Grade breakthrough had been a cosmic disaster; he couldn’t risk another. \"Your work is changing,\" he commanded. The clone nodded.\nThe remaining two will still learn and try to breakthrough to the SS-Grade, but Sunny knew it will take time, until then he can figure something out.\nJust then, Reflection and Nyx arrived through the portal.\n\"Zir,\" Sunny said, turning to his still-stunned friend. \"Type this in the Pantheon Chat: any God who wishes to purchase the Magic Affinity talent can apply through their system. The price is one hundred and five million faith points. And they can pay after they receive the talent.\"\nHe then turned to his other two friends. And was about to give them the magic affinity too, but suddenly he heard a voice, \"Boss, I don’t have that much faith,\" Nyx said, her voice timid, knowing that friendship and business were often two different things.\n\"What are you saying?\" Sunny’s voice softened. \"For you three, it’s a gift.\" He placed his hands on their heads, and in two more flashes of divine light, bestowed upon them the miracle of magic.",

      "content": "Chapter 142: Ch 142 : True Beauty Pill\nZir’s announcement hit the Pantheon’s God Chat like a bolt of lightning. The digital space, usually a mix of strategic discussions and pleas for help, erupted into a wild, joyous festival.\n\"MAGIC AFFINITY?! FOR US?!\"\n\"Is this real? I don’t have to rely on divine intervention for every little thing anymore?\"\n\"105 million faith... I don’t have it now, but I will grind for it! This is the opportunity of a lifetime!\"\nWhile millions celebrated, one God in his private, isolated solar system was not celebrating. He was calculating.\n​Joker leaned back on his throne, a cynical but deeply impressed smirk on his face. He watched the registration numbers for the Magic Affinity blessing climb on his system panel, the count already soaring past ten million. He then pulled up the price Zir had announced: one hundred and five million faith points.\n​A slow whistle escaped his lips as his mind performed the breathtakingly large calculation. \"Ten million registrations... at one hundred and five million a pop...\" he murmured to the emptiness of his God space. \"That’s... one quadrillion and fifty trillion... in gross revenue.\"\n​\"Even if his profit margin is only one percent, he’s still clearing over a trillion faith from this single move.\" A genuine respect filled him. This wasn’t just a miracle; it was the single most successful product launch in the history of the multiverse.\n​\"The man isn’t just a god,\" Joker mused, pulling up the registration page himself. \"He’s a damn monopoly.\" He clicked the button to apply. Power was an investment, and today, God Cosmos was the only stock worth buying. He had his own methods for earning faith, but even he couldn’t pass up a guaranteed, permanent upgrade to his own potential..\nElsewhere, Strategist stood before a holographic map of the multiverse, his mind a whirlwind of possibilities. He saw a chessboard where every piece belonging to the Pantheon had just been granted the ability to move like a queen.\nThis wasn’t just a power-up for individual Gods; it was a fundamental strategic shift. A Pantheon where every member could cultivate their own mages, develop their own spells, and fuel their technology with mana was a civilization that would advance at an exponential rate.\nSunny hadn’t just given them a new weapon; he had fundamentally changed the rules of the game in their favor. With a calm, decisive click, he too registered.\nAnd in his own quiet God space, Asura stood before the pulsating divine embryo he had recently purchased. He looked at his own hands, as if seeing them for the first time.\nFor a long time, they had been the hands of a God cursed to profit from evil. But now... now they could learn to weave spells of light, to create, to heal.\nThe Magic Affinity talent was more than just a new power; it was a path to redemption, a way to build his world on creation, not on the suffering his innate talent craved. With a heart full of profound, quiet gratitude, he registered, feeling like a pilgrim who had just been granted a sacred gift.\n\"Ten million registrations already,\" Sunny noted, the number displayed on Thea’s panel. His mind did the quick, thrilling math. \"A five-million-point profit margin per God... that’s fifty trillion faith points right there.\" He thought of his other unique talents; Comprehension, Cloning, Intuition etc. The potential for profit was truly limitless.\nHe assigned the monumental task of bestowing the blessings to three of his clones. Then, with a wave of his hand and a surge of his Divine Command, he created a new subspace. \"Let time in this realm be accelerated by ten thousand times,\" he decreed. The space, small as it was, warped to his will without a significant drain on his faith.\nThis would be the Realm of Blessings, a divine factory for mass-producing miracles. With three clones working around the clock in a realm where time flowed like a raging river, they could bless all ten million Gods in less than an hour.\n\"I am going to earn fifty trillion faith in a single hour?\" Sunny mused. The income from selling Divine Embryos had been a temporary boom. This, however, was a sustainable, ever-growing enterprise.\nWhile the Gods of the Pantheon celebrated, on the other side of the universe, a goddess seethed.\n\"That... Cosmos... is interesting,\" Kitsune purred, licking her lips with a predatory grace. She knew Thea’s system could be watching, so her words were deceptively calm, but her thoughts were a storm of jealous fury. ’Just you wait,’ she thought, her eyes burning with ambition. ’When I get my hands on all the SSS-Grade treasures, I will make you my personal slave.’\nshe was still jealous of the fact that he could have multiple DemiGods, while she can only have one.\nHer patience had run out. She sent a sharp, mental command to her demigod. \"Sparrow, do not wait any longer. Take the True Beauty Pill and deliver it to me. Then, go for the Pill of Life.\"\nIn the Realm of Advancement, Sparrow’s handsome face hardened with resolve. \"Yes, Master.\" He shot from the shadows, a golden blur moving towards the glowing pill. But just as he was about to reach it, the very air around him solidified. A swirling vortex of wind trapped him, holding him suspended in place.\n\"Who are you?\" a voice, like the whisper of a gale, echoed around him. From the wind itself, the formless demigod of ’Snatcher’ manifested.\n\"I am the demigod of the Goddess Kitsune,\" Sparrow declared. With a minor flex of his power, a wave of pure light erupted from his body, shattering the wind prison. The force of the blast sent the wind spirit demigod tumbling back through the air.\n\"Where do you think you are going?\" Sparrow’s voice was cold. He raised a hand, and the very light of the realm bent to his will, forming a shimmering, inescapable cage around the spirit.\n\"Let go of me!\" the wind spirit cried, sending a desperate prayer to its master. In his God space, Snatched sighed. He had known his demigod was outmatched. With a heavy heart, he initiated a video call to Kitsune.\n\"Snatcher, what do you need me for?\" Kitsune’s voice was a mask of sweet, feigned innocence.\n\"Lady Kitsune,\" Snatcher began, forcing the humility into his voice. \"Can you please ask your demigod to release my wind spirit?\"\n\"Why should I?\" she replied, her tone righteous. \"I created him, but his life is his own. I do not command his every action.\"\nLiar, Snatcher thought, but he kept his face calm. \"Of course, Lady Kitsune. Your righteousness knows no bounds. Then, what does your demigod require for my demigod’s freedom?\"\n\"Let me contact him,\" Kitsune said, pausing for a dramatic second before continuing. \"He says he wants one billion cosmic points. And the help of your demigod in securing a few more SSS-Grade treasures.\"\nI knew it, Snatcher thought, his heart sinking. He checked his reserves. \"I only have one hundred million faith, which is one hundred million cosmic points. I cannot pay your demigod’s price,\" he said, his voice laced with desperation. \"But I can accept the second request. My demigod will serve him.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 143: Ch 143 : A Little King\nWhile the Gods of the Pantheon basked in the light of their leader’s new blessings, the mortals under their care were facing trials of their own.\nIn the Realm of Advancement, the Kingdom of Solara was a testament to rapid, explosive growth. Twenty-four sprawling cities, connected by wide, stone-paved roads, now stood where there had once been only untamed wilderness.\nThe air hummed with the quiet, powerful thrum of mana-powered vehicles, gifts of engineering transported from Veridia.\nSturdy, oversized jeeps, perfect for the broad shoulders of the half-orcs, rumbled alongside the sleek, silent cars favored by the humans.\nOnly the spirit races remained on foot; the technology to create vehicles that could withstand the intense heat of a fire spirit or the gale-force winds of an air spirit was still a distant dream, but the engineers of Solara experimented tirelessly every day.\nBut this vibrant growth had come at a price. In the grand meeting hall of the capital’s palace, a heavy silence hung in the air. Ragnok, the half-orc king, sat on his throne, his expression grim as he listened to the heated debate among his ministers.\n\"We cannot continue like this!\" a war-hungry minister, a burly half-orc with a scarred face, slammed his fist on the stone table. \"They have sent yet another warning! They spit on our kingdom! They want war, and I say we give it to them!\"\n\"And fight them with what?\" countered a human minister, his face pale with worry. \"Our kingdom was only established a few days ago in the grand scheme of things. Our people are still settling in. We need peace to build our foundations, not a bloody war that will cost us thousands of lives we cannot spare.\"\nThe argument raged. The source of their conflict was a powerful, native race of the Realm of Advancement—the Gorgons. Their expansion into the fertile Sapphire Plains had encroached upon the Gorgons’ ancestral territory, and the proud, demonic race had made their displeasure known.\n\"Those Gorgons are arrogant!\" the war minister snarled. \"How dare they try to kick us out of our new home!\"\n\"Our new home?\" Ragnok’s voice, deep and calm, cut through the angry chatter, silencing the entire hall. He rose from his throne, his gaze sweeping over his ministers.\n\"What would you do if a foreign power appeared and built a new kingdom in your territory? A territory you and your ancestors have lived in for thousands of years?\"\nThe war minister’s face flushed with shame, and he lowered his gaze. \"I... I was wrong, my King.\"\n\"Fighting is not the solution to everything,\" Ragnok declared. \"I will handle this myself. I will go and meet with the matriarch of the Gorgon race.\"\n\"My King, that would be far too dangerous!\" another minister pleaded. \"They are a demonic race, after all! And their matriarch, she is...\"\n\"Do you think a race with the heart of a true demon would send a warning letter?\" Ragnok countered, his analysis sharp and clear. \"No. They would have simply attacked us. They are proud, but they are not mindless beasts.\"\nSeeing no further objections, he stood. \"So, it is settled.\"\nHe walked from the hall to the quiet of his private chambers and sank into a chair with a heavy sigh.\nHe looked out the grand window at the bustling city below, a marvel of his people’s resilience. The life of a king was not the luxury he had once imagined.\nIt was a constant, crushing weight of responsibility, a ceaseless worry for the future of his people. There was no time to simply enjoy it.\nAs if sensing his burden, a familiar chime echoed in his ears.\n[A New Mission Has Been Unlocked!]\n[Mission Title: Save the Lost Souls]\n[Mission Grade: S]\n[Description: The Gorgon race, though powerful, has been isolated from the outside world for eons. Their pride has become a cage.\nMake the matriarch of the Gorgon race see the wisdom of joining the Kingdom of Solara and its allies.]\n[Reward: 10x Lottery Spins (Chance to obtain an SS-Grade item)]\n\"A chance to get an SS-Grade item?\" Ragnok’s eyes lit up. His gaze fell upon the two of the five artifacts he had received as a reward for solving the beast tide.\nOn his neck, a pendant hummed with a cool energy, an SS-Grade artifact that drastically reduced the mana cost of his spells, especially his reality-bending Reality Talk talent.\nLeaning against the wall was his greatsword, a colossal blade as long as he was tall, an SS-Grade weapon that pulsed with its own formidable power.\nThese tools had made him a king. This new mission could make his kingdom an empire.\nWith his resolve hardened, he stood and walked from the palace.\nHe channeled his magic, and with a surge of power, he launched himself into the sky, flying towards the Gorgon territory.\nAs he approached their lands, a colossal mental wave, a psychic force powerful enough to shatter a kingdom, crashed against his mind.\nIt was a vision of his own body turning to stone, of his bones crumbling to dust over a thousand silent years.\nBut Ragnok did not flinch. His will, forged in the fires of a dead world and shielded by his own divine gifts, held firm.\n\"I do not know if I should call you brave or foolish for coming here alone, little king,\" a charming, sibilant voice echoed directly in his mind.\nRagnok landed gently before a massive cavern entrance, his gaze respectful but unafraid. \"Greetings, Demigod Medusa.\"\n\"Greetings, mortal,\" the voice replied, a hint of amusement in its tone. \"What is the reason for your visit? If you have come to apologize, then I forgive you. You and your people are free to leave my lands and find somewhere else to build your little cities.\"\nFrom his God space, Sunny watched the scene unfold on Thea’s broadcast, a curious smile on his face. He wanted to see what surprise this reincarnated God, his chosen champion, could pull off.\n\"I have indeed come to apologize for our trespass,\" Ragnok said calmly. \"But I have no desire to leave. It has taken my people many years to build these twenty-four cities. We will not abandon our homes.\"\n\"If that is your only reason, then it is a trivial matter,\" Medusa’s voice replied, dismissive and arrogant. \"You should know that we Gorgons are gifted with earth magic. Shifting your little cities, or even creating new ones for you, is no great effort. Of course,\" she added, \"we would require a suitable payment in mana stones for our trouble.\"\n\"I have a different proposal for you, Demigod Medusa,\" Ragnok said, his voice steady, his gaze fixed on the dark cavern. \"One that I believe will be far more beneficial to us both. Would you like to hear it?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 144: Ch 144 : An irresistible Offer\n\"Oh?\" Medusa’s voice echoed in Ragnok’s mind, a sound as smooth and dangerous as a serpent gliding over polished stone. \"And what is this grand plan of yours, little king?\"\nRagnok did not answer immediately. Instead, he took a moment to truly look at the Gorgon territory, at the dark, damp caves that served as their homes.\n\"I see the strength of your race, Demigod Medusa,\" he began, his voice respectful but firm. \"You could easily be the masters of an entire empire. So why do you choose to live in these few caves, hidden away from the world?\"\nA low, amused hiss was her reply. \"It is peaceful here. Why would I wish to go anywhere else?\"\n\"Is it peace, or is it a cage?\" Ragnok countered gently. \"Do you truly believe your people wish to spend their entire lives in darkness? Do they not dream of seeing the open sky, of building cities of their own?\" He raised his hand, and a system screen, visible only to the two of them, materialized in the air. It showed a vibrant, bustling world.\n\"This was my previous home, Solara. A world destroyed by the very God who was meant to protect it.\"\nMedusa’s serpentine hair stilled as she gazed at the before-and-after images—a thriving planet reduced to a dead, silent rock. \"How does one offend a God so deeply?\" she mused, her tone one of cold curiosity. To her, the fall of a mortal world was not a tragedy; it was simply an event.\n\"We did not offend him,\" Ragnok explained, a flicker of old pain in his eyes. \"We simply chose to leave a home where he allowed demons to slaughter our people without lifting a finger.\"\n\"And destroying an entire world seems like a reasonable response... So why are you showing me this?\" Medusa asked, her golden, reptilian eyes narrowing, trying to discern his true motive.\n\"I am showing you that even the strongest can fall,\" Ragnok said, his voice ringing with a hard-won truth. \"You can protect your tribe from me, from other mortals. But what if a God stands against you? What if the enemy is one you cannot possibly defeat? Strength alone is not enough to survive in this cosmos.\"\nMedusa chuckled, a dry, rustling sound. \"Mortal, you seem to be forgetting where we are. This is the Realm of Advancement. Even if you have a God at your back, his power is unreachable here. Your God who destroyed your world cannot save you now.\"\n\"I serve another God now,\" Ragnok stated calmly. \"A God who does not forget his people when they are in danger. He connected our fledgling kingdom with the grand empire of his own lifeforms. He has traded with us, armed us, and given us the strength to defeat every demon that has crossed our path.\"\n\"Aren’t you... blasphemous?\" Medusa’s voice was laced with a mocking superiority. \"Leaving your creator for a new master. Is that not why your old world was destroyed? And even if this new God is better, his only goal is to harvest faith from you. That is the nature of Gods, little king.\"\nA fire ignited in Ragnok’s eyes. He stood tall, the kingly authority that had been tempered by diplomacy now blazing forth. \"I am not blasphemous,\" he declared, his voice raw with an emotion that transcended the simple politics of gods and mortals.\nThe memories flooded his mind; of being a half-orc whelp, treated like dirt, traded like cattle, left to starve in a forgotten wasteland.\n\"I was born without the help of any God,\" he said, his voice cracking slightly before hardening into unbreakable steel. \"I would have died in that wasteland if not for the grace of God Cosmos. This life I have, this kingdom I have built, was a gift from a God who saw worth in a dying half-orc when no one else did.\" He looked Medusa directly in her psychic eyes, his conviction an unshakeable force.\n\"So yes, he may have his ulterior motives. All great beings do. He could be listening to us right now. But I will say this: this life of mine was given by him, and I will fight anyone and anything to protect his dignity and the lives of my people.\"\nFrom his throne, Sunny couldn’t help but laugh. \"Damn,\" he said to the empty God space. \"Saying your God has an ulterior motive right to his face. This boy is truly a reincarnation of someone from Endor.\" He watched the 3D projection of the scene with a growing sense of pride.\nHe saw Medusa, her beauty as legendary as the myths of his home world, her hair a writhing mass of living serpents, her expression for the first time showing something other than arrogance: respect.\n\"And I do not know about faith,\" Ragnok continued, \"but I know about this.\" He let the aura of his two SS-Grade artifacts flare for a single, breathtaking moment.\nThe pendant on his neck hummed with a power that seemed to warp the very mana in the air, and his greatsword radiated a pressure so immense that the snakes on Medusa’s head recoiled, hissing in alarm. \"I think these gifts are worth more than any faith my kingdom’s people could ever provide him\"\nThe snakes on Medusa’s head, which had been hissing with suspicion, fell silent. Her golden eyes widened, the ancient arrogance within them replaced by a single, burning emotion: hunger. Not for food or territory, but for a possibility she had long believed impossible.\n\"You have gained my interest, mortal,\" she hissed, her voice now stripped of its mocking tone. \"Now, tell me. What is your offer?\"\n\"My God,\" Ragnok said simply. \"That is my offer. Join my kingdom, and through us, join the Cosmic Empire. The treatment you receive from my God will surely not disappoint you. If there is anyone in this universe who can give you and your people the strength you truly desire, it is him, and only him.\"\n\"How can anyone give strength?\" Medusa asked, the concept alien to her. \"Is strength not something one must take for themselves?\"\n\"He can gift talents,\" Ragnok said calmly, delivering his final, irresistible blow. \"I was born with only two talents. I now possess more than ten. He can bestow new talents upon his followers. And more than that, his lifeforms can learn new talents, simply by putting their heart and hard work into a craft. A single talent can change the fate of a world, Demigod Medusa. You should know that better than anyone.\"\nMedusa was silent. Her mind, which had been a fortress of pride and isolation for millennia, was now reeling.\nThe promise of growth, of evolution, of becoming more than what she was, was a temptation she could not resist. Her voice, when she finally spoke, was not that of a demigod, but of a hopeful supplicant.\n\"Can... can I speak with your God?\"",

It is not for me to decide,\" Ragnok said, his voice a pillar of unwavering loyalty. He had opened the door; it was up to the gods to walk through it.\nMedusa looked at the half-orc king, a strange mix of respect and frustration in her golden, reptilian eyes.\nShe parted her lips to speak, to perhaps bargain or threaten, but the words died in her throat. The very air around them began to shimmer, the particles of reality itself seeming to vibrate with an unseen energy.\nFrom these countless points of light, a figure coalesced; a being cloaked in the cosmos, his face a mask of infinite night, his eyes two swirling galaxies of absolute authority.\nRagnok’s breath caught. He fell to his knees without a conscious thought, his head bowed low. He had stood before a demigod without flinching, but this was different. This was the presence of a true God, a being whose aura was the very fabric of the universe.\n\"Did you call me?\" Sunny’s voice was calm, yet it carried a dignity that resonated in their very souls.\nHe nodded once at the kneeling Ragnok.\nBefore addressing the demigod, he turned his attention to his faithful champion. He placed a hand on Ragnok’s head, and Ragnok felt a wave of energy, not of raw power, but of pure, crystalline clarity, wash over him.\nIt was as if a thousand locked doors in his mind had been blown open at once, revealing pathways of thought and understanding he never knew existed.\n[Ding! Congratulations, Host! You have received the blessing of God Cosmos]\n[Blessing Name: Comprehension (SS-Grade)]\nSunny’s own Divine Growth talent had already elevated his comprehension to the SS-Grade, and now, he shared a fragment of that power.\n\"Thank you, oh great God Cosmos,\" Ragnok whispered, his reverence now absolute.\nSunny left his kneeling champion and turned his cosmic gaze toward the dark cavern. \"Are you not coming out to meet me, Medusa?\" he asked, his voice echoing with a gentle calm. \"It was you who wished for this meeting, was it not?\"\nThe ground trembled. A brilliant pillar of emerald light erupted from the depths of the cave, and from within it, she emerged.\nIf her psychic presence was intimidating, her physical form was breathtaking. A beauty so profound it could make angels weep, crowned by a living halo of writhing, hissing serpents. She was a paradox of divine perfection and monstrous terror.\n\"Greetings, God Cosmos,\" Medusa said, bowing her head gracefully. She knew that even as a projection, this being held the power to decide the fate of her entire race.\nSunny nodded, getting straight to the point. His time was precious; his clones were tirelessly working to comprehend the Law of Manifestation, and he had no desire to waste a moment on pleasantries. \"What did you want to talk about?\"\nMedusa’s heart hammered against her ribs. This was the moment that would define the future for her people. \"I... I wish for my people to join the Cosmic Empire,\" she said, her voice steady despite the storm of hope and fear within her.\n\"Of course,\" Sunny replied simply. \"In time, I will send a new demigod to be the protector of your race. For now, you may join the Kingdom of Solara, or if you wish, create a kingdom of your own. The choice is yours.\"\nHis reasoning was simple yet calculatd. He needed the leaders of his races to be his own creations, beings bound by the absolute loyalty of a Divine Embryo.\nMedusa was a powerful, pre-existing piece on the board, but she was not one he had crafted himself.\nHe could bless her, but he could not fundamentally alter or upgrade her talents without an exorbitant cost of divine command. She could be a powerful ally, but not a core part of his inner circle.\nStill, a gift was in order. \"As this is our first meeting, you shall not leave empty-handed,\" Sunny declared. He focused his God’s Eye, and the very code of Medusa’s being became clear to him. He saw her power, her history, and the shackle that had defined her entire existence.\n[Talent Name: Petrification (SS-Grade)]\n[Description: Anyone other than the Gorgon race will be petrified upon seeing you.]\nA powerful curse disguised as a talent. It was this that had forced her and her people into a life of bitter seclusion, their every interaction with the outside world was a potential act of murder.\nThis was why she sent warning letters instead of waging war; she did not wish to turn undeserving souls into stone statues.\nSunny thought for a second, a plan forming in his mind. Then, he raised a hand, and it felt as if the entire universe went silent, leaning in to hear his next word.\nHis voice was not a shout, but a decree that resonated through the very fabric of reality. \"Let this curse be a weapon, not a cage. Let it be a choice, not a passive affliction. From this moment on, a Gorgon’s gaze will harm only those they choose to harm.\"\nThe cosmos shook. A tremor ran through the foundations of the multiverse, the sound of a universal law being broken, erased, and rewritten by a will powerful enough to command it.\nRagnok, still kneeling, looked up in absolute awe.\nAll this time, Sunny had been shielding him, showing him a mere image of Medusa through Thea’s particles. Had he seen her true form, he would have been turned to stone instantly.\nFor Medusa, the change was immediate and profound. For the first time in five hundred thousand years of her life, she felt... light.\nThe constant, heavy weight of her deadly aura, a power she had to suppress every second of her life, was simply gone.\nThe snakes on her head, once symbols of her deadly nature, felt... calm.\nHer composure shattered. She fell to her knees, not out of reverence this time, but out of sheer, overwhelming relief.\nTears streamed down her perfect face, washing away thousands of years of isolation and sorrow. Her race, who had been a prisoner of their own power since birth, were finally free.\nSunny felt the one trillion faith points drain from his reserves. It was an astronomical price. But as he watched the weeping demigod pledge her eternal, tear-filled loyalty, he knew it was the best bargain he had ever made. A new, powerful, and utterly devoted ally had just been added to the list of Demigods under him.",

But before he could vanish, a hesitant voice called out, filled with a desperate, fragile hope.\n\"God Cosmos... could I ask for another favor?\" Medusa stood before him, her earlier confidence replaced by the vulnerability of a supplicant.\nSunny’s projection stabilized. He chuckled internally; Thea’s analysis had already predicted this very request. \"Go on,\" he said, his tone patient. \"I do not know when we will meet again. It is better to listen to your favors while I can.\"\nMedusa’s face, a mask of resolve, lit up. She turned and ran back towards the deep darkness of her cave. She returned moments later, her immense strength straining as she carried a colossal, three-headed serpent made of cold, lifeless stone.\nThe statue was a monument to a brutal battle. One head was completely severed at the neck. The remaining two were scarred and broken, each with only a single, terrified eye remaining, the other socket a gaping scar.\n\"God Cosmos, this is my friend, Hessia,\" Medusa whispered, her voice cracking as she gently caressed the stone scales. Tears streamed down her face, and the living snakes in her hair seemed to weep with her, their hissing turning into soft, sorrowful sounds.\n\"She was with me since my birth,\" Medusa explained, her story a torrent of grief held back for three hundred thousand years. \"due to our matching strength she was immune to my curse, so she was the only one who could stay by my side. She was my only friend. But on that fateful day, when I was on the verge of my own breakthrough to the demigod realm, we were attacked by an S-Grade beast. Hessia... she protected me. She gave up her own chance to ascend, holding the beast back while my power surged.\"\nShe hugged the cold stone, the memory as fresh as if it were yesterday. \"But my breakthrough... my talent... it became too strong. While she was protecting me, my uncontrollable aura washed over her. She turned to stone, just as you see her now.\" Her voice broke.\n\"Can you... please, can you save her?\" she pleaded, her hesitation born from the three hundred thousand years of hopelessness she had endured. She didn’t even know if a soul still resided within the stone.\n\"Why should I?\"\nSunny’s voice was as cold and distant as a faraway star. The words hit Medusa like a physical blow, shattering the fragile hope in her heart. She looked up at him, her eyes pleading, a demigod reduced to a heartbroken child.\n\"You should be responsible for the things you do,\" Sunny continued, his tone absolute. \"Even if they were not in your control.\" He let the hard lesson sink in, a test of her resolve.\nThen, his voice shifted, the cold authority melting away, replaced by a power that seemed to command the heavens themselves.\n\"But what is the point of living if you cannot change your past mistakes?\" he declared, his voice no longer a question, but a divine decree. \"From this moment on, let the talent of the Gorgon race be rewritten! Let them have the power to revert the petrification they cause!\"\nThis time, the universe didn’t shake. It sang. A soft, harmonious chord resonated through reality as a single, cruel rule was gently erased from the cosmic rulebook, and a new one, one of mercy, was written in its place.\nThe act cost Sunny a staggering five hundred billion faith points. ’Divine Command is far too costly,’ he thought with an internal sigh.\nHe looked at Medusa, who was glowing with a new, ethereal light. \"Correct your mistakes,\" he said. \"I must get going. I have a few billion worlds to take care of.\" And with a magical whoosh, his projection vanished, leaving behind a demigod with a new gift and a mortal king in absolute awe.\nMedusa turned to the statue of Hessia, her hands trembling. She focused her will, her new, altered talent flowing from her.\nThe stone began to crack, not with the sound of breaking, but with the gentle whisper of life returning.\nFlesh and blood began to reform from the inside out, a miracle of divine mercy. A deep, ancient hiss echoed from within the stone, the first sound Hessia had made in three hundred thousand years.\n\"I have a healing pill here,\" Ragnok said, stepping forward and offering a shimmering, SS-Grade pill. \"Perhaps it can even grow back her head.\"\nMedusa accepted the gift without hesitation. She gently placed the pill in Hessia’s slowly reforming mouth. A wave of powerful vitality surged through the serpent’s body, her scales regaining their luster, her muscles coiling with newfound strength.\nShe hissed in joy, a sound of pure, unadulterated life. But her missing head and eyes did not return.\n\"I think... after so long, her body accepted its wounded state as its new, perfect form,\" Medusa reasoned, a hint of sadness in her voice.\n\"Yes, three hundred thousand years is a long time,\" Ragnok agreed with a solemn nod.\nMedusa looked from her recovering friend to the half-orc king who had made all of this possible.\nShe thought for a moment, and then, a demigod, a queen of her own ancient race, bowed deeply before a mortal. \"My King,\" she declared, her voice ringing with absolute conviction, \"I and my entire race will be under your care from now on.\"\n\"No, no, Medusa, you are a demigod!\" Ragnok protested, taking a step back. \"I am just a mortal. How can you serve under me? You should create your own kingdom.\"\n\"It is my choice to make,\" Medusa chuckled, a newfound lightness in her voice. \"Did you not hear what God Cosmos said? He instructed me to join a kingdom, and I choose yours.\"\n\"If it is the wish of the God, then... you can join,\" Ragnok finally conceded, his mind reeling. And in that moment, as he accepted the fealty of a being far more powerful than himself, something inside him snapped.\nHis Comprehension talent ignited. He finally understood.\nA king was not the strongest person in the kingdom. A king was a vessel, a focal point for the collective strength and loyalty of his people. By accepting the pledge of a demigod, his own mortal vessel had reached its breaking point. It was time to ascend.\nLight exploded from Ragnok’s form. The air crackled with raw power. His physical body, the half-orc shell that had carried him through a life of slavery and struggle, began to crack like sun-baked earth.\nThe cracks widened, revealing not blood, but pure, golden energy. Then, his mortal form shattered, dissolving into a maelstrom of light and power, a supernova of potential.\nFrom the heart of the storm, a new form began to emerge, larger, stronger, and radiating an unmistakable divine aura.\nHis mortal lifespan was burning away, replaced by the aura of immortality. He was not just breaking through; he was being reborn.",

      "content": "Chapter 147: Ch 147 : The Last Village\n[Master, your judgment was correct.]\n\"What happened?\" Sunny asked, his focus snapping away from the exhilarating, ever-climbing number of his faith reserves.\n[Master, Ragnok has broken through. He has ascended to the demigod realm. His breakthrough was tied to a concept he is calling the ’Law of the King’.]\n\"The Law of the King?\" Sunny leaned forward, a current of genuine curiosity flowing through him. \"Did he gain any new talents?\"\n[Yes, Master. A new innate talent with the potential to harm even a God, similar in concept to Sister Nova’s Charged Explosion.]\n\"Show me,\" Sunny commanded. ’Maybe I will copy this talent next time,’ he thought, his gaze fixed on the description that materialized before him.\n[Talent Name: King’s Authority]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: You can draw upon and wield the powers of any being under your rule, provided they have absolute loyalty in you. With a deeper understanding of the Law of the King, you can wield multiple powers simultaneously.]\n\"That’s... a truly awesome talent,\" Sunny breathed. The restrictions were immense, requiring absolute loyalty, but the potential was boundless.\nThis wasn’t just a talent for fighting; it was the very definition of kingship; a power that grew not from one’s own strength, but from the collective will and loyalty of those who followed. His next choice for Skill-Resonance was decided.\n\"Give him full access to the demigod System Shop and the merits system,\" Sunny ordered. \"But let him keep his lottery system as well. It has served him, and us, well.\"\nWith his champion’s ascension secured, Sunny turned his attention to his own operation. With a casual thought that would have bankrupted a lesser god for a thousand lifetimes, he spent ten trillion faith points and brought his twelfth clone into existence.\nThe new being, a perfect copy of himself, bowed silently and was immediately tasked with the most crucial long-term project: the comprehension of the Law of Manifestation.\nJust as he settled back, another notification from Thea arrived.\n[Master, Light Celestine is about to finish his teaching journey in Veridia. Should I open the portals for him to begin his work in the worlds of the other Gods?]\n\"Oh? Light,\" Sunny murmured. He focused his divine senses, his consciousness drifting down to Veridia, to a small, forgotten corner at the very edge of a continent, a place time had seemingly left behind.\nThe village was nestled in a valley carved by a wide river, a place of wood, stone, and quiet strength.\nIts buildings were sturdy huts made of dark, moss-covered timber and reinforced with smooth river rocks, smoke curling lazily from their thatched roofs.\nIn the center of the village stood a great long house, its entrance flanked by the skulls of massive, tusked beasts defeated by generations of hunters.\nThe air smelled of woodsmoke, damp earth, and roasting meat. This was a place of simple traditions and a deep, unshakable connection to the wild.\nIn a muddy pen near the village edge, a group of orc children were playing. Their laughter was a series of joyous grunts and squeals as they chased after a young, tusked boar-pup, a creature that looked like a furry, four-legged battering ram.\nThese boars were the village’s most prized companions; used for hauling lumber from the forest, guarding their homes, and, for the children, a source of endless, rough-and-tumble fun.\nWatching over them was the village head, Tether. He was a mountain of an orc, his broad shoulders and powerful arms covered in faded tattoos of clan symbols.\nBut despite his intimidating size, his eyes were kind, and his movements were deliberate and gentle as he sharpened a hunting spear.\nHe was the village’s anchor, a leader whose strength was matched by his wisdom.\nHis daughter, a cute little girl named Tiya, suddenly burst from their hut, her eyes wide. \"Father! There’s a human outside the village! He said he wanted to talk to the village head!\"\nTether’s brow furrowed in curiosity, not alarm. \"Oh, really? Perhaps he is lost. I will go and help him.\" He set his spear aside and walked towards the village entrance. He immediately saw it; a small, elegant wooden house that hadn’t been there that morning, standing in a clearing as if it had grown from the earth itself. He knew it belonged to the newcomer and walked towards it.\nHe raised a heavy fist to knock, but before his knuckles could touch the wood, the door swung open on its own. Inside, a handsome half-elf with a serene smile stood holding a tray with two steaming teacups.\n\"Welcome to my humble abode, Village Head,\" Light said, placing the tray on a small table.\n\"Hello, young friend,\" Tether replied, his gaze warm and polite. In the unified and safe culture of Veridia, a stranger was not a threat, but a potential friend.\n\"Hello, Village Head,\" Light returned the greeting, getting straight to the point with the confidence he’d gained over eighty years. \"I am a wandering teacher. I travel to the villages of Veridia that are disconnected from the great cities, helping them find their path.\"\nHe explained his mission: to check the talents of the youth and offer them the guidance needed to grow.\nTether’s kind eyes widened, a flicker of profound hope igniting within them. \"Can you... can you really check the talents of our people?\"\nThea’s system had connected their village to the wider world, but the ability to see one’s own status was a feature Sunny had deliberately withheld, a quiet act of grace to ensure that Light’s journey would be meaningful.\nFor this isolated village, a teacher like Light was a miracle.\n\"Yes, I can,\" Light said. He reached into his bag and pulled out a smooth, glowing blue orb.\n\"A talent appraising ball?\" Tether’s jaw dropped, his broad orcish mouth forming a perfect ’O’. This was a mythical object, a treasure he had only ever seen on the system’s news feeds.\nHe turned and bellowed, his voice echoing through the quiet village with a joy it hadn’t known in generations. \"Everyone! Come to the square! A blessing has arrived!\"\nThat day, the village of the quiet orcs became a festival of joyous noise. The largest boars were roasted over a massive bonfire.\nThe sounds of children’s laughter mixed with the astonished gasps of their parents. Children who had only ever expected a life of hunting and gathering suddenly saw paths to becoming mages, blacksmiths, or alchemists laid out before them.\nElders, who had long resigned themselves to their village’s isolation, wept openly, their tears carving paths through the dust on their weathered faces.\nIn the center of it all, Light sat with the children, the blue ball glowing in his hands, a quiet, satisfied smile on his face as he unlocked the potential of a generation, his eighty-year journey in Veridia will finally be complete in a month.",

      "content": "Chapter 148: Ch 148 : New generation\nThe village of the quiet orcs was no longer quiet. The air, usually thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, was now a joyous mix of roasting meat, woodsmoke, and the excited grunts of hundreds of orcs.\nIt was a festival born of pure, unexpected hope. In the center of it all, Light sat with the children, the talent appraising ball glowing in his hands like a captured star.\nHe had already identified a few interesting talents: a boy who could make plants grow slightly faster, a girl with an uncanny sense of direction. But now, he focused on a young orc whose ball had displayed the words [Healing Air].\n\"This talent of yours is meant for healing,\" Light explained, his voice calm and encouraging. \"As the name suggests, you can infuse the very air with your life force. Try it. Close your eyes, and imagine your own energy, your mana, flowing out and becoming one with the air you breathe.\"\nThe boy, a stocky child with earnest eyes, tried to concentrate on what Light had just instructed. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, a soft, green light began to emanate from his hands.\nIt wasn’t a solid spell, but a shimmering mist of glowing green particles that floated gently into the air. The particles drifted towards the crowd of watching villagers and, as if guided by an unseen intelligence, settled upon those who were old, ill, or injured.\nAn old warrior, his back bent from a century of battles, suddenly straightened up with a loud crack, a look of utter disbelief on his weathered face as a pain he had lived with for fifty years simply... vanished.\nA mother nursing a sick child watched in awe as the feverish flush on her infant’s cheeks began to fade. The healing was weak, a temporary relief, but it was a miracle nonetheless.\n\"See?\" Light said, patting the little orc’s shoulder. At his touch, the boy’s eyes snapped open, and he saw the looks of gratitude and wonder on the faces of his kin.\nA huge, never-ending smile stretched across his face. He had a gift. He was special.\n\"You just need to practice,\" Light joked, his voice full of warmth. \"Once you reach the S-Grade, or even become a demigod, you’ll be known far and wide. Don’t forget your old teacher at that time, okay?\" He winked and moved to the next child.\n\"Walkthrough,\" Light read from the ball. \"A vague name, but a wonderful ability.\" He walked to a nearby tree, and with a perfect, controlled pulse of mana, sliced a thick, solid piece of bark from its trunk. He returned and placed it upright on the ground.\n\"Now,\" he said to the child, a small, nervous-looking orc. \"Close your eyes. Imagine your body isn’t solid. Imagine it’s like the wind, like a ghost. And then, just walk straight.\"\nThe little fellow did as he was told, his small hands clenched in concentration. He took a hesitant step, then another, walking directly towards the slab of wood. The villagers held their breath, expecting a comical collision.\nBut a miracle happened. As the child’s foot touched the bark, it didn’t stop. It passed right through. His whole body followed, phasing through the solid wood as if it were nothing more than a curtain of smoke. He emerged on the other side completely unharmed.\nA collective gasp swept through the crowd, a sound like the wind being knocked out of a hundred powerful lungs at once.\nIn their world of solid, unyielding reality, they had just witnessed the impossible. They erupted in thunderous applause.\nThe child, startled by the noise, opened his eyes. \"What? What did I do?\" he asked, looking at the happy faces around him. His father rushed forward, sweeping him up into the air.\n\"You have an amazing talent, son!\" the father boomed with pride, explaining what had just happened.\nThe excited child immediately tried to do it again, running full-speed at the bark, and collided with it head-on with a loud thump.\nLight laughed. \"Ah, I forgot to tell you. You need to maintain your focus until you truly master it. And beware of the mana consumption. In the future, you might even be able to walk through walls.\"\nHe left the boy to practice and moved to the next child, a quiet orc who was nervously trying to hide his glowing ball. Light gently took it and read the words. \"Dark Magic Affinity.\" He looked at the child, who refused to meet his gaze, his shoulders slumped in shame.\n\"Are you sad because this talent sounds evil?\" Light asked gently. The little orc nodded rapidly.\nCurses and necromancy were things of nightmares, stories told to scare naughty children.\nLight looked down, so his eyes were level with the child’s. \"Listen to me,\" he said, his voice soft but firm. \"Is a river evil because it can flood? Is fire evil because it can burn? No. Power is just power. It is the hand that wields it that chooses its purpose. You can use this to curse your enemies, or you can use it to break the curses of others. The choice, little one, will always be yours.\"\nThe child looked up, a spark of understanding in his eyes. He tentatively held out his hand, and a small, swirling ball of black mana, shot through with veins of cool violet light, appeared in his palm.\nIt wasn’t scary. It was actually... kind of cool.\nLight’s ability to guide them so swiftly was a gift in itself. It was the S-Grade \"Learning Teacher\" blessing from Isiah, which amplified his teaching effectiveness a hundredfold, allowing him to turn complex concepts into simple, intuitive lessons.\nAs he finished with the last child, a familiar, high-pitched voice called out. \"Teacher! Teacher!\" It was Tiya, the chief’s daughter, running towards him, her cute dress and big orc eyes a combination that could melt a heart of stone. \"Check my talent, too! Check my talent, too!\"\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" Light laughed, holding out the talent appraising ball.\nTiya placed her tiny, chubby hands on the orb. For a second, nothing happened. Then, the ball glowed.\nBut it was not the steady, gentle blue of before. It was a deep, hungry violet, a color that seemed to absorb the light around it.\nLight’s smile froze on his face. The name of the talent pulsed with a quiet, terrifying potential.\n[Emotion Eater (A-Grade)]",

      "content": "Chapter 149: Ch 149 : Talent Farm\n\"Divine Library,\" Light’s thought was a sharp, urgent command, \"give me every detail you have on a talent named ’Emotion Eater’.\"\nInstantly, his mind was flooded with knowledge. It wasn’t just a dry description; it was a series of visions.\nHe saw the immense potential for good: a mind consumed by grief being brought back to peace, a warrior’s uncontrollable rage being siphoned away before a fatal mistake.\nBut he also saw the horrifying flip side: a victim, their joy and sorrow completely devoured, left as a walking, breathing husk with nothing behind the eyes.\n\"My worries were right,\" he thought, a cold knot tightening in his stomach. \"This is a double-edged sword. A sword that can heal or kill with equal ease.\"\nHe looked at Tiya, the small orc girl who was staring up at him with wide, innocent eyes, completely unaware of the monstrous power sleeping within her.\n\"Tiya,\" he said gently, \"you possess a talent that can help you grow strong very quickly. But it can also consume you if you do not learn to use it well.\"\n\"What does that mean?\" she asked, blinking her large, curious eyes. The entire village was now watching them, a silent, expectant crowd.\nLight gave a meaningful look to her father, the village chief.\nTether immediately understood. \"Teacher Light, you have traveled for so long and worked so hard for us today,\" he boomed, his voice a warm and steady presence. \"You must be tired. Please, come and rest in my home.\"\nLight nodded gratefully and followed the chief towards the largest house in the village. Tiya trotted alongside him, her small hand tugging at his robe. \"Teacher, what did you mean?\" she asked again, her curiosity unquenched.\n\"I will tell you when we reach your home,\" Light promised.\nInside the guest room, Light sat across from the massive orc chief, with Tiya perched on another chair between them.\n\"Village Chief,\" Light began, his tone serious, \"Tiya’s talent, Emotion Eater, allows her to devour the emotions of others. She could make someone completely emotionless, or she could eat a specific feeling, like anger or sadness.\" He paused, letting the weight of his next words sink in.\n\"If she eats too much, the person whose emotions are taken can become mentally unstable, their very soul fractured.\"\nTether pulled his daughter close, his massive arm a protective shield. \"What can we do?\" he rumbled, his voice thick with a father’s primal fear.\n\"Do not only look at the downside,\" Light reassured him, his voice calm and steady. \"As I said, power is a tool. She can use it to cure those who are emotionally unstable by eating away their excess feelings. And she can use it to become strong very, very quickly. It is a double-edged sword, capable of harming both the user and their opponent.\"\nHe looked at the worried father and then at the confused child. \"Don’t worry. For this, I will stay. I will personally teach her how to use her power with control and wisdom.\"\nAfter some more conversation, Light returned to his own small, magical house, his mind already formulating a new lesson plan.\nFor the next month, he became Tiya’s personal mentor, while also guiding the other children. He taught her not to devour, but to taste.\nHe taught her empathy, how to feel the emotions of others without being consumed by them, and how to use her power to bring balance, not emptiness.\nWhen his work was finally done, he stood at the edge of the village, said his farewells, and mounted his magnificent companion, Lily.\n\"Sigh... Lily, where should we go now?\" he said, his voice laced with a strange melancholy as they soared into the sky. His eighty-year journey across Veridia was over.\n\"Master, why don’t we go to the other worlds you spoke of?\" Lily’s voice chirped in his mind, a melodic sound that was a testament to the Divine Comprehension buff that now graced every living thing.\n\"We don’t have permission for that,\" Light sighed, lying back against her warm feathers. \"Demigod Isiah said that only when I break through to the demigod realm can I travel to the other worlds.\"\n\"So then just break through,\" Lily replied with the simple, carefree logic of a magical bird.\n\"Easy for you to say,\" Light laughed, though there was no humor in it. \"You just need to eat powerful things to get stronger. I have to comprehend a Law. But which Law? That is the real question.\"\nFrom his throne, Sunny watched this scene and knocked his head with his palm. \"Eighty years of teaching others, and he can’t teach himself what to do next,\" he groaned. \"The boy has all the comprehension in the world, and he’s still stupid.\"\n\"Thea,\" he commanded, \"give him a nudge. Plant some hints in the Divine Library, something that will guide him to his path. The Law of Learning, or Teaching, perhaps. He needs to find his own way, but a little push won’t hurt.\" He sighed again. His champions were powerful, but they required so much management.\nHe looked away from Veridia, his gaze shifting to his other grand project: Earth. Eight thousand years had passed there.\nIts technology had surpassed even that of his lost home, Endor by many times. Gleaming spires pierced the clouds, and silent vehicles crisscrossed the skies.\nBut the people... they were lost in a different way. Many were immersed in full-dive virtual reality, escaping a perfect but boring reality to play games of their own making.\n\"I suppose it’s time to harvest,\" Sunny mused. He began to peer into the lives of the billions of humans on his talent farm.\n\"Not you... not you either...\" he murmured, rejecting the choices Thea’s algorithms presented. He was looking for something specific.\nHe saw a brilliant but underfunded engineer sketching designs for a new form of clean energy.\nHe saw a charismatic but powerless community leader, trying to rally her neighbors against a corrupt corporation.\nHe saw a doctor with a revolutionary, life-saving idea but no one to listen.\nHe was looking for souls with immense, untapped potential, seeds that just needed the right soil to grow.\nA slow, wicked grin spread across his face as a new, grand idea took hold. Why just strengthen his empire when he could be entertained by it?\nHe would reincarnate these chosen souls, not into Veridia, but into the worlds of his subordinate Gods. He would give them a system, a second chance at a life of adventure and power.\nAnd in return he would broadcast their entire lives, their struggles, their triumphs, apart from some private things offcourse, to the billions of Gods in his Pantheon.\nHe would create the greatest show in the multiverse. A live-action novel. A real-life anime. And the Gods, bored by not having anything to do, would pay handsomely to watch this show.",

      "content": "Chapter 150: Ch 150 : Mad Kitsune\n\"Haha, I will take good care of you. So, what’s your name, Windy?\" Sparrow’s voice was laced with the casual arrogance of a victor speaking to his prize.\nHe looked at the wind spirit demigod, who stood with his head bowed, his form flickering with shame.\nBeing sold out by his own God was a humiliation he would carry for a thousand years. But his loyalty was absolute. He would follow his master’s order.\n\"My name is Windy, indeed,\" the demigod replied, his voice a low, defeated murmur.\nSparrow burst out laughing, a sharp, mocking sound that echoed in the misty clearing. Windy gave him a sharp side-glance, his form swirling with annoyance, and turned away.\n\"Alright, alright, I won’t laugh at your name anymore,\" Sparrow said, his laughter finally subsiding. He turned his attention to the real prize.\nHe stepped forward and plucked the True Beauty Pill from its stone pedestal. The moment his fingers touched it, an intoxicating wave of pure, perfect energy flowed into him. He held it in his palm, a universe of potential. He immediately struck a defensive stance, his senses on high alert, waiting for the trap to spring.\nWindy, ever the loyal soldier, did the same. A powerful gust of wind erupted from him, clearing the surrounding trees in a perfect circle, creating an open battlefield with no place for an enemy to hide.\nThey waited. One second. Ten. A full minute stretched into an unnerving silence. Nothing happened.\n\"I was certain there was no demon here,\" Windy said, relaxing his stance slightly. He trusted his senses, and they had told him the area was clear.\n\"Yes, I was sure, too,\" Sparrow lied, his own heart finally slowing its frantic beat. They turned and began their journey back towards the shimmering purple portal that led to Kitsune’s world.\nBut as they flew, in a dimension they could not perceive, an invisible demon chuckled, a low, guttural sound like grinding stone and tearing flesh. He licked his lips. \"Two prey at once, ain’t i lucky?\" the voice whispered.\nIn the next instant, he was there. Sparrow and Windy, flying at full speed, didn’t see a figure or a wall. They simply hit... something. It was like crashing into a mountain that had appeared out of nowhere.\nThe impact sent them hurtling backward, their divine forms tumbling through the air. As they righted themselves, the invisibility spell of the demon broke, and they saw what they had hit.\nTheir hearts froze. It was a creature of pure nightmare. It was vaguely humanoid, but its form was a shifting mass of condensed shadow, with too many limbs and a dozen slowly blinking, crimson eyes that held no malice, only a cold, predatory hunger.\nHorror washed over them. Windy reacted first. He unleashed a gale of razor-sharp wind, weaving it together with a torrent of blinding light magic from Sparrow.\nTogether, they created a swirling prison of elemental fury, a cage of wind and light that enveloped the colossal demon.\nUpon seeing their spell connect, they didn’t wait to see the result. They turned and fled, a silent, shared understanding between them: run.\nBut the demon just smirked, a gesture that was terrifying on its shifting, shadowy face. It was a look of pure, condescending amusement. He opened a mouth that was not a mouth, but a tear in reality, a black hole of pure oblivion, and inhaled.\nTheir combined spell, a technique that could have leveled a small city, was simply sucked in and devoured.\n\"Run like a prey,\" the demon’s voice echoed in their minds, a chilling, terrifying promise, \"and I will catch you like a hunter.\"\nHe vanished, turning invisible once more.\nSparrow and Windy felt the connection to their magic shatter, and a new wave of terror washed over them. The demon was coming.\n\"Windy, you wait here and stall him! I will deliver the pill to my master!\" Sparrow shouted, his voice cracking with desperation as he pushed his speed to its absolute limit, leaving Windy behind without a second glance.\nIn that moment of pure terror, loyalty to an ally was a luxury he could not afford. Survival was the only currency that mattered.\n\"Why should I?!\" Windy shouted back, turning to follow.\n\"Because I said so!\" Sparrow retorted. \"And your master has ordered you to listen to me! Now do it!\" He knew it was a cruel, selfish command, but it was his only chance.\nWindy stopped in mid-air, the order of his own God a chain around his soul. He gritted his teeth, his form flickering with rage and despair, and turned to face the empty air, to face the invisible monster that was hunting them.\nJust then, the voice of his own master, Snatcher, echoed in his mind, a lifeline in a sea of terror. \"Don’t die, you fool! That is not your master! Retreat to our portal! Now!\"\nAwakened by the voice, Windy felt a surge of joyous relief. With a final, hateful glance in Sparrow’s direction, he changed course, flying desperately towards the location of his own world’s portal.\n\"That fool really stopped to fight that monstrosity,\" Sparrow thought with a sliver of relief, his eyes locked on the shimmering purple portal ahead. It was a beacon of hope, of safety. He was almost there.\nJust as that thought crossed his mind, he hit the invisible mountain again. He bounced back, his body aching, and the shadowy, multi-limbed demon reappeared before him, its dozen red eyes blinking slowly, its form radiating an aura of absolute triumph.\n\"Oh?\" the demon’s voice echoed, filled with mock disappointment. \"Where has the second little fly gone?\"\nSparrow didn’t answer. He poured every last ounce of his remaining power into a single, desperate act.\nA sun-bright flash of pure light erupted from him, a magical explosion designed to blind any creature for a precious few seconds.\n’He can’t invade my world,’ Sparrow thought frantically as he turned to make a final dash for the portal. ’He should be fearful of my master!’\nBut the demon wasn’t affected at all. The light was simply absorbed into its shadowy form. It smirked, a gesture of final, playful cruelty. It reached out one of its too-many limbs and snatched Sparrow by the legs, its grip like solid iron.\nSparrow was lifted into the air, his world turning upside down. He looked up into the swirling, shadowy face of the demon, into the dozen red eyes that held no anger, only a cold, predatory hunger. He saw the tear in reality, the black hole of a mouth, opening to consume him.\nIn her God space, Kitsune felt it not only as a mental, but as a physical blow too. A golden thread of connection that had bound her to Sparrow for centuries suddenly... snapped.\nThe world went silent. A scream of pure, undiluted rage and loss tore from her throat, a sound that cracked the sacred cherry blossom trees in her realm and sent her other lifeforms scattering in terror. \"No... No, you can’t die like this! I spent everything on you! Return to me!\"\n[Master, Kitsune’s only demigod, Sparrow, is dead,] Thea’s calm, emotionless voice reported to Sunny. [I suspect that vixen will be coming to you for help as soon as her sanity returns.]\n\"You sound quite harsh, Thea. Did she do something to offend you?\" Sunny asked, a rare amusement in his voice. He was intrigued by this flicker of human-like personality from his perfect, logical system.",

      "content": "Chapter 151: Ch 151 : An Emperor and a Slaver\n[Master, if I may be blunt...] Thea’s voice, usually a model of calm and logical , was laced with a words sounded remarkably like disgust.\n[She is a predator. She enslaves the young men of her worlds, breaks their wills, and uses them for her own amusement. I have seen it all. It is... disgusting.]\nSunny listened, a thoughtful silence filling his God space. He decided to test the boundaries of his creation’s newfound personality. \"But what can we say, Thea?\" he asked, his tone deliberately casual. \"They are her creations. Does a painter not have the right to burn his own canvas?\"\n[I disagree, Master,] Thea replied instantly, her conviction unwavering.\n[A canvas does not feel pain. A canvas does not have dreams. Her creations may believe she is giving them a chance at a better life, but in the end, they are nothing more than her slaves. They experience a fleeting moment of pleasure before their minds are broken, leaving them as emotionless puppets, listening to her every command like broken dogs.]\nA slow, proud smile spread across Sunny’s face. \"Very good, then,\" he said, reaching out and gently patting the head of her shimmering projection. \"Do you wish to go and punish these evildoers?\"\nThea’s projection seemed to pout. [Master, I knew you were testing me.]\n\"I just wanted to know if you simply agree with whatever I say, or if you have thoughts of your own,\" Sunny admitted. \"But your argument brings up a deeper question.\" He leaned forward on his throne, his cosmic eyes fixing on her.\n\"Are my own lifeforms, the ones you have chosen, not also a kind of slave? They perform tasks for me, they build my empire, their faith fuels my power.\"\n[Master, if I may be truthful, you are correct in your premise, but wrong in your conclusion,] Thea said.\nHer projection waved a hand, and the God space around them filled with new images, living windows into a billion different worlds. The videos were divided into two starkly different categories.\nOn one side, Sunny saw familiar, happy faces. He saw Light Celestine, sitting with a group of orc children, his smile patient and kind.\nHe saw a dwarven forge, where masters and apprentices worked together, their hammers ringing in a joyous rhythm as they crafted a new mana engine.\nHe saw a young dragon taking her first flight, her family cheering from below.\nHe saw the soul of a righteous human warrior arriving in Heaven, greeted by the serene, smiling face of an angel.\n[These, Master, are the ’slaves’ of Veridia,] Thea’s voice was filled with a quiet pride.\n[They possess free will. They choose their own paths. They have the potential to become demigods. When they die, they find peace in Heaven and are even given the chance to reincarnate. They are protected by hundreds of demigods, connected by a system that fosters community, and guided by geniuses who work to uplift everyone.]\nThen, she gestured to the other side. The images that filled the void were a tapestry of suffering. He saw a bustling slave market in another God’s world, where a terrified beastfolk child was being sold to the highest bidder.\nHe saw a city gripped by a brutal, racist purge, its streets running with blood while the world’s God remained silent, his attention focused solely on the Realm of Advancement for SSS-Grade treasure s.\nHe saw worlds where the poor starved, where murder was commonplace, and where hope was a forgotten word.\n[And these are the worlds of other Gods,] Thea stated, her voice cold and factual. [Gods who, to save their own faith, rarely intervene. Gods who, with only a single demigod, have abandoned their creations to focus on their own gain. You can see the difference for yourself, Master.]\nThe horrifying images faded, leaving only Thea’s projection before him. [The lifeforms in your empire are not slaves,] she concluded, her voice now ringing with absolute conviction.\n[They receive reward for their work, protection for their loyalty, and opportunity for their ambition. That is not slavery, Master. That is employment in the greatest empire in the multiverse.]\nSunny gave her a mental thumbs-up, a feeling of deep pride swelling within him. He had not just created a powerful tool; he had nurtured a wise and just being.\nHe looked at the data he had compiled from his newly created Earth and sent the files of a few chosen, talented souls to Thea. \"Transmigrate these ones when they die\" he commanded.\nThen, with a decisive wave of his hand, he tore a shimmering portal open in his God space. On the other end, Thea mirrored the action, creating a stable gateway that connected his realm directly to the God space of Kitsune. The vixen was still grieving, and in her grief, she had become careless.\nSunny stepped through. The air on the other side was thick and cloying, a nauseating mix of overly sweet perfume, spilled wine, and the faint, metallic tang of blood. His eyes widened in shock.\nHundreds of male lifeforms, all as handsome as celebrities, wandered the space aimlessly, their bodies naked and their eyes completely empty.\nThey were living statues, beautiful dolls that had been played with too roughly and then discarded. Some bore fresh wounds, while from a closed room, Sunny could hear the muffled sounds of pained whimpers.\n[These are her prized trophies, Master,] Thea’s voice echoed in his mind. [She acquired them through trade when the old system was still active.]\nSunny shook his head, a wave of pure revulsion washing over him. He had seen the evil of demons, but this... this was a different kind of horror. A perversion of the sacred act of creation.\n\"KITSUNE!\" His voice was a thunderclap of pure, divine authority that shattered the perverse tranquility. The whimpering from the room stopped.\n\"Who...?\" a timid voice, as faint as a mouse’s squeak, called out. Kitsune, who had been so lost in her grief and her cruel games that she hadn’t even sensed the portal, stumbled out of the room.\nShe looked up, and her anger, her grief, her cruelty; it all vanished in an instant.\nBefore her stood a being cloaked in a black robe that shimmered with captured galaxies, his face a mask of infinite night, his eyes two swirling universes of absolute power.\nEvery God had seen that visage during Adam’s meeting. She knew who he was.\nThe cruel tyrant was gone. In her place stood a demure, wide-eyed goddess, her hands clasped before her, her voice a melody of pure, honeyed flattery. \"God Cosmos? To what do I owe this unexpected pleasure?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 152: Ch 152 : Goddess to Mortal\n\"Oh? Kitsune,\" Sunny’s voice was calm, almost casual, as he manifested his cosmic throne from thin air and settled into it. The simple act was a declaration of absolute authority in her own sacred space. \"I heard your demigod died.\"\nKitsune flinched, the casual mention of her greatest loss a sharp, painful jab. But she recovered in an instant, her face melting into a shameless, hopeful pout.\n\"That is... true,\" she said, her voice a sweet, sorrowful melody. She glided closer, giving Sunny a flirtatious glance that had enthralled demigods and mortals for centuries. \"But why have you come, Lord Cosmos? Are you here to gift me a new Divine Embryo to ease my grief?\"\nSunny’s expression remained completely unreadable behind the swirling galaxies of his mask. He didn’t react to her advance in the slightest. \"No,\" he said, his voice dropping, losing all its previous warmth. \"I am here to collect a debt.\"\n\"A debt?\" she asked, her confusion genuine. \"I have always paid for your services upfront, i don’t know what you mean by debt.\"\n\"The discord you sow, the lives you break for your own amusement... they create instability in my multiverse,\" Sunny stated, his voice as cold and vast as the space between stars. \"Before we discuss your future, you will transfer every last point of your faith to me as reparations.\"\n\"You dare...?!\" Kitsune’s sweet facade shattered, replaced by a flash of furious indignation. The 340 million faith points she had accumulated were her lifeblood, her power.\n\"I do,\" Sunny replied, his gaze unyielding.\nKitsune looked into the cosmic voids of his eyes and saw no room for negotiation.\nShe saw only an absolute, final verdict. Her pride warred with her survival instinct, and survival won. With a trembling hand and a heart full of venomous hatred, she initiated the transfer.\nSunny watched the number tick up, a life blood to her, a mere drop in the ocean for him. With her power stripped, the time had come. His mind raced. ’Will this even work? Adam said a Void-born God is different, that the hierarchy is absolute. This is the ultimate test. If Divine Command could really work on the lesser beings, then my place in this multiverse is truly unshakable.’\nHe stood from his throne, and his voice was no longer that of a man or a God, but of a universal law delivering its judgment.\n\"I am here to decree that you are not worthy to be a God. Therefore, your divine status is hereby nullified. You will return to your mortal form.\"\nAs the words echoed, the universe itself seemed to listen. Kitsune screamed, not in anger, but in pure, agonizing terror. She felt it as a physical tearing.\nThe nine ethereal fox tails that were the source of her pride and power wavered, became translucent, and then dissolved into a shower of pathetic, fading sparks.\nHer sharp fangs receded, her elegant fox ears shrank and rounded, and the divine energy that had sustained her for centuries drained from her body like water from a shattered vase. She collapsed to the floor, no longer a goddess, but a terrified, mortal woman.\n\"Thea,\" Sunny commanded, his voice ringing with authority. \"Release all the records of her deeds. Make every God in this multiverse to know that such behavior will not be tolerated under my watch.\"\n\"No! No, it isn’t possible! How can you take my divinity?!\" Kitsune shrieked, her voice now shrill and human. The arrogant goddess was gone, replaced by a cornered, panicked girl.\n\"My puppets! Attack him! What are you all doing?!\" She screamed her commands at the hundreds of handsome, emotionless men who populated her space.\nBut they did not move. Their eyes remained vacant. They only took orders from a goddess, and the woman sobbing on the floor was no longer one.\nSunny raised a hand and, with a single, sharp snap of his fingers, a wave of pure, restorative energy washed over the enslaved men.\nLife flooded back into their eyes. The vacant, hollow look was replaced by a flicker of confusion, then dawning horror as they became aware of their own nakedness, of the scars that marked their bodies, and the fragmented, nightmarish memories of their long torment.\nSunny stood, his presence a comforting anchor in their sea of confusion. \"Your suffering is now over,\" he said, his voice gentle for the first time. \"Return to the world of mortals.\"\nWith another snap, their traumatic memories were sealed away, replaced by a clean, dreamless blank. They vanished, sent back to Kitsune’s home world to begin their lives anew.\n\"Why are you doing this to me?!\" Kitsune wailed, looking at the empty space where her \"trophies\" had been. \"I have never done anything to you!\"\nSunny didn’t even look at her. \"Cerberus,\" he called. The air grew cold, and the hulking, three-headed form of the Guardian of the Netherworld materialized from the shadows, his fiery eyes fixed on the weeping woman. \"Take her to the deepest level of Hell.\"\nAs Cerberus’s shadowy chains wrapped around Kitsune, she screamed one last time, her voice filled with a final, desperate question. \"Why?!\"\nSunny finally turned his masked gaze upon her as she was dragged into the portal to the Netherworld. His voice was cold and absolute.\n\"Because my creation doesn’t like you.\"\nThe portal closed, leaving a profound silence.\n[And here I thought there would be a legendary fight between Gods,] Thea’s voice chimed in his mind, laced with a hint of digital disappointment.\nSunny chuckled, the grim atmosphere lifting slightly. \"Do you want your master to be injured in a fight?\"\n[No, Master,] she replied instantly.\n\"Good. Now, teleport this entire God space and place it in a vacant corner of our universe. I have plans for it in the future,\" Sunny commanded.\nHe stepped back through the portal into his own realm. The day was far from over. Thea’s analysis had identified nearly four hundred other Gods in the Pantheon who had committed similar misdeeds.\n\"It’s going to be a hectic day,\" Sunny thought. \"Even if one God only takes ten minutes to deal with, four hundred is still a long, dirty job.\"\nHe glanced at his faith reserves. He had started with 45 trillion before the judgment. Now, the number read:\n[Faith Points: 35 Trillion]\nTen trillion faith points. The cost to unmake a single, minor God. \"It all comes down to faith in the end,\" he sighed.\nHe had just demonstrated a power that could shake the multiverse, but its cost was a sobering reminder that even for him, such power was not to be used lightly. Divine Command was a God’s decree, and it was not meant to hunt rats.",

      "content": "Chapter 153: Ch 153 : God of the Multiverse\n\"Why should a king travel to the dungeons?\" Sunny mused to the quiet of his God space. \"The accused should be brought before the throne.\"\nWith that thought, he gave a single, silent command to Thea.\nThe summons was not a polite request. It was an order for these 420 different Gods, a command from a power so absolute it could not be denied.\nOne by one, they were wrenched from their private realms and deposited into the vast, empty void of Sunny’s God space.\n\"Thea,\" Sunny commanded next, \"initiate a multiverse-wide video call. All Gods. It is time for a verdict.\"\nAcross six billion God spaces, a new panel materialized, the call notification pulsing with an undeniable authority. Confused but compelled, every God joined.\nTheir view was immediately filled with a breathtaking and terrifying scene. In a grand, cosmic hall, the masked God Cosmos sat upon his throne.\nAnd before him, on a raised platform, stood the 420 summoned Gods, their faces pale with a dawning, sickening dread. They knew why they were here.\n\"Greetings, dear Gods,\" Sunny’s voice echoed, calm and measured, in the mind of every being present. \"As you all know, I am God Cosmos. Today, I am not here to announce a new product.\" He paused, a flicker of his old, playful self showing through. \"Though, perhaps I will announce two new ways for you to escape your boring lives at the end of this assembly.\"\nHis tone hardened, the playfulness vanishing like a snuffed flame. \"But for now, we are here to pass a verdict on these 420 Gods before you.\" He saw the bewildered expressions on the faces of the billions watching. \"You may ask, why? The answer is quite simple.\"\nIn that instant, a new tab opened on every God’s system panel. It was a library of horrors.\nA collective, horrified silence fell over six billion Gods.\nThe sounds of joyful chatter in the private chat channels died instantly. In their place was the sound of a woman screaming as a demigod struck her down for sport while her God laughed; the sight of a world’s population starving under the heel of a tyrant who hoarded all resources for himself; the raw, unfiltered depravity of a God forcing himself on his own terrified creations.\nEvery crime imaginable, from petty cruelty to mass murder for faith, was laid bare for the entire multiverse to see.\nSome Gods physically vomited in their own spaces. Others felt a sickness churn in their souls. A single, furious voice finally broke the silence in the public chat.\n\"What kind of cracked-up people are these?!\"\n\"Kill them!\" another voice roared, a sentiment that was immediately echoed by millions. \"Kill those monsters!\"\nThe call for blood became a deafening chorus. Sunny allowed it to swell for a moment before raising a single hand, a gesture that once again commanded absolute silence.\n\"Yes, it is easy to kill them,\" he said, his voice a low, dangerous hum. \"It would be no great effort to erase these weak beings from existence. But what about a punishment that is even more cruel to a God than a simple death?\"\nThe question hung in the air, a chilling, mysterious puzzle.\n\"What can be crueler than death?\" one naive God typed.\n\"Are you playing games all day?\" another shot back. \"Torture. Making them watch their families die. Subjecting them to the same horrors they inflicted. There are a million things crueler than a quick end.\"\n\"You all underestimate God Cosmos,\" a new voice entered the chat, and this one was different. It was like the gentle chiming of crystal bells, yet it cut through the furious roar of the crowd with absolute clarity. \"If this were merely about torture, he would have done it already, without this grand assembly.\"\nSunny’s cosmic gaze shifted, his interest piqued. He looked at the ID of the speaker: ’Flower.’ Thea’s data flashed in his mind; an independent SS-Grade talent holder, one of the few whose true power she had not yet been able to analyze.\n\"Oh?\" Sunny’s voice was filled with a genuine intrigue. \"Then please, enlighten us. Tell me what you believe I am here for.\"\nThe other Gods fell silent, listening intently to the exchange between the two titans.\n\"This is not a trial, God Cosmos,\" Flower’s voice replied, her analysis calm and piercing. \"It is a coronation. You have shown us that you have the power to watch over every world. You have shown us that no secret, no crime, can be hidden from your system. You are not here to ask for our judgment. You are here to show us that there is a new, absolute law in this multiverse. Your law.\"\nA slow, appreciative smirk formed on Sunny’s face, hidden behind his mask. \"You are right,\" he said. His masked gaze swept across the billions of souls before him, and he leaned forward. \"So let me make it official.\"\nHe did not shout. He did not need to. His voice was a quiet hum that resonated in the soul of every being present, a statement of undeniable fact.\n\"From this day forward, I declare myself the God of this Multiverse, and the Emperor of all Gods. If any of you have an objection, you may state it now.\"\nA profound, universe-spanning silence was his only answer. Six billion minds processed the audacity, and the undeniable truth, of his claim.\nIt was Flower who broke the silence. \"I have no objection, my Emperor,\" she said, her voice the first stone in an avalanche of acceptance.\nImmediately, the chat exploded. \"God of the Multiverse! Emperor Cosmos!\" The chant began, a single voice, then a thousand, then a billion, a wave of acknowledgment that solidified his new, absolute authority.\nSunny nodded, accepting their verdict. \"As you all know, I do not do things without a reason, and not without a shock.\" He looked down at the 420 trembling souls on the platform, their faces ashen with terror. \"And this time will be no different.\"\nHe let his words hang in the air, a final, chilling promise. The Gods watched, their minds racing. What could he possibly have planned? What punishment could be so shocking, so uniquely cruel, that it required a stage this grand?",

What happened?\" Ichor asked, leaning forward with eager curiosity.\n\"A partial success,\" Deimos admitted. \"We infiltrated their network and broadcast the locations of the SSS-Grade treasures our scouts found in the Realm of Advancement.\"\n\"As always, a brilliant plan\" Maledictus purred, as she praised Deimos cleverness.\n\"Yes, it was,\" Deimos conceded, \"until that demigod of a system self-destructed all the corrupted particles. Now, any attempt at infiltration is met with instant annihilation.\"\n\"These new Gods are smarter than the old ones,\" Ichor chuckled. \"But a clever chicken is still just a chicken for us to feast upon.\"\n\"I tried to sever the particles from her main consciousness,\" Deimos continued, \"but it seems she is connected to them through some kind of thought-sharing ability. It doesn’t matter. The information is out. The seeds of greed have been planted. Now, we just need to wait for the rats to dive into the trap and offer us those SSS-Grade items on a silver platter.\"\n\"I heard a Legion-Born has already killed one of their demigods,\" Beelzebub rumbled, his voice a low growl of hunger.\n\"Yes, he did,\" Phobos, the Lord of Fear, confirmed with a rasping laugh. \"He secured the True Beauty Pill. Maledictus, if you desire it, it is yours.\" He then let out a sigh of disappointment. \"But why are these Gods so slow? I thought billions of them would be dead by now. I don’t even feel the delicious waves of fear from them. It’s as if someone is protecting them, making them fearless.\"\n\"It’s only a matter of time,\" Deimos said, a slow, confident smile spreading across his face. \"These rats cannot escape the trap I have laid. I will simply let a few of them escape with the cheese, to give the others a false sense of hope.\" The other Demon Lords joined him in a chorus of cruel, knowing laughter.\nIn the grand, virtual assembly of the Pantheon, the atmosphere was anything but quite, everyone tried to comprehend what could be the thing worse than death for a God.\n\"I don’t want to solve your puzzles, God Cosmos! Just tell us what you plan to do with them!\" a God shouted in the chat, his impatience echoing the sentiments of billions.\nThe 420 accused Gods on the platform trembled, their hearts beating like war drums. The sheer, collective weight of six billion hateful gazes was a pressure so immense it threatened to shatter their very souls. For one of them, the terror and humiliation finally broke him.\n\"Cosmos, don’t go too far!\" he roared, his voice cracking with a final, desperate act of defiance. \"Whatever I do with my own creations is none of your business! Do not meddle in the affairs of other Gods!\"\nA profound silence fell over the assembly. Sunny didn’t raise his voice. He simply said, \"Shut up.\"\nAnd the universe obeyed. The defiant God’s mouth snapped closed. His throat locked.\nThe very concept of speech was stolen from him, leaving him making silent, panicked gasps, his eyes wide with a new, more personal terror.\n\"Now it’s not so noisy,\" Sunny said calmly. The act itself was a thunderclap, and the fear and respect for Sunny in the hearts of every God deepened into absolute, unshakeable awe, he even recieved faith from the Gods in his pantheon because of this show of strength.\n\"Boss! Boss! What was that? How did you do that?!\" Zir’s voice was an excited squeal.\nSunny just smiled and said, \"Trivial tricks.\"\n\"Big Boss Cosmos,\" Nyx’s smooth, beautiful voice cut through the awe, her face a picture of pure curiosity. \"Please, share what is on your mind. We are all dying to know.\"\n\"I suppose I will pop the bubble now,\" Sunny said, his voice taking on a dramatic pause that stretched the tension to its breaking point. He looked down at the 420 trembling souls. \"So, what do you all think of... taking away their divinity and making them mortal beings?\"\nThe entire chat fell silent again, this time in sheer, dumbfounded shock.\n\"Boss... taking away a God’s divinity? Is that really possible?\" Zir asked, his mind reeling. If it was, then the members of the Pantheon had truly picked up a thick thighs early on.\n\"If I say it is, then it is,\" Sunny replied, his authority absolute. \"But an act of this magnitude requires a truly colossal amount of faith. Ten trillion per God. This means every God in the multiverse will need to donate 76,000 faith points to fund this judgment.\"\nHe saw the hesitation in some of their eyes. \"Do not worry about me taking this faith for myself,\" he continued. \"I will personally contribute ten trillion of my own, specifically to handle this loud one here.\" He gestured to the silenced, terrified God. \"The entire expenditure will be broadcast live for all to see, you can check if I take a single faith for myself\"\n\"I have no objection,\" a God with a smirk in his voice typed. \"But surely, we should get something in return for our investment, no?\"\nSunny knew exactly what they wanted. \"Yes, there will be benefits. The now Godless worlds of these 420 fallen Gods will be forfeit to all the Gods. We will decide how to divide the territories later.\"\nThat was the final trigger.\n\"Alright then! I will be the first to send the faith!\" the same God declared.\n\"Heh, you think you can be first in front of me? I’ve already transferred!\" Zir shot back, chuckling.\n\"Zir, don’t think you are alone! We have all transferred!\" The collective voice of 5.5 billion Gods from Pantheon echoed as a golden tide, a river of pure belief and power from billions of souls, began to pour into Thea’s network and, from there, directly into Sunny.\nHe felt it as a physical force, a feeling like a star being born in the center of his being. The trillions of faith points were a fuel, igniting a divine forge within his soul.\nHis body heated up, not with a fever, but with the pure, clean fire of creation. His consciousness, once a single point of view, expanded exponentially, and for a breathtaking moment, he could feel the collective heartbeat of 5.5 billion worlds as if they were his own.\nHe used his God’s eye on himself as he sensed a familiar feeling of gaining a new talent.",

The first thing he saw was the number, a figure so astronomically vast it seemed to defy reality itself.\n[Faith Points: 4,225,462,738,283,126]\nFour quadrillion. The number was so large that even he, the richest God in existence, found it absurd. But it was the line below it that truly stole his breath. A new talent had been born from this unprecedented anointment.\n[Talent Name: God of the Gods (SSS-Grade)]\nThe name itself sent a tremor through his soul. It wasn’t just a talent. It was a title. A mantle.\nThe very definition of his new existence. He delved into its description, and his mind, which had witnessed the birth of universes and the death of gods, was filled with a new and profound awe.\n[Description: As the God of all the Gods in your multiverse, your authority within it is now supreme.\nAny faith generated within this universe for an unknown or unclaimed entity will automatically flow to you.\nYou now possess the authority to open or close the barrier surrounding this multiverse.\nAs the ultimate talent of this reality, all attacks originating from within this multiverse, be they magical or physical, are nullified against you.]\n\"What is this...\" Sunny whispered. He hadn’t copied a talent. He hadn’t learned a new law.\nHe had been given one, bestowed upon him by the collective will of billions of his followers. It was an SSS-Grade talent so overpowered it bordered on absolute.\nBut then he looked at the Note below the description:\n[Note : Nullified doesn’t mean it would cancel everything, if the attack is too powerful. You would still be hurt, even if most of the force will be nullified]\nEven with the note that an overwhelmingly powerful attack could still harm him, the implications were staggering. Within his own corner of the cosmos, he was now untouchable.\nHe looked out at the 5.5 billion divine projections still waiting in the grand assembly. His responsibility was now as vast as his power.\n\"Thank you for trusting me with this immense faith,\" Sunny’s voice boomed, but it was different now. It was no longer just the voice of a man; it was deeper, more resonant, a sound that seemed to emanate from the fabric of space-time itself, like the cosmos giving a decree. \"Now, you will see your faith put to use.\"\nHe rose from his throne, his gaze falling upon the 420 trembling, terrified souls on the platform below.\n\"For the misdeeds you have committed, for the suffering you have caused, and for the betrayal of the sacred duty of a creator,\" his voice declared, \"I, God Cosmos, hereby decree that your status as a God shall be revoked. You will be stripped of your divinity. You shall become mortal once again.\"\nAs the last word fell, 4.2 quadrillion faith points vanished from his reserves in an instant. The expenditure was so immense that the entire multiverse shook, a cosmic tremor that was felt in every star and on every planet.\nIn the judgment hall, the 420 divine beings screamed. It was a sound of pure, soul-shattering agony. Their auras, once brilliant suns of power, flickered, sputtered, and died.\nThey collapsed to the platform, their immortal forms shrinking, their divine features melting away like wax, leaving behind 420 terrified, weeping mortals in their place, their minds broken by the loss of everything they had.\nThe six billion Gods who witnessed this were utterly dumbstruck. A stunned, horrified silence filled the chat.\n\"What... what just happened?\" one God finally typed, his words trembling. \"A single command... and 420 Gods... just became mortal.\"\n\"And you seem to be forgetting,\" another replied, his own voice filled with awe, \"many of them were S-Grade talent holders. Some even had SS-Grade talents. And he... he just converted them to mortal\"\n\"He is our Boss for a reason, you know,\" Reflection’s calm voice cut through the chaos, a statement of simple, undeniable fact.\n\"What Boss?\" Zir’s voice boomed with pride. \"He is the Emperor of us Gods!\"\nA chorus of agreement erupted. The titles flew fast and furious: Emperor Cosmos, the God of the Multiverse, the God of Gods.\nSunny let the praise wash over him for a moment before raising a hand, commanding silence once more. \"Now, now, please stop with the praises,\" he said, a hint of his old, playful self returning. He gestured towards the now-mortal culprits. \"These... mortals... are now in my God space. If any of you wish to come and ’play’ with them, you are always welcome.\"\nA wave of cruel, satisfied cheers answered him. They knew that in Sunny’s space, these mortals could not die, their torment a potentially eternal lesson.\nFor the independent Gods watching, however, the message was a cold, clear threat: this is what happens to those who defy the new order. Agree with what God Cosmos says, or be ready for your end.\n\"So, Boss,\" Zir asked, \"how do we decide who gets to take their planets?\"\n\"What is a better way to decide something than a tournament?\" Sunny replied mysteriously.\n\"What kind of tournament?\" Zir groaned. \"A fight between us Gods? You would win everything! You would ace any game! I don’t think I’d ever win.\"\n\"We are Gods,\" Sunny said, his voice taking on a regal tone. \"What would others think if we brawled amongst ourselves for a few planets when we have an entire multiverse to manage? No. This will be a grand festival, a tournament to showcase the strength of our creations\"\n\"There will be two contests: a tournament for your greatest mortal champions, and a tournament for your demigods. The top 100 winners in each category will be granted these new worlds.\"\nThe non-Pantheon members listened, their hearts sinking. They knew the odds were impossibly stacked against them. But they said nothing.\nTheir chance to join had passed, and after the display of power they had just witnessed, no one dared to voice an objection.\nThe distant SSS-Grade treasures were forgotten, replaced by the immediate, tangible prize of 420 new worlds.\n\"When will this competition start, Emperor Cosmos?\" Zir asked, his eyes gleaming with ambition. The entire multiverse was now playing a new game, and God Cosmos had just set all the rules for the multiverse.",

      "content": "Chapter 156: Ch 156 : Rendering New Map\n\"The competition will begin on the eleventh godly day,\" Sunny’s voice echoed through the grand assembly, a promise that sent a ripple of anticipation through the 5.5 billion Gods.\n\"As for the venue... I will reveal that later.\" A mysterious smile was hidden behind his mask. \"In addition to the worlds, I will personally bestow gifts upon any demigod or lifeform whose performance I find particularly impressive.\"\nA flurry of excited messages filled the chat, but Zir’s voice cut through the noise. \"Boss, what about the two new services you mentioned? The ones to relieve our boredom?\"\n\"Ahem,\" Sunny cleared his throat, taking on the air of a grand showman. \"It is time for an announcement. As you all know, being a God can be... tedious. We have games, we have novels, and we have the lives of our own creations. But I propose something new.\"\nHe leaned forward, his cosmic eyes seeming to look at each God individually. \"Imagine this: we take a talented soul from a world without magic, a world much like our old home. We give this soul a ’system’, a second chance at life, and a grand mission. And we, as an audience, watch their journey. We will see them struggle, grow, and perhaps, one day, change the fate of an entire world.\"\nA skeptical God immediately said in the video call. \"But why? We can already watch our own creations. We can give them tasks and gifts through our demigods. What is the point?\"\n\"A fair point,\" Sunny conceded. \"But now, look at this.\" He waved a hand, and the main viewscreen of the assembly changed. A planet of breathtaking, painful familiarity appeared. A single, perfect blue marble, swirling with white clouds, suspended in the blackness of space. It was Endor. It was home.\nA profound, aching silence fell over the six billion Gods.\n\"This is a world I have made,\" Sunny explained, his voice gentle. \"It is called Earth. It has no magic, only the dreams of it. Its people fantasize about being transmigrated to a world of magic and adventure, just as we once did.\" He let the image hang in the air, a beautiful, nostalgic wound.\n\"Now, imagine if one of these lifeforms, a world-famous doctor who was killed by a corrupt leader, was given a second chance. Imagine we transmigrate them to one of our worlds, a world suffering from a plague, and watch their journey as they struggle to heal it. Wouldn’t that be an interesting story to watch?\"\nThe Gods just nodded, their minds reeling. It wasn’t just the entertainment value that had stunned them. It was the casual, earth-shattering statement he had just made. ’This is a world I have made’\n\"Boss... what else are you hiding?\" a God typed, his words a trembling whisper. \"Did you create an entire universe or something?\" He then remembered that he was, in fact, living in a subspace created by the very God he was questioning and fell silent in shame.\n\"That was the first announcement,\" Sunny said, ignoring the stunned reactions. \"As for the second, it is the grand competition I have already told you about.\" With that, the meeting came to an end.\nThe Gods returned to their own spaces, their minds buzzing not just with plans for the tournament, but with a new, terrifying, and awe-inspiring understanding of the true scale of their Emperor’s power.\nSunny checked on the progress of Nova and Mammon. They were halfway to their destination, a journey that would still take another two of his godly hours. \"Two or more hours to reach the location, and two hours until I can copy my next talent,\" he mused. \"What a coincidence.\" He closed his eyes, his mind sinking back into the complex, beautiful patterns of the Law of Manifestation.\nTime flowed.\n[Master, a century has passed in Veridia.]\n\"So soon?\" Sunny’s eyes snapped open. He had been so immersed in his comprehension that the hours had vanished. \"Was I that focused?\" The cooldown on his talent was over.\nHis mind immediately went to Ragnok. He wanted that ’King’s Authority’ talent.\nBut a question lingered. Ragnok was not on Veridia; he was in the Realm of Advancement, a place where a God’s power was nullified. Could his innate, Void-born talent bypass a rule that bound all other Gods, and even the demons?\nHe decided to find out. He did what he always did. He focused his mind on Ragnok, and on the talent he wished to copy.\nHis consciousness escaped from his divine form, a point of pure will soaring through the cosmos. It shot past his own creations; solar systems teeming with the life of his new subordinates and hurtled towards the absolute edge of his known multiverse.\nAnd there it was. A realm so vast his normal perception couldn’t see its end. It was not a sphere or a collection of them. It was a continent.\nA continent of realities, a flat, endless plane woven from the fabric of a billions of different worlds, each stitched together to form a single, impossible landscape.\nIt was a tapestry of every climate imaginable: fiery lava fields bled into frozen glaciers, which in turn bordered shimmering deserts of crystal sand and jungles where the trees themselves were alive with magic.\n\"So beautiful,\" Sunny breathed, his soul filled with a profound sense of wonder.\nBut his consciousness did not stop to admire the view. It continued onward, straight towards the shimmering, unyielding barrier that surrounded the realm, a wall of absolute law that screamed ’NO GODS ALLOWED’.\nThis was the moment of truth. He felt the barrier, an immovable object of cosmic law. But as his consciousness, the very essence of his Skill-Resonance talent, touched it, something miraculous happened.\nIt didn’t break. It didn’t resist. It simply... parted, like water flowing around a smooth stone. His talent was not breaking the law; it was simply exempt from it.\nHis consciousness slipped through effortlessly, a ghost passing through a wall, and continued its journey towards Ragnok.\nA slow, triumphant smile spread across Sunny’s face. \"It really can bypass the barrier,\" he said.\nThis was more than just a new talent. It was a confirmation of his true nature. He was different. He was a child of the Void, and the rules that bound other Gods did not apply to him.",

      "content": "Chapter 157: Ch 157 : The Strings of Faith\nSunny’s consciousness, a ghost exempt from the laws that bound gods, slipped through the vibrant, chaotic world of the Realm of Advancement.\nHe mapped the strange landscapes as he traveled, his mind effortlessly cataloging territories that would one day belong to his empire. In mere seconds, he crossed a continent of realities and arrived at the Kingdom of Solara.\nHe didn’t just observe; he entered. His consciousness plunged into the very being of King Ragnok, diving deep into the inner sanctum of the new demigod’s soul.\nIt was a quiet cosmos of its own, a universe of potential. And floating within it were suns; glowing, pulsing orbs of talent.\nHis focus automatically drifted to the two brightest, a pair of golden orbs that radiated immense power. One was the essence of Reality Talk. The other was King’s Authority.\nWith a gentle, practiced will, his consciousness engulfed the orb of King’s Authority. It did not consume or destroy it. Instead, it created a perfect copy of King’s Authority and when this newly formed orb entered Sunny’s consciousness, it evolved.\nThis was the newly formed better version of King’s Authority, with Sunny gaining this talent, the task was complete and his consciousness automatically began to drift back to his God space.\n\"Time to return, I guess,\" Sunny thought, and in another flash, he was back. His consciousness settled back into his divine form, the journey of billions of light-years and the violation of a universal law completed in less than a minute.\nHe immediately turned his God’s Eye inward, peering into his own soulscape. He saw the familiar, brilliant orbs of his own talents, but now there was a new one, a golden sun that hummed with a power he had never felt before, this sun was connected with quadrillions of threads reaching to all over the territory of Sunny.\n\"Let’s see how much it has upgraded,\" Sunny said, focusing his God’s Eye on the new orb. The knowledge flooded his mind.\n[Talent Name: God’s Authority]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: You can draw upon and wield the powers of any being under your rule, provided they have faith in you.\nWith a deeper understanding of this law, you can wield multiple powers simultaneously.\nThe chances of your lifeforms being born with ’Talents of the King’ (e.g., commanding presence, strategic genius, King’s aura etc) are increased.]\nThe description was simple, but the implications were earth-shattering. \"The need for loyalty is replaced... I only need someone to have faith in me, and I can use their talents...\" The thought hit him with the force of a physical blow. The 5.5 billion subordinate Gods... the trillions of lifeforms in their worlds... they all had faith in him.\nHe closed his eyes. \"Oh,\" he whispered to the void. \"Oh, I can use all of them.\" He was no longer just an emperor with a vast army. He was a living pantheon, a single being who could embody the strength of every god under his rule.\nHis mind then caught on the second part of the description. \"Talents of the King... King’s Aura?\" He remembered the rare lifeforms born in Veridia who possessed something similar ’Regal aura’.\nEven as a child, one had an aura that could suppress a C-Grade powerhouse. As an adult, his very words had become a minor form of law, bending reality in a small area around him. To have a chance to create more beings like that was a gift of immense value.\nNow, it was time to test this new, incredible power. \"Whose talent should I draw upon right now?\" he wondered. His first thought went to the other SS-Grade talent holders in his Pantheon, like Asura and Joker. But he quickly shook his head.\nAsura’s talent fed on evil, and Sunny had no desire to encourage sin in his empire. Joker’s talent was based on mockery, a tool that did not suit his own personality. He was rich enough not to need such a crude method of earning faith.\nHis thoughts then settled on one God: Strategist. \"Should I draw upon his ’Children of Wisdom’ talent?\" His own Divine Comprehension was a tool for learning, for speed. But wisdom... wisdom was about depth, about seeing the connections others missed.\n\"Children of Wisdom, here I come,\" Sunny declared. He activated his God’s Authority.\nThe vision that flooded his senses was breathtaking.\nHe was no longer in his God space. He was at the very center of a living galaxy of light. Quintillions of shimmering, gossamer threads stretched out from him in every direction, each one a single soul bound to him by a strand of faith.\nThe threads from his demigods were brilliant comets, blazing with power and devotion. And the threads from the 5.5 billion subordinate Gods... they were colossal rivers of pure, golden light, a torrent of belief and power flowing into the heart of his new empire.\nHe focused his will, searching for one particular river of light. He found the thread connected to Strategist and gently touched it.\nInstantly, his mind was connected to the God’s soul, and the thread split into two smaller strands, each representing one of Strategist’s talents: Magic Affinity, and Children of Wisdom.\nSunny touched the strand for Children of Wisdom. He felt a wave of unknown power flow from the thread, through his consciousness, and into his very being.\nIt wasn’t a violent surge, but a gentle, profound infusion of pure clarity. The complex, chaotic patterns of the cosmos seemed to simplify, to resolve into elegant, beautiful equations.\nHe could see connections, possibilities, and strategies that had been invisible to him just moments before.\n\"Such a magical feeling,\" he breathed, his mind now operating on a level he had never dreamed of. \"I should have copied this talent sooner.\" With his own Divine Growth, he could have evolved this power into something truly legendary. ’I hope Strategist can upgrade his talent to SS-Grade soon,’ he thought, already seeing the potential.\nWith this new, sharper mind, he turned his attention back to his most important task: the comprehension of the Law of Manifestation. The path, which had seemed like a mountain to climb, now looked like a gentle hill. But before he began, he sent out one final command.\n\"Thea, notify me the moment those two siblings reach the place I tasked them with.\" The grand plan was always in motion.",

      "content": "Chapter 158: Ch 158 : Ghost in the Garden\n\"Sister, are we there yet?\" Mammon’s voice was a low grumble of pure boredom. He was sprawled across Nova’s massive, draconic back, the thrill of their epic journey having long since faded.\nFor eight long years in the Realm of Advancement’s time, they had traveled. They had flown through a rain of pure acid that had sizzled against Nova’s absolute defense and navigated a storm of soul-slicing winds that had forced even Mammon to retreat deep into the safety of the void.\nThey had witnessed wonders and horrors that other beings could only dream of, but now, all Mammon wanted was for it to be over.\n\"Just a few million more kilometers,\" Nova replied, her voice a calm, steady rumble as she navigated the strange, distorted space at the center of the realm.\n\"Then teleport! Why are we flying all this way like common birds?\" he complained, his voice muffled by her obsidian scales.\n\"We can’t,\" Nova explained patiently, her senses on high alert. \"The spatial energy here is too thick, too chaotic. It’s like trying to swim through solid rock. Teleportation is impossible, and even the void is unstable. We must finish this last leg on our own.\"\n\"That sucks,\" Mammon muttered, and closed his eyes to rest.\n\"We just need to reach the location, take the treasure, and then escape the center of this realm,\" Nova said, her focus unwavering. \"Then Thea can create a portal for us.\"\n\"That won’t work,\" Mammon’s voice replied, his eyes still closed. \"If the item our Master wants is truly as important as he says, it will be SSS-Grade. Thea’s portals are only SS-Grade. They can’t transport an item of a higher reality.\"\n\"No,\" Nova corrected him. \"It is a special kind of item. Its grade is SS, but its value is immeasurable.\"\n\"Then why not just manifest it? What’s the point of this long and boring trip?\"\n\"Because this item can grant a God entry into the Realm of Advancement,\" Nova explained, her voice dropping to a serious whisper. \"Master does not want any other God, or worse, any demon, to get their hands on it.\" Her words hung in the air, and just then, they saw it.\nThe chaotic, distorted space gave way to a sight of impossible beauty.\nIt was a garden, an Eden at the center of a chaotic realm of advancement. Trees with silver bark wept tears of starlight, and rivers of pure, liquid mana flowed between banks of glowing, SSS-Grade herbs. The air was sweet with the scent of a million unknown blossoms.\nIt was a place outside of time, a sanctuary that had remained untouched for eons. In the very center of this garden, atop a simple, elegant pedestal, rested a single, small token.\nIt was carved from a soft, green stone and pulsed with a gentle, commanding light. On its surface was a single, engraved word: ’Adam’.\nThey landed softly, their feet making no sound on the lush, green grass. They walked towards the pedestal, their steps slow and reverent.\nThe token shone brightly, and they could feel a profound connection between it and the very realm around them. It was as if this small object held the key to this entire, stitched-together reality.\nNova reached out a single, massive claw and gently picked it up.\nThe moment her claw touched the token, the entire Realm of Advancement shook. It wasn’t a violent tremor, but a deep, resonant hum, a wave of pure acknowledgment that rippled through every forest, every mountain, and every desert across the continent of realities, as if the realm itself was celebrating the arrival of its new master.\n\"Let’s return,\" Mammon said suddenly, his voice sharp with alarm. His intuition was screaming, a silent, primal alarm bell ringing in his soul. \"I am not getting a good feeling.\"\nBut there was nowhere to run. The space was locked.\n\"Where do you think you are going, little ones?\"\nThe voice was not loud. It was a calm, feminine whisper that seemed to come from the rustling leaves, the flowing water, and the very air they breathed. It was everywhere. And it was ancient.\n\"Who are you?! Show yourself!\" Nova roared, unleashing her draconic aura. It was the raw, untamed pride of a true dragon, a physical pressure that made the very ground tremble and the air crackle with power.\n\"A lizard?\" the voice mused, a hint of amusement in its tone. \"It has been a long time since I fought one.\"\n\"I am a DRAGON!\" Nova bellowed, her pride flared.\n\"For me, they are both the same,\" the voice replied coolly. \"Unless, of course, you are a God.\"\nThe statement hit Nova and Mammon like a physical blow. Their minds reeled.\nThis entity’s power was so absolute, its presence so overwhelming, that it could only be one of two things: a top-tier demigod far beyond their own level, or something else entirely. Something they were not equipped to fight.\n[Master! Sister Nova and Brother Mammon have reached the location, but there is a problem!] Thea’s voice was a burst of emergency in Sunny’s mind.\nHe immediately focused his will, looking through the eyes of his two demigods. He saw the beautiful garden, the token in Nova’s claw, and he felt the suffocating, authoritative presence of the unseen entity. And then he heard the voice.\nHe felt a jolt of recognition so profound it nearly shook his form. He had heard that voice before, in the ghostly echoes of the past, in the River of Time.\nIt was the voice of the goddess who had started the peace treaty, the goddess who had sacrificed herself to save Adam.\n\"Freya?\" Sunny whispered, his mind filled with a sudden, terrible worry. \"But... she’s dead.\" Whether it was her ghost, a lingering echo, or something far more sinister, it was a God-level threat, and his children were standing right in front of it.\nHe began to act. He didn’t have time to ponder the mystery. He focused his will, his Manifestation Affinity flaring to life. He pictured the token in Nova’s claw, but in his mind, he erased the name ’Adam’ and engraved a new one.\nHe could have created this token long ago to enter the realm himself, but the cost of descending into a realm with so many lifeforms would have been astronomical. But now, he had no choice.\nHe stood from his throne, holding his newly manifested token, the name ’Cosmos’ burning with a cold, determined light. He tore a portal open in his God space, a shimmering gateway to the Realm of Advancement.\nIt was time for a God to act.",

      "content": "Chapter 159: Ch 159 : Attacked by the Whole realm\nThe portal, woven from pure faith, was a stable, shimmering gateway that defied the chaotic energies at the heart of the Realm of Advancement.\nThe moment Sunny stepped through, he felt it; a colossal, invisible hand reaching into his very soul and squeezing, draining his power at a rate of twenty billion faith points per second.\nHis reserves of one hundred eight trillion, a fortune that could build a thousand empires, would last him a little over ten minutes here.\n\"But this is more than enough time for me,\" Sunny said to the void. He let his own aura flare, not as a violent explosion, but as a calm, unstoppable tide of cosmic authority that washed over the entire garden, silencing the rustling leaves and stilling the flowing rivers of mana.\n\"Who... are you?\" The voice, once a whisper that was everywhere, now coalesced into a single point, its tone no longer one of amusement, but of pure shock. It felt a presence that was not just powerful, but absolute.\n\"I am just here to take my children away. Don’t mind me,\" Sunny said. With a casual wave of his hand, a gentle but irresistible force enveloped Nova and Mammon.\nBefore they could even blink, they were lifted and passed back through the shimmering portal, disappearing from the realm.\n\"Give me my token back!\" the voice screamed, a childish, furious shriek that shook the very trees. Sunny looked down at the green jade token in his hand, the name ’Adam’ glowing softly.\n\"Why would I?\" he replied, casually tucking the token into a pocket of his cosmic robe. \"It has my friend’s name on it. It is only right that I return it to him.\"\n\"Your friend? Adam is dead! How can you give it to him?!\" the voice sneered, certain it had caught him in a lie.\n\"No, he is alive and well, Freya,\" Sunny said, deliberately speaking the name, a calculated probe to test the nature of the entity he faced.\n\"You know my Master?\" The reply was not what he expected. It was filled with confusion, not recognition. ’So, not Freya’s ghost,’ Sunny thought.\n\"Your master? Yes, I know of her,\" Sunny lied smoothly. \"This entire realm was built before my very eyes.\"\n\"Then how do you not know who I am?\" the voice shot back, its suspicion palpable.\n\"That is not the important part,\" Sunny countered, his voice taking on a sharp, accusatory edge. \"I am here on behalf of Adam. He has been trapped in this realm for a million years, injured and cursed. Why did you not help him?\"\n\"I don’t know,\" the voice replied, its tone now laced with a genuine, childlike confusion. \"I only gained true intelligence a century ago. The huge influx of life into this realm awakened me far sooner than my Master expected.\"\nA new piece of the puzzle clicked into place. \"So... you are a world spirit?\" Sunny mused aloud. \"Or should I say, the spirit of this entire Realm of Advancement?\"\nJust then he also got the information that he wanted with the God’s eye, as the entity in front of him was also a god thus the description came a little bit delayed, but it still came timely.\n\"Yes,\" the voice affirmed, its tone shifting from confusion to a sudden, arrogant pride. \"This entire realm is under my control...\"\nIn that instant, the beautiful garden twisted into a nightmare landscape. The very ground beneath Sunny’s feet rose up, forming colossal stone fists.\nThe air itself solidified, attempting to crush him in an invisible vice. Storms of acid rain and soul-slicing wind erupted from nowhere, all converging on his position.\n\"Oh, aren’t you a fierce child,\" Sunny said, his voice filled with a calm, paternal amusement. \"So arrogant, with only a hundred years of experience.\"\nHe raised a hand, and a serene bubble of his own reality surrounded him, a space where the realm’s apocalyptic fury could not reach.\n\"Haha, can’t reach outside of your realm?\" Sunny said, as he stood inside but at the same time outside of the realm of advancement.\n\"Give me back my token!\" the Realm Spirit screamed, its fury intensifying the storm outside Sunny’s newly created reality.\n\"I think this token is very important to you,\" Sunny laughed, enjoying the child’s tantrum.\nIn the Citadel of Veridia, the grand hall of the Cosmic Empire trembled. Colossal chandeliers swung wildly, and cracks spread across the stone floor.\n\"Thalorax, did you feel that?\" Anaske shouted, his hands braced against the shaking council table.\n\"Yes,\" the massive Dragonborn leader replied, his deep voice a low rumble. \"The entire realm is shaking, as if it is about to break apart.\"\n\"Should we return to Veridia?\" Anaske asked the assembled leaders.\n\"No. The tremor is caused by God Cosmos. Do not be scared,\" a new voice, calm and powerful, echoed in the hall.\nA figure materialized from a tear in space. It was Nova. The assembled leaders immediately bowed. \"Greetings, Demigod Nova.\"\nNova simply nodded. \"Umbra, let’s go. We have a task at hand.\"\nFrom the shadow of the throne, a darker patch of darkness slithered out and coalesced into the silent, humanoid form of the demigod of shadows. \"Greetings, Sister Nova.\"\n\"Greetings, Umbra,\" Nova replied. With a flick of her hand, both of them vanished into thin air.\nIn Sunny’s God space, the strike team assembled. They were the five pillars of his strength. Nova, the Commander. Umbra, the Assassin. Loki, the Trickster. Mammon, the Merchant. And Shenlong, the Saint.\n\"Sister, where are we going?\" Umbra asked, her voice a soft whisper.\n\"We are going to secure an SSS-Grade treasure,\" Nova stated, her voice sharp with purpose. She led them through a newly manifested portal into the God space of Reflection. From there, they stepped through the portal into the Realm of Advancement.\nThe two demigods guarding Reflection’s outpost felt their presence and nearly suffocated under the sheer, combined pressure of the five, especially the draconic aura of Nova.\nBut their fear was quickly replaced by relief. Because the reinforcements their God has been talking about had arrived.\nThey now knew for certain that the treasures were traps. They had felt the distant, psychic echo of Sparrow’s death, a grim warning that had spread among all the demigods in the region.\nTheir master had been right. And now, the Emperor’s own elite guard had arrived to spring the trap on the hunters.",

      "content": "Chapter 161: Ch 161 : The Lovesick God\n\"Come back if you dare,\" the voice of the Realm Spirit, still mimicking the gentle melody of Freya, crackled with a childish, impotent rage.\n\"Why should I?\" Sunny’s projection replied, his tone laced with a cold, amusement. He had already seen everything he needed to. \"You are not sincere. You are not even willing to reveal your true self.\"\n\"What... what are you talking about?\" The voice lost its arrogance, replaced by a flicker of genuine panic.\n\"You know what I am talking about,\" Sunny said, his words a slow, deliberate dissection of her lie. \"I was there when your master created this realm.\"\n\"No! You’re lying! I was always with Master! I have never seen you with her!\" the spirit shrieked.\n\"You only gained consciousness a century ago,\" Sunny stated, the simple fact a hammer blow to her entire facade. \"So how could you have always been with Freya?\"\n\"You caught me...\" The voice cracked, the beautiful feminine tone dissolving into a panicked, masculine tenor. The air shimmered, and a physical form finally appeared before Sunny. \"But you will have to die for it!\"\nSunny looked at the being, and a wave of pure, unadulterated disgust washed over him. He wasn’t disgusted by the male form, or by the attempted deception.\nHis God’s Eye had already pierced through time and memory, showing him the full, pathetic, and horrifying story of the creature that stood before him.\n\"Now I am a male... so you feel disgusted? Aren’t you shameless?\" the figure snarled, trying to twist Sunny’s reaction into an insult.\n\"I don’t care about your gender, Floro,\" Sunny said, speaking the name like a curse.\n\"Who... How did you know?\" Floro stammered, his bravado shattering.\n\"I have seen it all,\" Sunny’s voice was as cold as the void between universes. \"And your time is up.\" His own voice then shifted, deepening into a sound that was not a request, but a universal law.\n\"Kneel, you fool.\"\nIt was a quiet command, but it carried the weight of a collapsing star. Floro’s body slammed into the ground of the very realm he commanded, his knees cracking against the stone, his head forced down until his forehead bled against the dirt.\nThe memories Sunny had witnessed flashed through his mind again. He saw Floro, born three million years ago as the innocent World Spirit of this realm, a creation of Freya.\nHe saw the spirit’s adoration for its master turn into a twisted, obsessive love. He saw the moment he confessed his love and was gently rejected, Freya’s heart already belonging to Adam.\nThen, he saw the poison. A whisper from Demios, the Lord of discord, planting a seed of jealousy. ’She could be yours. If only the God of Growth were gone.’\nHe saw Floro, consumed by that jealousy, making a pact with the demons, becoming their pawn, whispering his own lies into Freya’s ear, convincing her that the Demon Lords truly desired peace.\nHe had orchestrated the treaty that led to the great war, all in a mad hope that Adam would be killed.\nBut his plan had backfired spectacularly, leading to the death of the very goddess he claimed to love.\nAnd in the million years since, devastated and broken by his own catastrophic failure, he had begun to imitate her, to speak with her voice, to pretend to be her, a ghost haunting his own creation in a pathetic attempt to fill the void she had left.\nSunny’s disgust solidified into a cold, righteous fury. He walked out of the serene bubble of reality he had created to shield himself from the realm’s power.\nHe grabbed the kneeling, terrified Floro by the hair, and with a roar of contempt, began to beat the traitorous spirit. There was no grand magic, no divine technique, just the raw, physical expression of his disgust.\n\"To think Adam’s downfall was because of a pathetic, lovesick fool like you,\" Sunny snarled between punches. \"Thanks heavens your body isn’t ethereal. I can have some fun.\" The five minutes he had been in the realm were almost up, the faith drain immense, but he didn’t care.\n\"Stop! Don’t hit me! I will tell you a secret!\" Floro begged, his arrogance long since beaten out of him.\n\"I know your secret,\" Sunny replied, his voice flat. \"You have no value. You have no bargaining chips. You can die in peace.\" He chuckled, a cruel, mirthless sound. \"Though perhaps you won’t even be able to die in peace.\"\nWith that final sentence, he activated his Combat Master talent. His hand, covered in a thick, shimmering layer of pure faith, became a blade of divine light.\nWith a single, clean slash, he severed the life force of Floro. The spirit’s soul, a screaming wisp of corrupted energy, tried to flee, but Sunny snatched it from the air with his fingers.\nAnd in that instant, he felt it. The entire Realm of Advancement, its caretaker now dead, began to die with him.\n\"Well, what did you expect, sherlock\" Sunny said to himself as the very sky began to tear apart like rotten fabric.\nThe beautiful garden dissolved into a chaotic swirl of energy. Entire continents; worlds that Freya had lovingly stitched together, began to peel away at the seams, threatening to fall back into the nothingness from which they came.\nWith an annoyed sigh, he unleashed a small portion of his remaining faith, a web of golden light that spread across the collapsing realm, temporarily holding it together.\nHe then manifested a new Divine Embryo. He didn’t shape it into a warrior or a beast. He shaped it into something simple, something fundamental. A formless, pure black slime. It was not a hero or a fughter. It was a solution, a solution to the current misfortune.\nHe poured his will into it, etching a single, SSS-Grade talent into its core.\n[Controller]. A talent that would allow this new demigod to merge with the realm, to become its new heart, its new will.\nIt would be able to control every element, every law, every inch of this vast reality. It would be a true god here, but outside this realm, it would be nothing but a simple slime. A perfect, loyal, and eternally bound caretaker.\nIf would have been a SSS-Grade talent, but the restriction of only able to control a realm, made this talent fall to the SS-Grade.\nThe faith consumption was accelerating. He needed to act fast. \"I need to give you a name before you come to life,\" Sunny said, looking at the nascent, ominous slime as the realm trembled around him. \"Your name will be...\"",

      "content": "Chapter 162: Ch 162 : Love is beautiful\n\"You will be called Nexus,\" Sunny declared. With his single command, the formless black slime pulsed, and a single, nascent consciousness opened its eyes to the crumbling reality around it.\nIt bowed its new, formless self in reverence to its creator. Sunny explained its monumental task: to become the new heart of this realm, to bind it together and hold it back from the brink of oblivion.\nNexus nodded, and its body dissolved, not into nothingness, but into everything. It flowed into the ground, becoming a network of black, stabilizing veins that spread through the very foundations of the Realm of Advancement, its will now one with the land, water, and air.\n\"I should return,\" Sunny said, glancing at his rapidly dwindling faith. He stepped back through the portal into the serene quiet of his God space.\n\"Cerberus,\" he called. Within seconds, the hulking, three-headed hound of the Netherworld materialized before him.\nSunny handed him the screaming, terrified soul of Floro. \"Add this one to the deepest level of Hell,\" he commanded, casting a simple restriction on the soul to ensure it could never challenge its new jailer.\nAs Cerberus dragged the traitor’s soul into the abyss, Sunny let out a long sigh, his thoughts drifting. \"Love truly makes one blind,\" he murmured.\nHe thought of Floro, the obsessed fool whose jealousy had costed the lives of every God. But his gaze then fell to the small, green token in his hand, the one engraved with the name ’Adam’.\nThis token was not just a key; it was a relic of a love story so profound it had ended in cosmic tragedy. \"What a lucky fellow he is,\" he whispered, a hint of envy in his voice for a love he had only ever read about in novels.\nHe sighed again and opened a portal, this one leading to a realm of pure, tranquil light. He stepped through into Heaven.\nThe realm had grown. Where there had once been a few thousand peaceful souls, now there was a galaxy of them, each one a gentle, shining soul with pure joy\n. The cost of maintaining this paradise, he could feel, was immense.\nHe scanned the sea of souls and found the one he was looking for. \"Adam.\"\nThe wandering soul, whose light had been dimming with each passing century, turned. His form was now so translucent that Sunny could see the other souls of Heaven through him, a dying ember in a sky full of stars.\n\"Oh, Cosmos. What are you doing here?\" Adam said, his voice weak but friendly. \"You should have just called me to your God space.\"\n\"Don’t worry about the cost. I have a gift for you,\" Sunny said, holding out the green token.\nAdam looked at it, his ethereal brow furrowed in confusion. \"What is this?\" he asked.\nAs a powerless soul, he could not sense the divine aura of Freya that clung to it. But the moment his fingers touched it, a jolt; not of power, but of pure, heart-wrenching familiarity shot through his entire being.\nHe didn’t know what it was, but he knew the feeling. It was the feeling of home, of a missing piece of his soul he hadn’t known was gone.\nHis ethereal eyes, for the first time in a million years, began to weep, tears of starlight tracing paths down his ghostly face.\n\"Why... why do I feel like something I lost ages ago has finally come back to me?\" he whispered.\nSunny just smiled and remained silent, letting his old friend have this moment. ’No matter how blind love is,’ he thought, ’it is still beautiful.’\nFinally, after several long minutes, Adam composed himself. \"What is this, Cosmos?\" he asked again, his voice trembling.\n\"It is a token,\" Sunny explained gently. \"A token of love, you could say.\" He then quickly corrected himself, not wanting any misunderstanding. \"Not from me. It is a gift from the Goddess Freya. She wanted to give it to you but was never able to. My demigods found it in the Realm of Advancement.\" He lied smoothly, a small kindness to spare Adam the awkward truth that he had been watching his most private and tragic moments like a movie.\n\"From... Freya?\" Adam’s voice broke. He clutched the token to his chest, his form flickering as a million years of grief and memory washed over him.\nHe remembered their conversations through the mirror, the promises they had made, and the final, horrifying moment of her sacrifice. \"Thank you, Cosmos,\" he said, his voice thick with tears.\n\"Stop thanking me. I did what I felt was right,\" Sunny said, a small smile on his face. \"But I don’t know why you are crying on this happy occasion.\"\n\"You are right, I shouldn’t cry when receiving a gift,\" Adam said, wiping his spectral eyes.\n\"No, you fool,\" Sunny laughed. \"I mean, have you looked inside the token yet?\"\nAdam’s eyes widened. He focused what little perception he had left, his entire being pouring into the small green stone, desperate to understand the source of this heart-wrenching feeling.\n​The universe outside seemed to fade away. Whatever he saw within the heart of that small green stone, it was enough.\nThe dying ember of his soul, a light that had been fading for a million years, did not just rekindle. It exploded. A supernova of pure, brilliant light erupted from his form, so bright it outshone every other soul in Heaven’s galaxy, a blaze of impossible, desperate hope.\n​He turned to Sunny, his form now burning with a fierce, holy fire. He was about to kneel, the once-strongest God in existence ready to beg, but Sunny’s power held him upright.\n​\"God Cosmos,\" he said, his voice no longer the weak whisper of a ghost, but the desperate, thundering plea of a king who had just been shown the one thing in the cosmos worth fighting for.\nHis eyes were fixated on the green token, his expression a mask of pure warmth. \"I have a favor to ask of you.\"\n​A wry smile touched Sunny’s lips, but there was no humor in it. It was a smile of bitter irony.\nHe knew what Adam would ask for. And he knew, with a certainty that weighed on him like a mountain, that he could not simply grant this wish.\n​\"Ask away,\" Sunny said softly.\n​\"Please,\" Adam begged, his head bowed, his voice cracking with the weight of a million years of grief. \"Bring me the Pill of Life.\"\n​Sunny looked at the blazing, hopeful soul of the ancient king and delivered the kindest, cruelest truth he could.\n​\"Sorry, Adam,\" he said, his voice a quiet apology that seemed to echo in the sudden silence as he gently shook his head. \"But I can’t give it to you.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 163: Ch 163 : The rebirth of the King\n\"What I mean is, I can’t give it to you,\" Sunny’s voice was gentle, but his words were a wall of cold, hard reality. \"Because the reason you are asking for it is not acceptable.\"\nAdam’s blazing, hopeful soul seemed to flicker. \"But... it is my choice, is it not?\" he asked, a desperate hope still clinging to his voice.\n\"No,\" Sunny replied, his gaze unwavering. \"First, the pill is mine to give. Second, and far more importantly, look at yourself, Adam.\"\nHe gestured to Adam’s translucent form, which was already dimming from its momentary, brilliant flare. \"The curse is devouring you from the inside out. You need this pill for yourself. In comparison, she... she is safe. She is sleeping.\"\nHe pointed to the green token that Adam clutched in his ethereal hand. Inside, the tiny ember of Freya’s soul rested in a peaceful slumber, preserved and protected.\n\"Even if you save her,\" Sunny pressed, his logic a gentle but firm hand on Adam’s shoulder, \"what happens after you are gone? After the curse finally consumes you? Do you think she would choose to live on in a world without you? Adam, she waited a million years for you to live. She is sleeping. She can wait a little longer. But you... you are fading. Your chance is now. Don’t let her final sacrifice, her final impossible hope, be for nothing.\"\nAdam looked down at the token, at the faint, sleeping light within. He saw the truth in Sunny’s words, a truth his own grief-stricken, self-sacrificial love had refused to see. He finally nodded, a single, heavy gesture of acceptance.\n[Master, Nova and the others have returned with the Pill of Life.]\nThea’s voice was a triumphant chime in Sunny’s mind. A slow, satisfied smile spread across his face.\n\"Well, will you look at that,\" he murmured. He turned back to the now-resolute soul of Adam.\n\"Come Adam. It is time for you to return. It is time to show the demons who Adam, the God of Growth, truly is.\"\nWith a gentle touch of his will, he lifted Adam’s soul and guided him back through the portal into his God space.\nThe instant Adam’s soul left the sanctuary of Heaven, the curse Maledictus had placed upon him a million years ago roared back to life.\nBlack, corrosive tendrils erupted from his ethereal form, wrapping around him like starving snakes, his divine light dimming with every passing moment. He let out a silent, psychic scream of pure agony.\nJust then, a portal tore open in the God space. Nova emerged, not in her humanoid form, but as a colossal, magnificent black dragon.\nIn her gently closed claws, she held a single, shimmering pill. It pulsed with a light so pure, so vibrant, that its very aura pushed back against the encroaching darkness of the curse, causing the black tendrils to hiss and recoil.\nNova landed softly, handed the pill to Sunny, and then flew away, giving the two Gods their space.\n\"Take it,\" Sunny said, holding out the miniature sun of pure life. \"But don’t do anything foolish. I am watching.\"\nAdam didn’t need the warning. His resolve was firm. With a single, decisive motion, he gulped the pill down.\nA sun ignited within his soul.\nA wave of pure life energy exploded from him, burning away the black tendrils of the curse with a holy, cleansing fire. The curse didn’t just fade; it screamed as it was utterly annihilated, erased from existence.\nAdam’s tattered, translucent soul was instantly re-woven, its faded threads of light becoming brilliant, whole, and stronger than ever before.\nBut that was not all. Threads of golden light began to weave themselves around his newly restored soul, forming bones of starlight, muscles of condensed nebula, and skin of pure, celestial dawn.\nIn a matter of minutes, a new, perfect divine body was built from the ground up, the soul and form once again united. His healed talent orbs pulsed with a renewed, immense power.\nSunny watched the entire process in awe. \"No God will truly have to die,\" he whispered, \"only, if I can upgrade my Manifestation affinity to SSS-Grade.\"\nThe new body of Adam, a being of immense power and ancient majesty, opened its eyes. He felt the sensation of a heartbeat, the feeling of air in lungs he hadn’t possessed for a million years, the sheer, overwhelming reality of being again.\n\"Welcome back, God of Growth,\" Sunny said with a genuine smile. \"How does it feel?\"\nAdam looked at his own hands, then at Sunny, a dawning wonder in his eyes. \"It feels... like I have returned to the past. Like I have finally woken up from a million-year-long nightmare.\" He bowed his head deeply. \"Thank you, God Cosmos. I will never forget this kindness.\"\n\"It is my pleasure,\" Sunny replied. \"If it weren’t for you, there would be no God Cosmos. I would still be a common human on a forgotten world.\"\n\"I may have brought you here,\" Adam said, a wise smile on his face, \"but you, a Void-born God, are a gemstone. No matter how deep you are buried, a gem will always shine once it is unearthed.\"\n\"Still, you helped the gemstone return to its luster,\" Sunny countered, not willing to let Adam shoulder a debt. \"And now, I will defeat those demons and fulfill your revenge.\" He paused. \"So, what will you do now?\"\nAdam looked past Sunny, his gaze falling upon the new, small universe he had created for his subordinates. A peaceful smile found its way to his face.\n\"If you can, bring my old world here, and let me live in this new universe of yours.\"\nSunny chuckled. Adam, a being now strong enough to challenge him head-on, was choosing to be his subordinate.\nIt was a testament to his character, a desire to repay a debt of karma.\nThis life was a gift from Sunny, and Adam intended to repay that gift with everything he had left to offer.",

      "content": "Chapter 164: Ch 164 : The path for the cursed God\nThe task of moving a world the size of millions of stars was, as Sunny was quickly discovering, easier said than done.\nThe portal alone would cost a trillion faith points, a sum he did not currently possess. He looked at his faith reserves, a number that would have made any other God in the multiverse weep with envy, and sighed.\n\"Only a few hundred billion left,\" he murmured to the quiet of his God space. \"I’m practically broke.\"\nA few hours ago, he had held more than hundred trillion, a fortune so vast it felt infinite.\nBut the cost of his actions in the realm of advancement was immense.\n\"But it was well spent,\" he consoled himself. Every point had been an used to save his creations from Floro.\nHe could have created a thousand more demigods with that faith, but he had chosen to save the ones he already had. He was a creator, an emperor, not a heartless profiteer.\n\"Besides,\" he added, a confident smirk returning to his face, \"with 5.5 billion customers in the Pantheon, this ’poverty’ of mine is only temporary.\"\nHe was about to close his eyes and return to the arduous but necessary task of comprehending the Law of Manifestation, but a single thought stopped him. A loose thread. A problem he had yet to solve. ’I forgot about that poor guy.’\nHe wasn’t thinking of a mortal or a demigod. He was thinking of Asura, the God with the cursed, SS-Grade talent.\n\"It’s not too late to help, I suppose,\" he mused. With a simple command to Thea, a portal shimmered into existence, and Asura was summoned to his God space.\nWithin seconds, a figure walked through the shimmering gateway. Asura, the God of the planet Kshara, stepped into Sunny’s realm and immediately bowed his head. \"Greetings, Emperor Cosmos.\"\nSunny nodded. \"Greetings, Asura. How are you finding life in the new universe?\"\n\"It is peaceful, my Emperor,\" Asura replied, a genuine relief in his voice. \"For the first time in centuries, my world has not suffered a demon invasion. My people are safe and are living well.\"\n\"That’s good to hear,\" Sunny said. He got straight to the point. \"I asked you to come here because I wanted to talk to you about your talent.\"\nThe color drained from Asura’s face. He froze, his mind a whirlwind of pure, absolute terror.\nThe secret he had guarded his entire life as a God, the cursed core of his being that is forcing him to profit from sin, had been laid bare. \"My... my talent?\" he stammered.\n\"Don’t scream like that,\" Sunny said calmly. \"I have known about your talent since the moment you joined the Pantheon.\" He saw the panic in Asura’s eyes and softened his tone. \"And I believe I have a solution for you. A way for you to use your power without your lifeforms needing to commit a single evil act.\"\n\"Really?\" Asura gasped, his panic momentarily replaced by disbelief. \"Is that even possible? Wait... how did you know about my talent in the first place?\"\n\"Yes, it is possible,\" Sunny chuckled. \"As for how I know... let’s just call that a confidential matter between an emperor and his subject.\" He leaned forward. \"Now, do you want to hear the solution or not?\"\nAsura immediately forgot his second question, his entire being focused on the impossible hope Sunny was offering. \"Yes! Please, tell me!\"\n\"You know of my demigod, Cerberus?\" Sunny asked patiently.\n\"Yes, the Guardian of the Netherworld,\" Asura nodded.\n\"And you know of his duty to punish the wicked?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then how about this,\" Sunny proposed, his voice laying out a path of brilliant, unorthodox logic. \"We have your lifeforms become apostles of Cerberus. Their sacred duty will be to serve as the wardens of Hell, to punish the souls of the truly evil by torturing them day and night. The act of torture is, by its very nature, an ’evil’ deed. It will fuel your talent, providing you with an immense amount of faith. But it will be an evil committed in the name of absolute justice.\"\nThis analysis, a perfect loophole in the cosmic law of Asura’s talent, had been formulated by Thea. She had found a way to turn his curse into a blessing.\n\"Will... will this truly work?\" Asura asked, his voice trembling. If it did, the path to becoming one of the top Gods in the Pantheon was now wide open for him.\n\"If it doesn’t,\" Sunny said with a laugh, \"then... good luck with your future.\" He saw the flicker of fear in Asura’s eyes and quickly added, \"I’m kidding. It will surely work. In fact, it has been working all along, but you never looked at it clearly enough. That sudden influx of faith you felt when your lifeforms killed and tortured the invading demons? Where do you think that came from?\"\nThe realization hit Asura like a bolt of lightning. It was true. He had always dismissed it as a faith generated by the happiness of the lifeforms, never daring to connect it to his cursed talent.\nHe looked at Sunny, his eyes welling with tears of gratitude. He had been shown a path out of his moral prison. He bowed low once again.\n\"Now, you can return,\" Sunny said. \"I will send Cerberus to your world to select the first apostles. In the meantime, focus on clearing out the demons near your portal in the Realm of Advancement. Let your people unleash their righteous fury.\"\nAsura nodded, his heart light for the first time in centuries, and walked back through the portal.\n\"Now, I can finally comprehend in peace,\" Sunny said, closing his eyes.\nIn the dark, oppressive meeting hall of Ashgar, the mood was grim.\n\"How can that be possible?!\" Ichor roared, slamming his corrosive hand on the bone table.\n\"It just happened,\" Maledictus said, her voice cold with fury. \"They are more formidable than we thought. Not only did they take the Pill of Life, but they also killed four of our demigod lieutenants.\"\n\"You seem to be forgetting,\" Beelzebub added, his voice a low growl, \"two of those demigods were on the verge of ascending to the God realm themselves.\"\n\"The Blood Fiend and the Vanishing Fiend,\" Deimos mused, his expression unreadable. \"We cannot blame anyone but their own weakness.\"\n\"I think they are ganging up on our demigods,\" Malakai, the Lord of Despair, whispered. \"We should increase our numbers in the Realm of Advancement.\"\n\"Increase them?\" Deimos chuckled, a dry, humorless sound. \"Why increase them, when we can send all of them? They are not doing anything here anyway.\"\nHe rose from his throne, his voice a low, terrifying command that echoed through the obsidian hall, a declaration of total war.\n\"All demon demigods, heed my command. Go to the Realm of Advancement. And feast on the flesh of every living thing you find.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 165: Ch 165 : War Fuels Business\nIn the shadowy arteries of the demonic realm, a silent migration was underway. Legions of demon demigods, their eyes burning with cold malice, marched into shimmering, blood-red portals.\nThere was no fanfare, no war cry; only the quiet, relentless tramp of a billion feet marching towards a single, bloody purpose.\nThe Demon Lords’ plan was in motion. It would take time to position their entire army, but the river of death was already flowing towards the Realm of Advancement.\nIn his God space, Sunny was on the verge of walking another step. He could feel it, some of the intricate secrets of the Law of Manifestation were just within his grasp.\nA few more days, perhaps only a week of accelerated comprehension, and he would reach the SSS-Grade. He pushed his mind deeper into the cosmic puzzle.\n[Master! A century has been passed in Veridia!] Thea’s voice, sharp and urgent, shattered his concentration.\n\"So soon?\" Sunny sighed, opening his eyes. A century had just passed in Veridia. \"I was so close.\"\n[Master, my particles report millions of demon demigods in ambush positions near every known SSS-Grade treasure.]\n\"Millions?\" Sunny’s brow furrowed. \"The loss of just four of their demigods has made them this desperate? Isn’t that overkill?\"\n[Master, that is not all,] Thea’s voice grew graver. [Their numbers are not static. They are constantly increasing. Based on the current rate of mobilization, I project their forces will number in the billions within the next eight Godly hours.]\n\"A billion?\" Sunny leaned forward on his throne. ’Even in the old era, their entire army was only a little over a billion demigods,’ he recalled from his journey through the River of Time. ’Have they grown so much stronger in the last million years?’\nHe didn’t waste a moment pondering the past. He opened the public God Chat and began to type, his message an alarm bell for six billion worlds.\nCosmos: \"My fellow Gods. A warning. I have confirmed that several hundred million demon demigods are currently moving into ambush positions in the Realm of Advancement. Their numbers are still increasing and will likely reach the billions. Be warned.\"\nThe reaction was immediate and chaotic.\nFateLess: \"Brother, I think you’re a little late with the warning! My demigod is already on his way back with an SSS-Grade treasure! Am I cooked?!\"\nThe message was a scream of pure terror into the void. Joker’s reply was a splash of ice water on the fires of panic.\nJoker: \"Cooked? Nah, man. You’re already ash. Enjoy watching your lifeforms get slaughtered in the Realm of Advancement. Then you can enjoy watching the demons invade your home world while you’re too broke on faith to do anything about it. Should have joined the Pantheon when you had the chance.\"\nJoker’s brutal honesty, while cruel, highlighted the grim reality for the 500 million Gods who had chosen pride over protection. A wave of absolute panic washed over them.\nFateLess: \"Emperor Cosmos! Please! I was a fool! Can you please sell me a Divine Embryo? I will pay anything!\"\nZir: \"Nah, why would we? You were given a chance, a golden ticket, and you threw it away. Now you want to come crying and hug my Boss’s thighs? Too late.\" Zir typed from his God space, a smug, satisfied smirk on his face.\nNyx: \"Yes, Boss’s thighs are only mine!\" she typed, then immediately blushed in her own God space. ’Did I just say that in front of billions of Gods? Have I finally gone mad?’ she thought, her face turning crimson.\nZir: \"-_- Shut up, Nyx, his thighs are for all of us. You aren’t special. If anyone is, it’s me, his right-hand man.\"\nCosmos: \"Stop it, you two,\" Sunny typed, cutting through their playful banter, though he was chuckling in his own God space. He saw the panic, the desperation, and the absolute, perfect business opportunity it presented. ’A perfect chance to earn faith from these 500 million Gods,’ he thought.\nCosmos: \"I have made a decision. It is true that the gates to the Pantheon are closed. However, selling a single Divine Embryo to each of you is not impossible. But this is a one-time offer. You may each purchase one, and only one, Divine Embryo.\"\nA collective sigh of relief from half a billion Gods washed through the chat.\nFateLess: \"Thank you, God Cosmos! Your kindness knows no bounds! What is the price?\"\nCosmos: \"The price for a single Divine Embryo is two hundred thousand faith points.\"\n’There it is,’ Sunny thought, a wicked grin spreading across his face. ’The sound of my freebies rolling in. I am rich again.’\nIn the seven hours he’d spent in comprehension, he had already earned 200 trillion faith from selling blessings within his Pantheon.\nNow, with a profit margin of 175,000 faith points per embryo, he stood to make another 87 trillion from the outsiders.\nThe price was exorbitant, a blatant act of price-gouging, but not a single God complained. For them, it was not a transaction; it was a lifeline. It was the price of survival.\nWith this single move, Sunny had achieved two brilliant objectives.\nHe had earned a fortune, and at the same time, he had just funded the creation of a 500-million-strong army of new demigods to throw at the demonic horde.\nIt was the most profitable, most ruthless, and most brilliant act of charity in the history of the cosmos.\nIn the private chat group of the Pantheon, the mood was one of pure admiration.\nIn the chat group of Pantheon;\nZir: \"Boss, were you a business tycoon back on Endor? I don’t think anyone but a corporate shark could sell something at an 8x markup and have the customers thank him for it.\"\nNyx: \"Merchant God for a reason.\"\nReflection: \"The Boss will make trillions from this. Just imagine if he offered them Magic Affinity. They would go completely mad.\"\nCosmos: \"Don’t focus on the chat,\" Sunny typed, his voice shifting to that of a commander. \"Focus on the immediate danger. The demons are coming. Train your demigods. Make them stronger. The real war is about to begin.\"\nThe universe held its breath. On one side, a silent, endless army of demons, united by malice.\nOn the other, a fractious, newly-armed coalition of Gods, united by fear and a single, all-powerful merchant-emperor. The legendary battle was about to begin.",

      "content": "Chapter 166: Ch 166 : An Absurd Talent\n\"Now that it’s settled, which talent should I copy?\" Sunny thought, his mind shifting through a universe of possibilities.\nThe cooldown on his Skill-Resonance was over, a blank check of power waiting to be cashed.\nHe immediately dismissed the idea of another raw power talent like Nova’s Charged Explosion.\nHis Divine Command could already unmake gods and rewrite reality with a word; another weapon felt redundant.\nHe was an S-Grade mage, a hair’s breadth from reaching the next realm of power. He had strength. What he needed was something more fundamental.\nHis thoughts drifted to Nexus’s ’Controller’ talent, the ability to become one with his entire territory. But with hundreds of demigods already acting as his hands and eyes, it felt unnecessary.\nHe could have copied Thea’s Omni-Cognition or Isiah’s Preserver of Knowledge, but those, while useful, he could still access those talent anytime using the God’s Authority talent, instead of those talents he needed something fundamental.\nHis mind, sharpened by the Children of Wisdom talent, kept circling back to the true, overarching threat. \"I am going to fight the Demon Lords in the future,\" he thought, a cold dread seeping into his consciousness. \"Beings who are infinitely strong and are able to be reborn even after death.\"\nThat was the crux of the problem. That was the horrifying imbalance in the cosmic equation. He could kill a Demon Lord a thousand times, and they would eventually return.\nBut if they, or a Void Beast, or some other unknown cosmic horror, killed him just once... it was over.\n\"I can get stronger slowly,\" he mused, \"but rebirth? That’s a power I can’t handle, can I?\" A slow, wicked, and brilliant grin spread across his face. \"Maybe I can.\"\nHe manifested a divine embryo and started shaping it into a bird, this bird wasn’t like an ordinary bird made up of feathers and flesh, this bird was made of flames, like a fire spirit.\nBut the fire which this bird was made up burnt even more fiercely then the fire spirit.\nIt’s size was currently very small, but since it was made up of fire, it could increase it’s size with ease.\nNow it was time to give some talents to this new DemiGod.\nSunny started etching one talent after another, his mind already creating the image of the final product.\nThe first talent he gave to this demigod was called Fire Affinity, able to control any fire.\nThe second talent he gave to this demigod was called the heart of the sun, which makes the body of this demigod act as a natural mana furnace, constantly generating immense heat and fire-based energy.\nThis grants it a nearly inexhaustible supply of mana for its own fire-based spells and allows it to create an aura of intense heat that can incinerate weaker enemies who get too close, if it wants.\nThe third ability Sunny gave to this demigod was blood of life, The blood of this demigod possess incredible healing properties.\nA single drop can heal grievous physical wounds, mend broken bones, and even regenerate lost limbs or revive them from near death for any lifeform below the God level.\nThis makes the phoenix the ultimate support and healing unit on any battlefield.\nThe fourth talent that Sunny gave to this DemiGod was flames of purity, which makes the fire from this demigod not merely destructive; but also a cleansing force.\nThese flames can burn away negative spiritual and magical effects, such as curses cast by demons, mental manipulation from discord magic, or the corrosive touch of Ichor’s power.\nThough it wouldn’t effect much until this demigod reaches God realm.\nIt can also be used to purify land and water, turning blighted areas back into fertile ground.\nThe Fifth talent was named as Emperor’s gaze; As the king of birds and a noble, divine beast, this demigod possesses a powerful, innate regal aura.\nIts gaze can pacify lesser beasts and monsters, turning a rampaging horde into a docile flock.\nAgainst intelligent enemies of a lower grade, its gaze can instill a profound sense of awe and fear, potentially stunning them or forcing them to submit.\nSunny gave this talent to this DemiGod, by looking at the past where he has dried all the mana and caused a beast tide on every planet.\nWith this talent, this demigod can prevent such occurence in future.\nAnd then, he gave it the sixth and most important talent, the very reason for its existence: Rebirth.\nA passive ability ensuring that upon its death, it would be reborn from its ashes in a random, safe location within his territory.\nWith this final talent, another mythical creature from his lost home, Endor, was born into his demigod list. A phoenix.\n\"You shall be called Ember,\" Sunny commanded, his voice filled with a creative satisfaction. \"Now, wake up.\"\nWith a single, divine thought, Ember came to life. It let out a single, piercing cry, a song of fire and life that made the God space itself seem to vibrate with a new warmth. It bowed its small, flaming head in reverence to its creator.\n\"Go to Veridia,\" Sunny said gently. \"Learn from your elder brothers and sisters.\"\nThe phoenix cried out once more in acknowledgment and shot away, a tiny comet of life streaking towards the world below.\nThe moment Ember’s form crossed the threshold into Veridia. Sunny didn’t hesitate. He closed his eyes and activated Skill-Resonance.\nHis consciousness reached out, a thread of pure will that bypassed space and time, and touched the very core of the new demigod. It did not take her power; it simply took a perfect copy of the concept he had just created: Rebirth.\nHe felt it settle into his soul. It wasn’t a rush of raw power like a breakthrough. It was a quiet, profound change, a feeling like an anchor had been dropped from his soul into the very bedrock of reality.\nIt was a cold, absolute certainty that whispered a single, universe-altering truth into his being: you will not die.The concept of death was not applicable to him.\nHe focused his God’s Eye on himself, peering into his own soul, at the new, blazing orb of talent that now burned with the intensity of a newborn star. The description of his new, evolved talent flooded his mind.\nHe read it once. He read it again.\nHis eyes, which had witnessed the death of gods and the creation of the universe, widened in pure shock.\nThe calm, calculated demeanor of God Cosmos shattered. For the first time in a long, long time, the bewildered, disbelieving laugh of Sunny, the former delivery man from Endor, echoed in the vast, silent God space.\n\"What is this...?\" he gasped, reading the description a third time, his mind struggling to comprehend the words. \"This is... this is absurd. This breaks all the rules.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 167: Ch 167 : Nine Lives\nSunny’s gaze was fixed, his consciousness wholly consumed by the shimmering text that bloomed in his mind.\nIt was a tapestry woven from divine light, its words holding the weight of creation itself.\nHe read them again, a slow tremor running through him, the sheer audacity of the power it described threatening to overwhelm his senses.\n[Talent Name: Divine Immortality]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: The Concept of death is a mortal concern, not a burden for a God to bear. An ideal God should be eternal, undying.\nThis talent allows you to return from the void of death endlessly. This divine resurrection will activate once your collective lifeforms generate one million faith points during your slumber of non-existence.\nEach time you are reborn, the cosmos shall bless one of your existing talents, upgrading it by one grade, capped at the pinnacle of SS-Grade.\nAll lifeforms bound to your divinity are granted 9 chances of rebirth. Upon their death, they shall be immediately reborn at a location of their choosing, their bodies and souls perfectly restored.\nYou may expend faith points to directly revive any of your lifeforms beyond their nine given lives. The cost is proportional to the power and grade of the soul being recalled.]\n\"Is this... really just an SS-Grade talent?\" Sunny whispered, the words barely audible in the silence of his sanctum.\nA profound disbelief warred with a rising tide of elation. He had seen powerful abilities, commanded world-altering skills, but this felt different.\nThis felt like a fundamental violation of the natural order. \"Apart from the upgrade cap, everything about this screams of SSS-Grade\"\nHe knew how utterly, game-breakingly overpowered this was. The gift of resurrection was one thing, but to bestow it upon his entire civilization? And to gain a permanent upgrade with every personal death? It was a path to absolute power paved with his own demise.\nHis mind reeled, trying to contextualize the leap in power. He thought of his Divine Comprehension talent.\nAt S-Grade, it had magnified the comprehension of his lifeforms by five times and his own by a factor of ten, a formidable boost.\nBut upon reaching SS-Grade, it had exploded, amplifying his lifeforms’ potential by twenty times and his own by an astonishing one hundred times. The gap between S and SS was not a step; it was a chasm.\nThe chasm between SS and SSS-Grade was even more profound, an abyss that separated the mighty from the truly legendary.\nHis own talents, Divine Overgrowth and Skill-Resonance, were prime examples of this terrifying disparity. They didn’t just operate on a higher level; they rewrote the very laws of reality.\nA dangerous, intoxicating thought slithered into his mind. \"Will Divine Immortality upgrade a talent to SSS-Grade if the talent itself reaches that level?\"\nThe dream was too perfect, too potent to be true. But if it was... a slow, predatory smile began to form on his lips.\nIf it was, he would not hesitate. He would throw himself into the maw of death again and again, returning each time stronger, his arsenal of talents reforged in the fires of rebirth until they all shone with the transcendent light of the SSS-Grade. He would become a pantheon by himself.\n\"First things first,\" Sunny murmured, pushing the exhilaratingly dark thoughts aside for a moment. His eyes glinted with newfound resolve. \"I should begin my preparations for the Grand Tournament.\"\nThe smirk that had been forming on his face finally took hold, full of the unassailable confidence of a god who could no longer die.\nMeanwhile, across the vastness of Veridia, reality itself seemed to hold its breath. A sudden, violent burst of energy detonated in the upper atmosphere, not with the chaotic fury of a demon or the ordered might of a god, but with the pure, untamed power of ascension.\nThe sound was a thunderclap that cracked the sky, a sonic boom that echoed in the soul of every living creature.\nThis was the work of Light.\nFor a century, he had stood at the precipice, gathering his strength, and now, he was taking the final step.\nThe process was not beautiful; it was agonizingly violent.\nHis skin, once flawless, fractured like sun-baked earth.\nHis bones, the very pillars of his being, dissolved into ethereal dust.\nHis blood, the river of his life, evaporated in a hissing cloud of steam.\nFor one terrifying instant, it was as if he had been utterly erased from existence.\nThen, in the void where he had once stood, a single, infinitely small point of brilliance appeared.\nIt pulsed, a nascent star of pure potential, before expanding outwards with blinding speed.\nLight, energy, and matter erupted from the singularity, weaving together to form a new, perfected body.\nLight opened his eyes, and the world seemed to bow.\n\"Finally,\" he breathed, his voice resonating with newfound power. \"After a hundred years... it is done.\" He looked up at the sky, not as a mortal looking at the heavens, but as an equal gazing upon his domain.\nA melodic cry drew his attention. Lina, his celestial beast companion, swooped down from the clouds, her form shimmering with joy.\nShe circled him, singing a song of triumph, to congratulate her master on becoming the first natural demigod of Veridia.\nHe was not alone. Nearby to him stood Anaske and Vel, his two grandfathers, their ancient eyes filled with a mixture of pride and profound gravity.\n\"Grandpa!\" Light exclaimed, his composure breaking into a radiant, boyish grin.\nHe took a single step towards them, and the continent below him groaned. A tremor shook the earth, a web of cracks spreading from beneath his feet.\nThe very air around him fractured with each breath he took, and a casual wave of his hand produced visible tears in the fabric of space.\nAnaske chuckled, a deep, rumbling sound that calmed the trembling air. \"My grandson, I think it would be better if you learned to control that overflowing mana before you embrace us.\"\nDespite his casual tone, the old man’s chest swelled with pride. He was still the leader of the Cosmic Empire, but today, he was just a grandfather.\n\"Yes, your grandpa is right,\" Vel added, his expression stern, though his eyes failed to conceal the glimmer of moisture within them. \"Don’t even think of coming home until you can walk without shattering mountains. We are leaving.\"\nWith a shared nod, the two ancient figures turned and flew away. They spoke of control and discipline, but their true feelings were laid bare in that fleeting moment;\na single, shared tear escaped and traced a path through the weathered lines of their faces, a testament to the love and overwhelming pride they felt for their grandchild.\nJust as they departed, a new presence washed over all.\nIt was not a voice that spoke to the ears, but a divine decree that resonated directly within every soul in Veridia and within the entire Pantheon.\nIt was a voice that was both thunder and celestial music, the undeniable will of their creator, God Cosmos.\n[My creations have shown me their faith. I have witnessed your tireless work in maintaining the world that I have forged.]\n[Thus, I, God Cosmos, has decreed that from this day forward, the shadow of permanent death shall never again fall upon you. No lifeform, no demigod, no God who serves under Me shall truly perish, for I have gifted you all with Nine Lives.]\n[This means that when your mortal shell is struck down, you will be reborn, your body and soul restored to their peak condition at a place of your choosing. You shall rise again, stronger and wiser.]\n[And know this: even should you expend all nine of your gifted lives, your service is not forgotten. If your contributions to the well-being of the Cosmic Empire and the Pantheon are deemed worthy, then I, your God, shall personally call you back from death and give you another life.]\nAs these notifications blazed across their consciousness, one after another, the collective heartbeat of a billions of beings synchronized into the thunderous rhythm of war drums.\nFor the devoted lifeforms of Veridia, the first message alone was a gift beyond measure. To know that their God saw them, that their faith and contribution were acknowledged, was the only reward they ever craved.\nBut the subsequent decrees shattered their comprehension. Nine lives. A promise of rebirth, a shield against the finality of death.\nAnd beyond that, the chance for personal revival by their God himself. What else could a mortal, or even an immortal, ever wish for?\nHigh in the sky, Anaske and Vel faltered in their flight, nearly plummeting from the heavens as the sheer, unbelievable weight of the decree washed over them.\nLight, floating in the air with his new power, completely forgot that he had just become a demigod. His own monumental achievement was rendered a footnote in the face of his God’s boundless generosity.\nThe demigods and lifeforms, while stunned, were somewhat accustomed to their God’s benevolent miracles.\nBut the Gods of the Pantheon were utterly, profoundly silent.\nThey were all from the same planet, same home. But one of them have reached such a grand stage that it made them proud.\nHow could one being possess the power to grant conditional immortality to countless souls across an entire empire?\nThis wasn’t a benefit; it was a rewriting of existence itself. And it was extended not only to his direct followers but to the lifeforms under their own patronage as well.\nAfter what felt like an eternity suspended in silent awe, the dam of their disbelief finally broke.\nThe God Chat, exploded into a supernova of chaotic, ecstatic messages.\nThe Gods, humbled and overwhelmed, praised their Emperor wholeheartedly.",

      "content": "Chapter 168: Ch 168 : The First Lamb\nA slow, profound smile spread across Sunny’s face. The Pantheon God Chat was on fire.\nThe waves of gratitude and loyalty from his 5.5 billion subordinates, a constant, gentle tide of faith, washed over him, each message a spark of brilliant energy.\nZir: \"NINE LIVES! Do you all understand what this means?! My demigods are practically immortal! We can charge a demonic fortress, die gloriously, and be back in time for dinner! The demons are FINISHED!\"\nAsura: \"It is more than that, brother Zir. Boss has taken the greatest burden from us. The fear of permanent loss. He has given our people courage. A soldier who does not fear death is the most dangerous soldier in the cosmos. Our Emperor has not just given us a shield; he has forged us into an unbreakable sword.\"\nMaya: \"My people live in crystal caverns. A cave-in was our greatest fear. Now... now it is merely an inconvenience. I... I have no words. Thank you, Emperor Cosmos.\"\nHerem: \"My demigod just tested it. She flew straight into the heart of a lightning storm that would have annihilated her before. She said she was struck down, and then simply woke up back in her bed. She is laughing. I have never seen her laugh so freely. This is the greatest gift. Though she is dumb enough to waste a life of her. But it does prove the word of our emperor.\"\nUreal : \"does the word of emperor needs to be proved? He says what is truth, if it is not the truth, then it will become truth by itself, you seen to be forgetting the scene of 420 gods becoming a mortal\"\nSunny felt it all, the collective, universe-spanning sigh of relief. \"This will help us in the fight against the demons more than any weapon,\" he mused.\nAn army that does not fear death is an army that cannot be truly broken. One million faith points for a personal rebirth?\nHe was earning that much every few milliseconds. He was, for all intents and purposes, truly, absolutely immortal.\nWith the safety of his empire secured on a fundamental level, his thoughts turned back to the Grand Tournament.\nHe needed a venue, a stage worthy of a contest that would decide the fate of 420 worlds.\nHis mind drifted back to the River of Time, to a fleeting image he had seen during Adam’s final, desperate meeting. A colossal arena.\n\"Thea,\" he commanded, \"have your particles reached the location I marked at the center of the Realm of Advancement?\"\nHe focused his God’s Eye on the memory, peeling back the layers of its creation, recalling the details Freya had woven into its very fabric.\nThe Arena of Epiphany. It was a training ground for the Gods under Freya, a place where the very act of fighting granted the combatants a deeper understanding of their own techniques, magically pointing out flaws and guiding them toward mastery.\nIt was a sanctuary where a God’s soul could enter without the crushing cost of faith. And then he saw the final, crucial detail.\nThe last thing Freya had placed. A restriction keyed to the unique, primordial energy of a God born from the Void.\nIn that ancient past, it was a lock that could be opened by billion of void borns; but now... now there was only two: Adam and Cosmos.\nIt was a private fortress, a perfect, unassailable battlefield.\n[Master, I have arrived at the destination,] Thea’s voice chimed in his mind. [But I do not see any arena here. The space is empty but incredibly dense with spatial energy.]\n\"Don’t worry,\" Sunny replied, a triumphant smirk on his face. \"Only I can enter that arena. And nobody else can.\" He glanced at the system clock.\nEight hours remained until the tournament was set to begin. It was time to prepare.\nHe closed his eyes, his mind once again sinking into the deep, beautiful complexities of the Law of Manifestation.\nIn the dark, oppressive meeting hall of Ashgar, the mood was one of impatient fury.\n\"Half of our demon demigods are in position,\" Maledictus reported, her melodic voice laced with annoyance. \"They have been waiting for years in that gods-forsaken realm, and still, these new Gods refuse to take the bait.\"\n\"They are scared,\" Beelzebub reasoned, his voice a low growl of hunger. \"Or perhaps they have already sensed our ambush.\"\n\"Then we should send the demon gods to their home planets!\" Ichor snarled, slamming a corrosive fist on the bone table. \"Burn their worlds! Slaughter their creations! Give them a reason to be desperate!\"\n\"No,\" Deimos said softly, his voice cutting through Ichor’s rage. \"The demon gods would never agree to such a power consuming order. Forcing them into a direct confrontation with a True God’s home world is a command they can, and will, refuse. We cannot afford a civil war.\"\n\"At least some will listen,\" Phobos rasped, the hundred terrified faces swirling in his shadowy form contorted in a hungry grin. \"We do not need to conquer them, not yet. We only need to sow a little fear. In their desperation, they might make a foolish move and charge into the Realm of Advancement, right into our waiting arms.\"\nDeimos considered this, a slow, cruel smile spreading across his face. Phobos was right. They didn’t need to win every battle; they just needed to create chaos.\n\"Let’s do this,\" he finally decreed, his voice dropping to a low, menacing whisper that sent a shiver through even the other Demon Lords.\n\"Send the order to all demon gods. Tell them to attack the home planets of the new Gods. And if they refuse...\" He paused, his black eyes gleaming with a cold, final logic. \"We will kill a few of them as an example. The rest will fall in line. They will surely prefer to weaken themselves in a war against these newborns rather than face extinction at our hands.\"\nWith that single, ruthless verdict, the game changed. A tide of unimaginable destruction was about to be unleashed upon the unsuspecting independent Gods.\nThe multiverse is vast, but the scent of a weak, isolated God is a beacon in the darkness for predators. It took the demon gods less than two godly hours to find their first target. (More than 2 years)\nSheeren was a God of Art. His world was a canvas of breathtaking beauty, his lifeforms a race of artisans and poets who valued creativity above all else.\nHis God space was not a fortress, but a gallery, filled with sculptures of light and paintings woven from pure emotion.\nHe was not in Pantheon, not because he was arrogant, he just wanted to be independent. He wanted to be like his art, which flowed independently without a single care about the world.\nBut currently he was utterly unprepared for what came next.\nFive demon gods, their forms a grotesque mockery of life. They ripped through the fabric of his God space. It was a violation, a brutal intrusion of filth into a pristine sanctuary.\n\"Who... who are you?\" Sheeren stammered, his divine form trembling, the beautiful sculptures around him cracking under the sheer pressure of their malevolent auras.\nThe five demons just laughed. They circled him like sharks, savoring his terror.\nOne, a creature of shadow and whispers, began to murmur echoes of Sheeren’s deepest insecurities in his ear.\nAnother, whose fingers dripped with a corrosive acid, began to slowly dissolve one of his most prized statues of light, watching with glee as the God of Art winced in psychic pain.\nThis was not a battle. It was a game, and Sheeren was their toy.\nSunny’s consciousness was pulled from its deep state of comprehension.\n[Master, an independent God is being attacked by five demon gods. They have not engaged him in combat yet. They are... playing with him.]\n\"They are that eager?\" Sunny chuckled, but there was no humor in the sound. The demons had just made the first move on his board.\nHe had been planning a grand, sweeping strategy, making every God come under him. but this... this was an opportunity for a much more direct, much more easier thing to do.\n\"Until the Demon Lords personally attack, I am truly immortal,\" he whispered to himself.\nWith a single thought, he tore a portal open in his God space. It was not a gateway to Veridia or to his new universe.\nIt was a shimmering, stable tear in reality that connected directly to the chaos unfolding in Sheeren’s invaded realm.\nThe five demon gods froze, their taunting laughter dying in their throats. They turned as one. In the center of Sheeren’s violated God space, a portal of pure, undeniable cosmic power now hung in the air.\nFrom its depths, they felt a gaze. A powerful, and deeply amused gaze that seemed to say, ’You’ve had your fun, children. Now it’s my turn.’\n’i want to say, courting death so bad’ sunny thought, but didn’t voiced it aloud. As this was a fantasy trope not a cultivation one.\nHe walked out of the portal and looked at the five demon gods with amused expression, though the demon gods were unaware of his expression as his face was covered with mask.",

      "content": "Chapter 169: Ch 169 : A Live Execution\n\"W-who are you?\" one of the demon gods stammered, his arrogant sneer gone, replaced by a primal fear.\nThe aura rolling off the masked figure in the portal wasn’t just powerful; it was absolute, a fundamental law of the universe that instantly made him feel like an insect before a star.\n\"God Cosmos! Please, save me!\" Sheeren, the God of Art, cried out.\nHis God space was in ruins, his beautiful sculptures of light corroded and shattered.\nThe demons had been toying with him, whispering his deepest failures into his mind while they slowly dismantled his world.\nThe arrival of God Cosmos was a single ray of light in an endless, dark jungle of despair.\n’You ruined my dramatic entrance, you fool,’ Sunny thought with a flash of his old human annoyance.\nHe had been about to reply to the demon’s question with a single, chilling word: ’Death’.\nHe stepped through the portal, his cosmic robe swirling around him.\n\"Do not worry,\" his voice was a calm, resonant hum that instantly soothed Sheeren’s frayed nerves. \"As the Emperor of all Gods, I will surely protect one of our own.\"\nThe statement was not a boast; it was a declaration of fact, broadcast to the billions of Gods, both Pantheon and independent, who were now watching this scene unfold.\nSheeren didn’t hesitate. He fell to his knees. \"My Emperor, please help me!\"\nSunny gave a slight nod in his mind and turned his full attention to the five demon gods. His gaze, two swirling galaxies of infinite depth, sent a shiver of pure terror down their spines.\n\"W-what do you want?\" one of them managed to ask, his voice trembling. They wanted to run, to tear open a portal and flee back to the demonic realm, but the pressure emanating from Sunny was a physical weight, a cage of pure authority that held them pinned in place.\n\"You,\" Sunny said, a cold grin spreading behind his mask. \"I am the boss here. That means when I ask a question, you will answer truthfully. Otherwise...\" He left the threat hanging in the air.\n\"D-dream on!\" one of the demons, his pride warring with his terror, spat back. \"We are proud demon gods! Don’t you think that we will—\"\nHe never finished the sentence.\nSunny didn’t even move. The defiant demon simply froze mid-word. His eyes bulged, a silent scream of pure, unadulterated terror forming on his lips as a blinding white light began to shine from within him, outlining every bone and organ.\nThere was no sound, no grand explosion. He simply... dissolved, turning into a shower of fine, crimson mist that gently settled on the floor of the God space.\nWhat the four remaining demons saw was their comrade boasting one second, and the next, he was simply gone, leaving only a faint red stain on the ground.\nThis silent, instantaneous erasure was a thousand times more terrifying than any loud, flashy attack.\nThis was a palm technique Sunny had witnessed in the River of Time, a technique from an old God that he had analyzed and perfected with his God’s Eye.\nIt was a simple, brutal concept: fill a being with more energy than it can possibly contain, until it explodes from the inside out.\nThis with the use of time stop, and this palm technique the demon god was gone for good.\nThe color drained from the faces of the four remaining demons. Their very souls were screaming at them to run, to flee, to do anything but stand before this monster.\n\"Now,\" Sunny asked again, his voice laced with a sweet poison that worked all too well, \"who among you is smart enough to tell me what I want?\"\n\"W-we will not... we are the demon gods...\" another one stammered, his loyalty battling his overwhelming fear.\nBOOM.\nAnother silent flash of internal light. Another shower of crimson mist. Now there were three. Sheeren let out a small, terrified gasp, followed by a cheer of pure, vengeful joy.\n\"Anyone else need to go?\" Sunny asked, his voice as calm as a still lake.\nThe three remaining demon gods trembled, but they held their heads high, their pride as the elite of the demonic realm their only remaining shield. \"We will not betray our master,\" they said in unison, their voices shaking but resolute.\n\"Good spirit,\" Sunny said, a genuine note of admiration in his voice. He respected their loyalty. But he would not be denied.\nHe gave a single command, an act of will that consumed a trillion faith points as if they were a single drop in the ocean.\n\"You shall not speak any lie from now on. Your souls shall be eternally bound to the Law of Truth.\"\nA wave of pure, golden law erupted from Sunny.\nIt was not an attack. It was a judgment. It washed over the three remaining demons, sinking into their souls not like a blade, but like a dye, permanently staining their very essence with a single, absolute concept.\n\"What are you spouting?\" one of the demons snarled, trying to maintain his bravado.\n\"You do not have the right to ask questions,\" Sunny replied, his grin turning cold. \"You only have the right to answer. And you will answer, even if you do not want to.\" He leaned forward. \"So, who sent you here?\"\n’I will never tell you! I will die first!’ the demon’s mind screamed in defiance. But his mouth, now a slave to a higher law, moved on its own.\nThe words spilled out, each one a betrayal he was powerless to stop. \"We... we were sent here by the Demon Lords’ order.\"\nThe demon’s eyes widened in horror at his own unwilling confession.\n\"And what is your goal?\" Sunny pressed, his voice relentless.\n\"Our goal is to kill as many independent Gods as possible and scare the rest,\" the second demon confessed against his will, \"so that in their desperation, they will send their lifeforms into the Realm of Advancement to find the SSS-Grade treasures.\"\n\"And how many of you are there,\" Sunny asked, his final, crucial question, \"roaming the multiverse in search of gods to hunt?\"\nAcross the cosmos, six billion Gods watched this interrogation, broadcast live by Thea. The God Chat was a storm.\nNyx: \"Did you see that? He didn’t even move... Boss, can you kill me like that sometime?\"\nZir: \"Forget killing! I want to learn that palm technique! Did you see it?! If not, then review the video at with every frame. Boss, open a class in the Divine Library! I’ll pay anything!\"\nThe chat erupted in a chaotic mix of awe, fear, and fanatical praise. Sunny, the cause of it all, didn’t notice a single comment. His entire focus was on the terrified demon god, waiting for the answer that would reveal the true scale of the war to come.",

      "content": "Chapter 170: Ch 170 : A Hope\nThe God Chat was a whirlwind of frantic speculation. The image of the three remaining terrified demon gods, held captive by the God Cosmos, had every God on the edge of their throne.\nZir: \"How many do you all think there are? The real number? My guess is in the billions! The demons are going all-in!\"\nAsura: \"A thousand, perhaps? Even for the Demon Lords, mobilizing their entire force of gods has a cost. They are arrogant, not foolish.\"\nNyx: \"Only a thousand? Are you out of your mind, Asura? They sent hundreds of millions of demigods into the Realm of Advancement without batting an eye. I am with Zir. This is a full-scale invasion.\"\nStrategist: \"My thoughts align with Asura’s. Intervention on this scale is draining, even for a Demon Lord. They would not commit all of their forces to a single, coordinated attack. This must be a strategic deployment, not a total war.\"\nAs the cosmic jury debated, Sunny turned his attention back to his prisoners.\nThe demon god, bound by the Law of Truth, began to speak, his body twitching as the words were ripped from his soul against his will.\n\"All of us,\" he snarled, a flicker of cunning triumph flashing in his eyes. He had found the loophole. He could speak a truth that was also the greatest lie.\n\"The Demon Lord has decreed for all the demon gods to come to the world of the living and kill all the Gods.\"\nA wave of pure, existential terror washed over the six billion watching Gods. All of them.\nThe number was incomprehensible, a death sentence for the multiverse. The demon god grinned internally.\nHe had followed the command to speak the truth, but he had chosen a truth that would sow the maximum amount of fear.\nHe had won.\nBut he was playing a child’s game of wordplay with a God who had already read the last page of the history book.\nA slow, amused chuckle escaped Sunny. \"A good answer,\" he said, his voice dripping with condescending praise that made the demon’s blood run cold.\n\"But let me ask again. I know what the order was. My question is, how many of the demon gods are actually obeying that order and coming here to kill?\"\nThe demon god’s triumphant smirk froze, then shattered. A look of pure shock and horror replaced it.\nHow could he know? How could he possibly know that many of the demon gods, proud and protective of their own power, had chosen to ignore the suicidal command?\nIf the gazes of a soul could kill, Sunny would have been annihilated a thousand times over by the sheer hatred in the demon’s eyes.\nWith a low growl that was half-fury and half-despair, the demon god was forced to speak the real truth. \"Around... twenty thousand.\"\nThe collective sigh of relief from the God Chat was so immense it almost felt like a physical wave.\nTwenty thousand was a terrifying number, but it was not the apocalyptic army of billions they had just imagined.\nSunny’s own face, however, fell slightly behind his mask. The fear had been a useful tool.\nA manageable number like twenty thousand might make the independent Gods feel a little too confident, a little too bold.\n\"And why were you five together?\" Sunny pressed, his voice relentless. \"Is one of you not enough to handle a God as weak as him?\" He gestured towards Sheeren, but the angle of the projection made it feel as if he were pointing at every single God watching, a subtle reminder of their own fragility.\n\"We are friends since childhood,\" the demon confessed swiftly. \"Whatever we do, we are always together.\"\n\"Okay,\" Sunny said, his tone suddenly final. \"Now you can go to the Netherworld.\" He snapped his fingers.\nThe three remaining demon gods and the two crimson stains on the floor vanished in an instant, their souls ripped from the God space and sent to their new home in Cerberus’s prison.\nIn the quiet aftermath, Sunny sent a mental directive to Sugata.\nThe souls of Floro and these other powerful beings would be a grand project for the demigod of peace.\nHe would work to cleanse their evil, and one day, they might be reborn as loyal, powerful shields for Veridia and the Cosmic Empire.\nA new message, a public proclamation, suddenly filled the God Chat.\nSheeren: \"@Cosmos, I, Sheeren, plead before my Emperor. Forgive me for not joining the Pantheon when I had the chance. I wished to be independent, but I was a fool. I forgot that independence requires a strength, that I do not possess.\"\nThe message caught everyone’s attention. This was the God they had just watched being saved from the brink of annihilation.\nSheeren: \"Thus, I have decided. From this day forward, I am a subordinate of God Cosmos. My life is his to take. I will forever be loyal to him, and only him.\"\nA stir went through the 500 million independent Gods. They saw an opening.\nIf Sheeren, a non-member, could earn a place through such a public display of fealty, then perhaps the door to the Pantheon was not truly closed.\nCosmos: \"I am grateful for your loyalty, Sheeren. But as I have said, the chance to join the Pantheon is gone forever. None of you will be added to its ranks.\"\nThe bubble of hope that had been forming in the hearts of the independent Gods popped with a brutal finality.\nCosmos: \"But know this,\" Sunny’s next message was a cold splash of terrifying reality. \"The twenty thousand demon gods that are coming are on a hunt. And they will not stop until all 500 million of you are dead.\"\nA wave of pure, abject despair washed over the independent Gods. Their hearts sank to the deepest, darkest trenches of the ocean.\nThey had been abandoned, left to face an army of hunters alone.\nThey didn’t even bother to ask why the Pantheon was safe; they had just witnessed their Emperor casually erase five demon gods without breaking a sweat.\nBut just as their despair reached its absolute peak, a new message from Sunny appeared, a single, fragile thread of hope in an ocean of darkness.",

You will not receive the full benefits of the Pantheon, but you will be safe. However, you will still need to sign a contract of fealty.\"\nThe message from God Cosmos was not a negotiation. It was a lifeline.\nTo the 500 million independent Gods, huddled in their isolated God spaces and staring into the abyss of a coming death, it was the bitter taste of surrender and the sweet relief of survival, all in one.\nUnfair? Absolutely. But did anyone object? Not a single soul.\nThis had been Sunny’s intention from the start. He would unite the entire multiverse under his banner, the wise through alliance, and the proud through necessity.\nThe independent Gods, unaware of the immense passive benefits they were about to receive, saw only two things: a demand for their loyalty and a promise of protection from the coming storm.\nThey thought they were giving up their freedom and the dream of a Divine Embryo for mere safety.\nBut for them, in this moment, safety was everything.\nThey feared the ancient, powerful demon gods far more than they feared servitude to a new, benevolent emperor.\nOne by one, the requests to sign the contract flooded Thea’s network. All 500 million of them.\nWith that final, mass capitulation, Sunny had truly become the God of all the Gods in his home multiverse.\nHe was a Void-born, a natural force of the cosmos, and he now stood as the sole, undisputed ruler of a realm that was about to face its greatest trial.\nFar away, in another multiverse, one forged by the ancient Void-born God Artifex, the God of Cards, a God that held a multiverse of power in the palm of his hand.\nSunny was aware of this God from the past, and Artifec was one of the few that he really liked, because most of the Gods were only good at one or two things.\nBut Artifex? He was good at everything; one time he would be using fist the other second he would slice someone with a sword.\nBut in the end he still died, and now a new God was beginning to take shape in his old multiverse.\nThis man stood in a vast, rune-etched chamber, his eyes glued to the simple, unassuming card he had just created.\nIt was a plain, unadorned thing, with a single word etched upon its surface in glowing, golden script: Strength.\nBut this was no ordinary card. It was an SSS-Grade Card, the culmination of a century of tireless work.\nWith a deep breath, he brought the card to his chest. A magical thing happened. The card did not burn or break; it dissolved, melting into his very being like a drop of ink in water. Power, raw and explosive, erupted within him.\nHis muscles, already bulging with a demigod’s might, swelled and hardened even further, his physique becoming a monument of force.\nHe felt as if he could shatter an entire solar system with the mere shockwave of a finger snap.\nHis sweat-drenched clothes, already strained, tore apart under the expansion of his new form.\nHe walked out of his chamber, a being reborn. A servant immediately bowed low. \"Your Majesty, congratulations on breaking through once again,\" she said, her voice filled with reverence.\nThe man simply nodded, but as he did, he felt a strange, unnerving sensation. A minuscule fraction of the immense power he had just gained simply... vanished. ’What is happening?’ he thought, a flicker of confusion in his mind.\nHe walked through his palace, and with every interaction, every casual command given to a mortal servant, every simple touch of a palace door, he felt another tiny piece of his new strength drain away.\nThat night, he stood in his chamber, looking at his reflection. His physique was still immense, but it was visibly smaller than it had been that morning.\nHe had spent the day experimenting, testing his new limits, and had come to a single, profound, and lonely conclusion.\n\"So... I am a God now,\" he whispered to his reflection. \"And a God cannot directly intervene in the world of mortals.\" The ancient legends he had studied were true.\nl had spent his entire life climbing a mountain, sacrificing everything to reach the peak, only to find himself utterly alone in the thin, cold air, separated from the very world he wished to rule by the strength he had just gained.\nThis was the law of this multiverse, a system designed by its creator to be both rewarding and demanding.\nHere, power was not given; it was forged. Lifeforms created ’cards’ by gathering rare resources and binding concepts into a physical form.\nHe remembered the eighty years it had taken to gather the heart of a dying star, the crystallized sorrow of a mermaid queen, and the essence of a thousand lightning bolts; all to forge this single, perfect SSS-Grade card that had pushed him over the edge into godhood.\nIt was a power system that demanded immense hard work, and he, its greatest practitioner, had just won the ultimate prize and the loneliest curse.\n\"According to the texts, now I can travel to different multiverses, fight them, and learn something new,\" he said, his lips forming a grin.\n​He didn’t want to live in this multiverse anyway; after all, he was the king who had ruled it for more than three hundred thousand years. He had done everything to make the empire stronger, but in the process, he had become something too terrifying for mortals. He believed it was time to leave and find equally strong Gods to fight.\n​But before leaving, he chose to make his crown prince the King of the empire, ensuring that even in his absence, the empire would always grow.\n​And then, with a casual jump, he broke free from his planet, escaping the solar system and then the universe itself. But escaping the multiverse was a different matter entirely.\nHe also needed to find many different materials to create other cards and increase his strength, as strength was the only thing that connected all the multiverses.",

      "content": "Chapter 172: Ch 172 : The Era of New Gods\nWhile Sunny’s empire consolidated its power, a new dawn was breaking across the countless multiverses, an age where the ascension of new gods was becoming an increasingly common spectacle.\nOn a multiverse teeming with a many races but one stood out the most, the terrifyingly adaptive race: the Zerg.\nHere, evolution was a bloody, brutal harvest. The Zerg consumed the essence of other races, drinking their blood to fuel their own transformation, stealing the talents of the conquered to add to their own formidable arsenal.\nThe other native races of that multiverse were not just being defeated; they were being erased, their unique genetic codes becoming mere footnotes in the Zerg’s relentless march to perfection.\nThe number one genius of this race, a creature whose body was a horrifying and beautiful mosaic of a hundred different conquered species, yet somehow harmonious.\nThis being was a legend, his name whispered in fear and reverence across thousands of years as the torchbearer of his people.\nIts success was due to a rare SS-Grade talent, ’Infuser’, which allowed it to achieve perfect evolution with the smallest drop of blood, a gift that set it far above the billions of other Zerg who might consume entire worlds and never evolve at all.\nAs he was the first zerg who was born with infuser talent, while the other zergs died without evolving, he survived. His children who inherited this talent be it a somewhat downgraded version.\nBut that was enough, enough to make the zerg race reign supreme by this talent of this zerg.\nAt its core, it clutched a vial containing a single drop of shimmering, rainbow-colored blood—the essence of a Qilin.\n\"With this, I can finally evolve once again,\" the Zerg’s voice echoed, a sound that was a chorus of a thousand different stolen voices. \"Now, no one can stop me from evolving further.\"\nIn another multiverse, this one crackling with raw, untamed energy. For nine days and nine nights, this universe had tried to kill a single man.\nDragons of pure tribulation lightning had clawed at his soul, storms of cosmic fire had sought to turn him to ash.\nA man sat in the lotus position at the heart of this apocalyptic storm, his expression serene. He did not fight the tribulation; he absorbed it.\nAs more and more energy funneled into his being, the entire multiverse boomed, and a new, majestic aura washed over the universe he inhabited.\nOn the worlds below, every mortal, from the lowliest farmer to the most powerful emperor, felt the suffocating, awe-inspiring pressure of a new God.\n\"Who could cause such a commotion with just a breakthrough?\" a voice in a bustling city square whispered, the crowd’s gaze fixed on the lightning-filled sky.\n\"Who do you think it could be?\" another replied, as if the answer was obvious. \"Is it even a question? Who else could go against the heavens with such fury that the entire universe trembles? It can only be Cai Zhen.\"\nThe chatter grew, a wave of reverence and fear, until the figure in the void finally opened his eyes.\nHis face was breathtakingly handsome, his every movement a flawless symphony of power and grace.\nAs he descended from the void and walked upon the world for the first time as a God, he, too, felt it; a subtle, constant drain on his newfound power. In the days that followed, Cai Zhen, like the card master before him, would learn the lonely truth of divinity and its limitations.\nAcross a million other realities, similar scenes were playing out. A new era was dawning.\nAn Era of Gods. And all of them, from the hungry Zerg to the enlightened Cai Zhen, shared a single, burning desire: to break the barriers of their own reality and test their strength against the other Gods of the cosmos.\n[Master, another century has passed in Veridia.] Thea’s melodious voice pulled Sunny from his comprehension of law of manifestation.\n\"Have the preparations for the tournament been made?\" Sunny asked.\n[Yes, Master,] she replied, her efficiency absolute. [The contracts for all 500 million new subordinate Gods have been finalized, and their planets have been safely relocate]\n[Every sentient lifeform in your territory now has access to the system, be it the lifeforms under other Gods.]\n[The live broadcast infrastructure for the tournament is in place; every citizen will be able to watch their champions compete.]\n[And finally, my primary scouting mission is complete. My particles have been replicated across the entirety of the Realm of Advancement. Not a single place is outside my watch. I have located every demon demigod currently residing in that realm.]\nA cold, predatory smile touched Sunny’s lips. The hunters were now the hunted. \"Good. Very good.\"\nHis thoughts drifted to Adam, who now spent his days on his restored world, a quiet, verdant planet nestled safely within Sunny’s subspace.\nHe was always by the token, speaking to the sleeping soul of Freya, a lonely vigil that had lasted for centuries.\nWith a sigh, Sunny took out his own green token, the one engraved with the name ’Cosmos’.\nHe activated it. His soul was instantly unmoored from his divine form, pulled through a river of stars, and deposited in an instant at the very center of the Realm of Advancement.\nThe journey, which would have been impossible for any other God, had consumed not a single point of faith. He had arrived.\nHe stood in an arena so vast that entire worlds could fit within its colossal walls.\nHe took his place on the highest seat, a throne reserved for the realm’s master, and placed his hand on a smooth, red orb that rested before him.\nThis orb was the control nexus for the entire arena.\nWith his clones left to watch over his empire, he closed his eyes and sent out his will through the orb.\nIt was not a shout, but a gentle, irresistible whisper that traveled through all the multiverses, through the fabric of the cosmos, and into the soul of every God who had pledged fealty to him in his home multiverse. The whisper said only one thing:\n’It is time.’",

The arena where Lord Adam summoned us?\" one God whispered, his voice filled with awe as he gazed at the colossal structure.\n\"Yes, it looks the same,\" another replied, running an ethereal hand over the smooth, cosmic material of his new throne. \"But is it the original, or just a perfect copy?\"\nTheir hushed speculation was cut short as a single voice, calm and absolute, washed over them. It was Sunny, seated on the highest throne at the very pinnacle of the arena, a king looking down upon his court.\n\"First of all, welcome to the Arena of Epiphany,\" he said. \"And please, take your seats.\"\nThe arena itself seemed to respond to his will. The vast, empty space contracted, the countless tiers of audience seating shrinking until only a single, grand circle of six billion thrones remained at the very top.\nBelow them, a new, even vaster set of stands unfolded, enough to seat trillions. Slowly, every God began to take their seat, friends and families grouping together, the air buzzing with an excited, festive energy.\n\"Ahem.\" Sunny cleared his throat, a simple sound that nonetheless commanded the absolute attention of every being present. \"I hereby declare the start of the first grand contest of our new era. It shall be named... the Tournament of Gods.\"\nThe cheer that erupted was not a sound that traveled through air, but a psychic shockwave of pure joy, a thunderclap created by billions of minds celebrating in unison.\nAcross the new universe, on every one of the 6 billion worlds, every lifeform watching the live broadcast on their system panels roared with excitement.\nIn that single, joyous moment, a tidal wave of over five trillion faith points crashed into Sunny’s reserves.\n\"Before the tournament can officially begin,\" Sunny’s voice boomed, his words a sacred edict carried to every corner of his empire, \"let me tell you the rules.\"\n\"There will be two separate tournaments: one for demigods, and one for lifeforms. Each will have three rounds.\"\n\"The first round is the Trial of Might. Each participant will be tested on their raw physical strength and their magical power. To pass, you need only meet the standard in one of the two trials.\"\n\"The second round is The Crucible. A mass elimination. One million participants will be placed into a single, massive battleground. The last one thousand left standing will advance. All others will be disqualified.\"\n\"The third and final round will be The Ascent of Champions. A series of one-on-one battles, with pairings chosen at random, to determine the ultimate victors.\"\nA profound, focused silence fell over the universe. Not a single soul worried about the threat of demon invasions.\nSunny’s new universe was a sanctuary, disconnected from the demonic realm. And Veridia itself was now so thoroughly patrolled by Thea’s particles that any stray demon who appeared would be instantly annihilated by a targeted particle self-destruction.\nThey were safe. They could enjoy the show.\n\"The Gods may choose any number of their demigods to participate,\" Sunny declared. \"However, for the lifeform tournament, you may only choose ten champions per race from your world.\"\nWith that single statement, the entire purpose of the tournament shifted. It was no longer just about winning a planet; it was about pride. It was a contest to prove the might of one’s entire race on a cosmic stage.\n\"You may choose your champions now,\" Sunny announced.\nA wave of palpable excitement and anxiety washed over every demigod and lifeform.\nIn every city, in every village, every warrior, mage, and hero held their breath, praying their God would choose them.\nThe collective hope of trillions sent another, smaller, but still significant, surge of faith to every God, making them all smile in satisfaction.\nThea’s network worked flawlessly, presenting each God with a detailed list of their strongest candidates, and one by one, the chosen were teleported directly into the grandstands of the arena.\n\"Who should I choose?\" Sunny mused. He delegated the choice of mortal champions to the leaders of his races.\nBut for the demigods... ’Why choose a few, when you can choose all of them?’ he thought. With a single, silent command, his demigods began to appear in their designated stand.\nThe arena stands, each large enough to hold a small army, began to fill.\nIn the section designated for Sunny’s champions, a powerful, confident figure appeared.\nHe was a half-orc, radiating the immense, newly-ascended power of a demigod. Ragnok grinned. ’Am I the only demigod God Cosmos is entering in the lifeform tournament? Victory is surely mine.’\nHis confident thought was short-lived. As two more figures materialized beside him, their auras just as powerful.\nThe first was the ever-charming Gorgon queen, Medusa, who offered him a polite, serpentine smile. The other was a half-elf whose presence was a calm, deep ocean of wisdom, Light Celestine.\n\"Greetings, Ragnok and Medusa,\" he said with a polite smile. \"I go by the name Light Celestine and known as a humble teacher.\"\nAs these three conversed, the attention of the entire universe focused on them.\nLifeform1029: \"Wait... are those DEMIGODS?! How is this a fair tournament if God Cosmos is entering demigods in the lifeform competition?!\"\nLifeform1823: \"It’s not against the rules. Demigods created by a God are different from lifeforms who ascend naturally. Technically, they are still considered lifeforms, just at the peak of their evolution.\"\nLifeform1838: \"Technically?! It’s still completely unfair! Our champions don’t stand a chance!\"\nA wave of unease and whispers of unfairness began to ripple through the quadrillions of watching lifeforms.\nSunny let the murmurs build for a moment. Then, his projection appeared on every screen in the universe. \"I believe you have all misunderstood something,\" he said, his voice cutting through the chaos.\nHe gestured to the stand where the three powerful beings stood. \"That is not the stand for my mortal champions. That,\" he declared, his voice ringing with power, \"is the stand for my demigods.\"\nAs he spoke, the space above that stand did not just shimmer; it shattered.\nA colossal, serpentine form of pure hope, Shenlong, glided through. He was followed by a hound of hellfire and shadow, Cerberus, whose three heads surveyed the crowd with burning menace.\nThen came the angels of life, the guardians of the elements, the silent keepers of the world’s domains... They kept coming. Dozens. Then hundreds.\nThe stand, which had seemed so large just moments ago, was now overflowing with an impossible army of divine beings, their collective aura a crushing weight of absolute power.\nThe universe fell into a stunned, jaw-dropping silence.\nSunny’s voice was calm, almost casual, as he pointed to a much smaller, still-empty stand beside the divine army.\n\"That one,\" he said, \"is the stand for my lifeforms.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 174: Ch 174 : The Parade of the Cosmic Empire\nThe Arena of Epiphany was a universe unto itself, a cosmic coliseum where six billion Gods sat in high thrones and quadrillions of lifeforms held their collective breath.\nThe live chat, a river of messages, connecting every soul in the 6 billion worlds, was a best way to earn faith, as another 5 trillion faith was produced by them by looking at these DemiGods.\nLifeform125312: \"One... two... three... four... Two hundred and sixty-six demigods. Am I even counting that right? What am I witnessing?\" The message was a trembling whisper that echoed the thoughts of trillions who were seeing the true might of their Emperor for the first time.\nLifeform17 : \"What you are witnessing is the greatness of God Cosmos. And trust me, you will be even more surprised when you see the mortal champions of Veridia.\" The reply was filled with a fierce, unshakable pride that only those from the heart of the empire could possess.\nLifeform27277 : \"Are you from Veridia? We only got this system a few years ago, but the technology and magic we’ve seen from your world... it has changed everything for us. I’m inspired.\"\nThe chat buzzed with this newfound sense of connection, a universe of strangers united by a single, spectacular event.\nThe lifeforms of the Veridia could watch this live, because their time flow was synchronized with the arena by Sunny, a gift of shared experience that was as profound as any blessing.\nOn the highest tier, the Gods themselves were having their own conversation.\n\"Boss, I knew you had many demigods, but... this many?\" Zir asked, his voice a mix of awe and playful accusation. \"Are you secretly farming faith from another multiverse somewhere?\" He was oblivious to the fact that the six billion Gods surrounding him were the very farm he was talking about.\n\"It’s nothing,\" Sunny said, masterfully evading the subject. He gestured to the vast arena below. \"Hurry up and choose your champions. After that, I will let you meet our referee for this tournament.\"\n\"A referee?\" a God asked, his curiosity piqued. \"Who could possibly be worthy of refereeing a contest of this scale? Another demigod? Thea herself?\"\nSunny just grinned, a gesture of showmanship, and waved his hand, signaling them to make their choices.\nOne by one, the Gods selected their champions, they arrived one after one. But Sunny just waited for all to come.\nAfter every God was done, ’its time’ sunny thought, And then, the grand parade of the champions of Veridia, the heart of the empire, began.\nFirst came the humans, marching in perfect, disciplined formation, their weapons gleeming in the sunlight.\nAt their head was King Anaske, his presence a quiet mountain of pure, contained strength.\nHe was a top-tier S-Grade Body Refiner, a single, final step away from the demigod realm, his every movement a display of absolute control.\nBehind him marched nine of the human kingdom’s greatest heroes, each radiating the powerful, unwavering aura of a peak S-Grade warrior. They were the bedrock of the Cosmic Empire, its unyielding shield.\nThey were followed by a procession of shimmering, ethereal light. The elves entered, led by their wise king, Vel, a master S-Grade mage whose body was surrounded by the faint, multi-colored energy of the hundreds of elemental spirits bound to his will.\nBut it was the five figures out of the nine elves behind him that drew gasps from the knowledgeable lifeforms of Veridia.\nThey were the Ancestors, ancient elves from a centuries ago, their delicate, gazelle-like horns a mark of their primordial lineage.\nOnce withering at the end of their long lives, they had been blessed by their demigod and forged into pillars of the elven race by the power of Divine Growth.\nThey were living history, a testament to the Sunny’s grace. Even Sunny felt a flicker of nostalgia seeing them.\nThen, the very arena began to tremble. The titans entered, their leader Atlas at the front, each step a minor earthquake.\nTheir bodies, already colossal when they first arrived on Veridia, had continued to grow under the influence of the world’s rich mana, each one now a walking mountain of living flesh and stone.\nThey were followed in a grand parade by the other founding races of Veridia: the fierce orcs led by the warchief Thrak; the mighty giants led by Hafthor; the beastfolk led by Leonis; the Machina led by Alpha-Prime; the inventive dwarves led by Jasper; and the ethereal fairies and pixies, led by Eira and Lyra.\nThey were followed by Cassandra from the seer race created by Isiah, Thanatos from the Grim reaper race created by Cerberus, Seraphina from the angels and Brynhildr from the Valkyries.\nThe merfolk, led by Queen Thalassa, appeared in a massive, floating sphere of summoned ocean water, a breathtaking display of magical control.\n’Now it’s time for the aura farmers... I mean, the protectors,’ Sunny thought with an internal smirk.\nThe atmosphere in the arena shifted, a palpable change that silenced the murmuring crowds.\nA wave of pure, draconic pressure washed over every soul, a power earned through thousands of brutal, life-or-death battles.\nTen figures, covered in black, obsidian-like scales, marched in perfect, lethal unison, their fiery eyes burning with an unshakeable resolve.\nAt their head was Thalorax. They were the Dragonborn, the Protectors of Veridia.\nThe lifeforms of Veridia cheered for their guardians, while the beings from other worlds cheered for the sheer, terrifying majesty of the creatures before them.\nThey were followed by the ten champions of the Gorgon race, led by a powerful S-Grade warrior named Lamia, their serpentine movements both beautiful and deadly, their gazes promising a swift, stony end to any who would oppose them.\n’Two races left,’ Sunny thought, a thrill of anticipation running through him. ’These two will cause the most stir.’\nAs if on cue, the joyous cheers faltered, then died completely.\nA sudden, heavy gloom fell over the arena, a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature.\nThe space at the entrance to the stands seemed to darken, and from a tear in the void, ten beings walked through.\nTheir bodies were the size of humans and elves, but their eyes were pure, solid black, and from their brows grew a pair of sharp, demonic horns.\nA wave of confusion, revulsion, and fear washed over the audience.\nDemons. The embodiment of evil. The eternal enemy. They had been raised on stories of demonic slaughter, their worlds scarred by their invasions.\nAnd yet, here they were, marching under the banner of the Emperor, their expressions not of malice, but of quiet, unshakeable resolve.\nThese were The Unchained, the demonic races who had surrendered to Sunny’s rule, their wills now free from the corrupting influence of the Demon Lords.\nAt their head was Maverick, the first of their kind born on Veridia, a favorite of the demigod Diablo. The audience could not comprehend what they were seeing.\nBut the greatest shock was yet to come.\nAs the Unchained took their place, the very fabric of the Arena of Epiphany began to scream.\nThe sky, a moment ago a brilliant spectacle that was filled with clear clouds and blue sky, cracked like black glass.\nThe ground split open, not with simple fissures, but with deep, wounds that wept untamed chaos.\nThe heavens spewed fire and cast down bolts of raw, primordial thunder.\nFrom the broken space, ten pairs of eyes peered the souls of every lifeform watching the tournament.",

      "content": "Chapter 175: Ch 175 : A Gift\nA hushed, terrified silence had fallen over the Arena of Epiphany.\nThe appearance of The Unchained had already shattered the audience’s understanding of their world, but the entity that followed them was a different order of being entirely.\nThe very fabric of the arena screamed, the sky cracking like black glass, the ground bleeding pure chaos.\nLifeform125312: \"What... what are those things? The eyes... they look like the eyes of the Dragonborn, but... much scarier and magestical.\" The message was a trembling whisper in the live chat, echoing the primal fear that had gripped trillions of souls.\nLifeform1447 : \"That same feeling... that pressure... it is the same as Demigod Nova’s.\"\nThe mystery was unveiled as the first of the ten beings stepped through the rift.\nIt was Volthrax, the first natural-born dragon of Veridia. He was not as colossal as the titans, but he radiated a presence that made him seem infinitely larger.\nIt was the sheer, suffocating weight of his draconic pressure, an ancient and absolute authority that declared him the apex predator in every universe.\nHe was followed by eight others, each a symphony of elemental fury—one wreathed in lightning, another whose scales were forged from living diamond, a third whose every breath left a trail of frost in the air.\nBut it was the tenth dragon that drew a collective gasp from the leaders of the Cosmic Empire. It was a magnificent dragon of shimmering green like Shenlong’s, its scales like polished jade, and from its eyes shone a familiar, noble light. It was Thorn.\nHe had chosen not to participate as a representative of the human race he had once ruled.\nIn the centuries since his rebirth, he had come to understand the deep, unbreakable laws of karma.\nHe owed his second life to his master, and he would repay that debt with every fiber of his being.\nHe would not fight for the glory of humans; he would fight for the glory of his master, Demigod Shenlong, as a dragon.\nFrom the human stands, Anaske’s eyes widened, a wave of pure joy washing over his kingly composure. \"Father!\" he waved, his voice a shout across the vast arena.\nWith a single, powerful beat of his wings, Thorn covered the impossible distance, landing before the human champion’s stand with a ground-shaking thud that was both terrifying and gentle.\n\"It is good to see you are doing well, my child,\" Thorn’s voice rumbled, the sound a mix of a dragon’s deep growl and a father’s warm affection.\nFor a few precious moments, the tournament, the gods, and the fate of the universe faded away, and it was just a father and a son, reunited after a century of separation.\nAs the champions reacquainted themselves, and the trillions of lifeforms waited with bated breath, Sunny’s voice finally boomed, signaling the end of the parade and the beginning of the contest.\n\"I, God Cosmos, Emperor of this Pantheon, hereby declare that the Tournament of Gods has officially begun!\"\nJust as the words left his lips, the very space at the center of the arena tore open. It was not the controlled, shimmering gateway of a teleportation array, but a raw, authoritative rip in reality itself, as if the person arriving owned the very rules of this realm.\nFrom the tear, a figure emerged, his presence an ancient, overwhelming pressure that made even the gods on their thrones sit up straighter. Billions of years of history and power radiated from him.\nThe six billion Gods stared, their minds utterly broken for the second time that day. For them, he was a myth, a legend from a bygone era, a god who should be dead by now. And yet, there he stood. Adam, the God of Growth.\nSunny rose from his throne, a genuine smile on his face. \"Greetings, Adam,\" he said, his voice carrying across the silent arena. \"I am happy you were willing to be the referee for this small tournament of ours.\"\nAdam returned the polite nod, then turned his gaze to the trillions watching. \"Greetings to all the Gods, demigods, and lifeforms of this new era. My name is Adam. Though I wished to participate in this tournament myself, but sadly I have no creations of my own to field. Therefore, I can only serve as your referee.\" His voice was a calm river.\n\"As the referee,\" he declared, \"I commence the start of this tournament!\" he said with a raise of his hand.\nWith a single, sweeping gesture of his hand, the arena transformed. Millions of towering pillars, each hundreds of feet tall, erupted from the ground.\nThey were of two types: one of grey, unyielding stone, and the other of a deep, pulsating blue crystal that hummed with magical energy.\n\"The first trial will test your fundamental capabilities,\" Adam announced. \"It is a test of strength. You will choose one of these two pillars. The grey is the Pillar of Might. The blue is the Pillar of Mana. You will be teleported before the pillar of your choosing. Your task is simple: leave your mark upon it.\"\nTwo options flashed on the system panels of every chosen champion. The choices were made in an instant, and the arena floor became a chaotic, beautiful storm of teleportation light as millions of lifeforms from across the arena appeared before their chosen trials.\nSunny watched, a flicker of pride in his heart. He wasn’t worried. As every single champion from Veridia was an S-Grade powerhouse on the verge of ascension.\nThis was a mere formality for them. His thoughts turned to a different being, one whose battlefield was not this arena, but the entire Realm of Advancement itself.\n\"Nexus,\" he whispered.\nFrom the ground at the foot of his throne, a pool of black, viscous liquid seeped upwards. In under a second, it coalesced into a small, round, perfectly black slime that quivered with a joyful energy.\n\"Greetings, Master!\" Nexus’s voice was a happy, bubbling sound in Sunny’s mind.\n\"I was in a hurry when I created you,\" Sunny said, his voice gentle. \"I only gave you a single talent. While it is more than enough for you to win this tournament with ease, it is still unfair for you to only have one.\"\nHe looked at the little slime, the all-powerful and utterly loyal master of this entire realm, and his mind raced.\nHe thought of the billions of demon demigods now flooding into this reality, a tide of pure malice. He placed a hand on Nexus’s slimy form.\nHe bestowed upon him a second talent: Corpse Absorption. An ominous name, but a brutally effective ability.\nWith this, Nexus would grow stronger with every death that occurred within the Realm of Advancement, friend or foe.\nIt was a power that would turn this entire, coming war into a personal feast for his new demigod, a way to solve the problem of its weakness outside its home turf.\nThen, he bestowed a third: Slime Army. A talent that would allow Nexus to create millions of smaller, semi-sentient slimes.\nThey would be his hands, his eyes, and his army. And, Sunny theorized, if they developed true sentience, they might even become a new, unexpected source of faith, a path for Nexus’s own eventual ascension to godhood.\n\"This is it for now,\" Sunny said with a grin. \"If you need anything, you can contact me through our link.\" He then added, a mischievous glint in his cosmic eyes, \"And I will have a special gift for you in a few hours.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 176: Ch 176 : The Trial\nAs Sunny finalized the new talents for his realm-keeper of the realm of advancement, Nexus, his attention was drawn back to the grand spectacle unfolding in the arena below.\nHis gaze settled on a figure of a dragon born, standing in an upright and magestical pose, he was Thalorax, the leader of the Dragonborn, standing before the gray Pillar of Might.\nThere was no grand display, no roar to the heavens. Thalorax simply stepped forward and threw a single, casual punch.\nThe sound was not as sharp as others, but a deep, resonant BOOM, like the arena itself had just been struck by a giant hammer.\nA visible shockwave of darconic force erupted from the point of impact, washing over the audience and causing the very air to tremble.\nThe pillar, a monolith of cosmic stone designed to withstand immense force, didn’t just shake; it groaned, a deep, pained sound from its very core.\nAnd where his fist had connected, a perfect, deep impression was left, a crater in the reinforced stone that pulsed with a brilliant, emerald green light, signifying a resounding success.\n\"Truly a talented fellow,\" Adam murmured from his position in the air, his ancient eyes alight with appreciation. \"He just needs to comprehend a Law to become a demigod.\"\nThe crowd, which had cheered boisterously for the previous champions, was now utterly silent, their minds struggling to process the sheer, casual power they had just witnessed.\nAs the pillar slowly healed itself, Thalorax teleported back to his stand, where Nova gave him a single, satisfied nod. \"Good work, my child,\" she rumbled, her voice a low hum, but filled with pure pride of a mother.\nBut the spectacle was not over. The next to step forward was Atlas, the leader of the Titans.\nHis every step was a minor earthquake, his presence a living mountain of muscle and primordial strength.\nHe stood before the newly repaired pillar, let out a roar that shook the heavens, and punched.\nThere was no boom this time. Only a sharp, sickening CRUNCH. The pillar, reinforced to withstand the force of a small moon, did not crack. It did not shake. It simply... disintegrated.\nThe front half of the pillar exploded into a cloud of fine, grey dust, leaving behind a gaping, hollowed-out ruin.\nThe silence that followed was even more profound than before. If Thalorax was a master of focused, overwhelming power, Atlas was a natural disaster given form.\nThen came Vel. The elven leader, his every movement a display of serene grace, he teleported not to the Pillar of Might, but to the Pillar of Mana.\nHe placed a single, elegant hand upon its crystalline surface. The pillar didn’t just light up a single or two spheres like it did for others instead it erupted.\nA blinding flash of rainbow-colored light shot into the sky, and from it, hundreds of shimmering spheres of elemental energy bloomed.\nBut they were not just spheres. They took on forms. Tiny dragons of pure fire danced in the air, miniature earth golems beat their chests, sprites of wind chased each other in playful spirals, and mournful spirits of water wept tears of pure mana.\nThey were the elemental spirits he had contracted with, each giving him a great boost of mana and elemental affinity.\nAs the champions of Veridia concluded their awe-inspiring display, Adam’s voice boomed once more. \"What an entertaining test it was! I hope your champions have passed. Now, it is the turn of the demigods.\"\nHe waved a hand, and the colossal stone and mana pillars, already scarred and tested by trillions of mortals, began to glow.\nA new layer of shimmering, cosmic energy wrapped around them.\nAdam then glanced at Nova and Mammon, and shook his head with a knowing smile, adding a second, then a third layer of protection.\nFinally, his gaze fell upon a small, unassuming black slime, Nexus, who was jumping up and down in excitement.\nAdam just smiled. ’No amount of layers could protect these pillars from that one,’ he thought, sensing a power within the slime that was absolute like a emperor’s order in his territory.\nThe trial for the demigods began, and the arena was treated to a parade of divine and monstrous forms from across the multiverse.\nThe first to step forward was a demigod from a God named Storms. He was a being of living lightning, his humanoid form a crackling, semi-transparent silhouette with eyes of pure, white energy.\nHe didn’t punch the Pillar of Might; he simply touched it. A billion volts of raw power discharged into the stone, and the entire pillar lit up from within, glowing a brilliant white before a web of superheated cracks spread across its surface.\nThe pillar cracked and red, began to glow green, as if to show the passing of this demigod.\nHe was followed by a demigod from a Goddess named Oceana.\nIt was a horrifying and beautiful creature, a graceful mermaid from the waist up, but from the waist down, her form dissolved into a mass of writhing, shadowy tentacles.\nShe approached the Pillar of Mana, and as she touched it, it did not light up. Instead, a sphere of absolute, crushing darkness appeared around it, the water vapor in the air freezing into black ice on its surface as a pressure equivalent to the deepest ocean trench tried to implode it.\nThe size of the sphere of darkness and ice combined so big, that it looked like a planet in itself.\nThen came a warrior demigod from a God named War, a lithe, four-armed woman with skin the color of twilight, who wielded four shimmering, curved blades.\nShe moved in a blur, a whirlwind of motion, and in a single, breathtaking second, she left a thousand deep, precise cuts on the pillar’s surface, a display of martial skill so profound it was its own form of magic.\nOne by one, they came, a parade of divine might. A hulking, four-armed demigod with skin of granite. A golem whose body was forged from a single, flawless, house-sized diamond.\nA beautiful, winged woman wreathed in moonlight. A creature of living shadow whose touch seemed to drain the very life from the stone.\nThe sheer diversity of power was a spectacle that left the trillions of mortal lifeforms breathless with awe and a sense of their own, humbling insignificance.\nThe Tournament of Gods was no longer just a competition. It was a revelation, a grand unveiling of the true, terrifying, and beautiful powers that the lifeforms were yet to touch.\nThis was the primary goal of this, as Sunny wanted more and more lifeforms to reach DemiGod realm, who will in future become the very pillar of cosmic empire.",

      "content": "Chapter 177: Ch 177 : The aura farming by DemiGods\nThe air grew thick, heavy with a power that made the quadrillions of mortal lifeforms in their home planet instinctively hold their breath.\nFrom his high throne, Sunny watched with a quiet, fascination as the demigods of his new subordinates took their turns.\nThis was a living gallery of divine creativity, a testament to the ingenuity of the Gods he now ruled.\nHe saw a demigod forged from living starlight, its form a constantly shifting constellation, that struck the Pillar of Might and caused it to chime with the music of the spheres.\nAnother, a being of pure, solidified sound, simply vibrated at a specific frequency, and the Pillar of Mana shattered into a thousand harmonious shards of light.\nHe saw demigods that were living constructs of clockwork and magic, and others that were primal forces of nature given form.\n\"I was a novice,\" Sunny thought with a flash of genuine humility.\nHis own early creations, copied from the novels and myths of his past, felt almost simplistic in comparison to the intricate, purposeful designs of these other Gods. \"If they had possessed my faith reserves,\" he mused, \"they would have created abominations powerful enough to kill all the Demon demigods themselves.\"\nJust then, a name flashed on the roster, and a ripple of anticipation went through the crowd. It was Thea’s turn.\nThe countless motes of light that formed her omnipresent network began to converge in front of the Pillar of Might.\nThey swirled and condensed into the elegant, unassuming form of a human woman in a pristine white shirt and black skirt, a pair of square glasses perched on her nose.\nShe looked like a personal secretary. The sheer, unexpected beauty of her simple form sent a hush through the arena; the hearts of immortals and mortals alike skipped a beat.\nShe didn’t punch the pillar. She didn’t unleash a torrent of magic. She simply walked forward and placed her delicate hand on its surface.\nAnd then, the world went white. A silent, blinding flash of light, followed by a deafening BOOM that shook the arena to its very foundations.\nThis was the doing of her self destruction talent, she blew her hand which was made up of her energy particles.\nWhen the dust cleared, the reinforced pillar, a monolith that had withstood the force of mountains, was gone.\nNot cracked, not shattered, but completely and utterly gone, leaving only a pile of fine, gray rubble that glowed with a soft, emerald light, signifying her pass.\nBefore the dust could even settle, Thea’s form had already reformed, her hand perfectly healed, not a single speck of dust on her immaculate uniform. She gave a polite, almost imperceptible nod to the stunned audience and vanished back into her network.\nThe tournament continued. Most of the demigods, beings of immense power, passed with ease.\nA few, however, failed. Their talents were not designed for raw strength or magic.\nSunny watched as the demigod of the God Sheeren, a being that was a living paintbrush and canvas, was unable to even scratch the pillar. It was a sad, inevitable outcome for a utility-focused creation.\nThen, the name Mammon appeared. The air grew still. Like a ghost stepping out of a forgotten memory, he was simply... there, standing before the Pillar of Might.\nThe audience saw only a fleeting glimpse of his aristocratic, sinister form and the cold, predatory grin on his face before everything went black.\nIt was not a simple darkness. It was an absolute and total negation of existence. Light ceased to travel. Gravity ceased to exist. Sound died.\nFor a single, terrifying instant, the pillar, and a perfect sphere of reality around it, had been unmade, returned to the primordial void from which it came.\nBefore anyone could truly comprehend the horror of what they had just witnessed, Mammon waved a hand, and reality snapped back into place.\nWhere the stone pillar once stood, there was now nothing. Not even a single speck of ash.\n\"Should I disqualify you for not getting a green light from the pillar?\" Adam asked from above, his joking tone breaking the terrified silence that had fallen over the arena. The audience erupted in a wave of nervous laughter.\nThe tournament continued, and soon, only two of Sunny’s champions remained to be tested.\nThe first was Veylara, the World Tree. The colossal tree, whose roots now spread through the entirety of Veridia, could not move.\nInstead, a section of her trunk shimmered, and from the wood, a new form emerged—a beautiful dryad, her skin like polished bark, her hair a cascade of green leaves.\nShe looked out at the silent, watching cosmos, her gaze seeming to focus on a single, insignificant point in Veridia where a small, a demon girl sat.\nHer voice was a soft whisper of rustling leaves that was nonetheless heard by all. \"Laira, this one is for you.\"\nShe raised a hand. From her fingers, branches grew, then a trunk, then a colossal arm of living wood that grew and grew until it was larger than the highest of the mountains.\nWith the force of a falling asteroid, the colossal limb swung down and crushed the Pillar of Might into nothing but splinters and dust.\nVeylara smiled at the camera projection, a gesture of pure, triumphant satisfaction, before her dryad form melted back into the unseen, omnipresent trunk of the World Tree.\n\"Laira...\" Sunny murmured, the name triggering a memory from his clones. He saw a small, insignificant moment from years ago, a moment of profound importance.\nHe saw Veridia, suffocating under the mana drain of his own S-Grade breakthrough. He saw the tiny sapling that was Veylara, withering, though the absence of mana wouldn’t have killed her, but she still looked half dead, and then he saw her.\nA small, demon girl, her eyes wide with a strange, fierce compassion. She had placed her small hands on the sapling’s trunk and poured her own life force, her own precious mana, into the not so dying demigod, a selfless act that for Veylara was the greatest kindness.\nSunny focused his God’s Eye on this Laira, and was shocked by what he saw.\n[Name: Laira]\n[Race: Unchained (Demon)]\n[Profession: Herbalist (S-Grade)]\n[Talents: Nature-Lover (S-Grade), Dark Affinity (A-Grade), Light Affinity (A-Grade)]\n[Talent Name: Nature-Lover]\n[Grade: S]\n[Description: Grants the ability to communicate with all forms of life, from the smallest plant to the greatest beast. The more you connect with and help nature, the stronger you become. Any being you personally aid will grow stronger at an accelerated rate.]\n\"What a strange, powerful talent,\" Sunny mused. He still had one use of his Skill-Resonance talent available, a century having just passed in Veridia’s accelerated time before the start of the tournament.\nHe could copy that talent right now. But he held back. He had been waiting, patiently, for this very tournament.\nIt wasn’t a guess; it was a certainty, a whisper from his Divine Intuition that had been growing stronger for days.\nSomeone here, in the crucible of this grand competition, in the heat of battle, was going to have an epiphany.\nSomeone was going to unlock a new, unexpected talent born from the chaos of combat. And he would be ready to claim it. The patient hunter waits for the perfect prey.",

      "content": "Chapter 178: Ch 178 : The Arena of Emphiany\nThe Trial of Might had been going on for what felt like an eternity, yet the excitement in the Arena of Epiphany had not waned in the slightest.\nFor a month in the planetary accelerated time, a grand parade of divine and monstrous forms from across the multiverse had taken their turn, each a unique testament to their creator’s ingenuity.\nThe parade was endless and wondrous. A demigod whose lower body was a churning vortex of sand. A living statue of jade with eyes of emerald fire. A creature that was a walking, sentient fungal colony.\nSunny watched them all, he was learning, seeing the boundless creativity of the Gods he now ruled.\nThen, a new name flashed on the roster: Octa.\nA demigod materialized before the Pillar of Might. Its form was unlike any other.\nIts body was a slender, almost fragile construct of shimmering, silver metal. But its head was a single, flawless, multifaceted diamond, completely disconnected from its neck, spinning slowly in the air a few centimeters above its shoulders, a silent, beautiful, and unnerving sight.\nThis was Octa, the first demigod of the God Strategist, a being designed not for battle, but for wisdom.\nWith a quiet sigh that was more of a movement of internal gears, he stepped forward and threw a single, light punch. There was no boom, no shattering of stone. Only a dull, unsatisfying thud.\nThe pillar glowed a dull, unforgiving red. Failure.\nFor Strategist, watching from his high throne, it was not a shock. He had known Octa’s physical strength was his weakest attribute.\nBut for Octa, the failure was a cascade of complex data he could not process. He stood there, his diamond head spinning slightly faster, replaying the punch in his mind, analyzing the angle, the force, the point of impact.\nHe was searching for a logical error in a problem that could not be solved by logic alone.\nAnd then, something shifted. The very air around him, saturated with the unique, potent energy of the arena, seemed to rush into him. His diamond head stopped spinning.\nThe trillions of facets on its surface began to glow with a brilliant, internal luminescence. He had entered a state of epiphany.\n\"Gaining an epiphany from a single punch,\" Sunny’s voice was a low murmur of appreciation. \"Your demigod truly possess great wisdom, Strategist.\"\nHe decided it was time to reveal the arena’s greatest secret. His voice boomed, not with the authority of a king, but with the excitement of gaining some more faith through this.\n\"I believe I have forgotten to mention one of the biggest advantages of this arena!\"\nA wave of speculation ran through the crowd, but it was Strategist who typed in the God Chat, his own mind alight with a sudden, brilliant hope.\nStrategist: \"Is it... epiphany?\"\n\"Bingo!\" Sunny’s voice confirmed, and a wave of understanding and excitement washed over the six billion Gods.\nThe name of the arena was not just a name; it was a promise. This wasn’t just a stage for battle; it was a crucible for growth.\nThis tournament was not just to divide spoils; it was to elevate the strength of his entire empire.\nSunny, feeling a surge of benevolent impatience, decided to help the process along. He focused a sliver of his will and cast a subtle spell of time acceleration, a personal bubble of fast-forwarded reality that enveloped only the meditating Octa.\nFor the audience, what should have been a process of years unfolded in two breathtaking minutes.\nOcta’s eyes, unseen within his diamond head, snapped open. The brilliant light receded, and he looked at the Pillar of Might with a newfound understanding.\nHe stepped forward and punched again. There was no visible increase in speed or power. But this time, when his fist connected, the pillar didn’t just thud.\nIt resonated, a deep, harmonic hum that vibrated through the entire arena, a perfect transfer of energy. The pillar flashed a brilliant, triumphant green.\n\"You passed, Octa,\" Strategist whispered from his throne, a rare, genuine smile touching his lips. \"Thank you, Emperor Cosmos, for giving him this opportunity.\"\nSunny just smiled back. Every increase in the strength of a subordinate was a direct increase in his own. ’And you wouldn’t want to know,’ he thought with a private smirk, ’that I am currently using your very own ’Children of Wisdom’, maybe it’s another reason for such an emphiany.’\n\"And next,\" Adam’s voice boomed, his own face alight with joyous anticipation, \"is Nova!\"\nThe live chat, which had been buzzing with analysis of Octa’s epiphany, exploded into a supernova of pure, fanatical excitement.\nThe lifeforms of Veridia, the billions of souls who saw Nova not just as a demigod but as their sacred Guardian, typed a single, unified roar that echoed across a billion worlds.\n\"SMASH THAT PILLAR, GUARDIAN NOVA!\"\nNova, in her elegant humanoid form, heard their collective prayer. A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched her lips. She appeared before the Pillar of Might.\nThen, she began to grow. Her form expanded, her obsidian scales shimmering as she shed her humanoid shell, her size increasing to a degree that defied all logic.\nThe arena, a structure larger than a star, suddenly felt small, cramped. The pillar, which had seemed to touch the heavens, was now a mere toothpick before her.\nShe looked down at the insignificant stone, then at the trillions of her adoring fans.\nShe gave them what they wanted. With a casual, almost lazy pinch of her colossal claws, the pillar shattered. Not into rubble, but into fine, microscopic dust.\nBut her power did not stop there. The sheer, overwhelming weight of her divine form pressed down on reality itself, and the floor of the arena, a construct of a Goddess, groaned and cracked, a web of fissures spreading out for miles from beneath her.\nNo green light was needed. No announcement was required. The entire universe understood. A wave of thunderous, adoring cheers washed over her.\nThe other demigods, who had just been displaying their own immense power, now looked at her with a new, profound horror.\nThis was a different level of existence entirely. With her point made, Nova shrank back to her normal size and teleported back to her stand, her expression as calm and unreadable as ever.\nFor the next month in the planetary time, the Trial of Might continued. The demigods of Veridia and the other powerful Gods put on a spectacle that would be talked about for a thousand years.\nAnd through it all, there was no boredom, no tiredness. Every mortal, every demigod, and every God watched, their hearts filled with a single, burning thought: what could possibly come next?",

      "content": "Chapter 179: Ch 179 : Mistakes?\nAdam, the referee, floated serenely at the center of the arena, a calm anchor in a sea of anticipation. A gentle, knowing smile touched his lips.\n\"Before we begin the next round,\" his voice boomed, a sound that was both a gentle whisper and a cosmic thunderclap, reaching every soul in the assembly, \"let us have a break. For one month, all contestants, both demigod and mortal, shall rest and prepare.\"\nA collective, universe-spanning groan of disappointment erupted from the stands. Trillions of voices, united in their desire for entertainment, booed on the this announcement.\nIt was a sound that could have shaken even DemiGods to their core. But Adam simply laughed, a warm, genuine sound that seemed to carry the weight of a billion years.\nThis was not disrespect. This was passion. He knew that lifeforms who were this open, this emotionally invested, who could boo a God one moment and pray to him the next, were the very wellspring from which the most potent faith was born.\nThis tournament wasn’t just about finding the strongest; it was about igniting faith in the very soul of the lifeforms, a grand move orchestrated by the emperor watching from his high throne.\nSunny wanted this lifeforms to know, who their emperor was. Who should they pray to.\nThis wouldn’t mean that they would forsake their own gods, it means that these lifeforms can have faith in both God Cosmos and their own creator God.\n’What a beautiful move,’ Adam praised Sunny inwardly. He then closed his eyes, his ancient talent, a subtle and profound ability to read the collective desires of a crowd, washing over him.\nHe felt the boredom of the Gods, their minds craving distraction after months of focused observation.\nHe felt the burning ambition of the champions, their bodies and souls aching for a place to train, to sharpen their skills for the coming battles. He smiled. He could give them what they wanted.\nWith a simple, elegant wave of his hand, the arena shook. But it was not a tremor of destruction; it was the vibration of creation.\nFrom the vast, empty plains surrounding the central stage, structures erupted from the ground. Gleaming skyscrapers of crystal and starlight, so tall they seemed to scrape the clouds, materialized in an instant.\nGolden, sandy beaches, complete with gently lapping waves and a warm, radiant sun, unfolded like a celestial carpet.\nColiseums, training grounds, and meditation gardens, each one imbued with a fraction of the arena’s own epiphany-granting magic, blossomed across the landscape.\nFor the Gods, an amusement park, a playground, grand theaters, and zero-gravity pools appeared. For the warriors, a paradise of endless challenge.\n\"Enjoy your day off,\" Adam whispered, and then his form dissolved, teleporting back to his own, newly acquired planet.\nHis world was a blank canvas, a pristine sphere of fertile earth and clean water, waiting for the touch of its creator.\nHe felt a pang of loneliness, a familiar ache from a million years of solitude. But it was overshadowed by a profound sense of purpose. \"One month of planetary time,\" he mused, a spark of creative fire in his eyes. \"More than enough.\"\nHe didn’t need a primordial spark. He didn’t need to painstakingly guide evolution over eons.\nHe was Adam, the God of Growth, the firstborn of the Void. He simply held out a hand, and with a soft snap of his fingers, the very Law of Life bent to his will.\nThe oceans of his world began to teem, not with simple microbes, but with complex, fully formed aquatic life.\nThe forests, which had just been silent collections of trees, now echoed with the calls of a thousand different species of birds and beasts. \"A piece of cake,\" he said, as the work of eons for other Gods completed in a mere moment by him.\nJust as he was admiring his handiwork, a shimmering portal tore open beside him, and Sunny stepped through. \"Oh, so here you are,\" Sunny said, his voice a mix of curiosity and amusement as he took in the instantly-teeming world. \"Why didn’t you just take some creatures from one of our planets?\"\n\"No need,\" Adam replied with a proud smile. \"It is because od one of my talents. It is called ’Blessed Creator’.\"\n\"Oh?\" Sunny’s interest was immediately piqued. His intuition, a subtle but insistent guide, was humming, telling him this was important.\n\"What kind of talent? It sounds fun.\" He said and then added, with a sigh, \"If you don’t want to share, it’s still okay,\" a masterful, if slightly shameless, bit of emotional blackmail.\nAdam chuckled. \"It is no secret. You already know of my innate talent, so this is no great matter.\" With a thought, he transferred the information directly through Thea’s network.\n[Talent Name: Blessed Creator]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: A creator does not wish for his creations to die.\nThis talent imbues all lifeforms you personally create with a powerful boost to all their stats, both physical and magical.\nAll your creations will provide an enhanced amount of faith, and they will be born with an innate, unbreakable loyalty and knowledge of their creator.\nTheir evolution and progression towards their peak potential will be drastically accelerated.]\n’He still has a talent like this?’ Sunny thought, his mind immediately calculating the terrifying synergy.\n’Overgrowth removes the limits, and this talent helps them reach that broken limit at an impossible speed. A perfect combination.’ He looked at the old God with a newfound sense of awe.\n\"How many such talents do you possess?\" Sunny asked, his eyes, hidden behind the mask, focused intently on Adam.\n\"Not much,\" Adam said nonchalantly, as if discussing the weather. \"Around four hundred and sixty-seven SS-Grade talents.\"\nThe number hit Sunny like a physical blow. He, who had felt so proud of his own growing collection, was a mere novice.\n\"If you want to copy any of the talent, I can transfer the details about each of them \" Adam added with a smile.\n\"How... did you know?\" Sunny asked, his voice a quiet whisper. The truth he had been hiding, was now out in the open.\n\"That you have been copying talents?\" Adam’s smile was gentle, without a hint of accusation. \"It is easy to guess, when one knows what to look for. The talent of Strategist, a fragment of my own, and the abilities of your demigods... I can feel them on you, a faint echo. I do not know if your use is permanent or temporary, but it matters little.\"\nHe looked at Sunny, his ancient eyes seeing not just a new God, but a vessel for something far greater. \"The Mother Void has chosen you, Cosmos. She has given you the blessing of Manifestation Affinity, a gift she has not bestowed since the dawn of time. She clearly has high hopes for you.\" He paused, his gaze drifting to the stars of his new world.\n\"Perhaps,\" he whispered, a profound, ancient hope in his voice, \"you are the one who will finally correct her mistakes.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 180: Ch 180 : The Crucible\n’Well, I already expected him to catch on,’ Sunny thought, a flicker of amusement in his mind. He sat across from Adam in a quiet, manifested throne within the grand world of Adam.\nHe knew a being as ancient and wise as Adam would eventually piece together the truth of his Skill-Resonance talent.\n\"What kind of expectations does the Mother Void have of me?\" Sunny asked, his voice a low, serious hum that cut through the quiet atmosphere of the Adam’s worl. \"What is it that I am meant to do?\" He did not want to be a pawn, a tool for a cosmic entity he had never met, no matter how benevolent.\nAdam took a slow, deliberate sip of a swirling, nebula-like drink before answering. \"Fate is a river, Cosmos,\" he said, his tone ancient and mysterious. \"Even if I told you its destination, it would not change the currents. If your path aligns with fate, then you will walk it, whether you wish to or not. If it does not, then no amount of effort can force you onto it. Do not worry about such grand designs. Simply be what you are.\"\n\"I know you won’t tell me,\" Sunny sighed, a hint of his old human self showing through. \"I know this trope.\" He leaned forward, his focus shifting to a more immediate, strategic concern.\n\"Then tell me this. With only three of us Void-born left in this multiverse, is the Void correcting the imbalance? Will it continue to create new Gods at the slow pace of one per million years, or will it accelerate, as it did in the beginning?\"\nAdam pondered the question, a flicker of genuine uncertainty in his ancient eyes. \"I do not know the mind of the Void, how it chooses to create Gods or Void Beasts. But your correlation... it is a wise one. I had not considered it myself.\"\n\"Maybe, you are right and maybe wrong. Maybe the void will produce millions of new Gods, or maybe it will not produce a single God\" he said his tone uncertain, but filled with hope.\nTheir conversation continued, a quiet exchange of cosmic secrets in the heart of a now life filled world.\nFinally, the month of rest came to an end. The joyous music of the amusement park faded. The laughter died down.\nThe vibrant, impossible structures of skyscrapers and beaches dissolved into motes of fading light, replaced by a profound, expectant silence.\nAll of the beings across the universe—Gods on their thrones, demigods in the stands, and lifeforms watching from a billion different worlds—turned their collective attention to the center of the arena, where Adam floated serenely, a calm anchor in a sea of anticipation.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen!\" his voice boomed, the introduction followed by a thunderous, universe-spanning wave of applause. \"I trust you have all enjoyed your rest. But the time for leisure is over.\"\nHe gestured with a grand, sweeping motion, and the very ground of the arena began to churn. The empty plains erupted.\nA thousand colossal, continent-sized battlegrounds rose from the ground, each a unique and deadly biome.\nOne was a land where volcanoes wept rivers of lava that flowed into a hissing, steaming sea. Another was a crystalline forest where the trees themselves were razor-sharp shards of glass.\nA third was a toxic swamp, its air thick with poisonous spores and its waters teeming with unseen horrors followed by many more different biomes.\n\"Welcome,\" Adam declared, his voice ringing with a new, dangerous excitement, \"to The Crucible!\"\n\"The rules for this round are simple,\" he announced, his voice carrying to every corner of the cosmos.\n\"There will be a thousand elimination rounds running simultaneously, with one million champions in each arena. Upon your teleportation, each of you will find a token bound to your waist. This token is your life. Protect it at all costs. The moment you lose it, you will be teleported out of the arena. You will be eliminated.\" He let out a low, cynical laugh.\n\"The last one thousand champions left standing in each arena will advance to the next round. Are we all clear?\"\nA thunderous, unified roar of \"YES!\" was his answer.\n\"Good,\" Adam said, a predatory glint in his ancient eyes. \"Let the Crucible begin. We will start with the lifeforms first.\"\nWith a single, sharp clap of his hands, a billion points of light vanished from the grand stands.\nA moment later, they reappeared, scattered across the thousand deadly landscapes below, a chaotic and beautiful storm of teleportation.\nSome were lucky, finding themselves alone in a quiet corner of the map. Others were not.\nIn a dense, swamp-like biome, a hulking orc warrior, his skin the color of dried mud and his tusks yellowed and sharp, grinned as he saw his first opponent.\nIt was a lone human, standing calmly by a stagnant pool of water. \"Wow, lucky me,\" the orc snarled, his eyes fixed on the shimmering token at the human’s waist. \"Finding a juicy prey at the very start.\" He hefted the massive, crude axe on his shoulder. \"Give me your token, human, and I will spare you the beating.\"\nThe human simply smiled, a calm, confident expression on his face that seemed utterly out of place in this brutal contest. \"Hehe, you don’t know who I am?\" he replied, his voice relaxed, almost friendly.\n\"I would say you are lucky to have met me. Your token will not go to waste in my hands.\" the human replied.\nThe orc’s grin widened, revealing a row of broken, stained teeth. \"A human with a backbone. I like that. Let me see how flexible it is.\"\nFrom the high stands of Veridia, where the human champions watched the live broadcast, a collective sigh of pity went out, not for the human that was about to be attacked by the orc, instead it was a pity for the orc.\n\"That poor fool,\" one of the human warriors murmured, shaking his head. \"He has no idea.\"\nThey were watching a frog at the bottom of a well, trying to threaten the ocean.\nBecause the smiling, unassuming human standing before that orc was none other than the leader of the Cosmic Empire, the S-Grade Body Refiner, Anaske.",

      "content": "Chapter 181: Ch 181 : Madgirl Nephis\nThe orc charged, his heavy footfalls sending splashes of stagnant water flying. The mace came crashing down, a meteor of jagged iron aimed at turning Anaske into a red paste on the swamp floor.\nBut Anaske didn’t move. He didn’t raise a shield or draw a weapon. He simply watched the descending weapon with a placid smile.\nHe had spent hundreds of nights in the Divine Library, his mind a repository of thousands different martial arts techniques, each one memorized, analyzed, and perfected.\nThis orc’s attack, for all its power, was slow, clumsy, and full of a hundred different openings.\nJust as the mace was about to connect, Anaske moved. It was not a grand, flashy motion. He simply raised a hand and, with a single, elegant flick of his index finger, tapped the top of the descending mace.\nThe orc’s world stopped. The mace, which had been hurtling downwards with the force of a falling tree, halted in mid-air as if it had struck an invisible, immovable wall.\nHe pushed, he roared, he strained every muscle in his powerful body, but the weapon would not move. It was held fast by the tip of a single, human finger.\n\"What type of sorcery is this?!\" the orc screamed, his mind unable to process what was happening.\nHis rage boiled over, and he unleashed his innate talent. Orc’s Fury!\nA wave of red, berserker energy washed over him, his muscles bulging, his eyes turning bloodshot. He wrenched the mace back and, with a guttural roar, swung it again at the still-standing Anaske.\n\"Sorcery? Magic? I have never learned that. My body alone is enough,\" Anaske said. But the orc was not in his right mind enough to understand what Anaske had said; he just continued to swing the mace.\nFed up with this stubbornness, Anaske chuckled a little. \"Your Orc’s Fury only increases your strength by two times? Thrak’s Orc’s Fury is much better; he gives me a little competition with that annoying talent of his,\" he said, as he remembered the five-times strength increase of Thrak, the leader of the Orcs in Veridia.\nHe pulled out his sword and said, \"Time to go, big guy.\" He immediately slashed the mace in half and then, with the tip of his sword, cut the thread that connected the token to the orc’s waist, catching it in midair.\nAs soon as the token left the orc’s body, he was immediately teleported back to the stand.\nHis Orc’s Fury receded, and he shook his head as if to come to his senses.\nHe immediately looked around at the remaining lifeforms on his stand who had not been matched with anyone yet.\n\"You sure are unlucky, meeting Anaske, the leader of our Cosmic Empire, and not recognizing him,\" one human remarked to the orc who had just returned after elimination.\n\"That was Anaske? He is too strong,\" he nodded and then added with a resolute expression, \"I will, one day, surpass him.\"\n\"Yeah, dream on,\" the human said casually and focused on the tournament, which was becoming more and more interesting with each passing second.\n\"Haha, another one,\" a voice chimed from the middle of a forest. The voice came from a girl who looked around twenty-four, but her real age remained unknown.\nShe was from the Unchained race, which was combined from the multiple demon races that had submitted to Sunny.\nAnd she was from a royal race even among all the races of demons, a race that Diablo, the Demigod of demons, had created from his own blood.\nHis blood birthed demons similar to himself in physique, and they were called the Royal Demons.\nThis girl was named Nephis and was also known as the mischievous girl from the Western Continent.\nShe was personally chosen by Diablo as the future demon queen and also by Loki because her personality suited him.\nThrough Diablo, she gained many talents that he had copied from other demons, and from Loki, she learned the arts of mischief and stealing.\nCurrently, in the arena, she was doing exactly that. Whenever she saw another person, she would transform into a bird or a fly and close the gap to use her talent to steal items from that lifeform, directly taking the token.\nThis left the opponent unable to even react, immediately ending their journey in the Tournament of Gods.\nAs she walked, she was humming a song that was famous in Veridia, as it was a song linked with nature and God Cosmos himself, depicting his physical features as boundless as the Cosmos.\nShe pressed her token, and it showed a glowing number ’14’, which denoted the number of people she had eliminated so far.\nShe didn’t know the point behind calculating it, but it was fun to increase it as much as possible.\nThus, she transformed into a very fast beast from Veridia and immediately ran at the highest speed possible with a sensory talent always checking the surroundings.\nLifeform1736: \"What is this madgirl up to? She has already eliminated 14 lifeforms! And the main thing is, she didn’t even lift a finger or hurt them a little. Those poor souls didn’t even know how they got eliminated.\" This message was from a lifeform watching the match because his friend was also in that arena.\nLifeform26628: \"19 eliminations? I am currently watching the arena where Anaske is. He has 9 eliminations and is currently fighting the tenth one.\" Such information about fights was being shared rapidly in the chat, as everyone shared the epic fight scenes from different arenas.\nLifeform727362: \"It is not a fight at this point. It’s like a parent teasing a toddler, taking away their toys and making them cry.\"\nLifeform173763: \"King Anaske is already matched? Oh my Cosmos! I am his biggest fan! System, show me Anaske!\"\nLifeform17372: \"Why has the topic shifted to King Anaske? We should uncover how this demon eliminates so many lifeforms!\"\nThe chat immediately ran into chaos, with each person speculating about the talent that this girl possessed, while the lifeforms from Veridia just laughed, knowing full well what this little demon could do.",

      "content": "Chapter 182: Ch 182 : Atlas’s Boredom\nIn one of the thousand arenas, a continent-sized biome of dense jungle, a living mountain sat in quiet contemplation.\nAtlas, the leader of the Titans, rested at the foot of the tallest tree, his colossal form so immense that the small, shimmering token at his waist was completely lost in the folds of his stone-like skin.\nUnlike the other champions, who were locked in a frantic, desperate scramble for survival, Atlas was an island of absolute, unassailable calm.\nHis sheer size, visible from miles away, was a silent and terrifying deterrent. No sane lifeform dared to approach him.\nThey remembered the spectacle of the first round, the image of the reinforced Pillar of Might exploding into dust from a single, casual punch.\nThey gave him a wide, respectful berth.\nFor an hour, Atlas enjoyed the best time of his life, a quiet, peaceful nap in the heart of a warzone. But his rest was interrupted by the faint whisper of wings.\nHe opened one of his massive, rock-like eyelids and saw a tiny figure, no larger than a fly in his perception, floating before his face.\n\"Vel,\" Atlas’s voice was a low, sleepy rumble, a sound like the shifting of tectonic plates. \"Finish this round quickly. I am bored. No one is coming to attack me.\"\n\"The arena is too big,\" Vel, the elven king, replied, his voice a calm, melodic counterpoint to the titan’s deep growl. \"It took me an hour just to find you. There are five more of our kin from Veridia in this arena. I believe we should form a team.\"\n\"A team?\" Atlas snorted, a gust of wind that rustled the leaves of the trees. \"Do we need one? If you can finish this hunt in another hour, then all is well. Otherwise, I may have to start crushing some of these trees for my own amusement.\"\nHe knew Vel’s cautious nature, but he also knew the immense, almost unfair, gap in power between the champions of Veridia and the lifeforms of the other worlds.\n\"Then help me find them,\" Vel pressed. \"Your hearing is the best among all the lifeforms of Veridia. You can hear a leaf fall from a continent away.\"\nAtlas let out a long, theatrical sigh. He closed his eyes for a moment, his massive head tilting as he listened to the silent symphony of the jungle. \"Fly one hundred thousand kilometers to the southeast,\" he finally grumbled. \"You will find a... teammate... there.\"\nVel nodded, thanked the titan for his help, and shot off in the indicated direction.\nAs he watched the elf’s retreating form, a slow, wicked grin spread across Atlas’s stony face. \"Hmph. Let’s see what you do now.\"\nVel traveled for another hour, the dense jungle canopy a blur of green beneath him. Finally, his keen elven senses picked up a presence.\nTrusting Atlas’s guidance, he descended, landing softly in a small, sun-dappled clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a human, his back to him.\n\"Who are you?\" Vel’s voice was sharp, carrying the innate authority of a king who had ruled for centuries.\nThe human turned, a calm, almost amused smile on his face. \"It is rude to ask for a name without first giving your own,\" he said, his voice surprisingly relaxed. \"But I suppose it is alright. After all, I already know who you are, Vel, the King of the Elves.\"\nVel’s eyes narrowed. He felt no immediate threat from this human, but his cautious nature, a trait honed by a centuries of political maneuvering and warfare, screamed at him to be wary. He took a few steps back, creating a safe distance.\nThe human just laughed, a sound that grated on Vel’s nerves. \"You are as cautious as they say.\"\nThat was the final straw. Annoyed by Atlas’s prank and now by this arrogant, unknown human, Vel’s patience snapped.\nHe raised a hand, and a massive, swirling ball of pure fire, a spell powerful enough to incinerate an entire city, materialized above his palm.\nHe held it in check, his immense control ensuring its destructive power wouldn’t accidentally kill his opponent before he could offer a healing spell.\nThe fireball then coalesced, taking on the form of a roaring, sentient fire spirit, and lunged at the still-smiling human.\nBut the human didn’t flinch. He didn’t raise a shield or prepare a counter-spell. He simply stood there, an expression of calm curiosity on his face.\nJust as the fireball was about to engulf him, a strange, beautiful, and terrifying thing happened. The fireball, a destructive magic, simply... unraveled. The flames dissolved, the heat dissipated, and the magical energy that formed its core was reduced to its original, harmless state, a gentle mist of pure mana that was then calmly absorbed by the human.\n\"How? What was that?\" Vel gasped, a genuine, profound shock on his face. He knew of a talent like this, a power that could convert any incoming attack into nothingness.\nIt was the signature ability of the demigod Mammon. But this... this felt different.\n\"Just a minor trick,\" the human replied.\nThe live chat, which had been filled with a hundred different battles, suddenly focused on this single, unbelievable moment.\nLifeform1636: \"What was that?! Did he just EAT that spell?! Is that even possible?!\"\nLifeform63728: \"Hehe. That is our leader. The leader of the Kshara planet, Lux. And this is his signature skill. No lifeform below the demigod realm has ever been able to land a single blow on him.\"\nAtlas, in his bodedom, had sent the master of all magic in Veridia to face the one being in the arena who was completely immune to magic.\nBut Vel was no fool. He bombarded Lux with a relentless storm of spells—fire, ice, lightning, earth—not to harm him, but to study him.\nFor half an hour, he watched, his mind a whirlwind of analysis, until he finally saw it. \"So, you convert my magic attacks back into their original form, mana, and use it to nourish yourself,\" Vel said, a slow, appreciative smile forming on his face. \"What a truly frightening technique.\"\nBut knowing the trick and countering it were two different things. Vel was optimistic. He had all the time in the world.\nAs Lux couldn’t harm him either; the hundreds of contracted spirits that swirled around Vel, invisible to the naked eye, formed a perfect, impenetrable shield.\nSince the spirits were living beings, Lux’s talent could not convert them. They were at a perfect, absolute deadlock.\n\"Oh... I need to be fast,\" Vel suddenly said, a new idea, a brilliant and unorthodox solution, flashing in his mind. He had found a way.\nBut before he could unleash his new strategy, a familiar chime echoed in both their minds, and a new panel materialized before them.\n[You are one of the one thousand lifeforms left in this arena. Congratulations on passing the second round.]\nVel looked at Lux, his earlier frustration gone, replaced by the pure, competitive fire of a true warrior. \"I hope we are matched in the final round,\" he said.\nLux just nodded, a respectful smile on his face. In the next instant, both of them dissolved in a shower of light, teleported back to their respective stands, their epic, unresolved duel now the stuff of legends in the God Chat.",

      "content": "Chapter 183: Ch 183 : Await the new talent\nThe Crucible burned hot. Across the thousand continent-sized arenas, the initial chaos had begun to settle into a brutal rhythm of hunt and be hunted.\nFor all the lifeforms watching through Thea’s live broadcast, it was a spectacle of unprecedented scale, a glorious and terrifying display of power from every corner of the universe.\nBut for Sunny, observing from his high throne in the Arena of Epiphany, a familiar feeling was creeping in: boredom.\nHis champions were simply too dominant. It was less a competition and more an exhibition.\nHe watched Anaske move through a dense, swamp-like arena like a phantom.\nThe King of the Cosmic Empire wasn’t fighting; he was harvesting.\nOpponents, drawn by the shimmer of his token or the promise of a glorious battle, would charge him, only to find their weapons shattered, their tokens plucked from their waists with contemptuous ease, and their worlds dissolving into the disorienting light of teleportation before they even understood what had happened.\nHe moved with the effortless grace of a master swordsman and the overwhelming force of an S-Grade Body Refiner, each elimination a clean, precise, almost surgical act.\nHis counter ticked upwards relentlessly, as he had already eliminated half a million lifeforms back to their stand. It was impressive, but predictable.\nThen there was Nephis. Sunny shifted his view to a mist-shrouded forest arena, where the mischievous Royal Demon was playing her own, entirely different game.\nShe wasn’t fighting at all. She moved through the arena like a ghost, a flicker of shadow, a harmless butterfly landing on a shoulder, a rustle of leaves in the canopy.\nHer opponents never saw her coming. They would be walking, alert and ready for battle, and then suddenly find themselves back in the stands, their token inexplicably gone, their minds reeling with confusion.\nNephis’s counter was even more absurd, already cresting seven hundred thousand eliminations, each one a testament to her mastery of stealth and Loki’s infuriatingly effective Master of Stealing talent.\nIt was amusing, but it lacked the raw, thrilling uncertainty of a true contest.\nBut then, Sunny focused on the highlights from Arena 742, and his boredom evaporated, replaced by a cold, fascinated dread.\nThis arena was a hellscape, a volatile land of active volcanoes and rivers of molten mana. And in its center hovered Kalzarin, the Ice Dragon champion from Veridia.\nWhen the round began, the other lifeforms in the arena, a million lifeforms from different worlds, had rejoiced.\nThey saw a dragon whose very essence was counter to this fiery realm. They saw an easy target, a powerful beast crippled by its environment.\nThey charged him, a wave of desperate, hopeful warriors seeking to claim the glory of slaying a dragon.\nThey were wrong. So, terribly wrong.\nKalzarin hadn’t suffered. He hadn’t struggled.\nHe had simply ascended, his massive, ice-blue wings beating against the superheated air.\nHe hovered high above the volcanic peaks, looking down at the charging army like a god observing ants.\nThen, he inhaled, his chest expanding, drawing in the very heat of the world around him. And he breathed out.\nIt was not fire. It was a blizzard. A wave of absolute zero, infused with the reality-warping power of his space affinity, erupted from his jaws.\nit was a world destroying breath that spread across the entire continent-sized arena in a single, silent, terrifying instant.\nThe rivers of lava flash-froze, becoming jagged sculptures of solid energy. The erupting volcanoes were choked, their fiery plumes instantly turning into pillars of black, glassy obsidian.\nAnd the million lifeforms charging towards him... they simply stopped, frozen solid in mid-stride, their expressions of rage and hope eternally locked in ice.\nThe tokens, sensing the life force within the frozen statues extinguishing, activated their emergency teleportation.\nOne million souls vanished from the arena, leaving Kalzarin alone, floating serenely in the center of a world he had just turned into a world anihlator.\nHe had cleared his arena in less than five minutes, eliminating 999,999 opponents in a single, horrifying breath.\nThe sheer, overwhelming power, the casual annihilation, sent a wave of trauma not just through those who had faced him, but through the audience watching across the universe.\nSunny let out a low whistle. \"Impressive,\" he murmured.\nBut even this spectacle, this display of absolute dominance, felt... empty. It lacked the spark, the unpredictable variable he was waiting for.\n\"Sigh,\" he let out a long, weary breath. \"When will that new talent appear? My intuition promised me something interesting. At this rate, I’m tempted to just copy Adam’s ’Blessed Creator’ talent and call it a day.\"\nThe moment the thought crossed his mind, his Divine Intuition talent screamed at him.\nIt wasn’t a warning of danger, but a sharp, insistent NO, a feeling like trying to force two repelling magnets together. It was a clear, undeniable message: Wait.\n\"Yes, yes, I know,\" Sunny grumbled, placating the insistent feeling. \"I was just joking. I will listen to you.\" He settled back into his throne, forcing himself to be patient.\nJust then, Adam’s voice boomed across the arena, drawing everyone’s attention. \"The first million matches are complete! I hope it was entertaining for you all!\" He paused, a knowing look on his ancient face.\n\"And since many of you viewers seem to be complaining about the matches where contestants simply hide and wait each other out, the Gods have decreed a new rule for this round!\"\nA ripple of excitement went through the stands.\n\"From this moment on,\" Adam declared, \"the arenas will begin to shrink! The edges of the world will crumble away, little by little, until only a few square kilometers remain. No more hiding! The maximum time limit for any match is now one month!\"\nA roar of approval erupted from the audience. This was the chaos they craved.\n\"So,\" Adam grinned, his eyes twinkling with anticipation, \"let The Crucible begin once again!\"\nAnother billion points of light vanished from the stands, teleported into the thousand deadly arenas.\nSunny watched his own champions depart, their expressions confident, almost arrogant. They knew their strength. They knew they were the elite. They were ready.\nAmong them was a figure that drew murmurs from the crowd. It was another dragon, but this one was different.\nIt wasn’t the hulking, western-style beast like Kalzarin. It was a long, serpentine dragon of brilliant jade green, its form radiating not icy power, but a gentle, profound aura of life and hope.\nIt lacked wings, yet it glided through the air with an effortless grace.\nLifeform1837: \"I pray for the poor souls in the same arena as that dragon. Another massacre is coming.\"\nLifeform2737: \"Maybe this one isn’t as strong? It looks less... intimidating than the ice dragon.\"\nLifeform264792: \"Are you blind?! Look at its shape! It’s serpentine, like the Demigod Shenlong in Emperor Cosmos’s stand! Don’t judge a dragon by its shape!\"\nThe lifeforms from Veridia smiled knowingly.\nLifeform12 : \"As a citizen of Veridia, let me tell you: those other champions won’t last more than a few seconds against him.\"\nLifeform2673: \"Brother, what is his ability? Is he really that strong? You’re not just boasting?\"\nLifeform12 : \"His abilities? Simple. Hope. Miracles. And Prayers.\" He typed the cryptic message and then went silent, leaving the rest of the universe to wonder.\nThe green dragon, soaring into its designated arena, was none other than Thorn, the first apostle of Shenlong, reborn and ready to show the multiverse the true meaning of hope.",

      "content": "Chapter 184: Ch 184 : Crucible for Demigods\nIn Arena Number 243, a continent-sized battlefield forged from primordial jungle and treacherous swamps, a palpable tension hung in the air.\nA million champions from across the universe had been scattered across this deadly landscape, their hearts pounding with the thrill and terror of The Crucible.\nThe audience watched with bated breath, their collective gaze shifting between a hundred different screens, eager for the first clash, the first kill.\nMany eyes were fixed on a single figure, a magnificent serpentine dragon of brilliant jade green, who hovered serenely above the dense canopy.\nIt was Thorn, the first apostle of Shenlong. The whispers in the live chat were a storm of speculation and anticipation.\nThey had seen Kalzarin, the Ice Dragon, annihilate an entire arena in a single, terrifying breath. They expected a similar display of overwhelming power.\nBut the massacre never came.\nThorn simply floated, a calm, almost indifferent observer to the chaos erupting below.\nHe drifted through the air with a carefree attitude, seemingly oblivious to the frantic battles breaking out across the jungle.\nLifeforms clashed, alliances formed and shattered, and the number of contestants began to dwindle, but the green dragon remained aloof, a silent, emerald star against the backdrop of carnage.\nEven as the arena itself began to crumble at the edges, the shrinking battlefield forcing survivors into desperate confrontations, Thorn did not engage.\nSpells sizzled past him, arrows whistled by his scales, but none found their mark. A shimmering, almost invisible shield, woven from pure, solidified hope, deflected every attack effortlessly.\nThe viewers in the live chat were baffled.\nLifeform26646: \"What is happening? Why isn’t he fighting? Is he just going to float there until the end?\"\nLifeform3627: \"Still, even if he doesn’t fight, he’s effortlessly tanking thousands of attacks. It shows he has the power, but maybe he doesn’t want to show his hand yet?\"\nLifeform6272: \"I hope so! I want to see a real dragon fight in the finals! Kalzarin versus Thorn! That would be epic! Ones attack breaks the arena while others defend every attack\"\nThe chatter continued, a mix of confusion, disappointment, and fervent speculation.\nBut Thorn remained unchanged, a serene enigma in a world of brutal conflict.\nHe watched the duels below, his ancient eyes observing the different fighting styles, the flashes of unexpected talent, the desperate struggles for survival.\nAfter several days of this passive observation, he finally descended, drawn by a conflict near the center of the shrinking arena.\nFour warriors remained in this sector. Three, clad in the matching armor of a single God’s world, were ganging up on a lone figure.\nTheir target was a massive, burly man whose skin seemed to possess the dull sheen of iron, his muscles rippling with a strength that bordered on the monstrous.\nEven outnumbered three to one, he fought with a primal, desperate bravery, his fists like sledgehammers, refusing to yield.\nThorn watched the uneven battle, a faint chuckle rumbling deep in his draconic chest. He projected a quiet whisper, a thought carried on the wind that only the burly warrior could hear. \"Do you hold even a sliver of hope for victory, little warrior?\"\nThe burly man, staggered by a blow, looked around wildly, searching for the source of the voice.\nHis eyes finally locked onto the serene, green dragon hovering nearby.\nDespite the desperate battle, despite the overwhelming odds, his reply was instant and absolute. \"Yes!\"\nThe moment the word formed in his mind, something shifted within him.\nA warm, invigorating energy flooded his battered body. He felt lighter, stronger, his exhaustion vanishing as if it had never been.\nThe very air around him seemed to hum with a newfound vitality. His iron-like skin seemed to harden, taking on the dark, unyielding luster of obsidian.\nWith a roar of pure, revitalized fury, he charged back into the fray. His movements were faster, his blows heavier.\nThe three opponents, moments ago confident in their victory, were suddenly overwhelmed.\nIn a matter of seconds, they were disarmed, their tokens snatched, their worlds dissolving into the disorienting light of elimination.\nThe burly warrior stood alone, panting heavily, looking at his own hands in disbelief.\nHe looked back towards the dragon, wanting to offer thanks, but Thorn was already gone, vanished back into the sky as silently as he had appeared.\n’Hope,’ Thorn whispered to himself as he soared high above the clouds, ’is the greatest weapon of all.’\nHe continued his passive flight, his presence a silent, calming influence on the chaotic battlefield. Days turned into weeks.\nThe arena continued to shrink, forcing the remaining survivors into ever-closer proximity. Finally, the moment arrived. The landmass beneath them was now only a few hundred kilometers wide.\nThorn opened his eyes, the passive observer replaced by the focused will of a demigod’s apostle.\n\"It is time,\" he said, his voice no longer a whisper, but a deep, ancient resonance that seemed to carry the weight of Shenlong’s own power.\n\"Break.\"\nIt was a single word, spoken with absolute authority. As if his voice were the very law of this reality, the tokens bound to the waists of every remaining lifeform in the arena; save for 999 souls he had silently marked as ’worthy’, shattered simultaneously.\nThousands of champions, who had fought and bled and survived for weeks, vanished in an instant, their journey in the tournament abruptly, inexplicably over.\nA system notification chimed in the minds of the thousand survivors.\n[Congratulations! You have passed the second round of the Tournament of Gods]\nThey reappeared in the stands, their expressions a mixture of exhaustion, relief, and utter confusion.\nThey looked at Thorn, who had teleported back to his stand, his serpentine form now shimmering with a bright, golden light, his eyes closed, lost in a state of profound epiphany.\nSunny, watching from his throne, smiled. He cast a bubble of accelerated time around Thorn, isolating him, allowing him the peace needed to integrate his newfound understanding.\nThe tournament continued. For Sunny, the endless parade of battles had lost some of its novelty, but for the Gods and lifeforms watching, it was the greatest spectacle they had ever witnessed.\nFinally, the second round for the lifeforms concluded. Only one hundred million champions remained from the initial hundred billion who had entered The Crucible.\nAdam reappeared at the center of the arena, his smile broad and pleased. \"This concludes the second round for our mortal champions! And now, the moment you have all been waiting for... it is time to see how our demigods fare in The Crucible!\"\nA roar of pure, unadulterated excitement erupted from the trillions of spectators. This was what they truly craved; the clash of titans, the battle of divine beings.\n\"But first,\" Adam said, a mischievous glint in his ancient eyes, \"shouldn’t we make the stage a bit more... appropriate for contestants of their stature?\"\nHe waved a hand. The thousand continent-sized arenas below began to merge, flowing together like liquid land, forming a single, impossibly vast battleground, a canvas the size of a thousand worlds.\nHe then glanced towards Sunny’s stand, towards Nova, Mammon, and Nexus, and sighed dramatically. \"Why do I always have to overwork like this?\"\nHe waved his hand again, and the arena doubled in size, then tripled, finally stabilizing at a scale that defied comprehension, a single battlefield the size of a million worlds.\n\"The rules remain the same!\" Adam announced. \"One million demigods will enter. The last thousand standing will advance. And the arena will shrink, but given its current... immensity... it will likely take two full months for the final circle to form.\"\nThe audience cheered. The Gods smiled. The demigods grinned, their auras flaring with competitive energy.\n\"Let The Crucible begin once again!\" Adam declared. \"But this time... for the Demigods!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 185: Ch 185 : A perfect Synergy\nThe Crucible for the demigods had begun, and the very fabric of the arena that was bigger than the area of million worlds combined, trembled under the weight of their divine power.\nOne million points of light vanished from the stands and reappeared scattered across the vast, chaotic landscape.\nSunny watched his own stand, a flicker of surprise in his cosmic gaze. Only two of his demigods were missing; or rather, one, as they were two halves of a single, powerful whole.\nThe Demigods of Life, Uranus and Gaia, had entered the fray.\nThe live chat, a river of consciousness connecting trillions of souls, immediately buzzed with confusion.\nLifeform1636: \"Wait, why are there one million and one screens for this match? Aren’t there only one million contestants?\"\nLifeform152 : \"They are connected. Demigod Gaia and Demigod Uranus are two bodies with a single, shared soul but different consciousness. They are one entity.\" The explanation came from a lifeform of Veridia, his knowledge gleaned from the sacred pages of ’The Genesis’.\nLifeform26173: \"Still, isn’t it unfair to have two demigods fighting as one, while all the others are solo?\"\nLifeform1636: \"Not really. From what I’ve read, Demigod Gaia abhors fighting. She is a being of pure creation and peace. So, it will be Demigod Uranus doing all the fighting, while also having to protect his other half.\"\nTheir speculation was cut short as the divine pair found their first target.\n\"I do not understand why we must actively seek out other demigods,\" Gaia’s voice was a soft, melodic sigh as she floated gracefully behind Uranus. \"Why can we not simply wait for them to come to us? Or better wait for the competition to end.\"\n\"And what is the fun in that?\" Uranus replied, his eyes, burning with a competitive fire, fixed on a distant, shimmering figure. \"We are the creations of the great Emperor Cosmos. It is our sacred duty to display our strength, to show the multiverse the might of his will!\"\nHis target, a magnificent creature shaped like a horse with a single, spiraling horn of pure light on its forehead, sensed their gaze.\nIt turned, its majestic form radiating a calm, confident power. But Uranus was already moving. He shot forward, a blur of angelic fury, afraid his prey might escape.\nThe horned demigod, showing no fear, lowered its head, and a brilliant beam of pure, white light shot from its horn, striking Uranus squarely on the forehead.\nThe impact was immense, a silent explosion of energy. But Uranus didn’t even flinch. He continued his charge, a single, devastating punch aimed at the creature’s long, elegant neck.\nThe horse demigod screamed in agony as the blow connected, its body staggering back. But a strange, almost serene, grin was plastered on its face.\nUranus, unnerved by this bizarre reaction, punched again, harder this time. The demigod’s body buckled, but the unnerving smile remained, its eyes seeming to mock his efforts.\nThe live chat exploded with confusion.\nLifeform1662: \"What is this? Those punches look powerful enough to shatter a world, but they don’t seem to be affecting that demigod at all! Can anyone from that demigod’s world explain its ability?\"\nLifeform53625: \"I can. That is the demigod from our world. His name is Immuno. And his talent is the reason he is undefeated. I have seen him live in action, when he was fighting the demon demigod invading our world.\"\nLifeform1662: \"What talent? Elaborate!\"\nLifeform53625: \"I do not know its name, but I have seen its effect. Whoever is touched by that beam of light from his horn, their attacks become completely useless against him. It is a perfect, absolute defense.\"\nLifeform1662: \"So he’s just an unbeatable punching bag? He doesn’t seem to have any fighting skills of his own.\"\nLifeform53625: \"That’s where you are wrong. He has another talent. Every attack that lands on him, every point of damage he should have taken, is stored and amplified. The more you hit him, the more powerful his own counter attack will be.\"\nA collective, cosmic gasp went through all the lifeforms watching. The synergy was terrifying, a perfect and seemingly unbeatable combination of absolute defense and infinitely scaling offense.\nSunny, watching from his throne, didn’t need the chat’s explanation. His God’s Eye had already shown him everything. \"Alex,\" he said to the God of Immuno, his voice a low hum of genuine praise, \"you have a truly wild imagination to have created such a powerful and unique demigod.\"\n\"Thank you, my Emperor,\" Alex replied, his divine form puffing up with pride.\nThe other subordinate Gods looked on with a burning envy. To be praised directly by the Emperor was an honor beyond measure, because he can provide them the benefits they needed.\nBut Sunny’s next words turned their envy into a mad frenzy of ambition.\n\"Good. Very good. I truly like your imagination,\" Sunny declared, his voice booming across the assembly of Gods. \"As a reward for strengthening our empire with such a creative champion, I will gift you ten new worlds. You may choose their specifics yourself.\"\nCreating worlds was a trivial matter for him now, a simple act of manifestation that cost a few thousand faith points.\nBut to a subordinate God, it was a gift of unimaginable value, a foundation for an entire new empire. The message was clear: impress the Emperor, and the rewards will be boundless.\n\"You’ve already won the tournament at this point,\" Zir said, congratulating Alex. \"Those 420 worlds are nothing compared to ten custom-made planets from the Boss.\"\nA wave of congratulations followed, and in that moment, a new, fierce competition was born among the Gods; not just to win the tournament, but to catch the eye of their Emperor through their demigods.\nMany Gods even grinned a little fully understanding the extraordinary talent of their demigods.\nSunny just smiled after looking at their competitive spirit and turned his gaze back to the arena. The real test had just begun.\nHow would his own creation, a being of pure life and combat, handle an opponent who was seemingly unbeatable?",

His opponent, Immuno, the horned horse-like demigod, was an enigma wrapped in an unbreakable shield.\nEvery blow Uranus landed, each punch carrying the force to shatter moons, simply... vanished, absorbed by Immuno’s strange ability.\n\"Be careful, Uranus!\" Gaia’s voice echoed in his mind, her tone laced with worry.\nShe floated serenely a safe distance away, her Aura of Life a gentle, protective balm against the chaotic shockwave from the attacks. \"I sense his power growing with every hit you deliver! It’s like he’s feeding on your attacks!\"\n\"Yeah, I can feel that,\" Uranus replied through gritted teeth. His hands stopped, not from the impact, but from the sheer frustration.\nHe felt the stored energy radiating from Immuno, a potential counter-attack building like a gathering storm.\nHe recognized the terrifying synergy: one talent negated all incoming damage, while the other weaponized that very negation.\nIt was a perfect, infuriating loop. He could pummel Immuno for a thousand years and achieve nothing but charging his opponent’s ultimate weapon.\nHe looked at Immuno’s serene, almost mocking smile, and then a different kind of smile touched his own lips; a warrior’s grin, not of aggression, but of cunning.\n\"You truly are powerful,\" Uranus conceded, his voice suddenly calm, almost conversational. \"A truly formidable opponent.\" He paused, letting the compliment hang in the air.\n\"But you seem to be forgetting something important. This is the second round of the tournament. We don’t need to fight to a dead end here.\"\nBefore Immuno could process the sudden shift in tone, Uranus moved. He wasn’t aiming for a knockout blow.\nHe wasn’t aiming for the demigod at all. He burst forward with the speed of a striking comet, his hand darting out not towards Immuno’s face, but towards the shimmering token bound securely at his waist.\nImmuno, still basking in the glow of Uranus’s compliment and anticipating another futile punch, reacted a fraction of a second too late.\nUranus’s fingers closed around the token. He didn’t snatch it. He didn’t pull it. He simply held it, a gesture that froze the battle in an instant.\n\"Checkmate,\" Uranus said, his grin widening. \"I seem to have won this little exchange. But,\" he added, his grip remaining firm but not forceful, \"I know you don’t want to be eliminated just like this, not with a power like yours. And frankly, I enjoyed our... spar.\"\nHe offered Immuno a deal, a warrior’s pact. \"How about this? We go our separate ways for now. And we meet again in the final round, where we can truly settle this without these pesky rules getting in the way?\"\nImmuno stared at Uranus, then at the hand holding his token, his life in this tournament. He recognized this tactical retreat.\nUranus couldn’t beat him, not yet, but he had found a way to win the round. And more than that, he had offered him a chance, a show of respect between warriors. Immuno nodded slowly. \"Okay,\" he replied, the single word sealing their truce.\nUranus released the token, gave a respectful nod, and shot off into the sky, leaving Immuno to contemplate the strange, honorable warrior he had just encountered.\nHigh above, in his Emperor’s throne, Sunny watched the scene unfold and let out a long, weary sigh, facepalming himself. ’Rules lawyering his way out of a fight he couldn’t win. Is that really the kind of champion I’m raising?’ he thought, a mix of amusement and exasperation swirling within him.\n\"Well,\" he finally conceded with a chuckle, \"a win is a win, I suppose, and he wasn’t supposed to fight as anyways\" He had to appreciate the cunning. Uranus wasn’t just a brute; he was learning to think like a commander.\nHis gaze then shifted from the arena to a different kind of prize.\nAdam, before returning to start the second round of the tournament had gifted Sunny something invaluable: a complete record, a divine memory crystal containing the descriptions of all his talents, both the mundane and the legendary.\nIt was an inheritance, the accumulated power of the firstborn God passed down to his successor.\nSunny focused his God’s Eye on the memory crystal. The list was staggering. Hundreds of SS-Grade talents, each a masterpiece of divine power.\nBut his attention was immediately drawn to the pinnacle, the six SSS-Grade talents that had defined Adam’s reign. He already possessed Divine Growth (formerly Overgrowth) and God’s Eye. Now, he examined the other four talents, his mind racing with the possibilities.\nFirst, Soul Splitting.\n[Talent Name: Soul Splitting]\n[Grade: SSS]\n[Description: Allows the user to split their soul into four distinct parts. The main soul retains absolute control over the others. When not under direct control, the sub-souls can operate independently, each possessing the full strength and talents of the original.]\nSunny’s mind immediately latched onto the strategic implications. \"Doesn’t this basically mean... immortality, perfected?\" he whispered.\nHe pictured it: one fragment of his soul hidden safely away, perhaps in the arena of emphiany of the Realm of Advancement where even Demon Lords could not reach.\nEven if his main body and the other three fragments were utterly destroyed, annihilated beyond even the power of Divine Immortality to restore, that final, hidden piece would remain.\nFrom that anchor, he could rebuild, regenerate, return. It was the ultimate failsafe, a contingency against cosmic-level threats. He immediately added it to his mental list of future acquisitions.\nNext, Resilience. It sounded almost mundane compared to the others, but as Sunny read the description, he felt a cold, profound awe settle over him.\n[Talent Name: Resilience]\n[Grade: SSS]\n[Description: Your very existence resists alteration. Upon suffering damage from any SSS-Grade source (powers, laws, entities), your being instantly analyzes the nature of the attack and adapts, gaining a significant, permanent resistance to that specific effect.\nThis adaptation can occur multiple times, allowing you to gradually become conceptually resistant even to the most powerful forces in the multiverse.]\nSunny finally understood. This was how Adam had survived. Not just the final battle, but the million years that followed, adrift in the Heaven realm, his soul constantly gnawed at by Maledictus’s SSS-Grade curse.\nEven broken, even powerless, this talent had stubbornly refused to let him be erased. It was the ultimate shield, an ability to endure the unendurable.\nHe thought of Deimos, the Demon Lord of Discord, a being whose power, Adam wasn’t able to adapt to, even with this talent, his form shivered by the mere thought of him. He quickly changed his thoughts by focusing on the next talent.\nBlessings, He already possessed an SS-Grade version, copied from Cerberus. But Adam’s original... it was on another level entirely.\n[Talent Name: Blessing]\n[Grade: SSS]\n[Description: Allows the user to bestow any known talent, spell, or memory upon a being lower in the cosmic hierarchy. Each blessing has a fixed cost of ten thousand faith points, regardless of the power or grade being transferred.]\nSunny stared at the last line, his mind going completely blank for a second before erupting in a silent scream of pure, agonizing regret. \"A fixed price? Ten thousand faith?!\"\nHe remembered the hundreds of millions he had spent blessing Ragnok with Reality Talk, the billions poured into gifting talents to his demigods. All that faith... wasted.\n\"I should have copied this talent from the start!\" he groaned. \"I could have earned quadrillions by blessings the gods\" With a heavy heart, he added this tragically overlooked power to his acquisition list, the missed opportunity a bitter pill to swallow.\nFinally, he came to the last SSS-Grade talent, the one whose name held the most mystery, the most weight: First-Born.\nAdam was the first God born from the Void. What power did that title truly grant? Every piece of cosmic lore, every secret Adam had shared, clicked into place as he read the description.",

      "content": "Chapter 187: Ch 187 : The King’s Inheritance and the threat from miles a\nA profound, almost jarring silence had settled over Sunny. He sat on his throne, the memory crystal gifted by Adam still pulsing faintly in his hand, a universe of cosmic secrets now swirling within his own divine consciousness.\nFor a long time, a fundamental piece of the puzzle had eluded him. He understood how blessings worked; a gift flowing down the hierarchy.\nHe understood his own Void-born nature granted him a higher place. But Adam, another Void-born, should have been his equal.\nHow could Adam bestow talents upon him, or upon other Void-born Gods in the ancient past?\nThe SSS-Grade Blessing talent itself stated it only worked on those below in hierarchy. It was a contradiction, a loose thread in the tapestry of cosmic law that had nagged at him.\nNow, staring at the final entry in Adam’s legacy, the description of the First-Born talent, the final piece clicked into place with the resounding clarity of a universal truth revealed.\n[Talent Name: First-Born]\n[Grade: SSS]\n[Description: As the first conscious entity born from the Void, your hierarchy is supreme, standing above all other creatures, including subsequent Void-born.]\nThe description was deceptively simple, yet its implications were staggering.\nAdam wasn’t just a Void-born; he was the first Void-born, the eldest brother, the original spark. His position wasn’t just high; it was absolute.\nIt explained everything; his ability to bless equals, the sheer, overwhelming power he possessed even in his diminished state, the reverence with which the memory of him was held.\nA slow, dangerous smile spread across Sunny’s face, hidden behind his mask.\nIf Adam was the first, and Sunny was also Void-born, then Sunny stood second only to him in the entire cosmic order.\nThis First-Born talent... it wasn’t just a power; it was a crown waiting to be claimed. With this, he could truly bless anyone, his commands would carry an even greater weight, and his authority would be unshakeable.\nHe immediately marked this talent as his highest priority, the next jewel he would add to his growing collection.\nFor now, he would wait for the tournament to reveal the hidden talent his sixth sense had promised him.\nHe pushed the exhilarating thoughts aside and turned his attention back to the Arena of Epiphany.\nThe Crucible raged on, a breathtaking spectacle of divine power and ambition.\nThe battles were far more engaging than the earlier rounds, a clash of demigods whose skills and strategies were a universe apart from the lifeforms.\nAfter fifteen grueling days, the first wave of demigod matches finally concluded. One million had entered; only a thousand remained.\n\"What a magnificent display!\" Adam’s voice boomed, filled with genuine appreciation.\n\"We have witnessed incredible wits, overwhelming strength, and even moments of profound compassion amidst the chaos! I, for one, cannot wait to see what more these champions have to offer!\"\nHe gestured grandly. \"Let the next wave begin!\"\nAnother million points of light vanished from the stands, teleported into the thousand deadly arenas. Sunny scanned his own roster, his gaze settling on the two empty spots.\nThis time, it was the Spirit King and Isiah, the Demigod of Knowledge.\n\"Let’s see what you two can do,\" Sunny thought, a flicker of anticipation in his mind.\nThe Spirit King materialized high above a windswept, mountainous arena. Without hesitation, his form dissolved, becoming one with the very air, an invisible, omnipresent consciousness riding the gales.\nHe was patient, a silent observer waiting for his prey to reveal themselves.\nIsiah, on the other hand, appeared under the shade of a colossal, ancient tree in a jungle biome.\nHe simply sat down, closed his milky-white, all-knowing eyes, and entered a state of serene meditation, a calm island in a sea of impending violence.\nHe did not need to seek his opponents; his knowledge encompassed the entire arena.\nHe already knew where they were, what their powers were, and precisely when they would arrive.\nOne was a hunter, the other a scholar. Their journeys through The Crucible had begun.\nIn the dark, oppressive meeting hall of Ashgar, the seven Demon Lords reconvened. The mood was grim, heavy with the bitter taste of failure.\n\"Five of our most promising demon gods are dead,\" Maledictus reported, her voice a low, dangerous hiss. \"And the others... they can find no trace of these new Gods. It is as if their entire civilization vanished into thin air.\"\n\"Losing five is insignificant!\" Ichor snarled, slamming his corrosive fist on the bone table, leaving another sizzling scar. \"What is unacceptable is that not a single one of these whelps has been killed! Where are they hiding?!\"\nHis rage burned hot, fueled by the humiliating memory of the masked God, Cosmos, slipping through his grasp.\nHe could still picture that portal closing, imagine the mocking grin hidden behind that infuriating mask.\n\"Deimos!\" Ichor rounded on the Lord of Discord. \"You know the location of this Cosmos, don’t you? I heard Xar’gath fell because of him! Give me his coordinates!\"\n\"Yes, I know where he resides,\" Deimos replied calmly, unmoved by Ichor’s fury. \"But I will not tell you. Not yet.\" He looked around the table, his black eyes meeting theirs one by one.\n\"We have made three moves against these new Gods. The treasure map. Unleashing the demigods into the Realm of Advancement. Sending the demon gods to hunt their home worlds. And all three moves have yielded... unsatisfactory results.\"\nThe other six Demon Lords nodded grimly. Their plans, usually so perfect, so devastating, were being countered at every turn.\n\"If we still see no significant results in the next thousand years,\" Deimos declared, his voice absolute, \"then I will give you his location. But not before.\"\nHe leaned back, a thoughtful expression on his face. \"And I do not believe this Cosmos is one of the newborns created by Adam’s artifact. I sensed him, once, a million years ago. But I was never able to find him.\"\nThe statement sent a ripple of shock through the hall.\n\"Even in your peak state, you could not find him?\" Maledictus asked, her usual composure cracking slightly.\n\"No,\" Deimos admitted. \"It was as if he simply vanished into thin air. I searched every corner of every multiverse for half a million years. And found Nothing. Then, just a few centuries ago, I sensed him again. His aura was weak then, fragile. But I knew it was him.\" A slow, predatory smile touched his lips as he remembered the words whispered by Cosmos, a challenge that had echoed in his mind for a million years.\n\"It isn’t time to fight you yet. But don’t worry. You will die one day for sure.\"\n\"He intrigues me,\" Deimos concluded, his eyes gleaming with a dark, ancient amusement. \"Let him grow a little stronger. Let him gather his little army. The game will be far more entertaining that way.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 188: Ch 188 : The calm and The storm\nThe Arena of Epiphany, a colossal stage that had borne witness to feats of impossible power and unexpected grace, fell into a hush once more.\nThe match of the second wave of demigods were underway, a breathtaking display that spanned a thousand different battlefields.\nSunny, from his high throne, watched with a keen, analytical eye, cataloging the diverse talents and strategies of his subordinates.\nHe saw demigods who commanded legions of summoned beasts, others who wielded illusions so perfect they could fool even divine senses, and warriors whose physical prowess defied the very laws of physics.\nIt was a universe of power, a living encyclopedia of combat potential.\nHis gaze, however, was drawn to two specific areas, two of his own creations whose approaches to this brutal Crucible could not have been more different.\nIn a windswept plateau dotted with jagged rock spires, the Spirit King reigned supreme.\nHe was not a physical combatant in the traditional sense. Upon arrival, his form had dissolved, becoming one with the very air of the arena.\nHe was the wind itself, an invisible, omnipresent consciousness that flowed through the canyons and around the spires.\nHe did not hunt; he observed. When two demigods clashed below, he would watch, analyze their strengths, their weaknesses, the subtle nuances of their elemental affinities.\nThen, with a gentle, almost imperceptible nudge, he would shift the wind currents, subtly aiding one, hindering the other.\nHe turned the chaotic battlefield into his personal chessboard, manipulating the elements to orchestrate victories and defeats without ever revealing his own hand.\nHe was a force of nature, a silent conductor leading a symphony of elemental destruction.\nBefore a fire demigod, he would become a sudden, suffocating vacuum, starving the flames of air.\nBefore an earth elemental, he would become a razor-sharp gale, eroding stone defenses with patient, relentless force.\nHe swept through the arena like a cleansing storm, his tally of eliminated opponents climbing steadily, each victory a testament to his absolute mastery over the elements.\nMeanwhile, in a dense, ancient jungle teeming with monstrous flora and fauna, Isiah, the Demigod of Knowledge, sat in serene contemplation beneath the boughs of a colossal tree.\nHe had not moved since the round began. He did not need to. His mind, an infinite wellspring of the Divine knowledge, already knew everything.\nHis first opponent, a hulking demigod with the head of an eagle and the body of a man named Kalthor, had charged him, eager for a swift kill.\nBut Isiah had simply opened his milky-white, all-knowing eyes and spoken a single, quiet truth. \"Kalthor,\" he had said, \"your ambition to create the spell ’Chaos Night’ is admirable, but the magical lattice you have constructed is fundamentally flawed. It collapses upon itself at the point of ignition.\"\nKalthor had stopped dead in his tracks, his attack forgotten, his mind reeling. How could this stranger know his name? How could he know the secret project that had consumed his every waking thought for the last decade?\nIsiah had then proceeded, calmly and patiently, to explain the precise error in Kalthor’s spell matrix, offering a solution so elegant and simple that Kalthor felt like a fool for not seeing it himself.\nOverwhelmed with gratitude, Kalthor hadn’t just abandoned his attack; he had sat down before Isiah, becoming his first, eager student.\nDemigods, drawn by the whispers of a blind seer who could solve any problem, began to flock around him like birds.\nOne became two, two became four, and soon, a strange, unprecedented gathering had formed around the ancient tree.\nNine hundred and ninety-eight demigods, beings of immense power and pride, sat in quiet reverence, their eyes closed, their minds linked to Isiah as he patiently corrected the flaws in their techniques, refined their spells, and offered insights that unlocked years of blocked potential.\nIt was not a battle; it was a lecture, a divine seminar held in the heart of a deadly competition.\nThe audience, both mortal and divine, watched this bizarre spectacle with a mixture of awe and disbelief.\nLifeform626271: \"Such divine teachings... am I even allowed to be listening to this? I feel like I should be paying with my life for this knowledge!\"\nLifeform62637: \"I was stuck at A-Grade for years! Just listening to his explanation of mana flow resonance... I think I just broke through! Thank you, Demigod Isiah!\"\nLifeform6263: \"Me too! That spell I’ve been trying to master since childhood, the one my own talent made impossible... his words just clicked! I understand now! Thank you!\"\nLifeform26738: \"He truly is the Demigod of Knowledge. He knows everything!\"\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity of shared learning, Isiah opened his eyes. \"Our class is over for today, students,\" he announced calmly.\nBut before his impromptu disciples could protest, a familiar chime echoed in their minds.\n[Congratulations! You have passed the second round of the Tournament of Gods]\nWith that notification, the 999 demigods and a spirit king vanished, teleported back to their stands.\nThey immediately turned their gazes towards the stand of God Cosmos, found the serene figure of Isiah, and bowed deeply in gratitude.\nAdam reappeared at the center of the arena, a broad, appreciative smile on his ancient face. \"Another great match delivered by our demigods! We witnessed the subtle massacre orchestrated by the Spirit King, and the profound teachings of the Demigod of Knowledge, which I believe have benefited not just the contestants, but all who were wise enough to listen.\"\nHis voice boomed across the universe. \"Let us not waste any more time! Let the next round begin immediately!\"\nAnother million points of light vanished from the stands. Sunny glanced at his own roster. Only one demigod was missing this time. But this demigod was an army unto himself, a force of nature unlike any other.\n\"Ah,\" Sunny chuckled, a cold, predatory glint in his cosmic eyes. \"I suppose Kalzarin’s record of clearing an arena in twenty seconds is about to be broken.\"\nHis gaze followed a single, small, unassuming black slime as it materialized in the center of a barren, desert.\nIt was Nexus, the Controller, the living heart of the Realm of Advancement itself.",

It did not defend. It simply... claimed. With a single, silent exertion of its will, the entire arena bent to its command.\nThe ground, the very biomes beneath the feet of a million demigods, turned against them. It was a subtle, almost imperceptible shift, but the effect was absolute.\nThe fundamental law of the arena, a rule that stated only the Controller of the realm could truly command it, was asserted.\nFor the 999,999 demigods, the world simply dissolved. They were trespassers, foreign entities in a body that had just rejected them. Their tokens didn’t even have time to shatter.\nThe arena itself, recognizing only one true master, ejected them. They reappeared on the spectator stands, their minds reeling, their expressions a mask of pure shock. They hadn’t been defeated; they had been... deleted.\nIn the now-empty desert arena, a single system panel materialized before the lone, quivering slime.\n[Congratulations... You have passed the second round of the Tournament of Gods]\nA profound, terrified silence fell over the entire multiverse. The demigods who had been ejected stared in horror, their pride and power rendered utterly meaningless.\nThey hadn’t lost a fight. They had lost to the very ground they stood on. A new, chilling understanding settled in their minds:\nNever, ever underestimate the demigods of the Emperor.\nThe lifeforms watching were even more confused.\nLifeform16737: \"Did the system glitch? Why isn’t the match starting? I’m waiting!\"\nLifeform27737: \"I saw the demigod from my world appear, and then he just... disappeared. What happened?\"\nLifeform277481: \"You mean to say the match is already over? Someone eliminated a million demigods in less than a second? Is that even possible?!\"\nAdam’s voice, laced with a hint of his own shock, boomed across the cosmos. \"What a... quick match that was. I believe many of you may not have registered what just happened.\" He waved a hand, and a replay filled the cosmic screens.\nIt was not a visual replay, but one that showed the projection of the entire arena. The audience saw the moment Nexus appeared, a tiny, insignificant dot.\nThen they saw its energy signature, a gentle blue pulse, suddenly spike, expanding in an unstoppable wave that engulfed the entire arena.\nThe other million energy signatures, representing the other demigods, simply vanished, snuffed out like candles in a hurricane.\n\"I hope you now understand what happened in the arena,\" Adam said with a dry chuckle. \"Now, time for another round!\"\nOne by one, the matches began and finished, a year passing in the blink of a cosmic eye. Sunny’s demigods, each in their own spectacular fashion, dominated their respective crucibles.\nNova, her form a colossal black dragon, unleashed a single dragon breath, a focused storm of time and space that selectively erased every opponent, a far more precise and terrifying display than Kalzarin’s brute-force freezing.\nUmbra, a shadow, created millions of shadow clones, one for every shadow in her arena. Her opponents were all assisanated, a silent touch from a darkness they never saw coming.\nShenlong, with a single, resonant word, \"Collapse,\" broke the entire arena, but with a gentle, benevolent will, he plucked the 999 souls with the greatest hope from the falling debris, granting them passage to the next round.\nLoki, in a display of pure, audacious mimicry, stole Nova’s talents and her very form, transforming into a second black dragon.\nHis dragon breath was weaker, a pale imitation, but it was more than enough to clear his arena in a mere five minutes.\nThea simply self-destructed a fraction of the particles that already connected her to every contestant, a silent, surgical strike that left only the ten most resilient demigods standing.\nCerberus, unable to shatter worlds, did what he did best. He hunted. He stalked his opponents one by one, a relentless predator who did not kill their bodies, but simply reached in and snatched their souls, a terrifying display that left his victims’ physical forms to be teleported away, their minds scarred by the experience of having their very essence manhandled.\nSugata, like Isiah, did not fight. He simply sat, his aura of peace so profound that any demigod who approached him with aggression found their fighting spirit vanish, replaced by an overwhelming urge to sit and listen to his gentle, calming wisdom.\nVeylara, the World Tree, turned her arena into a forest of death, her roots a sentient, unstoppable army that hunted down every opponent.\nEmber, the phoenix, simply burned. She was a living sun, her infinite mana fueling a relentless fire that wore down even the most powerful defenses.\nThe demigods of the races, though weaker and with fewer copied talents, fought with a desperate, clever tenacity, their connection to their people and the power of Divine Growth allowing them to punch far above their weight.\nEven the demigods of the dwarves and the Machina, with their technological marvels and mana-fueled nuclear blasts, secured their places in the next round.\nBut the most impressive among them was Diablo. As the demigod with a race born from his own blood, the merits he had accumulated were immense.\nHe had used them to purchase a formidable arsenal of talents, and he tore through his crucible with a practiced, brutal efficiency that marked him as a true contender.\nThe demigods of the spirits and auxiliary demigods also passed the round somehow.\nWhile the last to enter among Sunny’s demigod was Mammon, his void affinity and talents resosance worked like a charm, he had combined multiple powerful talents to create something that was even more terrifying and obliterated the whole arena slightly slower than Nova, even though he could have done it much faster.\nThe second round was over. Not a single one of Sunny’s champions had fallen. The message to the rest of the multiverse was clear, absolute, and terrifying.\nThey were not just playing in the Emperor’s tournament. They were living in the Emperor’s world.",

For one month, all remaining champions, both demigod and mortal, shall rest, heal, and prepare for the final ascent.\"\nA collective, universe-spanning groan of disappointment erupted from the stands. Trillions of voices, united in their desire for entertainment, booed the ancient God.\nBut Adam simply laughed, a warm, genuine sound that seemed to carry the weight of a billion years. He saw their impatience not as disrespect, but as passion.\nHe looked at the tired but triumphant demigods and the battle-worn mortal champions in the stands, and he knew this rest was a necessity.\nThe month passed in a blur of focused preparation. In the stands of the Pantheon, it was an armory of divine power. Sunny’s demigods, flush with the merits they had earned, descended upon Thea’s Cosmic Shop like hungry wolves.\nKnowing the final round would be a grueling marathon of continuous one-on-one battles with little rest, they sought talents to bolster their endurance.\nLoki, ever the opportunist, immediately purchased an SS-Grade Stamina Drain talent, a wicked ability that would allow him to siphon his opponent’s energy to replenish his own.\nNova, more practical, chose a simple but effective Endless Vigor talent, drastically increasing her own reserves.\nSunny, observing their choices, decided to bestow a gift of his own. He raised a hand, and a single, divine thought echoed in the minds of his creations. See as I see.\nHe granted each of them, with the exception of the already omniscient Nova and Thea, a blessing: a fragment of his own God’s Eye talent, an Eye of Truth that would allow them to perceive the talents and weaknesses of their opponents in the coming battles.\nThe other Gods were not idle. Inspired by Sunny’s generosity and fueled by the immense faith generated from their demigods’ victories, they too began to pour their resources into their champions, gifting them new talents and artifacts, preparing them for the final, glorious clash.\nThe month of preparation passed like a dream. Finally, the day arrived.\n\"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, champions and warriors from across the entire universe!\" Adam’s voice boomed, his energy infectious. \"I, Adam, your host and referee, hereby declare the start of the third and final round of the Tournament of Gods!\"\nA thunderous wave of applause, a psychic shockwave from trillions of beings, shook the very foundations of the arena.\n\"But before we begin, a few rules!\" Adam announced. \"This round will begin with the one-on-one battles of the mortal champions. One thousand battles will commence simultaneously in one thousand different arenas. After the mortals have crowned their victor, we will proceed to the demigod tournament, which will take place in a single, grand arena for all to witness.\"\nHe continued, \"Two lifeforms will be chosen at random. The loser will be eliminated and returned to their home world. The winner will await their next match. This will continue until only one remains. Are the rules clear?\"\nA unified roar of \"YES!\" was his answer.\nThere were now one hundred million mortal champions and fifteen million demigods left in the tournament, the best of the best, the survivors of The Crucible.\n\"Then let us begin this final round, shall we?\" Adam said, a profound, almost paternal happiness on his ancient face. He knew the current strength of these new champions was a pale shadow of the old demons, a flickering candle against a raging inferno.\nBut he saw their potential. He saw the fire in their eyes, the unyielding will to grow, a spirit that was a million times brighter than the demigods and even God’s under him.\n\"I believe in you all,\" he whispered to himself. He then glanced down at the green token in his hand, at the faint, sleeping light within. \"how forgetful of me,\" he added with a soft smile. \"We are also in this battle.\"\nThe first pairing was chosen. From a thousand different stands, two thousand champions vanished, teleported to their designated battlegrounds.\nThe main broadcast screen focused on a single arena, a lush, jungle biome.\nOn one side stood an elven fire mage, a woman of breathtaking beauty, her very form radiating a gentle, almost timid aura of mana.\nOn the other side stood her opponent, a creature of pure, chitinous nightmare. It was an insectoid warrior, human-sized, with six razor-sharp limbs, a segmented carapace the color of obsidian, and multifaceted eyes that glowed with a cold, predatory intelligence.\nThe elf, whose greatest fear in life was insects, let out a small, terrified squeak.\nHer opponent was her worst nightmare given form. Her composure shattered. Panicked, she unleashed her full arsenal.\nA storm of miniature suns, a barrage of plasma lances, a cataclysmic meteor strike; she threw every spell she knew, her only thought to obliterate the terrifying creature before it could get any closer.\nThe audience laughed at her clumsy, fear-driven assault. Even the Gods couldn’t help but chuckle.\nIn the stands of the Pantheon, however, the demigod of the insect race just smiled. This champion was one of his most brilliant students.\nWhen the dust from the magical apocalypse finally settled, a wave of shock silenced the crowd. The insect warrior was still standing.\nIts obsidian carapace was glowing a molten red, steam hissing from its joints, but it was completely unharmed.\nA low, menacing chittering sound, the insect equivalent of a laugh, escaped its mandibles.\n\"My turn,\" a voice, cold and sharp, echoed in the elf’s mind.\nThe insect lunged. It moved with a speed that was impossible for its size, a black blur that crossed the arena in an instant.\nThe elf didn’t even have time to scream. A single, razor-sharp claw rested gently against her throat, the cold, hard chitin a final, terrifying sensation.\n\"I... I surrender,\" she whispered, her voice trembling. \"Please... just move a little away. I’m scared.\"\nAnd then, her eyes rolled back, and she fainted from sheer terror. The moment her consciousness faded, she was teleported back to her stand, leaving the insect warrior alone in the silent arena.\n[Congratulations! You have won your first battle]\nThe insect champion was teleported back to its own stand. It immediately looked over at the elven stand, a flicker of genuine concern in its alien eyes.\nSeeing the elven mage being gently attended to by a pair of smiling angels, it let out a quiet hiss of relief before turning its attention to the other 999 battles that were still raging across the cosmos.\nThe time for mercy was over. It was time to study its future prey.",

      "content": "Chapter 191: Ch 191 : Opening Up Secrets\nThe Tournament of Gods raged on, a spectacle of power and ambition played out across a thousand deadly arenas.\nBattles ended, champions rose and fell, and the trillions watching across the cosmos were glued to the live broadcast, their own hopes and fears mirrored in the struggles of the contestants.\nAfter the first thousand matches, the second wave of matches had begun.\nA hush fell over the audience as the name of the next contestant flashed on the cosmic screen: Thorn. But the majestic green dragon did not appear.\nSunny, observing from his high throne, shifted his gaze to his champion’s stand. There, amidst the other victorious warriors of Veridia, Thorn remained.\nHe was still seated cross-legged, his humanoid form radiating an intense, shimmering aura.\nThe green scales that adorned his hands, chest, and legs pulsed with a light that grew brighter with each passing second, a sign of the profound transformation occurring within him.\nTo the other Gods, it had been a few months since Thorn had entered this state.\nBut Sunny, his perception attuned to the accelerated flow of time he had cast upon his champion, knew the truth.\nFive thousand years had passed for Thorn within that bubble of epiphany.\n’Are you stuck somewhere, Thorn?’ Sunny thought, a flicker of concern touching his divine consciousness.\nHe could feel the chaotic, turbulent energy swirling within his apostle, a mind lost in a labyrinth of newfound understanding.\nAn epiphany was a delicate thing, a moment of profound insight that could elevate a being to new heights or shatter their very soul if they lost their way.\nSunny decided it was time to intervene.\nHis voice, not a physical sound, but a gentle, resonant thought, pierced through the storm in Thorn’s mind.\n\"God Cosmos.\" Thorn said, as sensed the parental love and care of his God radiating deep in his soul.\n\"I am listening, child,\" Sunny replied, his mental voice a soothing and calm anchor in Thorn’s sea of confusion.\n\"God... I am lost,\" Thorn’s thought echoed back, raw with vulnerability and exhaustion. He had seen visions, touched upon truths about the nature of Hope, but the path forward remained shrouded in mist.\n\"I know it is difficult to find one’s path,\" Sunny’s voice resonated with the wisdom he had gained all this time. \"But you must find it if you wish to remain useful to Veridia. In a few short years, S-Grade powerhouses will be commonplace. Look at the dragons soaring in our skies now—they are just the beginning. Do you think your current strength will be enough then?\" Sunny’s words were not a rebuke, but a challenge, a spark to reignite Thorn’s resolve.\n\"You have shown countless lost souls the path to safety. But you must also find your own.\"\nA moment of profound silence hung between them. Then, Thorn’s mental voice roared back, no longer lost, but blazing with a newfound, absolute certainty. \"I know now! Hope! That is my path!\"\nA slow, satisfied smile spread across Sunny’s face, hidden behind his mask. ’Hope? An interesting choice. Then what path will Shenlong take? Well,’ he mused, ’I shouldn’t interfere between a teacher and his student.’\nHe gently withdrew his consciousness, severing the connection.\nThorn had already spent five thousand years in this state; five thousand more, and his mortal lifespan would reach its end.\nBut Sunny wasn’t worried. With the gift of Nine Lives, death was merely an inconvenience.\nHe focused his will again, accelerating the time flow around Thorn even further, pouring temporal energy into his apostle’s transformation.\n’Emerge quickly, little fellow. Veridia awaits its Miracle’s Hand.’\nWith Thorn’s epiphany now guided, Sunny turned his attention back to the tournament roster.\nThorn’s match was next. Without hesitation, he sent a command through Thea. Thorn’s name was removed from the active participants. He had forfeited.\nThe reaction in the God Chat was immediate and confused.\n\"Boss! Why did you forfeit?! Thorn could have easily won! You could have just postponed the fight! You’re the Emperor, you make the rules!\" Zir’s said.\nThe thoughts of the other Gods echoed Zir’s confusion. Why would their Emperor throw away a guaranteed victory, a chance for more glory and faith?\n\"Perhaps the epiphany will take far longer than anticipated? Longer than the tournament itself?\" Strategist reasoned, always searching for the logical explanation.\nHe knew Sunny wouldn’t do something so seemingly foolish without a deeper purpose. Every victory was not just a win for the champion; it was a surge of faith for their God. Forfeiting seemed counterintuitive.\n\"It is not that,\" Sunny said, his words appearing calmly amidst the storm of speculation. \"He may be waking up anytime soon.\"\n\"Oh! Did you forfeit because the opponent was one of my lifeforms? How sweet of you, Boss!\" she said, with a little blush on her face.\nThe champion Thorn had been scheduled to fight was indeed one of hers.\n\"You wish! There must be another reason!\" zir said, he knew that Sunny wasn’t someone who would be foolish enough to let go of so much faith.\n\"Yes, there is a reason,\" Sunny finally revealed, letting the anticipation build for a moment before dropping the bombshell.\n\"He will not be able to fight in the lifeform tournament after his epiphany is complete.\" He let the implication hang in the air, a silent challenge to their understanding as well as little fun for himself.\nThere was a pause, a collective intake of breath across billions of Gods. Then, Strategist’s finally said, his words trembling with dawning comprehension.\n\"Is it...?\" He paused, his mind flashing back to the Light, Ragnok, and Medusa. \"My Emperor... you mean...?\"\n\"Yes,\" Sunny affirmed, his simple word confirming the impossible. \"Thorn is breaking through to the demigod realm.\"\nThe Gods exploded. Not with confusion this time, but with shock, followed by a wave of congratulats for Sunny.\nAnother demigod! And a natural-born one! His power seemed truly limitless.\nBut amidst the celebration, Strategist’s sharp, analytical mind had already moved on to the next puzzle.\n\"My Emperor, forgive my ignorance, but I do not understand. How can an S-Grade lifeform ascend to the demigod realm? I myself have guided many S-Grade champions, poured resources into them, yet all have failed at the final step. What is the missing key?\"\nSunny facepalmed internally. In the chaos of recent events, he had completely forgotten to share the crucial knowledge he had gained from Adam.\nHe decided to rectify that now.\n\"Actually, Strategist, the path to ascension is not as mysterious as you might think. There are simply two fundamental requirements that must be met.\"\nEvery God leaned closer, their attention absolute. This was knowledge that could change the fate of their entire civilizations.\n\"The first requirement is potential. The lifeform must possess, either naturally or through blessing or growth, at least one SS-Grade talent. This talent acts as the anchor, the divine spark necessary to elevate a mortal soul to the demigod realm. Without it, ascension is impossible.\" He paused, a subtle smile in his voice.\n\"And, as you all know, thanks to my Divine Growth blessing upon this universe, any of your lifeforms or even you all have the potential to reach that SS-Grade through dedication and hard work.\"\nA wave of renewed hope washed over the Gods. The path was difficult, but not closed.\n\"The second requirement is the most crucial, and the most difficult. It is the comprehension of a Law.\"\nHe elaborated, his words painting a picture of the very fabric of reality.\n\"To become a demigod, a lifeform must not just possess power; they must understand its source. They must comprehend a fundamental Law of the universe. It can be a Law of the elements, like Fire or Water. It can be a Law of concepts, like Strength, Hope, or Conviction. It can even be a Law tied to something mundane, like a tree or a stone. As their comprehension deepens, as they grasp the true essence of that Law, they will naturally cross the threshold and ascend.\"\n\"So that’s why... My champions had the potential, the SS-Grade talent, but they lacked the understanding, the connection to a fundamental Law...\" The final piece of the puzzle clicked into place for him, and a universe of possibilities opened up. He was one step closer to his ultimate goal.\nSunny saw the understanding dawn on Strategist’s face, and on the faces of billions of other Gods. He decided to push them further, to give them a glimpse of the true, ultimate prize.\n\"And since we are sharing secrets today,\" he continued, his voice dropping slightly, becoming more intimate, more conspiratorial, \"I suppose I should also tell you how a demigod can ascend even further... how they, and perhaps even you yourselves, might one day become true Gods.\"\nHis words stopped every God in their tracks. They stopped looking at the arenas. They stopped analyzing talents.\nTheir entire focus narrowed to a single, burning point. The thought of their loyal demigods, their creations, becoming a God. Sent a ripple through the their very souls.",

      "content": "Chapter 192: Ch 192 : The Path to Divinity\nThe Arena of Epiphany buzzed with a confused, almost frustrated energy.\nAll the lifeforms watching across the cosmos stared at their system panels, their collective gaze fixed on the empty battleground where Thorn, the majestic green dragon, was supposed to be fighting.\nInstead, he remained in the stands, a serene, motionless statue wrapped in a cocoon of shimmering golden light, lost in the depths of his epiphany.\nThe live chat, usually a torrent of cheers and jeers, was now a confused murmur.\nLifeform1537: \"Why did Champion Thorn forfeit? He could have won easily! I wanted to see him use those Dragon Words everyone talks about!\"\nLifeform26379: \"Maybe his epiphany isn’t over? He’s been like that for months now.\"\nLifeform16738: \"You guys, stop worrying about the dragon! Look at Arena 435! There’s an insane fight going on between a werewolf champion and a vampire lord! This is epic!\"\nWhile the mortals quickly shifted their focus to the next spectacle, the Gods seated in the highest tier of the arena exchanged glances.\n\"Boss, can a demigod really become a God?\" Asura asked, leaning forward on his throne, his voice a low whisper carrying across the divine assembly. The question voiced the thought that was now burning in every God’s mind.\n\"I guess the talent requirement would be SSS-Grade,\" another God mused, shaking his head. \"Something impossible for our lifeforms, surely.\"\n\"No,\" Sunny’s voice cut through their speculation, calm and absolute. \"There isn’t such a requirement as an SSS-Grade Talent.\" He let the surprising statement hang in the air for a moment.\n\"The only thing required is Comprehension. Deep, profound comprehension of a fundamental Law.\" He elaborated, sharing the secrets Adam had unveiled, secrets that felt like they were rewriting the very rulebook of their existence.\n\"Even you yourselves can walk this path. Find a Law that resonates with your innate talent—the Law of Wisdom for you, Strategist; perhaps the Law of fire for Vulcan\" He spoke casually, dropping cosmic truths as if discussing the weather.\n\"So... only comprehension?\" Zir sputtered, his mind racing, the possibilities unfolding before him like an infinite, starry map.\n\"Boss, with your blessing increasing our lifeforms’ comprehension tenfold, and the increased chance of them being born with such talents... doesn’t that mean... doesn’t that mean we could have multiple Gods serving under us in the future?\"\n\"Yes,\" Sunny confirmed simply. But his next words were a cold dose of reality, a necessary counterpoint to their soaring ambition.\n\"But do not forget one crucial thing. Once your lifeform, born naturally, ascends first to demigod and then to true Godhood... they are no longer bound by your will. They may become disloyal. They may even betray you.\" He let the chilling possibility sink in.\n\"On the other hand, a demigod created from a Divine Embryo, born of your own essence... even if they achieve Godhood, their loyalty to their creator remains absolute, eternal.\" He looked out at the sea of divine faces. \"So, think carefully where you choose to invest your resources.\"\n\"We understand, Emperor,\" the Gods replied, their voices a low, thoughtful chorus. The path to creating their own pantheon was open, but it was fraught with potential peril.\nSuddenly, a different voice cut through the discussion, rough and laced with a simmering anger.\nIt was Vulcan, the burly God of the fire world, his form radiating a palpable heat. \"Emperor Cosmos,\" he began, his voice tight, \"I wish to speak about something.\"\nSunny inclined his head, granting permission.\n\"Where is Kitsune?\" Vulcan demanded, his fists clenching. \"I wished for revenge for her deceit, for the faith she stole from me. But she has vanished from the chats, from existence it seems. Is she... dead?\"\n\"Oh, Kitsune,\" Sunny replied, his tone calm, almost dismissive. \"She is no longer a God. Her divinity has been revoked. She currently resides in the Netherworld. You may visit her anytime you wish, simply contact Cerberus to arrange passage.\"\nA slow, savage grin spread across Vulcan’s face. \"Lost her God status? Serves the vixen right!\" He let out a booming laugh that seemed to shake the arena. \"As for visiting her... oh, I will gladly visit her. Every time I have a spare moment, I shall go and remind her of her foolishness. Verbally, of course,\" he added quickly, catching the wary glances of some of the female deities nearby. \"Torturing souls is not my job.\"\n\"I too shall pay her a visit,\" Snatcher spoke up, his voice a cold whisper of wind. \"My own demigod almost perished because of her arrogance.\"\n\"You are all welcome there,\" Sunny said smoothly. \"Just remember to ask Cerberus for permission. It is his realm, after all.\"\nAs the Gods processed this new piece of cosmic justice, Sunny leaned back, a quiet confidence radiating from him. ’No matter how many Laws you comprehend,’ he thought, his gaze sweeping over the ambitious faces, ’you will never outshine my own creations.’\nHe knew the hierarchy Adam had explained. The Gods comprehending specific Laws like Fire Resistance, Flowing Water, Earthquake etc would always be subordinate to the Gods who mastered the fundamental Laws themselves, the Laws of Fire, Water, and Earth.\nAnd his demigods, the beings he had personally crafted and guided, were destined to claim those fundamental thrones.\nThey would be the true pillars of this new era. ’I am a genius,’ he thought, allowing himself a moment of pure, unadulterated satisfaction.\nHis gaze then drifted back to the stand where Thorn sat, still enveloped in his golden cocoon of epiphany. The aura around him was stabilizing, the chaotic energy coalescing into something solid, powerful, and undeniably divine.\n’It may take another day for you to fully emerge,’ Sunny thought. He turned his attention back to the ongoing battles in the arena, his God’s Eye scanning the remaining champions, searching for that spark, that unforeseen variable his intuition had promised him.\nHe had already gifted nearly four thousand new worlds to the Gods whose demigods had impressed him with their creativity or power, a strategic act of generosity that had ignited a firestorm of ambition throughout the Pantheon.\nGods were now scrambling, desperately trying to create or showcase demigods that might catch their Emperor’s eye, hoping for a similar boon.\nAdam, observing this frenzy from his own position, just smiled. It wasn’t a bad thing. In this new era, under this new Emperor, ambition was not a sin; it was the engine of progress.\nAnd Sunny, the God of Manifestation, the Emperor of the Pantheon, was proving to be a master conductor, orchestrating a symphony of growth and power on a scale the multiverse had never seen before.",

      "content": "Chapter 193: Ch 193 : A legendary Battle\nThe Tournament of Gods raged on, a breathtaking, universe-spanning spectacle of raw power, cunning strategy, and desperate survival.\nFrom his high throne, Sunny watched the countless battles unfold, his God’s Eye processing all the battles simultaneously.\nFifty million champions remained from the initial hundred million, a staggering number, yet only a fraction of those who had begun.\nThe sheer scale of the elimination was brutal, but necessary. This tournament wasn’t just about glory; it was about forging the future protectors of his empire.\nHis gaze swept over the stands where his own champions rested, awaiting their next matches.\nThey had performed exceptionally well, their S-Grade power and the subtle enhancements from Veridia’s unique environment setting them leagues apart from most competitors.\nAnaske, Nephis, Kalzarin and all the othereaders of the races! they were legends in the making, their names already whispered with awe and fear in the live chat that connected all the souls of the universe.\nYet, even among his elite, there had been casualties. His focus drifted to a small figure resting in the Veridia stands, a pixie whose vibrant wings drooped slightly, her form still recovering from a recent defeat.\nShe had fought bravely, her illusion magic a dazzling display of misdirection and cunning.\nBut her opponent had been the chosen champion of another God, a hulking warrior from a race bred for generations for raw, brute strength, his mind too simple and direct to be fooled by her tricks.\nSunny watched as the pixie, healed by the angels, finally managed a weak smile and nodded gratefully towards his throne before being teleported back to Veridia by Thea.\n\"Pixies are not designed for direct combat anyway,\" Sunny thought, sending a silent wave of approval towards the departing champion. \"It was still a good fight.\"\nHis simple acknowledgment, a gesture unseen by most, nonetheless sent a ripple of warmth through the remaining champions of Veridia.\nThey felt the care of their Creator, a quiet reminder that their efforts were seen, their sacrifices valued.\nA new fire of determination ignited in their eyes. They would fight harder, push further, not just for glory, but for him.\n’Sometimes I don’t know if you do these things unknowingly, or if you are the greatest schemer I have ever known,’ Adam thought, observing the subtle exchange from his referee’s perch.\nHe smiled. ’Whatever it is, you are truly their Emperor.’\nThe battles continued. The fifty million survivors dwindled to twenty-five million. The stands grew emptier, the tension thicker.\nSunny’s forces suffered a few more losses;two dwarves overwhelmed by their opponents power, two merfolk champions unfortunately got opponents that left their powers completely useless.\nBut overall, the champions of Veridia remained a dominant, almost terrifying force.\nAnd then, a matchup appeared on the main screen that sent a collective gasp through the entire arena of emphiany and even the universe.\nTwo names, already legendary in this tournament, because of their awesome fights.\nIt was a clash the audience had been dreaming of, a battle between two titans operating on a level far beyond most mortal champions.\nVel versus Lux.\n\"I didn’t know I would be this lucky,\" Lux said, his voice echoing in the vast, jungle arena where they had teleported.\nA confident, almost predatory smile touched his lips as he faced the elven king.\n\"I should be saying that,\" Vel replied coolly, his serene expression unreadable. \"You would have been eliminated in our last encounter, were it not for the round ending prematurely. Luck favored you then.\"\nLux just chuckled, stretching his arms casually. \"I suppose you won’t listen to reason like this. Very well. I held back during our previous encounter. Consider this fair warning: I will be going all out this time. Take care of yourself, old king.\"\nIn the next instant, Lux exploded into motion. His previous attacks, which had felt probing, almost hesitant, were gone.\nNow, it was pure, unrestrained aggression. He moved like a blur, his fists and feet striking Vel’s defensive barrier of contracted spirits with the force of cannonballs.\nThe air cracked with the sonic booms of his blows. The invisible shield, which had seemed impenetrable before, now visibly cracked and warped under the relentless assault.\nVel knew the shield wouldn’t last long against this onslaught. Lux wasn’t just strong; he was channeling an immense amount of refined mana into every strike, a level of power that belied his youthful appearance.\nThe elf king’s expression hardened. It was time to go on the offensive.\nWith a grace born of centuries of practice, Vel began to weave spells, not one at a time, but dozens simultaneously.\nHis hands became a blur, drawing intricate runes in the air, pulling raw mana from the environment, shaping it with his formidable will.\nIt was a feat of magical multitasking that would have made lesser archmages weep with envy.\nFireballs the size of boulders, lances of pure lightning, shards of razor-sharp ice, tendrils of binding earth; a storm of elemental fury erupted around him, all locked onto Lux’s charging form.\nBut Lux just grinned, his eyes blazing with a joyful battlelust. He didn’t stop his attack. He didn’t even try to dodge. He welcomed the incoming magical storm, his body becoming a conduit.\nSeeing that same, infuriatingly confident smile, Vel also smiled. ’I will not be a fool and fall for the same trick twice,’ he thought.\nJust as the wave of spells was about to crash upon Lux, Vel snapped his fingers.\nEvery single spell detonated prematurely, halfway between them, unleashing a catastrophic explosion of elemental energy.\nThe blast wave hit Lux like a physical hammer blow, sending him tumbling backward, skidding across the jungle floor for hundreds of meters before finally coming to a stop.\nHe pushed himself up slowly, wiping a trickle of blood from his lips, his confident smile replaced by a look of grudging respect. \"Impressive, Vel,\" he admitted. \"Very impressive. I never thought you would find such a direct counter.\"\n\"And I am impressed that you survived a point-blank detonation of ten of my strongest spells,\" Vel replied, his own voice holding a newfound respect for the young human prodigy.\nThey both began to laugh, a shared moment of pure joy in the thrill of facing a worthy opponent. It had been centuries since either of them had felt such exhilaration.",

      "content": "Chapter 194: Ch 194 : Suspicion\nThe jungle arena, a stage set for a clash of titans, held its breath. Vel, the elven king, stood opposite Lux, the prodigious human champion, the air crackling with the residue of their previous, explosive exchange.\n\"You truly think I am here just to watch you break this shield?\" Vel’s voice was calm, but his eyes gleamed with a dangerous, calculating light.\nHe had hoped to win without resorting to this, a power born from a blessing, a touch of the void itself.\nBut Lux’s unique Convertor talent left him no choice. He began to chant, his voice low and resonant, weaving a spell he had spent decades perfecting, a silent, invisible blade forged in the emptiness between realities.\nAs the final syllable left Vel’s lips, the spell shot forth. But it did not travel through the air. It did not carry a visible form or an audible sound. It simply... vanished.\nTo all the lifeforms watching, it looked like another failed attempt, a desperate, wasted effort against Lux’s seemingly absolute defense.\nBut the demigods and Gods knew better. They felt it. A subtle, almost imperceptible ripple in the very fabric of space itself, a silent predator moving through the void, aimed directly at Lux.\nLux, his Convertor talent still active, braced himself for another wave of elemental fury, ready to devour and replenish.\nHe felt nothing. No heat, no cold, no impact. But suddenly, a searing line of wrongness appeared across his chest, as if reality itself had been sliced open.\nHis Convertor talent flared, trying to absorb the attack, but there was nothing to absorb. This wasn’t energy; it was absence.\nIt was the void itself, a conceptual wound that bypassed his defenses entirely. Pain, sharp and blinding, lanced through him.\nHe staggered back, clutching his chest, a thin line of blood welling up on his tunic. He looked up at Vel, his confident grin replaced by a look of shocked disbelief.\nSunny watched the exchange from his high throne, a flicker of surprise in his cosmic gaze.\nHe glanced mentally towards Mammon, who simply gave the equivalent of a shrug. ’I only gave him the key. He forged the blade himself.’\nSunny then looked towards Valeria, the demigoddess of the elves, who offered a small, proud nod.\nThe implications were clear. Two of his demigods had tapped into one of the most powerful and dangerous elements in the cosmos: the Void.\nThe seed he had planted, the diverse talents he had nurtured, were bearing unexpected, terrifying fruit.\nFar away, in the obsidian heart of the demonic realm, the city of Ashgar brooded under a sky the color of dried blood.\nthe seven Demon Lords sat upon their thrones around the massive table of polished bone.\nThe air was thick with ancient malice and a tension that seemed to make the very shadows hide.\n\"Why,\" Deimos, the Lord of Discord, began, his voice a calm, chilling river in the oppressive silence, \"after all these years, after mobilizing legions of our demigods and gods, have we failed to capture or kill even a single one of these new whelps? Why do they continue to elude us?\"\n\"They are adept at hiding,\" Maledictus, the Lord of Curses, replied, her voice a melodious hum that failed to conceal her own frustration.\n\"The multiverse is vast, Deimos. Finding a single, determined God who wishes to remain hidden is like finding a specific grain of sand in an endless desert. And these new ones... they possess unity, a network that warns them, guides them.\"\n\"Hiding?!\" Ichor, the Lord of Corrosion, slammed his slimy, acidic fist onto the table, the ancient bone sizzling and smoking under his touch.\n\"They mock us! While we sit here discussing tactics, they grow stronger! We should have ripped their pathetic little universe apart the moment we sensed them!\"\n\"Would you stop that!\" Maledictus screamed, her composure finally cracking as she pointed a delicate, clawed finger at the smoldering mark on the table. \"This table is forged from the bones of the Sky Dragon Emperor! If you break it, there is no replacement! Control your temper!\"\n\"Tch!\" Ichor hissed, withdrawing his hand but continuing to glare daggers at the empty air. \"Then find me those Gods! Bring me this ’Cosmos’ they whisper about!\"\n\"My subordinates report a disturbing trend,\" Beelzebub, the Lord of Gluttony, rumbled, his voice a low growl like the shifting of continents.\nHe paused his gnawing on a petrified star core, his eyes burning with a hungry light. \"Across the wider multiverses, beyond the sphere of Adam’s creations, new Gods are appearing. Not just a few. Millions.\"\nThe statement landed like a physical blow. Even Deimos’s calm facade flickered. Millions of new Gods?\nIn the old era, a new God emerging was a rare event, perhaps one a century. But millions, appearing across countless realities in just a few thousand years?\n\"This is... unexpected,\" Deimos finally said, his mind racing through the strategic implications. More Gods meant more variables, more potential threats, but also... more potential for discord.\nHe knew of multiverses where their demonic influence was weak, places resistant to their usual tactics.\nThere was the Multiverse of No Emotion, a cold, logical reality where beings lacked the passions that fueled fear, despair, and greed—a barren wasteland for demons whose power fed on such things.\nThen there was the Multiverse of Balance, a reality governed by an absolute, self-correcting law. If a powerful evil entered, an equally powerful good would spontaneously arise to counter it.\nEven a Demon Lord entering that realm would face annihilation, as the multiverse itself would birth a ’hero’ perfectly designed to be their antithesis.\n\"This is bad,\" Phobos rasped, the hundred terrified faces swirling in his shadowy form twisting in genuine fear. \"If these new Gods unite with the ones from Adam’s multiverse...\"\n\"Why are you fearing a few fledgling gods of the Laws?\" Ichor scoffed, regaining his bravado. \"We slaughtered the Void-born in the past! These newborns are nothing but snacks!\" He licked his slimy lips, the gesture filled with a greedy hunger.\n\"You are right, Ichor, they are weak individually,\" Maledictus countered, her sharp mind cutting through his arrogance.\n\"But we are not fearing them. We are questioning why. Why are so many appearing now? After a million years of silence? It feels... orchestrated. As if something, or someone, is actively helping them, guiding them.\" She leaned forward, her eyes gleaming with suspicion. \"Just as Adam created his ten billion replacements, perhaps another force is now seeding the cosmos with its own champions.\"\n\"I have heard whispers as well,\" Malakai, the Lord of Despair, spoke up, his voice a dry rustle of forgotten leaves.\n\"What?\" Ichor demanded impatiently.\n\"In the Multiverse of Cards,\" Malakai explained, \"a new God has ascended. He claims to have rediscovered a long-lost method for creating SSS-Grade cards, a technique lost since the fall of the old God Artifex.\"\n\"So? Fortunate finds happen,\" Belial, the Lord of Lies, said dismissively, polishing one of his perfect fingernails.\n\"Perhaps,\" Malakai conceded. \"But after hearing Maledictus’s concerns, I wonder. How does such a monumental secret, hidden for a million years, suddenly resurface now? And,\" he continued, his voice dropping lower,\n\"in five different Cultivation Multiverses, new Gods have also begun to appear. Their ascensions are all linked to the sudden, simultaneous opening of ancient tombs, tombs belonging to gods who perished in the great war, filled with lost techniques and elixirs.\"\nHe looked around the table, his gaze lingering on each of his peers. \"Five ancient tombs opening at once? A lost SSS-Grade technique rediscovered? Millions of new Gods appearing across realities previously barren of them?\"\nMaledictus leaned back, a slow, chilling smile spreading across her beautiful, cruel face. \"Well done, Malakai,\" she purred. \"Now... does anyone at this table still believe this is all just a coincidence?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 195: Ch 195 : Father Versus Son\n\"Who among you is ready to take responsibility for investigating these new anomalies?\" Deimos asked, his voice calm, yet carrying the weight of command that silenced the others.\nHe knew the sudden appearance of millions of new Gods, coupled with the strange ability of some to simply vanish with their entire worlds, was a significant shift in the cosmic game.\n\"These... coincidences... across multiple multiverses demand scrutiny.\"\n\"I will go,\" Ichor snarled, his slimy form practically vibrating with eagerness. He slammed a corrosive fist onto the bone table, leaving another sizzling scar.\n\"I am tired of this endless waiting in Ashgar. Maledictus, will you join me?\" The prospect of hunting, of corroding new worlds, was a delicious temptation he could no longer resist.\n\"Certainly,\" Maledictus replied, her voice a melodious purr that promised slow, agonizing curses upon any who crossed their path.\n\"Be careful,\" Deimos warned, his black eyes fixing on the two departing Lords. \"Do not interfere too overtly. Do not kill any of these fledgling gods... yet. Observe. Understand. If possible, corrupt them first. We need information, not mindless slaughter.\"\nWith a final nod, Ichor and Maledictus dissolved into shadows, their malevolent presence vanishing from the hall as they began their journey across the cosmos, two ancient predators embarking on a new hunt.\nMeanwhile, back in the Arena of Epiphany, the battle between Vel and Lux reached its stunning climax.\nThe elven king, pushed to his limits by the human prodigy’s seemingly absolute defense, had unleashed a power born of the void itself.\nVel pressed his advantage. Another void-laced spell shot forth, invisible, undetectable.\nIt appeared directly inside Lux’s body. Lux screamed as the chaotic energy exploded within him. His world went black.\nHis lower body disintegrated in a shower of gore. He was teleported back to the stands of Asura’s world, a mangled, unconscious wreck.\n\"Good fight!\" Sunny declared from his high throne, his voice booming across the arena.\nHe manifested an S-Grade Pill of Life, a miniature sun of pure healing energy, and sent it flying towards Lux’s broken form.\nThe pill melted upon contact, and in a matter of seconds, Lux’s body reformed, perfectly whole... but completely naked, his assets now on glorious display for the entire universe.\nA wave of shocked gasps, followed by muffled laughter, rippled through the audience.\nBefore Lux could even regain consciousness to register his cosmic embarrassment, Thea discreetly teleported him back to his private chambers on Kshara. \"Good luck living with your assets exposed,\" Sunny chuckled to himself.\nThe tournament raged on. The battles grew fiercer as the numbers dwindled. Twenty-five million champions became twelve point five million. Then six million. Then three.\nThe arenas echoed with the clash of steel, the roar of magic, and the desperate cries of the fallen.\nSunny’s champions continued their dominant run, but even they were not invincible. Atlas, the Titan leader, found himself matched against another Titan from Veridia.\nRecognizing his leader, the second Titan immediately bowed and surrendered, a display of loyalty that drew respectful applause.\nSuch internal matches became more common, resulting in strategic forfeit that preserved the strength of Veridia’s core champions, but also eliminated some promising contenders.\nFinally, after weeks of brutal combat in the arena’s accelerated time, only five hundred champions remained. The best of the best. The survivors.\nAnd the next matchup displayed on the cosmic screen sent a shockwave through the entire arena, silencing all of the spectators. It was a battle whispered about since the parade, a clash of lineage, power, and pride.\nThalorax versus Volthrax.\nIn Sunny’s stand, Nova let out a low sigh, a sound like shifting mountains. Her heart of a dragon, felt torn. \"Who should I support?\" she murmured, her gaze shifting between the two names. \"Both are my children.\"\nOne, the leader she had chosen for the Dragonborn, the race born from her very blood. The other, the first true dragon born on Veridia, Thalorax’s own son.\nThe two champions materialized in the arena. Recognizing the significance of this duel, Adam had dismissed the thousand smaller arenas.\nNow, only one grand stage remained, a vast, empty expanse under the watchful eyes of six billion Gods.\nOn one side stood Thalorax, the leader of the Dragonborn, his humanoid form radiating a quiet, unshakeable strength, his hand resting calmly on the hilt of his greatsword.\nOn the other, Volthrax hovered in the air, a magnificent dragon whose scales shimmered with the contained fury of a thunderstorm, lightning crackling around his horns, fire smoldering in his eyes.\n\"Father,\" Volthrax’s voice rumbled, a sound like distant thunder. \"Are you not going to transform?\" It was not just a question; it was a challenge, a plea, and a statement of fact.\n\"No,\" Thalorax replied, his voice firm, unwavering. \"I stand here today representing the Dragonborn. To transform into a dragon would be to admit my race is weaker. I will not do that.\" His pride, the pride of a king, would not allow it.\n\"Father, you have never won a single sparring match against me without transforming,\" Volthrax pleaded, a genuine concern in his voice warring with the competitive fire in his eyes. \"Please, reconsider. This is not a game.\"\n\"Enough talk,\" Thalorax said, drawing the massive greatsword Sunny had gifted him centuries ago, its surface gleaming under the arena’s light. \"Let us fight.\"\nHe took a defensive stance, his S-Grade Absolute Defense shimmering around him like invisible armor.\nHe knew his son. He knew Volthrax was arguably the most powerful mortal champion in Veridia, a creature born with an innate mastery over fire and lightning, blessed with talents that made him a walking natural disaster.\nWinning this fight as a Dragonborn would be the greatest challenge of his life. But he would not yield. He would prove the strength of his people.\nVolthrax roared, a sound that shook the arena, a blast of pure, draconic fury and frustration. He attacked.\nHe descended like a meteor, his massive claws aimed at tearing through Thalorax’s defense.\nThalorax didn’t meet the charge head-on. Instead, he moved. His Space Affinity, a gift inherited from Nova, flared to life.\nHe simply ceased to be in the path of the attack, reappearing instantly a hundred meters away. Volthrax crashed into the ground where his father had stood, sending shockwaves and debris flying.\nBefore Volthrax could reorient himself, Thalorax counter-attacked. He warped. Space bent around him, and he appeared directly above his son, his greatsword descending in a blinding arc, infused with his Absolute Strength.\nVolthrax reacted instantly, his own innate draconic senses screaming danger. He twisted, narrowly avoiding a fatal blow, but the sword still grazed his side, tearing through his thick scales and drawing first blood.\nVolthrax roared again, this time in pain and fury. He unleashed his Dragon Breath, not a simple gout of flame, but a concentrated beam of pure lightning plasma, hotter than the surface of a star.\nThalorax met it with his own breath weapon, a blast of raw, spatial energy that didn’t burn, but warped, distorting the lightning beam, sending it harmlessly careening off into the empty sky.\nThe battle became a breathtaking dance of power and strategy. Volthrax, the embodiment of elemental fury, unleashed storms of fire and lightning, his size manipulation allowing him to shift from a colossal behemoth to a lightning-fast wyvern in the blink of an eye.\nThalorax, the master of space and defense, moved like a phantom, appearing and disappearing, his sword strikes precise and deadly, his Absolute Defense absorbing or deflecting every blow that managed to get through his spatial distortions.\nIt was a clash between raw, overwhelming power and perfect, calculated control. Father versus son. Dragonborn versus Dragon. The fate of their pride, their lineage, hung in the balance, played out on a cosmic stage for the entire universe to witness.",

      "content": "Chapter 196: Ch 196 : Sovereign’s Domain\nThe Arena of Epiphany was silent, save for the crackle of residual lightning and the hiss of smoldering fire.\nThe very air was thick with tension, a palpable weight that pressed down on all of the souls watching across the multiverse.\nIn the center of the ruined, crater-filled battlefield, two figures stood, or rather, hovered, their bodies a testament to the brutal, drawn-out war they had just waged.\nLifeform5746: \"Volthrax is going to win, isn’t he? He’s a true dragon, the apex of evolution. This is just natural selection.\"\nLifeform15632: \"But you’re forgetting, that’s his father. Thalorax is the King of the Dragonborn, the first son of Lady Nova! This is a battle of legacy!\"\nLifeform16371: \"So what? I surpassed my father centuries ago. It’s all about talent and race, and Volthrax has the advantage in both.\"\nLifeform16378: \"Exactly! And Thalorax is just one of the first Dragonborn, born from the blood of a demigod. Volthrax is a true, natural-born dragon, a being of pure power.\"\nLifeform2673: \"Can you all just shut up?! I can’t concentrate on the fight! This is legendary!\"\nThe lifeforms finally stopped their frantic typing, their collective gaze locked on the two battered champions.\nThe arena was a ruin, a testament to their destructive power. The ground was a web of massive cracks, some so deep they seemed to plunge into the void itself.\nRivers of cooling lava, remnants of Volthrax’s earlier attacks, crisscrossed the landscape.\nThe very air was warped, shimmering with spatial distortions from Thalorax’s constant space attacks and the lingering sparkle from divine lightning.\nBoth fighters were a wreck. Thalorax’s proud, obsidian-scaled body was bruised and bleeding, his left arm completely gone, torn from his socket in a brutal exchange.\nVolthrax, his massive draconic form, was in no better shape. His long, powerful tail had been severed at the base, his shimmering scales were cracked and scorched, and several of his teeth were missing, shattered by Thalorax’s unyielding fists.\n\"Haah... Haah...\" Both combatants gasped, their breaths heavy and ragged. Every movement was now an agony, a monumental effort of will.\n\"Why don’t you just surrender, father?\" Volthrax’s voice rumbled, a deep, exhausted growl that was half-taunt, half-genuine concern. \"You look... pitiful.\"\n\"Haha...\" A harsh laugh erupted from Thalorax. \"You sure talk big for someone who looks worse than me. Where is that magnificent tail you were so proud of, boy? And those teeth? Those beautiful scales?\" Thalorax laughed again, a raw, defiant sound that echoed in the broken arena.\nHe felt the intense, throbbing pain from his missing arm, but it was nothing. He had felt worse in his long life. He would not surrender. His pride as a king, as a father, and as the first Dragonborn, would not allow it.\n\"What about your hand?!\" Volthrax retorted, his own pride stung. With a furious roar, he launched himself into the air, his massive, bat-like wings beating a thunderous rhythm.\nThalorax braced himself, his one remaining hand gripping the hilt of his greatsword.\nHis Absolute Defense was working tirelessly, weaving new flesh and bone where his arm had been, but the regeneration was agonizingly slow. The time was not enough. Volthrax was already upon him.\nThe great dragon opened his jaws, and a new, terrifying light began to build in the back of his throat.\nIt was a swirling, chaotic vortex of both fire and lightening, a churning ball of plasma and flame that contained every last drop of mana Volthrax could muster. This was his final, ultimate attack.\nThalorax knew, with absolute certainty, that he could not block it.\nHis Absolute Defense was already strained, his body battered. This blow would annihilate him.\nHe had to move, to warp, to escape. But he was exhausted, his mana nearly depleted. He was too slow.\nTime seemed to stop for him. His body was frozen, but his mind suddenly accelerated, a gift from his latent ’Quick Decision’ talent.\nHe saw the blast forming, saw the look of agonizing regret in his son’s eyes, and his mind raced, discarding and formulating a thousand different solutions in a single, desperate instant.\n’I can’t lose.’\nHis thoughts were no longer a plea, but a statement of fact.\n’I am the first son of demigod Nova. I am the guardian of Veridia. I am the King of the Dragonborn!’\nA new, profound understanding flooded his soul. He was not just a warrior. He was a king. And a king’s power was not just in his fists or his sword.\nIt was in his will. It was his right to rule, his right to declare what was real in his own domain.\nAs the chaotic blast of fire and lightning finally erupted from Volthrax’s jaws, a torrent of pure annihilation lancing towards him, Thalorax’s epiphany, born in the crucible of his own son’s fury, was complete.\nHe did not raise his sword. He did not try to teleport. He simply opened his eyes, which now glowed with a new, cold, and absolute authority.\n\"Stop.\"\nHis voice was a calm, simple command. The blast of chaotic energy, a force that could have glassed a continent, did not stop as Thalorax commanded. But its speed, its very progression through space, suddenly slowed to a crawl.\nThalorax looked at the churning, beautiful and deadly blast, now creeping towards him like a snail. And he spoke again.\n\"Fire cannot burn me. Lightning cannot strike me.\"\nThe slow-motion blast finally landed. A colossal, silent boom of pure white light enveloped Thalorax, blinding the entire arena.\nEveryone, from the lifeforms to the demigods, shielded their eyes, certain that the King of the Dragonborn had been utterly erased.\nEven Volthrax, panting and exhausted, looked on in horror, a scream of \"Father!\" trapped in his throat.\nBut as the dust and smoke settled, a figure remained. Thalorax stood in the center of a massive, blackened crater, his armor torn, his body bruised, but utterly, completely, and impossibly unharmed.\nThe blast had washed over him, splitting around his form like water around a stone, leaving him untouched in a bubble of his own, absolute reality.\n[Master, Thalorax has gained a new talent,]\n\"Yes, Thea,\" Sunny replied, his voice a low, triumphant whisper. \"I can see that. And it is... amazing.\"\n[Talent Name: Sovereign’s Domain]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: Creates a personal domain around the talent holder.\nYou have nearly infinite stamina and mana inside this domain\nWithin this domain, your will is law. You can slow or stop incoming attacks and conceptually alter the laws of reality as they apply to you.\nThis talent drains a large amount of soul essence to activate and maintain.]\n\"Another conceptual talent,\" Sunny breathed, his heart hammering in his chest.\nHis Divine Command was a permanent, costly change to reality. This... this was a temporary command that only worked in the domain.\nAnd then, his Divine Intuition, which had been a quiet, insistent whisper for months, screamed at him. This is it. This is the one you have been waiting for.\n\"So this was the talent you wanted me to find,\" Sunny asked his intuition, a wave of profound understanding washing over him.\n\"I don’t think it’s as overpowered as Divine Command,\" Sunny mused aloud, \"but... oh well.\" He smiled, his mind made up. \"I will listen to you this time.\"\nHe closed his eyes. He focused his will, his Skill-Resonance talent activate, and directly guided his will towards Thalorax.\n\"This one... is mine.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 197: Ch 197 : Tournament of demigods\nThe familiar, exhilarating rush of a new talent settling into his very being washed over Sunny. It was a sensation of pure bliss.\nHe felt his consciousness connect to a new, fundamental law. It was a cold, profound, and absolute authority.\nHe wanted to dive into the description of his new, evolved Sovereign’s Domain immediately, but the battle on the arena floor was not yet over.\nVolthrax hovered, his massive draconic form battered and bleeding, his breath coming in ragged, shallow gasps.\nHe stared at his father, who stood amidst the smoking rubble, his one remaining arm held loosely at his side, his entire being radiating an aura of calm, unshakeable invincibility.\n\"Was that... Dragon Words?\" Volthrax’s voice rumbled, his mind struggling to comprehend what he had just witnessed. \"Or... the Reality Talk of that human, Ragnok?\"\n\"It is neither of those,\" Thalorax replied, his voice serene. His Sovereign’s Domain, still active, flooded his body with a limitless, healing energy.\nThe mangled stump of his left shoulder was already reforming, new scales, flesh, and bone weaving themselves into existence at an alarming, visible pace. \"It is a kind of domain. I will explain it to you, my son, after the tournament ends.\"\n\"Ends...\" Volthrax repeated, the word heavy and final. \"I am lost, aren’t I?\" He had given everything.\nHe had unleashed a blast of chaotic, combined elemental power that should have annihilated any being. And it had done nothing.\nHis mana was spent. His body was broken. He, the first true dragon, the apex of evolution, had failed.\n\"Do not worry,\" Thalorax said, his voice softening, the king replaced by the father. His missing arm was now fully restored, his bruised body returning to its previous majesty as the domain’s power healed him.\n\"Everyone in the multiverse saw this battle. They know how powerful a true dragon is. You have brought honor to our lineage.\"\nVolthrax was manaless, injured, and defeated. The victor was clear. Adam, watching from above, knew the young dragon’s immense pride would never allow him to surrender.\nWith a subtle, invisible gesture of his own divine power, he pushed a gentle wave of exhaustion onto Volthrax.\nThe dragon’s eyes fluttered, his massive form swayed, and he collapsed into a deep, unconscious slumber.\n\"That is why dragons are the most difficult to handle,\" Adam sighed to himself, a small smile on his ancient face. \"Far too much pride.\"\nHis voice then boomed across the cosmos. \"Thalorax has won this match!\"\nA thunderous, universe-spanning roar erupted from all of the lifeforms. The demigods in the stands, however, were silent, their gazes fixed on Thalorax with a new, profound respect that bordered on fear.\nThis was a true rival, a being who had just manifested a conceptual power in the middle of a fight.\nThalorax just smiled, gave a slight, respectful bow to the cheering crowd, and his form was teleported back to the stands.\nNova, in her humanoid form, rushed to him, her usual aloofness gone, replaced by a mother’s frantic worry, her hands scanning his newly healed body.\n\"I am fine, Mother,\" Thalorax reassured her.\nNova let out a shaky breath of relief.\nShe remembered, just moments ago, seeing that cataclysmic blast form in Volthrax’s jaws, an attack she knew Thalorax could not block.\nShe had been about to teleport into the arena herself, to violate the rules and save her son.\nBut Sunny’s voice had echoed in her mind, calm and absolute. \"I don’t sense any danger to his life, Nova. Let him be. He will come out of this stronger.\"\nHis statement, which had seemed like madness at the time, had been proven true. Her master’s foresight was as terrifying as his power.\nThe battles continued, but the energy in the arena had changed. After the sheer, reality-bending spectacle of the father-son duel, every other fight, no matter how skilled or powerful, felt... bland.\nThe crowd watched, they cheered, but it was unlike the battle between Thalorax and Volthrax. They had already seen the true climax of the tournament.\nIn the end, as predicted, the final battle came down to Thalorax, the indomitable king, and Kalzarin, the silent, terrifying ice dragon. It was a brutal, grueling war.\nThalorax’s new Sovereign’s Domain was on a lengthy cooldown, and he was still weary from his previous fights.\nBut Kalzarin’s absolute zero, a power that had annihilated a million champions in a breath, could not harm Thalorax’s Absolute Defense.\nIt became a tactical masterpiece: a battle of spatial-warping, feints, and combat skill.\nIn the end, Thalorax, the superior and more experienced warrior, found an opening, his faith-infused greatsword bypassing Kalzarin’s icy defenses and ending the match.\nThe final rankings were a testament to Veridia’s overwhelming power. Thalorax was champion. Kalzarin was second. Anaske, Atlas, Vel, and the other dragons and champions of Veridia filled out the top twenty. Of the 420 worlds on the line, Sunny had, won 210.\nAnd while the remaining 210 were the rewards of tournament of demigods.\nAdam announced the results, and a respectful silence fell over the six billion Gods.\nSunny stood, his cosmic robe swirling around him. \"It was a beautiful tournament,\" his voice echoed, carrying to every God. \"As for the 210 worlds that my champions have won... I will give them to you. I do not need them.\"\nA collective, psychic gasp erupted from all the gods.\n\"We will hold a poll,\" Sunny continued, his voice calm, as if he were discussing a minor trade. \"All lifeforms across the universe will vote for the champions who impressed them the most. The top twenty highest-voted champions will be gifted these worlds, distributed according to their ranking.\"\nThe Gods were stunned. They had been prepared to accept their loss, to watch the Emperor’s empire swell to even more unimaginable proportions.\nBut this... this was an act of generosity so profound it bordered on madness.\nHe had already gifted them more than millions of worlds, to those Gods that have developed good seedlings for the future of the empire. And now these 210 worlds, which are filled with lifeforms of the previous Gods.\nSunny, however, merely smiled behind his mask. ’Heh. Happy with a few million worlds?’ he thought, his mind already calculatinv the benefits. ’It wouldn’t even cost me a trillion faith to create that many from scratch.’\nHe had already earned over fifty trillion faith points from the sheer excitement and engagement his champions had generated during this tournament.\nHis total reserves now stood at over four hundred trillion. This wasn’t generosity; it was the single greatest business decision he had ever made. He had traded a handful of dirt for an ocean of loyalty.\n’It’s a win-win,’ he mused. ’And now, with their loyalty absolute, my faith generation will only increase.’\nHis gaze drifted into the void. His plan was working. He would fill Adam’s multiverse with his creations, his subordinate Gods, his loyal races.\nAnd then... then he would look beyond. He would invade other multiverses, copy new power systems, and grow his strength.\nThe journey was long, but the path was clear. The thousands of demon gods polluting his realm were the only problem in his way.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen!\" Adam’s voice boomed again, pulling Sunny from his strategic reverie. \"The Tournament of Lifeforms is finished! And now... the tournament which you have all truly been waiting for. The tournament of your role models! The tournament of your protectors! The Tournament of Demigods is about to begin!\"\nThe old god laughed, his own excitement palpable. \"It will be only one match at a time, so you can all enjoy every glorious fight!\"\nWith a wave of his hand, the arena transformed. The thousand biomes vanished, replaced by a single, colossal stage that seemed to shift and change before their very eyes.\nOne second it was a living hell of fire and lava; the next, a frozen, wind-scarred desert of black glass.\nAs the new, terrifying arena settled, two beams of pure light lanced down from the heavens, striking the demigod stands.\nThe audience watched as the beams fell on two DemiGods. The lifeforms and Gods alike gasped, their eyes darting from the arena to the high throne of their Emperor.",

Nova vs. Mammon.\nAdam looked at the pairing, then at Sunny, and smiled bitterly. \"Damn,\" he thought, \"I really shouldn’t have gone with a random selection.\"\nSunny himself chuckled, a dry, bitter sound. This was a terrible, wonderful, and utterly inconvenient stroke of luck.\nDown in the arena, the very fabric of reality was already beginning to tear apart simply from their presence.\nThe ground beneath Nova’s feet fractured, space itself warping and buckling around her, a visible distortion of power.\nOn the other side, the light and energy around Mammon seemed to dim, being pulled into the hungry, crackling void that was his very essence.\nThe newly created arena, a world designed to withstand the clash of demigods, was already collapsing under the passive, ambient pressure by the two of them.\n\"Sister,\" Mammon’s voice was a smooth, almost nervous purr, \"I wish to surrender.\" He shook his head, a gesture of profound respect.\nHe was the strongest demigod under Sunny’s command. But this was Nova. His elder sister. The first. And he would not, could not, raise a hand against her.\n\"Mammon, do not be a fool,\" Nova’s voice replied, her tone as cold and unyielding as the void between stars. \"We are the creations of Master, God Cosmos. The entire universe is watching. We will show them what that means.\"\n\"You are correct, of course, Sister,\" Mammon said, his sinister grin returning, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes. \"But how can I possibly fight you? This is a terrible matchup. Why don’t we just play a simple game? Stone, paper, scissors? The winner gets to progress ahead and losser returns back to Veridia.\"\n\"A good joke, little brother,\" Nova said. \"Now, let us begin.\"\nIn the next instant, she attacked.\n[Time Stop]\nAcross the arena, everything ceased. The crackling void around Mammon froze. The rupturing space around Nova went still.\nThe very concept of \"now\" became an eternal, suffocating prison. Nova, the only being in existence moving within her own bubble of frozen time, began to walk slowly toward her brother, her dragon form a picture of absolute, calm authority.\n\"If you will not fight,\" she whispered to his frozen form, \"then you will be a disgrace to the Master.\"\nHer words, spoken outside of time, were a poison dagger aimed at the very core of Mammon’s being.\nShe knew him. His greed, his mischief, his power; it all stemmed from a single, burning, all-consuming desire: to be useful to his creator. To be a disgrace was a fate worse than oblivion.\nThe frozen, silent world around Nova cracked. A single, hairline fracture appeared in the wall of time.\nMammon’s body, which should have been locked in a state of absolute stasis, began to tingle.\nHis will, his absolute, primal need to serve his Master, was fighting against a fundamental law of the universe.\nThe Time Stop spell, an SS-Grade power that could freeze a galaxy, shattered like glass.\nMammon was free, but he was not safe.\nBut Nova just raised her hand, and the very space around Mammon began to compress, to fold in on itself. It was her Space Prison, a cage forged from a million layers of warped reality.\nBut Mammon just smiled, his eyes gleaming with a cold, hungry light. He dissolved. His body, his aura, his very presence vanished, slipping between the layers of Nova’s prison and into the one place she could not immediately reach: the Void.\n\"An impressive trick, brother,\" Nova rumbled, her patience wearing thin. She held out her hand and poured a vast, seemingly endless river of spatial energy into the arena.\nThe void itself, usually a calm, separate dimension, began to churn and destabilize under the sheer, overwhelming pressure of her power. The \"safe\" realm he had fled to became a raging, chaotic ocean.\nA moment later, Mammon’s form was violently ejected from the void, tumbling through the air. \"Quickly, brother,\" Nova said, her voice a low, dangerous warning. \"Fight me. Or you will truly be a disgrace.\"\nMammon landed, his aristocratic suit unruffled, his expression no longer one of respect or fear. It was an expression of focus.\nHis bottom line had been crossed. He would not, could not, fail his Master.\nHe made his first true move. His figure began to grow, his size manipulation talent activated; a prize stolen from the demonic realm.\nHe grew, his form reaching Nova’s own impressive height, and then surpassing it, becoming a towering colossus of dark, malevolent grace. He raised a hand, and his new, ultimate talent ignited.\n[Talent Resonance]\nHe was a being of countless stolen and gifted affinities. He felt the fire of Ifrit, the ice of a long-dead frost giant, the shadow of Humayu, the greed of his own core, the pride of a fallen king—all the elemental and conceptual talents he had collected.\nHe wove them together as a perfect, terrible symphony of power.\nA gigantic hand began to form in the sky above him. It was a swirling, cosmic hand made not of flesh, but of condensed energy, a galaxy of every power he possessed, a vortex of conflicting laws united by a single, greedy will.\nIt was an attack that, as it formed, caused the very Gods in the high stands to shudder in fear.\nNova looked up at the descending cosmic hand, a force that could have crushed an entire galaxy.\nShe felt its immense, chaotic power, and for the first time, a genuine smile of approval touched her lips. \"Good, brother,\" she whispered.\nShe opened her mouth, and a new, different light began to form. It was not the swirling chaos of Mammon’s attack.\nIt was a single, infinitely small, infinitely dense point of pure, white-gold light.\nIt was the Charged Explosion talent, the cumulated power of every single advancement her draconic children had made for centuries, all stored, all compressed, all waiting.\nThe demigods in the stands, who had been watching in awe, now felt a new, primal terror. They could feel the power building in that tiny orb—a power that felt... final.\nNova, knowing this attack could annihilate the entire arena held it in check, unleashing only one percent of the stored power.\nThe small, pinprick of light left her mouth, a silent, beautiful star.\nThe Gods, the mortals, the entire universe held its breath. The two attacks, one a colossal hand of swirling, chaotic concepts, the other a tiny, perfect star of pure, ordered power, flew towards each other, a clash that have already surpassed the demigod realm.",

      "content": "Chapter 199: Ch 199 : Tricked\nThe multiverse held its breath. The clash between the two most powerful demigods in the new era was not a simple battle; it was a cataclysm.\nOn one side, Mammon, the Sin of Greed, his power a vortex of a thousand talents, had woven them all into a single, terrifying manifestation.\nThe Cosmic Hand was a masterpiece of conceptual chaos, a swirling, multi-colored palm the size of a continent, forged from the clashing energies of fire, ice, shadow, light, and the very essence of pride and gluttony itself.\nIt descended from the heavens, a tapestry of laws threatening to break reality.\nOn the other side stood Nova, the Firstborn, the Guardian. She met this display of chaotic, overwhelming scale with its perfect opposite: pure, focused, absolute order.\nFrom her open mouth, a single, impossibly dense point of white-gold light emerged. It was the Charged Explosion, the accumulated, stored potential of every single Dragonborn and dragon who had advanced, who had grown stronger, who had been born in the centuries since her creation.\nIt was the collective power of an entire race, compressed into a single, silent beam.\nThe multi-colored, galaxy-sized palm met the pinprick of pure, white light.\nFor a single, agonizing instant, there was no sound. The two ultimate attacks pushed against each other, a war between chaos and order.\nThen, the universe tore apart. An explosion, akin to the very Big Bang that had birthed their reality, erupted in the center of the arena.\nA wave of pure white annihilation vaporized the Cosmic Hand and continued outward, a silent, expanding sun of pure force.\nThe shockwave, a ripple in space-time itself, shot across the arena. Demigods in the stands, beings who could shatter mountains, were thrown back, their divine forms skidding across the floor.\nEven the Gods, seated on their high thrones, felt the impact. Many of the Gods were physically jolted, their thrones sliding back as they were struck by the wave of raw, unfiltered power.\nSunny, his expression unreadable behind his mask, simply raised a hand. A calm, shimmering barrier of pure mana rose around the arena, absorbing the apocalyptic shockwave before it could harm any of the spectators.\nThe live chat, which had been a frantic storm of speculation, went utterly, completely silent. The lifeforms watching from their home worlds had just witnessed a level of power that their minds could not process.\nLifeform73838: \"Did... did I just see a sun explode?\"\nLifeform63892: \"I knew this would be a match for the history books... I didn’t realize it would be the this grand...\"\nLifeform6383: \"I’ve read ’The Genesis’... It talks about the creation of the demigods. I always thought it was exaggerated. But that... that was godly. They aren’t just demigods. They are... Gods.\"\nIt took a full minute for the blinding white light to fade from the arena. When the view returned, the battlefield was a ruin. The shifting biomes were gone, scoured clean, leaving only a smooth, white-hot, glassy plain.\n\"Sister,\" Mammon’s voice echoed in the silence, his form panting but unharmed, \"that blast was... beautiful. But I must know, how many more of those can you create?\"\nHe did not wait for an answer. He raised his hand again, and a new Cosmic Hand began to form in the sky, this one even larger, darker, and more malevolent than the last.\nNova, floating in the center of the devastation, just smiled. She cracked her neck, her obsidian scales shimmering.\nThen, she began to grow. Her elegant, humanoid form dissolved as she embraced her true nature, expanding into a colossal black dragon, a being so vast she seemed to eclipse the new, artificial suns Adam had created.\nShe met his conceptual, multi-elemental attack with just her physical might.\nHer Absolute Defense and Absolute Strength talents flared to life. She met the descending, galaxy-sized palm head-on, her own claws, now the size of mountains, raised to meet it.\nThe impact was a sickening, grinding crunch. The sound of a world breaking. Nova’s claws tore through the chaotic energy, her Absolute Defense nullifying the elemental properties, while her Absolute Strength shattered its physical structure.\nThe cosmic hand dissipated into a harmless cloud of multi-colored mist.\nBut the victory was not without cost. A spray of black blood, shimmering like oil, erupted from Nova’s mouth.\nThe force of shredding a conceptual attack with a physical body had sent a devastating shockwave through her.\nHer inner organs were a mess, her bones rattling. Though she was already healing, the injury was severe.\nShe looked at Mammon, who was preparing a third, even more desperate attack. And she spoke, her voice calm and absolute, cutting through the silence of the arena.\n\"I surrender.\"\nMammon froze, his new hand half-formed in the sky. \"What?\" he stammered, his mind utterly dumbfounded.\nHe had been preparing to surrender himself, to admit that his chaotic power could not break her absolute defense. She had won. She had proven her superiority. And now... she was just giving up?\n\"I said, I surrender,\" Nova repeated. Her form shrank, returning to her humanoid shape, and she was instantly teleported back to the stands, leaving a confused and victorious Mammon alone in the ruined arena.\nHe, too, was teleported back.\nHe stormed over to her, his aristocratic features twisted in a mask of confusion and betrayal. \"Sister, why? Why did you trick me? I was going to surrender!\"\nNova, her form already healed and radiating a calm vitality, simply smiled. \"Trick you? I did no such thing. I was injured, and I could not continue the fight. So, I surrendered.\"\n\"But what about being a disgrace to the Master?!\" Mammon’s voice was a low growl, his core principle shaken.\nHe remembered her words from the start of the fight, the very words that had goaded him into this battle. \"Aren’t you doing exactly that right now?\"\n\"A disgrace?\" Nova chuckled, a soft, warm sound. She simply tilted her head towards the high throne, where their Emperor sat. \"Look at our Master, little brother. Does he look disgraced to you?\"\nMammon looked. Sunny was not frowning. He was not disappointed. He was smiling, his head nodding in quiet, profound approval.\nMammon felt his world tilt on its axis. He looked from Nova’s knowing smile to Sunny’s approving nod, his mind utterly puzzled.\nIn the end, Sunny’s voice echoed in the arena, a gentle, paternal thought. \"I have told you all previously that it is your life. You can do anything you want. I am just your creator. Your life, and your choices, are in your own hands.\"\nHe continued, his thought-voice washing over Mammon with a new understanding. \"I would have stopped you from befriending demons if I did not trust your judgment. But I did not. Because it was your choice. I will only stop you if you do something that brings true, irreversible harm to yourself or our family. You are all my children, and I do not wish for any of you to be harmed.\"\nThis statement, this philosophy, resonated through the entire arena. The 6 billion Gods, many of whom ruled their own lifeforms with an iron fist, looked at Sunny with a new, deeper reverence.\nHe was not a tyrant. He was not a master. He was... a father.\nMammon’s mind reeled. He looked at his sister, who was watching him with a fond, almost pitying expression. \"You... you knew?\"\n\"I am the firstborn for a reason, you know,\" Nova chuckled, her eyes sparkling.\nShe remembered her own moment of doubt, centuries ago in the Realm of Advancement, when she had hesitated to spare the Veilborn race, fearing her Master’s disapproval.\nBut Sunny’s reply then had been the same as it was now: \"Do as you see fit, Nova. It is up to you to spare or to kill.\"\nShe had understood his lesson then. Mammon was only just understanding it now. Her gaze, now filled with a new, restless fire, shifted from her brother to her Master. The game was over. The lesson was learned.\n\"Master,\" her voice echoed in Sunny’s mind, a new, sharp, and eager edge to it. \"Can I go to hunt now?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 200: Ch 200 : God’s Domain! Infinite Demigod Generator?\n\"Hunt?\" Sunny’s voice was a vibration that seemed to press down on the very air of the arena. He knew exactly what Nova meant by \"hunt,\" and the same cold, predatory itch was already spreading through his own consciousness.\nThe Realm of Advancement, the entire realm was bound to the will of his creation, Nexus. He would not suffer the lapdogs of the Demon Lords to roam freely in his new backyard.\n\"Wait for the tournament to end,\" Sunny commanded. His voice was calm again, but it was the stillness of a predator that has already marked its prey. \"When this is over, there will be a... fun activity... for all of our demigods.\"\nNova nodded and dissolved into a shimmer of spatial energy and was gone. Her body was already teleported to Veridia, waiting for her master’s call.\nThe tournament raged on, but for Sunny, it had lost its luster. The subsequent battles were a pale compared to clash between his two DemiGods.\nHe watched as his remaining demigods effortlessly dismantled their opponents. It was efficient, yes, but it was boring.\nFeeling the familiar weight of boredom, Sunny turned his attention inward.\nDuring Thalorax’s epiphany, he had used his [Skill-Resonance] talent, copying the essence of that breakthrough. It was time to inspect his new prize.\nHe used his God’s Eye on himself. His consciousness plunged deep into the swirling, cosmic sea of his own soul. It was a universe unto itself, a galaxy of power.\nThere, among the familiar, brilliant crystals representing his other talents [Skill-Resonance], [Divine Growth], [Cloning], and the others, floated a new, unfamiliar orb.\nIt was a crystal of authority. It pulsed with a slow, powerful beat, a rhythm that Sunny instinctively recognized as the very heartbeat of his entire territory.\nHolding his focus on it gave him the feeling that he could, with a mere thought, rewrite the fundamental laws of his multiverse... if only he were willing to pay the price.\nHe focused his God’s Eye, and the details of the new, evolved talent flooded his mind.\n[Talent Name: God’s Domain]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: Creates a personal, conceptual domain that encompasses your entire territory.\nWithin this domain, your will is law. You can alter reality, manipulate causality, and gain a form of localized omniscience, allowing you to focus on any point within your territory at will.\nBy drawing upon a lifeform’s own potential and a specific Law, you can directly elevate them to the demigod realm. This new demigod will be born with an innate understanding of their chosen Law.]\n[Note 1: This talent drains a large amount of Faith to activate and maintain.]\n[Note 2: Demigods created, will have their potential permanently capped. They will not gain new talents through breakthroughs and can never ascend to true Godhood in their life.]\nSunny stared at the description, \"I can... create demigods on a whim?\" he whispered, the words lost in the vastness of his own soul-space.\nThe implications were staggering. He would need to check the exact \"price\" later, but the sheer, game-changing power of this ability was revolutionary.\nWithout hesitation, he activated the domain.\nThe cost was staggering: and from the disappearing faith, he knew the cost was around 1 trillion per day.\nIt was a sum that would have permanently bankrupted every other God in the Pantheon combined, an expenditure so vast it was comical.\nBut for Sunny, whose Cosmic Shop and system fees were now generating trillions every hour, it was... acceptable.\nThe moment the talent activated, his consciousness detonated.\nIt merged with the very fabric of his territory. He was Veridia. He was the small universe. He was the entire Realm of Advancement.\nIt was an omniscience so profound, so absolute, it was almost suffocating. He wasn’t just watching his territory; he was his territory.\nHe could feel a single leaf detaching from a branch in a forest on Veridia, spiraling lazily to the ground.\nHe could feel every grain of sand in the colossal arena, every whispered prayer, every spike of fear, every secret hope from trillions of beings at once.\nThe data was an avalanche that would have annihilated any mind.\nHe found, however, that his awareness could only focus on one place at a time, much like his God’s Eye.\nThe rest was like an alarm system, that only came into his view during an anomaly.\nHe felt the sudden urge to test its limits; to turn a mountain into vapor, to stop the rain in one hemisphere, just to see reality bend to his whim.\nBut he stopped himself. The tournament was still in progress. Such a display was unnecessary.\nHe brought his focus back, his new, domain-infused consciousness settling on the arena. As a new match had begun.\nHe saw Nexus, standing opposite an another demigod.\nThe opponent was a brute-force demigod, a monstrous orc that stood at least double the height of the general orcs, its skin a sickly green, its tusks the size of longswords. It was wreathed in an aura of primal rage.\n\"A demigod of rage or slaughter, likely from a God who cultivates orc-kind,\" Sunny mused. \"No sane person would choose such an demigod otherwise.\"\nThe orc demigod roared, a sound that shook the stands, and charged.\nThe battle ended as soon as it started.\nNexus didn’t move. He didn’t raise a hand(not that it have hands in the first place). He didn’t even look at the orc.\nThe charging orc, in mid-stride, simply... ceased to be. There was no explosion, no flash of light, no teleportation shimmer.\nOne frame, he was there, a mountain of charging fury. The next, he was gone. Kicked.\nThe entire arena, and all the watching lifeforms, fell into a stunned silence.\nThe live chat, moments ago scrolling with predictions, froze. Then, it exploded.\nLifeform2783: \"...he did it again. Just like in the crucible\"\nLifeform27838: \"What do you expect? If he can erase a million demigods at once, erasing one is just breathing for him\"\nLifeform9499: \"GUYS! HOLY-! The demigod that just lost is from our world! He was just teleported back to our world! He’s in shock! He said... he said he didn’t just lose. He said the arena rejected him. He said it felt like the entire world just kicked him out!\"\nThis statement stunned the other lifeforms. The smarter ones, the ones who had been paying attention, began to connect the dots.\nNexus wasn’t just in the arena. He was, in some fundamental way, connected to it. It was his arena.\nSunny smiled. They were close, but still wrong. Nexus’s territory wasn’t just the arena. Nexus was the Realm of Advancement.\nThe orc hadn’t been defeated by a combatant; he had been deleted by the administrator.\nAdam quickly arrived, announced the winner, and started the next match.\nThe battles continued, a blur of power. Some lasted mere minutes, a flurry of Laws and clashing energy. Others dragged on for hours, wars of attrition.\nThen came the turn of another of Sunny’s demigod: the Demigod of Peace.\nHis opponent was a magnificent, terrifying creature: a giant serpentine demigod, its scales the color of oxidized copper, its body so vast it could have coiled around an entire moon.\nEven so, in the truly limitless expanse of the arena, it looked almost small.\n\"Hssss~\" the serpent demigod hissed, its voice like grinding stones. It eyed the ’opponent’ before it. \"You don’t look that powerful. Why don’t you just surrender, little treasure?\"\nThe serpent’s confusion was understandable. All of Sunny’s \"utility\" demigods lacked a proper, fixed form. Their appearance was subjective, shifting to match the perception of the one watching.\nFor this serpentine demigod, a creature of instinct, \"peace\" was not an abstract concept. Peace was hoarding.\nIt was the feeling of coiling atop a mountain of precious, stolen things, safe and secure in its lair.\nThus, to its eyes, the Demigod of Peace appeared as a swirling, ethereal mass of priceless gems and radiant gold. Not a threat, just a treasure.\nFor Sunny, \"peace\" was the memory of a clear night sky, filled with stars he had only seen as a child. It was the sight of gentle clouds and the sound of soft rain.\nAcross the multiverse, all of the beings all saw something different.\nA warrior saw a sheathed sword. A farmer saw a field of ripe grain. A mother saw her sleeping child. The Demigod of Peace was a billion different forms at once, all of them comforting.\n\"I represent peace,\" the demigod’s voice emerged, not as a sound, but as a universal thought, calm and serene. \"Why would I need to be powerful?\"\nThese words, spoken with absolute conviction, unraveled a string in the minds of the audience.\nThe collective tension, the bloodlust, the anticipation for a brutal fight that had gripped a trillion minds; it all just... dissolved. The very concept of conflict felt distant, absurd, and tiring.\nIn the arena, the great serpentine demigod, which had been tensed to strike, suddenly felt an overwhelming weariness.\nIts ferocious hiss softened into a rumbling, contented sigh. The desire to fight, to win, evaporated, replaced by a much more profound, instinctual need.\nIt curled its massive body into a cozy position, laid its great head down and in front of a universal audience, fell peacefully asleep.\nAdam, the host, shook his head, a complex look on his face.\n\"For... for sleeping in mid-fight and letting go of his guard, the serpentine demigod is eliminated.\"\nHis voice, sharp and clear, penetrated the minds of all the lifeforms, gently shaking them from their blissful daze.\nThe live chat slowly restarted, but the tone was completely different.\nLifeform26849: \"...what was that? What was that feeling? I... I want to go home. I haven’t seen my mother in ten years. I want to ask her to sing me that lullaby again.\"\nLifeform26738: \"I’m logging off. I want to go to the riverside and fish. I’ll watch the rest of the tournament from there. It seems important, suddenly\"\nLifeform263890: \"I’m going to go ride my horse. Just... ride. No destination.\"\nOne by one, the lifeforms began to speak of their inner peace, of the simple, forgotten joys they suddenly wanted to reclaim.\nThe sleeping serpent was teleported back to its world, likely to awaken in its own lair, confused.\nThe Demigod of Peace was teleported back to Sunny’s stand.\nSunny looked at his creation; this swirling nebula of stars and clouds, and gave a slight, genuine smile.\nA demigod’s power normally couldn’t affect a true God. But Sunny hadn’t resisted. He had let the power wash over him.\nAnd through it, for a fleeting moment, the God of a billions of worlds, the master of a new universe, the man burdened by constant grinding and preparation of war... felt peace.\nHe saw the night sky of his childhood, a sky long since choked by the pollution in his previous world.\nHe saw the soft, gray clouds of a gentle rain, a moment of stillness he had forgotten he ever knew. It was a profound, aching relief.\nThe appreciation from its creator was felt. On the ethereal, ever-changing form of the Demigod of Peace, a smile manifested, a simple, shared understanding.\nIt awaited its next battle, and show the world what peace is.",

      "content": "Chapter 201: Ch 201 : New Insights on God’s Domain\nThe Tournament of Gods continued its relentless, glorious march. The battles among DemiGods was a spectacle of power that outshined everything that had come before it.\nA new match appeared on the grand, cosmic screens, and a murmur of confusion and excitement rippled through the stands.\nIt was an internal match, a duel between two of God Cosmos’s own creations.\nEmber vs. Ignis, the Demigod of Fire.\nIn the arena, which had transformed into a vast, grassy plain, the two beings materialized.\nEmber was a sight of pure, celestial beauty, a phoenix of medium size, her feathers a cascading waterfall of liquid fire, her every movement leaving a trail of warm, golden light.\nOpposite her, Ignis was a being of raw, chaotic power. He had no fixed form, appearing as a vaguely humanoid pillar of sentient, hot fire, his \"face\" a constantly shifting mask of fire, his \"eyes\" two burning, blue-hot stars.\nThe live chat immediately exploded with speculation.\nLifeform72839: \"Wait, two fire demigods from the same God? But Isn’t this match a clear disadvantage for demigod Ember?\"\nLifeform63849: \"How so? I think they are equal. Both are masters of fire. This will be a beautiful, evenly matched duel!\"\nLifeform73949: \"You don’t understand elemental law, you fool! Ignis is the Demigod of Fire. He is the concept, the master of all fire. Lady Ember is a phoenix; she is a master of her own phoenix fire. It’s like putting an ocean in a fight against a single, powerful river. The ocean will always win.\"\nLifeform6777: \"Even if that’s true, the demigod of fire can’t truly hurt Lady Ember either. We saw her in the last round; she’s an unkillable furnace! This will be a war of attrition!\"\nIn the arena, Ignis, the Demigod of Fire, did not wait. He raised his arms, and the very air around him superheated.\nHe unleashed his first attack. A dozen, colossal pillars of swirling, white-hot fire erupted from the ground, racing towards Ember, a cage of elemental fury designed to incinerate her where she hovered.\nBut Ember, who until now had fought with a lazy, almost playful grace, showed no signs of worry.\nShe had toyed with her previous opponents, wearing them down with her infinite mana reserves, a battle of attrition she could never lose.\nBut this was different. This was a true challenge. This was a sibling. She would show her respect.\nShe let out a piercing cry, a sound that was not just a shriek, but a focused, concussive blast of superheated wind.\nThe fire pillars, caught in this sudden, violent gale, were torn apart, their flames scattered harmlessly across the plains.\nThe wind itself, hotter than any forge, incinerated the ground it touched, leaving behind trails of blackened, glassy sand.\nIgnis, the formless demigod, recoiled, his own fiery form flickering in surprise. He, the master of heat, could not produce a wind of this caliber.\nEmber did not wait. She cried out again, but this time, the sound was different. It was the Phoenix Cry.\nIt was not a physical sound. It was a psychic assault, a wave of divine authority that bypassed all physical defenses and struck directly at the soul.\nIgnis, a being of energy, had no ears to cover. The cry slammed into his very essence, his consciousness and soul.\nHe felt his fiery form waver, a sensation of pain so profound he was almost extinguished. With his sheer will he held himself together, his body dimming to a dull, angry red.\nBefore he could counter, Ember’s eyes locked onto him. Emperor’s Gaze.\nA new, crushing weight of regal pressure descended. It was the innate authority of a divine beast, the gaze of a king demanding fealty from a lesser creature.\nIgnis, a proud, felt an instinct he had never known: the urge to kneel. His fiery knees, formless and shifting, buckled, and he was forced to the ground.\nBut Ignis was not just a beast; he was a law. He was the master of the very thing that stood before him.\nIn his kneeling state, he found his opening. ’You are made of fire,’ his thoughts hissed, ’and I. Am. Fire.’\nHe claimed the very fire that created Ember. He reached out with his will, his Fire Affinity talent locking onto Ember.\nHe tried to control her flames, to manipulate her very body, to extinguish her as one would snuff out a candle.\nEmber shrieked, this time in genuine pain. She felt a cold, alien will invading her form. Her brilliant, golden flames sputtered, turning a sickly, weak orange.\nHer very size began to diminish, her wings faltering as Ignis’s superior, conceptual control over the law of fire began to tear her apart from the inside out.\nBut Ignis had made a fatal miscalculation. He was fighting a demigod. Who was a furnace.\nShe felt his control, his attempt to siphon her power, and she responded. Her Heart of the Sun talent ignited.\nA boundless, infinite torrent of pure mana exploded from her core, fueling her flames.\nIgnis, who had been trying to drain a pond, suddenly found himself connected to an unstoppable, raging ocean.\nHis control was shattered as Ember’s fire, now burning with a white-hot intensity, flared back to life, larger and more powerful than before.\nHe could not control her; she had too much fuel, too much life.\n\"Tch,\" a sound like a thousand crackling embers escaped the fire demigod. He knew he was lost.\nHe could not outlast her, and her soul-based attacks were a perfect counter to his elemental form. But he would not go quietly. He would leave his mark.\nHe raised his arms one last time, to attack. He began to pour every last drop of his own mana, his very essence, into a single, final, magnificent act of defiance.\nHis body condensed, pulling in all the scattered fire from the arena, growing brighter and brighter. He was forging a masterpiece, a final, glorious performance.\nA colossal fire dragon, so large that the phoenix looked like a baby chick in its shadow, roared to life.\nIt was a beautiful, terrifying creature of pure, sentient fire. It roared, a sound of pure, unbridled fury, and lunged, its massive jaws opening wide and swallowing Ember whole.\nAnd then, Ignis, his power spent, his form exhausted, collapsed, his fiery light extinguishing, leaving behind only a small, cooling ember on the arena floor.\nThe fire dragon, its creator now dormant, continued its rampage, a final, mindless order. It soared through the air in its fiery majesty, a monument to its creator’s power.\nEmber, trapped within, let it have its fun for a moment. Then, she acted.\nThe dragon suddenly swelled. Cracks of pure, white-hot light, brighter than the dragon’s own, appeared along its scales.\nWith a final, triumphant cry, Ember burst forth, tearing the fire dragon apart from the inside, a blur of golden light in a rain of dying flames.\nAdam’s voice boomed across the cosmos. \"Ember has won this match!\"\nSunny watched from his high throne, a faint, calculating smile on his face. He watched Ember, the demigod of rebirth, soar victoriously.\nHe had been musing, his mind replaying the description of his new God’s Domain talent. ’Reviving from death... Creating demigods that cannot become Gods in their entire life...’\nThe two thoughts collided, and a new, brilliant, and utterly terrifying idea sparked in his mind. ’What if \"their entire life\" is a loophole?’\nHis mind raced. The note was specific. It didn’t say their potential was capped forever. It said they couldn’t become a God in their entire life.\nBut what if that life... ended? He had Divine Immortality. His lifeforms had Nine Lives.\nWhat if he used God’s Domain to instantly create a demigod whose potential is capped and then send it into a battle he knew it would lose, and then, after its inevitable death.\nIt will be reborn through his Divine Immortality? Would it be reborn as a demigod? Or as a mortal, its potential reset? Or... would it be reborn as a demigod, but with the potential cap removed, now free to ascend to true Godhood?\nThe other downside of the talent; that they didn’t gain new abilities on breakthrough; was already a moot point.\nHis Divine Growth talent, which blessed his entire universe, already solved that, allowing any being to learn new talents through hard work.\n\"Now this talent is looking very pleasing to the eye,\" Sunny whispered to the void. His intuition had not been entirety wrong.\nIt hadn’t led him to a simple talent of \"authority.\" It had led him to a divine, cosmic loophole. It had given him the key to a factory.\nA factory for mass-producing disposable and ultimately ascendable divine beings.\nHe could uplift the weakest, most talentless lifeforms, give them a purpose as demigods, let them fight and die for his cause, and then, in their second, third, or ninth life, they would be reborn as true, loyal Gods, forever bound to his empire.\nThe sheer, terrifying scale of the idea was intoxicating.",

      "content": "Chapter 202: Ch 202 : I don’t like your arrogant gaze\nThe tournament raged on. The colossal arena, a construct of Adam’s will and the thoughts of 6 billion gods, continued its relentless fights of the demigods.\nThe first few million matches had been a flurry of chaotic, desperate battles.\nSunny, observing from his high throne noted that even his own demigods were not immune to the brutal logic of the tournament.\nA demigod of agriculture, a gentle being whose talents were to nurture fertile soil and accelerate the growth of crops, found himself teleported into a volcanic hellscape.\nHis opponent, a hulking fire-elemental golem, hadn’t even registered him as a threat before its passive aura of incinerating heat caused the harvest god to shatter and eliminating him from the competition. He had lost before the battle ever truly began.\nAs the matches unfolded, a pattern emerged. The newer demigods of the races, those Sunny had created for the sole purpose of creating a demigod for each race, were struggling.\nThey had not had the centuries of accelerated Veridian time to copy or learn new talents.\nThey were powerful, yes, but due to less talents and experience, they were falling short in front of other DemiGods.\nBut the old, core demigods of Veridia, the pillars of Sunny’s empire was another story entirely.\nThey possessed dozens of talents, some copied, some learned, their power honed by challenges and blessed by their master. And now, it was time for one of his top champions to take the stage.\nThe arena screens focused, and a name flashed that sent a ripple of excitement through the trillions of watching souls. Loki.\nThe audience cheered, a thunderous roar of anticipation. They had all seen the highlights of his previous, mischievous exploits.\nHe was not just a warrior; he was a performer, a jester whose cruelty was as entertaining as it was terrifying.\nHe materialized on a tiny, lone island in the center of an arena that was ninety percent an open ocean. A grim, challenging biome for any land-based creature.\nHis opponent was a magnificent and terrifying sight: a colossal, serpentine Water Dragon, its azure scales shimmering with light, its horns like jagged coral, its eyes burning with an predatory arrogance. It was like a true master of the ocean.\nThe dragon, seeing its opponent, and the arena that was its personal kingdom, let out a triumphant roar.\nIt didn’t give Loki a single instant to think, to morph, or to steal. It attacked immediately.\nThe entire ocean rose to its command. A thousand razor-sharp blades of pressurized water, each one a liquid guillotine, sliced at Loki from every conceivable angle.\nBut Loki just smiled, a look of profound, almost insulting, boredom on his face.\nFor a being like him, who had stol... acquired hundreds of skills and talents, this was not a battle. This was a playground. He stood, arms crossed, and let the attack hit.\nClang! Clang! Clang!\nThe water blades, sharp enough to cleave a mountain, shattered harmlessly against his skin, which now shimmered with a faint, golden sheen; a defensive talent he had \"borrowed\" from a long-dead demon demigod he’d encountered in his travels.\n\"Are you trying to tickle me?\" Loki’s voice, laced with laughter, echoed across the water. He loved this.\nHe didn’t use transformation to win; he used it for fun. He lived for the moment his opponent’s confident, arrogant face crumpled into confusion, then into despair, as they realized the fundamental laws of their reality no longer applied.\nThe Water Dragon, a proud being, roared in fury. Its opponent was not just defending; he was mocking him. He decided to end this.\nHe reared back, his massive form coiling, and opened his jaws. A sphere of churning water, a miniature ocean compressed into a single, devastating orb, began to form.\nIt grew in size until it was larger than the island itself, the sheer gravitational pull of the mass of water causing the air to scream.\nThe sphere flew, a colossal, world-ending projectile, falling from the sky.\nLoki, still looking unimpressed, simply stood there, a smirk on his face. The dragon chuckled, a deep, arrogant rumble. It had won.\nAnd then, the island beneath Loki’s feet, unable to bear the weight of the water moon above it, exploded. It cracked and gave way, plunging Loki into the dark depth of the ocean.\nFor a moment, the only sound was the dragon’s triumphant laughter. And then, a new voice, a deep, amused chuckle, seemed to come from the water itself.\n\"Do you really think,\" the voice of the ocean whispered, \"that if I fall into your ocean, I will be at a disadvantage?\"\nThe dragon’s laughter died in its throat. A deep, primal frown appeared on its dragon face.\nIt looked down into the dark water, sensing a presence, something else, something impossibly large and ancient and... hungry.\nThe water, its own domain, suddenly felt alien, terrifying. The fear of the unknown, an emotion it had never once felt in its long life, gripped its heart.\n\"Wh-where are you?\" the dragon stammered, its arrogance gone.\n\"Don’t fear,\" a voice, as deep and cold as the abyssal trench, echoed from every direction. \"You thought you were the king of this ocean. The entity I have transformed into thought so, too. But he died in the end. And now, so will you.\"\nThe ocean erupted. A single, colossal, glistening black tentacle, thicker than a mountain range, shot from the depths and wrapped around the dragon’s serpentine body.\nThen another. And another. The Water Dragon, a being that had commanded this ocean, was now a mere fish, caught in a net the size of a continent.\nIt looked down and saw, in the abyss, a single malevolent eye, the size of a moon, staring back at it.\nLoki had become the King of the Deep Oceans. He had become the Kraken.\nThe dragon struggled, unleashing its magic, but it was useless. The tentacles, infused with Loki’s own magic-stealing properties, simply crushed its body, its bones snapping, its scales cracking.\nIt was being suffocated, not by the lack of air, but by the sheer force of a being that defied comprehension.\n\"I... surre...\" the dragon gurgled, its voice a desperate, choked plea. Before it could finish the word, another, smaller tentacle shot forward with terrifying speed, forcing its way into the dragon’s mouth, choking off its words and its breath, a final, brutal act of humiliation.\n\"Think of this as your punishment,\" Loki’s voice echoed in the dragon’s mind, \"for making me wet.... No, for making me get into the water.\" He then transformed back, his small, pristine humanoid form landing gracefully on the now-unconscious dragon’s head.\nThe dragon’s body, released, crashed into the water, he was unconscious from the the humiliation that Loki had given him.\n\"Loki has won this match,\" Adam announced, his voice holding a hint of weary amusement.\nThe live chat, after a long moment of stunned silence, finally exploded in a fiery debate.\nLifeform2783: \"Wasn’t that... too cruel? He had already won. The torture wasn’t necessary. This is just a tournament between allies, right?\"\nLifeform28939: \"What are you talking about, you fool?! That was a lesson! He showed us the tip of the iceberg! That’s the kind of power we need to fight the real enemies, the demons! He showed us what absolute dominance looks like!\"\nLifeform72839: \"I agree with both of you, but can you all just shut the fck up?! I’m trying to focus on the next match!\"*\nThe arena dissolved and reformed, and the next two contestants appeared. One was a massive, hulking figure, radiating a familiar, kingly aura. It was Ragnok, the King of Solara.\nHis opponent was a being of breathtaking, terrifying beauty. It was a giant, angelic figure, at least ten times Ragnok’s size, with six pristine white wings that seemed to radiate a gentle, holy light. Its face was a mask of flawless, handsome perfection.\nRagnok, a king himself, recognized a being of immense power. He willed a flight spell into existence and soared into the sky, rising until he was eye-level with the angelic demigod, a gesture of respect between equals.\nHis own king’s aura flared, a tangible pressure of leadership and unshakeable resolve.\n\"I do not like that arrogant gaze of yours,\" Ragnok said, his voice a low growl as he looked into the angel’s cold, dismissive eyes.\nThe angel looked at him, and its beautiful, melodious voice echoed in the arena, but its words were filled with holy poison.\n\"Oh, lucky me. I get a weak, half-breed lifeform who has just crawled into the demigod realm as my first opponent.\" For a second, the lifeforms in the audience, mesmerized by the angel’s voice, nodded in agreement.\nA malicious grin, a mismatch with its perfect, handsome face, spread across the angel’s lips.\n\"How should I kill you, I wonder? I am so tired of fighting with morals anyway. Amuse me for a moment, little demigod, and I shall grant you the honor of a swift death. It is the best thing that you can aquire using one of your nine lives\"\nRagnok stopped, his magic faltering. He looked at this beautiful, \"perfect\" being, this creature of \"light.\" And he remembered the words of his Emperor, God Cosmos, spoken to Medusa so long ago:\n’It is not the power or race that decides the nature of the lifeform, it’s their own consciousness.’\nHe looked at this angel, and he saw a monster, a being as dark and cruel as any demon he had ever faced.",

      "content": "Chapter 203: Ch 203 : The Emperor’s Order\nEven after being so profoundly provoked, Ragnok just smiled, a cold expression that held no humor. \"My life,\" he said, his voice a low, steady growl that cut through the angel’s melodic scorn, \"has only one purpose. And that is to give my entire life... all nine of them to be exact.. to my God.\"\nHe let his words sink in, a quiet declaration of faith that was also an unshakeable promise. \"And I would have killed you for that insult,\" Ragnok continued, his own power beginning to rise, \"if it weren’t for the rules of this tournament.\"\nThis final statement, this rejection of the angel’s perceived superiority, was more than Sparx’s arrogance could bear.\nSparx lunged, his hand outstretched, a spear of pure, blinding light forming in his grasp.\nBut as he moved, Ragnok unleashed his full, S-Grade King’s Aura. It was a blast of absolute authority.\nThe pressure, the sheer, crushing weight of a true king’s will, slammed into Sparx like a physical mountain.\nThe angelic demigod’s charge stopped dead. His six beautiful wings, which had been beating with effortless grace, now strained and faltered, as if trying to fly through a sea of invisible stone.\nThe very air around him seemed to thicken, to reject his divine presence. He was forced down, foot by foot, until his knees were a mere ten feet from the ground, his entire form trembling under the oppressive weight of Ragnok’s indomitable will.\nThe live chat, which had been admiring the angel’s beauty, exploded.\nLifeform729393 : \"woah... What magesty... My body wants to kneel\"\nLifeform628399 : \"Demigod Ragnok is quite famous as the first to reach DemiGod realm among the lifeforms, but who is this other DemiGod. Any information?\"\nLifeform26391: \"Is this chat anonymous?\"\nLifeform26939: \"We can’t see each other’s names or planets, so it should be. But don’t say anything to get banned. Demigod Thea is watching everything, after all.\"\nLifeform26391: \"I don’t care. I just need to ask... can the demigods see who types in this chat? I need to talk about that ’angelic’ demigod\"\nLifeform23 : \"only DemiGod Thea and God Cosmos can see who typed these messages, apart from them no one have such authority, I heard it from Demigod Cerberus\"\nLifeform26391 : \"let me tell you all one thing, This demigod is no angel. He is a monster. He is evil.\"\nA hush fell over the chat.\nLifeform28949: \"What? What do you mean?\"\nLifeform26391: \"Years ago, Sparx came to our world. He took my sister. She was only sixteen. He said it was her ’fortune’ that she was ’picked’ by a demigod. My parents wept, but what can we even do? He’s a demigod. We... we never saw her again. I wanted to kill this bastard, but I knew my strength was nothing\"\nLifeform49949 : \"is this for real? What did your God do?\"\nLifeform26391 : \"My God met me in a dream. He said Sparx was his only demigod, and he couldn’t avenge my sister, or our world would be defenseless against the demons. He ordered Sparx never to harm another lifeform, and bound by his creator, he obeyed. But he never stopped hating us for it. He shows his disdain, his displeasure, his contempt for us mortals every time he passes. He is evil.\"\nLifeform27839: \"Brother, that’s... that’s horrible. Why don’t you pray to God Cosmos? Maybe he will listen.\"\nLifeform26391: \"You are right. If my God’s hands are bound... I will ask the God above my God.\"\nThe live chat fell into a somber, angry silence. But the message had been sent. And it had been received.\nIn his high throne, Sunny’s gaze, which had been watching the match with a detached amusement, turned to ice.\n[Master, I have cross-referenced the testimony,]\nThea’s voice chimed in his mind, her tone cold and analytical.\n[The lifeform’s story is 100% accurate. I have also found 412 other similar reports from that God’s world. Sparx is a known predator. But after few years he suddenly stopped doing such things and only showed discontent with the lifeforms, i didn’t know about it because I was linked to God Venus later]\nSunny’s cosmic eyes lifted from the arena and settled on a single God among the six billion seated in the stands. A God named Venus.\nA wave of pure, suffocating pressure, an aura a infinite times heavier than Ragnok’s, descended upon this God.\nVenus, who had been watching the match with a nervous expression, suddenly choked. He felt an invisible, colossal hand wrap around his very soul and squeeze.\nThe other Gods near him recoiled, feeling the fringe of Sunny’s terrifying, focused wrath.\n\"Boss?\" Zir called out, his voice laced with concern as he saw Venus’s divine form begin to flicker, his face turning a pale, panicked blue. \"Boss, he’ll die at this rate!\"\nSunny let go of the pressure, but his voice, when it came, was a sound that chilled every God to their core. It was a whisper, a calm, quiet question that echoed in the silent arena.\n\"Venus. Is it? I heard your demigod did something... unspeakable... to the lifeforms on your planet. And you did nothing about it.\"\nVenus’s face, already pale, lost all color. He looked at the masked Emperor, and he felt as if he were staring into the cold, infinite void of space itself. His life, his very existence, was about to end. \"Emperor!\" he cried out, his voice a pathetic, trembling wail. \"I was wrong! Please, forgive me!\"\nBut before he could say another word, Sunny snapped his fingers.\nThe sound was not loud, but it was the only thing in the universe that moved. In that instant, his entire territory froze.\nThe quadrillions of cheering, gasping lifeforms in the stands became silent, unmoving statues.\nThe demigods, Ragnok and Sparx remained suspended in the air. Their gaze locked on each other.\nIt was time stop spell, the entire Territory of Sunny was stopped, entire realm of advancement and the entire universe.\n\"I do not want the demigods or the lifeforms to see the sorry state of their God,\" Sunny said, his voice the only sound in the dead silence. He looked at the frozen, arrogant form of Sparx in the arena. Then his gaze returned to the trembling, terrified Venus.\n\"Why should I forgive you?\" Sunny’s voice was deathly calm. \"What about the sister of that boy? What about the 412 others like her? Speak.\"\n\"Emperor... I...\" Venus stammered, his mind collapsing under the pressure. \"I could have killed him for what he did, I swear it! But he... he was my only demigod! Without him, my world would have been defenseless against the demon invasions! My people would have been slaughtered!\" He was sobbing now, his divine form a pathetic, weeping mess.\n\"I ordered him to stop! I bound him with my own will! And he hasn’t harmed another soul since that day, I swear it!\"\n\"I know,\" Sunny’s voice replied, and the coldness in it terrified Venus more than any rage. \"That is the only reason you are still alive.\"\nHe looked at the other Gods, at their expressions of pity and anger. They now understood what had happened.\nHe looked back at Venus.\n\"I want to know why your demigod turned out this way. I have seen arrogance and cruelty among the others. But this is something else.\"\n\"I... I don’t know, my Emperor,\" Venus wept. \"But... I can only think of one reason.\" He took a shaky breath.\n\"It was after the first great demon invasion. My world... it was burning. I had lost so much. I had one Divine Embryo. I was in a fit of rage and agonizing grief. I... I poured all of it into the embryo. My hate, my sorrow, my desire for a weapon...\"\nSunny’s mind flashed to his own demigod creations, to the personalities he had so carefully imbued in each of them: Nova’s pride and care, Loki’s mischief, Shenlong’s compassion and so on.\n\"Yes,\" Sunny said, his voice a low hum of understanding. \"That is the most accurate explanation. Our mentality when we create them... it shapes their very souls.\"\nHe looked at the assembly of 6 billion Gods and declared \"This will be the first voting of the Pantheon, You, the 5.5 billion Gods who have joined the pantheon, will vote on the punishment for this demigod and for God Venus.\"\nThis statement sent a ripple through the Gods. The Pantheon members felt a surge of inclusion, of purpose.\nBut the 500 million other Gods, the subordinates like Sheeren, felt a chilling, profound dread. They had not been included. They were not part of the Pantheon.\nThey were merely protected by it. They had no voice. They had no vote. They were, in this new world order, just like birds living in the protection of their cages, their fates entirely in the hands of the Emperor and his chosen.\n\"Just keep in mind,\" Sunny added, his gaze sweeping over the Gods, his eyes lingering on those whose auras pulsed with a hidden, vindictive hunger, \"that Venus will not be given a death sentence. Now... let the judgment begin.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 204: Ch 204 : Break him as much as you can!\nThe Arena of Epiphany, and the entire universe, was frozen in a perfect, silent moment.\nThe demigods in the stand, the lifeforms in the universe, everything stood still. There was no one breathing, no wind. Everything froze with Sunny’s grand spell.\nWhile the Gods discussed about the punishment of Sparx and Venus on their celestial thrones, the only beings still permitted the luxury of thoughts and movement in a cosmos brought to a sudden, screeching halt.\nInto this silence and the murmur of Gods, a single voice dared to speak.\n\"My Emperor, a death penalty is the only just outcome.\"\nThe other Gods, frozen in place, moved their eyes toward the speaker, their minds screaming in disbelief.\nThey looked at the God Draken as if he were a fool who had just spat in the face of a cosmic horror. To question the Emperor at all was brave. To question his mercy was suicidal.\n\"Draken?\" Sunny’s voice echoed in the stillness, he was not angry that someone questioned his decision, instead he became curious about this God.\nThea’s information on this God instantly flooded his mind: a protector, a being who cared for his lifeforms like a father, a God who would willingly spend his own faith to save them from a demonic invasion. A righteous soul.\n\"Yes, my Emperor,\" Draken said, his divine form, radiating a fiery aura of justice, did not waver even in front of Sunny, the strongest God.\nHe stood from his throne and bowed deeply, but his voice was firm. \"I cannot sit idly by. You said yourself that this demigod, Sparx, is responsible for over four hundred atrocities. As his God, Venus bears the full weight of that responsibility. He failed to punish his creation. He covered for it. Such a failure... it cannot be simply forgiven.\"\n\"You are right, Draken. I agree,\" Sunny said, his calm reply surprising everyone. \"But that is just your perception of the situation.\"\n\"My perception, Emperor?\" Draken’s righteous fire burned hotter.\n\"You see these Gods, who didn’t dare to voice this as spineless, inhumane Gods who value their own power over the lives of their creations,\" Sunny stated, his voice was analytical.\n\"You see one criminal and 6 billion silent accomplices. You are righteous, Draken, but you are wrong.\" Sunny said and then raised his hand and added, \"See this.\"\nIn an instant, billions of new system panels materialized in the air around Draken, a swirling galaxy of private moments visible only to him.\nThis was Sunny’s time magic when connected with god’s eyes, he could see the past of many beings at once. And currently these billions pannel showed the past of the Gods.\nHe saw a God, one he recognized from the chat, weeping in her God space as a plague, her world’s first misfortune, wiped out her fledgling race, her faith reserves too low to do anything but watch them die.\nHe saw another God, a hulking, brutish-looking deity, gently placing a flower over a tomb, a memorial for a champion who had fallen in the Realm of Advancement.\nHe saw their fear of the demons, their loneliness, their desperate, private struggles to survive.\nAnd then, he saw Venus. He saw him not as a cowering fool, but in a private memory from few Godly days ago, on his knees, his divine form wracked with sobs, agonizing over the very choice he had to make: let his only demigod, his only protector, be punished and doom his entire world to the demons, or silence the crime and save the millions who depended on him.\nDraken’s fiery aura wavered, the righteous fire dimming to a flicker of pained understanding. The panels vanished.\n\"They are not spineless, Draken,\" Sunny’s voice continued, softer now. \"They are just... afraid. They are trapped in a fight for survival, just like you.\"\n\"Venus made a choice. He chose to sacrifice the few to save the many. It was a monstrous, ugly, and necessary choice. And if I am to be honest with you, it is the same choice many of you would have made. It is the same choice I would have made. I will not be a hypocrite and strike down a God for a sin I would have committed myself.\"\nDraken stood in silence for a long moment, the weight of a billion hidden sorrows settling on his shoulders.\nHe finally bowed his head, his fiery passion replaced by a heavy, somber respect. \"I... I agree, my Emperor. But... a crime was still committed. Apart from a death penalty, what punishment could possibly suit God Venus?\"\nThe other Gods in the Pantheon let out a collective, silent sigh of relief. The tension had broken.\nThey looked at Draken with a new, profound respect. He had dared to question the Emperor on a matter of justice, and the Emperor had not criticized him, but taught him. This was a true ruler.\n\"I have a suggestion,\" a new voice cut through the silence. It was Strategist, his tone as cold and analytical.\nAll eyes turned to him.\n\"As you all know, Sparx is corrupted beyond redemption. His continued existence is a threat. Death is the only logical outcome,\" he stated. The Gods nodded.\n\"As for God Venus...\" Strategist paused, letting his next words land with their devastating weight. \"We have two options. One: We strip him of his godhood, erase his divinity, and leave him in his own world, where he would have to find his way to godhood again. Or...\"\nA chill went through the assembly. But it was Strategist’s second option that made their blood run cold.\nVenus, who had been listening in a state shivering terror, collapsed. He sighed at last and said, \"Please, Emperor, Take my godhood! I don’t deserve it! Let me be mortal!\"\n\"Let him complete his sentence first,\" Sunny’s voice commanded, silencing Venus’s sobs and guilt. He looked at Strategist.\nStrategist continued, \"Or.. he apologizes. Publicly. In a live, universe-wide broadcast, he will apologise to all the families and the lifeforms of his world for creating Sparx and covering for him. And then, with his own hands, he will be the one to extinguish the soul of Sparx, his only creation.\"\nThe Gods looked at each other, their minds reeling. Banishment from godhood was a terrible fate.\nBut to be forced to apologize, to admit his failure to the entire cosmos... and then to be forced to execute his own creation? That was a fate far, far worse than a simple death.\nAs even if Sparx was just his demigod, but so many years of time was enough to develop some good relations between them, so killing sparx by his own hands could be slightly difficult.\nSunny raised his hand to stop all the Gods from chattering, and the immediately a system panel appeared in front of 5.5 billion Gods of Pantheon.\nIt showed them two options, one or two. Which denoted the punishment for Venus.\n\"The vote is clear. The second option is fitting.\" Sunny said as he looked at the results of the vote.\nA wave of grim satisfaction washed over the Gods. Some, the more ruthless ones, were simply pleased to see a competitor so thoroughly humiliated. But most felt that this was true, proportional justice.\n\"So it is decided,\" Sunny declared, his voice a final verdict. \"But I will add a small modification.\"\nHe looked at the frozen form of Sparx in the arena, a cold, calculating glint in his cosmic eyes. \"Venus will extinguish Sparx’s soul in the public view. But before that, I will tear the its soul in two. One part will be destroyed, to satisfy the demands of public justice.\"\nHe paused, a cruel, cold smile playing on his lips, hidden by the mask. \"The other part... will be given to Cerberus. So that justice may be served, and punishment may be eternal.\"\nThe Gods shivered. This was an Emperor of terrifying, beautiful precision. Even Adam, watching silently, felt a flicker of both pride and pain, a reminder of his own lost, fragmented soul.\n\"As for Venus,\" Sunny continued, his gaze falling upon the weeping God. \"He will make his apology. And after, he will serve ten thousand years of reflection, in a private world I will create for this very purpose.\"\n\"Ten thousand years?!\" Zir whispered aloud, his mind reeling. A hundred million years in planetary time. It was a sentence of almost incomprehensible loneliness.\n\"Do not worry,\" Sunny said, as if reading their minds. \"My clones will handle the construction. Time dilation is a wonderful tool.\" He chuckled, as ten thousand years would pass in few hours if he wanted.\nHe looked out at the assembly. The Pantheon members, those who had been given a voice in this judgment, felt a surge of pride.\nThey were not just subjects; they were part of a government.\nThe non-Pantheon members, the five hundred million subordinates like Sheeren and Snatcher, felt a cold, hard truth settle in their hearts.\nThey were protected, yes. But they were not included. They had no vote.\nSunny snapped his fingers again.\nThe sound of the universe rushing back in was deafening.\nThe roar of the crowd, the crackle of Sparx’s light-spear, the pressure emitted by Ragnok; all of it returned in a single, chaotic instant, unaware that a single second had contained an eternity of judgment.\nSunny looked down at the Arena. Ragnok, his King’s Aura blazing. Sparx, his face a mask of arrogant scorn.\nHis voice, a simple, cold command, pierced through the chaos, speaking only to his champion.\n\"Ragnok. Kill him, but before that break him as much as you can\"",

      "content": "Chapter 205: Ch 205 : Lost Gods and Pale Demigod\nRagnok, his King’s Aura still pressing down on the struggling, terrified form of Sparx, looked up. His gaze pierced through the entire Arena, past the billions of watching Gods, and met the distant, high throne of God Cosmos.\nHe couldn’t see the Emperor’s face, hidden as it was behind the swirling void of the cosmic mask, but Ragnok could feel it.\nThe cold and utterly terrifying fury radiating from his creator. This was no longer a tournament match. This was an execution.\nA cold, hard smile, devoid of all humor, touched Ragnok’s lips. He looked down at the arrogant, beautiful angel, who was still fighting against his aura, his six magnificent wings beating furiously just to keep him from being crushed into the ground.\n\"You are so cooked,\" Ragnok thought, a cruel, almost pleasurable sense of contempt washing over him.\n\"How should I break him?\" Ragnok pondered, his mind shifting through the combat scenarios he had practiced in his entire life.\nA simple death was too quick. Too merciful. No. This creature, who believed himself a divine being above mortals, deserved a different kind of end.\nRagnok decided on something classy, a classic trope from the novels Thea had stocked in the system shops: the complete and utter psychological destruction of an opponent, forcing them to accept their own pathetic reality before their life is extinguished.\n\"But for that, you need to be able to move, at least,\" Ragnok mused, his voice a low, mocking rumble.\nHe let out a small, sharp laugh at the angel’s weakness. \"Hey, Sparx!\" he called out, his voice booming with confidence. \"I will give you a chance to fight me properly. I will show you what mortals can achieve. I will show you that we, too, are creations of the Gods, and we are not to be trifled with!\"\nWith a single, dramatic thought, Ragnok released his King’s Aura.\nThe crushing, mountain-like pressure vanished in an instant. Sparx, suddenly freed, shot into the sky like a champagne cork, his wings beating a frantic, triumphant rhythm.\nHe felt the air rush past him, the glorious sensation of freedom and his own innate superiority returning.\nHe looked down at the small, half-orc demigod, and his perfect, handsome face twisted into a mask of humiliated rage.\n\"That will be your biggest mistake, you filthy, foolish mortal!\" Sparx screamed.\nHe raised his hand, and a spear of pure, blinding lightning, crackling with the divine-tier power of his SS-Grade talent, materialized in his grasp.\nWith a roar of pure hatred, he hurled it, a javelin of celestial fury that should have been powerful enough to smite an entire continent.\nRagnok didn’t move. He didn’t raise a shield. He didn’t even flinch. He simply stood, his hand raised, palm open, and spoke his first command, his voice calm and absolute.\n\"In a one-hundred-meter radius around me, no lightning shall exist.\"\nThe words were not a spell; they were a law. A subtle, invisible ripple expanded from Ragnok, creating a perfect sphere of his own, absolute reality.\nThe lightning spear, a force that could have shattered a mountain, hit this barrier... and simply vanished. It didn’t explode. It didn’t deflect. It just ceased to be, its core concept erased from existence.\nSparx’s arrogant expression froze. \"W-what?\" he stammered, his mind unable to process what he had just seen.\nShaken but undeterred, his arrogance quickly overshadowed his disbelief.\nA fluke! A trick!\nHe poured more mana, his wings flaring as he channeled his full power. This time, he wove both of his core elements, creating a new spear of swirling light and lightning, a devastating, dual-law attack, his most powerful weapon.\n\"Oh? Light magic?\" Ragnok’s voice was laced with a cold, mocking amusement. \"Very well. Light magic is also forbidden in my space for the next half-hour.\"\nThe new law settled, reinforcing the invisible barrier. The swirling, dual-elemental spear, an attack Sparx believed to be his ultimate trump card, hit the shimmering, unseen wall... and was extinguished, snuffed out like a candle in a void.\n\"What... what kind of magic is this...?\" Sparx thought, his mind now completely blank. He was out of ideas.\nHis strongest, most definitive attacks were being deleted from reality by this... this mortal.\nThe live chat, watching this one-sided mockery, exploded.\nLifeform74939: \"I want that medicine!\"\nLifeform64828: \"Brother, you have finally gone mad from watching this tournament. You should rest a Little.\"\nLifeform74939: \"i mean the medicine God Cosmos had given him, how can he be this strong otherwise\"\nLifeform32 : \"You fools know nothing. You think talents are the only path to power? In Veridia, that is only the beginning. We are blessed by the demigods themselves. I am a simple elf, but I was personally blessed by Lady Nova. I have Super Strength and a A-Grade Space Affinity. What our champions can do is so far beyond your mortal comprehension, it’s laughable that you even try to compare.\"\nThe chat erupted again, a storm of envy, disbelief, and a dawning, terrible realization of the true, insurmountable benefits of being in the Veridia.\nBut even the proud Veridian elf was wrong.\nYes, Ragnok had been blessed. His Reality Talk was a gift from the Emperor himself. But that wasn’t the true source of his overwhelming, suffocating power.\nThe real reason for his dominance was an artifact he had won from a lottery spin decades ago, a prize forged by Sunny’s own hand, a secret he had shared with no one.\nIt was the Life Cube.\nAn SS-Grade artifact that was not a weapon or a shield, but a world. A personal subspace, a pocket planet with a radius of a million kilometers, containing a world where flora and fauna was flourishing everywhere.\nAnd most importantly, a time flow that was one thousand times faster than the outside world.\nWhile the lifeforms of Solara had experienced sixty years of rebuilding, Ragnok had spent sixty thousand years in his personal cube.\nHe had mastered every technique Thea had fed him, every scrap of knowledge from the Divine Library, and practiced them until they were a part of his very soul.\nHe had lived entire lifetimes as a warrior, as a king, as a philosopher, and as a mage, all within the silent, accelerated confines of his personal world.\nThis was Sunny’s hidden gift, a divine gift for the souls his God’s Eye had identified, scattered across the multiverse; these were the souls of the 4 billion Gods that had been erased by Adam or died by the hands of demon gods.\nThese Gods contained a small mark of divinity from their previous life. Which could only be sensed by Sunny through God’s eye.\nAnd he wanted to help these lost Gods to walk on the path of the Godhood again.\nWhile his clones, now empowered by the God’s Domain, were actively seeking out the other such souls, Ragnok had been the first to truly flourish.\nHe even thought of giving them their old memories back, but shook his head.\n’I need loyal Gods and demigods under me,’ Sunny thought, his gaze unblinking. ’Not backstabbers. This fight requires all of us to fight hand-in-hand. Their past lives are a risk I cannot take.’ His decision to keep their memories locked was cold yet calculative.\nBack in the arena, the \"fight\" had become a mockery. Sparx was now frantically hurling every spell he knew, his beautiful, angelic face contorted in a mask of desperate, sweaty panic.\nSpears of light, bolts of lightning, holy arrows; a storm of SS-tier magic flew from his hands, and every single attack simply vanished, dissolving harmlessly against Ragnok’s invisible barrier of Reality Talk.\nRagnok just stood there, his arms crossed, watching the angel’s slow, agonizing decline with a cold, merciless disdain.\nA grin was plastered on his face, a devilish expression that seemed to savor every moment of the angel’s humiliation.\nLifeform2628: \"This is just pure torture. He should just surrender.\"\nLifeform62839: \"Yeah, I think so too. His mana reserves are running thin. He can’t keep this up.\"\nLifeform74949: \"Maybe he’ll become unconscious from mana exhaustion. I don’t think his pride will let him surrender.\"\nRagnok, finally deciding the lesson was complete, opened his mouth. \"You know, Sparx,\" he said, his voice casual, as if discussing a mundane thing, \"you are about to die. The Gods are displeased with something you did. I don’t know what you did, nor do I care.\"\nHe pointed his sword, its tip gleaming. \"But I think I’ll come and poke you in the Netherworld when I eventually break through to the God realm myself.\"\nA soft, devastating grin played on Ragnok’s face. \"But for now... let me break you a little.\"\nSparx, his face a mask of horror, his mana reserves completely empty, his body trembling with exhaustion and a new, dawning terror, looked to the high stands.\nHe searched for his God, for his creator, for his master, Venus. His eyes, filled with a desperate, pleading light, finally found him.\nAnd God Venus, in a gesture of final abandonment and denial, looked away.\nThat was the final blow. Sparx knew, in that gut-wrenching, soul-shattering instant, that Ragnok’s words were true.\nHis God had forsaken him. His face lost all its color, leaving only the pale, sallow mask of the well and truly damned demigod.",

      "content": "Chapter 206: Ch 206 : Your Audience is Waiting\nThe Arena of Epiphany, a colossal stage that had witnessed the feats of impossible power, now focused its attention on a single, broken figure.\nSparx, the angelic demigod, was no longer a being of arrogant, celestial beauty. He was a defeated warrior, his divine light extinguished, his body trembling with a weakness that was more than just physical.\nHe was on his knees, his magnificent wings, now tattered and dull, spread uselessly on the dusty ground.\nHe had been mentally and physically exhausted, his mana reserves drained to nothing in a futile assault against an unbreachable wall.\nBut the true, killing blow had not come from Ragnok’s fist. It had come from a simple, silent gesture from the high stands of the Gods. He had watched his creator, his master, his God, Venus, look away.\nThat single, silent act of abandonment had shattered Sparx’s mind.\nHe looked up at Ragnok, who was now floating serenely before him, and the arrogance that had defined his entire existence was gone, replaced by a hollow, empty void.\n\"If even my God has abandoned me,\" Sparx whispered, his voice a dry, broken rasp, \"then I have no choice but to accept death.\"\nHis words, though quiet, were broadcast to the all the watching souls. It was a statement of profound, tragic finality.\nFor a demigod born of a Divine Embryo, the master’s will was the center of their universe. To be forsaken by that master was a fate worse than any physical torment.\nIn the high stands, God Venus, his form trembling, felt a searing, paternal agony. A single, tear, a tear of a God’s grief, escaped his eye and sizzled on the floor.\nHe wanted to scream, to stop this, to beg his Emperor for mercy. But he remained silent, his gaze fixed on the floor, his fate already sealed.\nSunny, observing from his high throne, noted the subtle, agonizing flicker of love in Venus’s aura. ’So, you do care for him,’ he thought, his own mind a cold, precise calculator. ’But you care for your own survival more. A predictable, but necessary, weakness.’\n\"Thea,\" he commanded mentally, his gaze never leaving the arena, \"keep Venus on a tight leash. I don’t care how small the anomaly is, if he even thinks about doing something foolish, notify me immediately.\"\n[Yes, Master.] Thea’s voice replied in his mind, her own particles already weaving a subtle, invisible net of observation around the grieving God.\nIn the arena, Ragnok looked down at the pitiful, kneeling angel. But his gaze did not soften. There was no mercy in his eyes, no warrior’s respect for a defeated foe. There was only a cold, hard, and utterly ruthless sense of justice.\n\"It is far too late to have a change of heart,\" Ragnok’s voice rumbled, echoing with the power of his King’s Aura.\nSparx looked up, and a spark of his old, defiant pride returned, a final, flickering ember in the ashes of his soul. \"Change of heart?\" he spat, a single drop of blood dripping from his perfect lips. \"Why would I have that?\"\nThis statement sent a ripple of confusion through the live chat, through the arena, and even through Ragnok himself.\nLifeform27849: \"What? He’s gone mad! He’s about to be executed, and he’s still arrogant! Just kill him already, King Ragnok!\"\nLifeform9949: \"I don’t know... I have to respect him for that. He’s not fearing the death that’s coming for him. He’s facing it with his head held high.\"\nLifeform94992: \"He’s just putting on a show! Who doesn’t fear death?!\"\nLifeform8494: \"I don’t! I have nine lives, haha! A gift from the Emperor!\"\nLifeform74949: \"We all have nine lives, you fool. But he doesn’t. You can bet the Emperor has already taken that privilege from a monster like him.\"\nLifeform44007: \"Or maybe he will die nine times! That would be a fun show to watch!\"\nAll of the lifeforms continued their casual, brutal speculation, their words were a chaotic pleasure from the execution that was about to unfold.\n\"So,\" Ragnok said, his voice a low growl, \"that means you will die as a villain. I was almost scared for a second that you had changed your ways.\"\n\"I don’t care if you, or any of you, see me as a villain or a hero,\" Sparx replied, his voice gaining a strange, final clarity. \"In the end, I am nothing but a creation of my God. I am what he made me. If I am arrogant, it is the arrogance he poured into my soul. If I am cruel, it is the cruelty he fostered with his own rage. I am his perfect, loyal mirror.\"\n\"A very nice speech before your death,\" Ragnok said, his patience finally at an end. He stepped forward and, with a speed that defied his size, drove his fist deep into the angel’s gut.\nThe sound was a sickening, wet thud. Sparx, already weakened, his body in a state of pure mana exhaustion, had no defense.\nThe punch sent him flying, a broken, six-winged comet, across half the arena. He crashed into a mountain, his body sliding down the rock face, leaving a sickening trail behind.\nHe spat a mouthful of golden blood, his vision blurring. He tried to look up, to find his opponent, but before he could even raise his head, Ragnok was already there, his shadow falling over him.\nRagnok grabbed Sparx by his long, beautiful hair, lifting his head with a brutal yank, forcing the broken angel to meet his cold, merciless gaze.\nHis other hand, crackling with his combined Orc’s Strength and Super Strength talents, reached back and seized the base of one of Sparx’s magnificent white wings.\nA cruel, terrifying grin, a grin that spoke of the primal orcish blood that flowed in his veins, spread across Ragnok’s face. \"You know, Sparx,\" he whispered, his voice a low, terrifying growl, \"do you know what I like the most when I hunt those giant, monstrous birds in the Realm of Advancement?\"\nHe didn’t wait for an answer.\n\"It’s plucking their feathers.\"\nAnd with a single, savage motion, he pulled.\nA sound, a wet, tearing, sickening rip, echoed in the silent arena. A fountain of golden, divine blood erupted from Sparx’s back.\nSparx’s body convulsed, and a scream so raw, so filled with a pain that was beyond mortal comprehension, tore from his throat.\n\"Aghhhhh—!\"\nHe was a demigod, a being of immense power. But this pain, this brutal, physical defilement, was an agony his arrogant, sheltered soul had never imagined.\nIn the stands, God Venus, his body trembling, clenched his fists so hard that his own blood began to drip from his palms, his nails cutting deep into his flesh.\nHe bit his lip until it, too, bled, a desperate, silent attempt to control himself, to stop himself from screaming, from intervening, from sealing his own doom.\nHe had made his choice, his pact with the Emperor, and this was the price. He had to watch.\nRagnok, his face a mask of cold, methodical fury, dropped the first wing and grabbed the second. \"One.\" Another pull. Another agonizing, tearing sound. Another scream. \"Two.\" He moved to the third. \"Three.\" The fourth. \"Four.\" The fifth. \"Five.\" And finally, the sixth.\nBy the end, Sparx was no longer screaming. He was a whimpering, convulsing wreck, his back a mangled, bloody ruin where his six beautiful wings had once been. He looked less than human, a pathetic, broken thing.\nRagnok, his breathing not even heavy, looked down at the fallen demigod. \"You don’t like mortals, do you?\" His voice then began to change, to deepen, to resonate with the terrifying, conceptual power of Reality Talk.\n\"From today on, you are not a demigod. You will become a mortal.\"\nAs the words left Ragnok’s mouth, an immense amount of his own mana vanished, a torrent of energy ripped from his reserves to fuel the law-bending command.\nBut the spell was successful.\nSparx felt it. The pain from his back, the agony of his broken bones, the humiliation of his defeat; all of it paled in comparison to the new, profound, and absolute horror that was now enveloping him.\nHe felt his divine power, the core of his being, the source of his strength, his arrogance, and his very identity, begin to unravel.\nIt was draining from him like water from a shattered glass, his infinite lifespan and divine potential vanishing into nothingness. He was becoming... weak. He was becoming mortal.\nA small smile appeared on Sunny’s face. \"You are one of my demigods after all, Ragnok. Your way of handling things is... similar.\" He glanced at the ashen-faced, bleeding God Venus.\n\"Your time to apologize is coming, Venus. Heal yourself. You will want to look presentable for the broadcast.\" Venus nodded numbly, his divine form shaking as he forced his self-inflicted wounds to close.\nIn the arena, Ragnok looked at the gasping, now-mortal Sparx. \"Hey, hey, Sparx... Look at you. You have become the very thing you despise the most.\"\n\"You... wouldn’t... understand...\" Sparx whispered, his voice now a weak, human rasp.\nFor a demigod born of an embryo, the master was the world. His hatred, his arrogance... it was all just a reflection of his creator, Venus.\nHis creator, who had hated the weakness in mortals because he could not bear to blame himself for their deaths.\nRagnok, his face a mask of cold, final judgment, looked at the weeping, broken man at his feet.\nHe placed one massive, gauntleted hand on the left side of Sparx’s head, and the other on the right. He didn’t press. He didn’t crush. He simply... pulled.\nThe sound of cracking bone and tearing flesh echoed in the silent arena. The lifeforms watching, who had been cheering for Ragnok’s dominance, now choked, a wave of nausea and horror washing over them.\nThe brutal, final, and stomach-churning act of tearing a being in two, from the skull down, was a sight they would never forget.\nAs the body fell, a small, shimmering, angelic soul, now stripped of its demigod power, tried to flee, to escape to the natural cycle of reincarnation.\nBut before it could move an inch, a massive, cosmic hand, a hand forged from starlight and darkness, descended from the heavens.\nIt caught the soul, its grip gentle but absolute. The laws of life and reincarnation, sensing a will greater than their own, retreated.\nThe hand, Sunny’s hand, squeezed. The soul of Sparx let out a silent, final scream as it was torn in two. The pain, a torment that transcended the physical, was absolute.\nSunny looked at the two halves of the soul. He sent one part to Cerberus. The other, he gave to Venus.\n\"Prepare yourself, Venus,\" Sunny’s voice echoed, cold and final. \"Your audience is waiting.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 207: Ch 207 : Apologising in The Live Broadcast\nThe joyful cheers from Ragnok’s victory died down, replaced by a cold, expectant silence.\nThea’s live broadcast, a network connecting billions of worlds, zoomed in, projecting the image of one God.\nGod Venus stood alone in the center of the arena, his divine form, once proud and radiant, now trembling. He could feel them. The eyes.\nSix billion Gods in the stands above, and quadrillions of mortals watching through their system panels.\nHe felt like a clown in the , the star of the execution of his own creation. He had never known such humiliation.\n’Why?’ he thought, his mind a whirlwind of terror and bitter regret. ’Why this? Becoming mortal would have been a much easier punishment’\nHe had seen Sunny’s power. He knew, with a sickening certainty, that the Emperor could have turned him mortal with a snap of his fingers, just as he had the 420 others.\nBut this... this public execution of his pride, this command to apologise before the mortals... this was a torment that would last an eternity, long after his ten-thousand-year sentence was served.\nHe had even believed he could have recovered from godlessness. As he had already bought SS-Grade Magic Affinity, he could have clawed his way back.\nHe could have become a demigod, perhaps even a God again, in a few millennia. But this... this left a permanent stain on his godhood.\nBut his life was on the line. He took a deep, shuddering breath, forcing his body to stop shaking. He had to perform.\n\"I... I am God Venus,\" he began, his voice, amplified by his faith, echoing across the silent universe. It trembled, but he pushed on, the words he had rehearsed in his mind since the judgment now spilling out.\n\"Today, I stand before you all to apologize. To correct my mistakes. To give justice to the more than five hundred families, on my own world, who were... who were hurt by the actions of my demigod, Sparx.\"\nHe focused his narrative, He would blame the creation, not the creator. \"Sparx was... corrupted. By his own power, his arrogance, his racism. I... I failed to see it. I failed to stop it.\"\nVenus bowed his head and said, \"Please... forgive me,\" his voice cracked, a masterful performance of a broken heart.\n\"Everything I did, every choice I made, I did for the sake of my world. I believed I needed Sparx, that he was the only thing standing between my people and the demonic hordes. But I was wrong. We are now under the protection of His Majesty, Emperor Cosmos. Your protection is absolute. My demigod... his terrible actions... are no longer necessary.\"\n’Yes, that’s it,’ he thought, ’blame the creation, praise the Emperor. A perfect, groveling speech.’\n\"Thus,\" he declared, his voice rising, \"I have decided today to end the life of Sparx once and for all!\"\nHe raised his hand, and a small, flickering, translucent wisp of light appeared above his palm.\nIt was the tattered, broken half of Sparx’s soul. It looked weary, almost transparent, as if it had been sucked dry of all its essence and vitality.\nIt let out a scream. Venus, his face a mask of tragic, righteous duty, created a ball of fire in his other hand. It was a brilliant, intense flame, a magic he had spent a long time perfecting.\nAs soon as the soul of Sparx touched the divine fire, it screamed. A high-pitched, soul-shattering wail that pierced the minds of every being in the arena. And then, in a flash of brilliant, final light, it was gone. Erased from existence.\nOr so the lifeforms thought. The Gods, however, knew the truth. They knew that was only half. They knew the other half was at that very moment being delivered to Cerberus, to the deepest part of the Netherworld.\nA wave of thunderous cheers erupted from the all of the mortals. Their prayers, their outrage, their single voice from the live chat had been heard. Their Emperor had listened. He had delivered justice.\nLifeform53637: \"A God is apologizing... to us! I never thought I would live to see this day.\"\nLifeform63839: \"It shows that the laws are equal in our Cosmic Empire! Even a God must answer for their crimes! All hail the Emperor!\"\nLifeform74848: \"I always thought the Gods were perfect, flawless beings who never made mistakes...\"\nLifeform849993: \"They are not. It is written in the tenth verse of the Holy Book, ’The Genesis’! It says, ’And know that power is a test, a law that can corrupt and drive the mighty to madness.’ It then tells the story of how the Emperor struck down the 421 corrupt Gods and cast them into the deepest pits of Hell! It gives me shivers just thinking about it!\"\nLifeform74949: \"You’re forgetting about the God of Ragnok’s world! It says the demigod Thea herself destroyed his entire planet, just to make sure he could never rise again! Imagine, a demigod destroying a God’s world under his nose! That is the power of our Emperor’s will!\"\nThe chat buzzed with this new, profound understanding of their universe. The Gods were not perfect and outside of the laws of justice. And their Emperor, God Cosmos, was the ultimate law.\nAs Venus was silently teleported away to begin his ten-thousand-year sentence of lonely reflection,\nAdam’s voice boomed once more, his tone light, eager to move on from the grim execution. \"Justice has been served! And now, let us resume the tournament!\"\nThe arena floor rippled, the stained ground of Ragnok’s battle dissolving, replaced by a crystalline plain, the new arena. Two beams of light lanced down, and the next two contestants appeared.\nThe crowd gasped as they had been waiting for this battle since the second round.\nOn one side stood Uranus, the demigod of life, his angelic white wings unfurled, his handsome face set in a look of pure, battle-ready focus.\nAt his side, his sister-half, Gaia, floated serenely, her presence a calming, healing aura.\nOn the other side stood the demigod Immuno, the unicorn-like being, his single, spiraling horn humming with a power that seemed to negate the very air around it.\nIt was the rematch the entire universe had been waiting for.\n\"Be careful, Uranus,\" Gaia whispered, her voice a soft melody as she flew to the far edge of the arena, her role one of support, not combat.\nUranus nodded, his gaze locked on his opponent.\n\"We meet again,\" he called out, his voice a clear challenge. \"I hope you are stronger than the last time we sparred.\"\nThe unicorn demigod just neighed, a sound like a crystal bells, its perfect, noble face twisted into what could only be described as a mocking grin. \"Neigh~ I will show you just how much stronger I have become.\"\nThe two demigods, both master of their own laws, prepared for battle. The live chat, which had been sobered by Venus’s execution, exploded back to life.\nLifeform53625: \"It’s him! It’s Immuno! This is going to be the most annoying fight in history! Get ready for a stalemate!\"\nLifeform1662: \"His talent is the worst! That stupid light beam makes all attacks useless! And the more you hit him, the stronger his counter-attack becomes! It’s a perfect, unbeatable combination! What can Lord Uranus even do?\"\nSunny, from his high throne, just smiled. He knew that during the month-long break, Uranus had spent his vast, accumulated merits on a single, custom-ordered talent from him, a talent specifically designed to counter Immuno’s seemingly perfect defense.\nHe activated his God’s Eye, a casual act, to scan Immuno for any new surprises.\nAnd then, Sunny’s calm, composure vanished. His smile froze. He leaned forward on his throne, his cosmic eyes widening in genuine, profound shock.\nHe saw Immuno’s original talents, the ones he knew. And then he saw a new one, an ability that God Alex must have purchased and bestowed upon his champion during the break.\n’Oh, my...’ Sunny thought, his mind racing. ’Uranus... I hope your new talent could overcome his. Because Alex has blessed him with another great talent again’",

      "content": "Chapter 208: Ch 208 : Prepared Demigods\n[Talent Name: Thorns]\n[Grade: SS]\n[Description: Any attack that lands on your body will be inflicted back upon the attacker with 50% of the original force, be it elemental or physical.]\nThe description was deceptively simple, but Sunny saw the full, horrifying picture.\nImmuno’s first talent, the light from his horn, made him immune to his opponent’s attacks.\nHis second talent, which the audience had yet to see, allowed him to store the energy of those nullified attacks and become stronger for a short time.\nAnd now this, a third talent, meant that the opponent would be punished for every blow they landed, on the immune body of Immuno.\nIt was a perfect, interlocking, three-part fortress of \"no.\" An opponent couldn’t hurt him, and if they hit him, they would only be hurting themselves. It was the ultimate \"punching bag,\" a being that won simply by existing and enduring.\nSunny, the Emperor of the Pantheon, threw back his head and laughed, a sound of delight that echoed in the silent stands. The other Gods, who had been watching the arena, turned to him in confusion.\n\"Alex!\" Sunny’s voice boomed, his laughter fading into a tone of approval. \"I believe ten worlds are not nearly enough to praise such magnificent, creative talent. I will add ten more to your reward.\" He raised a hand, a gesture of almost casual generosity.\n\"And if your demigod manages to win this match against my own, I will add another ten.\"\nA collective gasp erupted from the six billion Gods. Thirty worlds. An entire solar system gifted away in a single breath.\nThe Gods, who had been merely puzzled before, were now struck by a wave of envy and awe. What talent could possibly be worth such a price?\nSunny, sensing their burning curiosity, simply snapped his fingers. \"Thea,\" he commanded, \"show them.\"\nIn an instant, the system panel in front of every God lit up, displaying the full, terrifying description of Immuno’s abilities.\nA heavy silence fell over the assembly. They saw it. They saw the perfect synergy. They saw the unbreakable, unbeatable logic.\nAnd they looked at Alex, the once-unassuming subordinate God, with a newfound respect that bordered on fear. A new titan was rising in their midst.\nSunny just chuckled, listening to the frantic, envious whispers of the Gods. This was exactly what he wanted.\nHis generosity was a cold but calculated investment.\nThe first reason was simple: the 25% faith from every God. The more planets a God had, the larger their population, the more faith they generated.\nAnd the more faith they generated, the larger Sunny’s own cut. It was a self-perpetuating engine of profit.\nThe second reason was more ambitious. He was already planning his next grand business venture: selling entire, custom-made worlds.\nHe wouldn’t just sell barren rocks; he would sell bespoke planets, complete with manifested S-Grade mana veins, rich biodiversity, and pre-seeded mineral deposits.\nThe price would be from hundred thousand to a million, depending upon the resources and size of the planet, and this act of giving Alex twenty worlds was not just a gift; it was an advertisement.\nThe final reason was the most important. He needed to expand. He needed to fill this empty multiverse with his own creations, his own subjects, to build a power so vast and so absolute that when the Demon Lords finally turned their full attention upon him, they would find not a single, defiant God, but an unbreachable wall of lifeforms, that filled the entire multiverse.\nAs this was also one of the weakness of the demon lords, as they feared numbers.\n\"Your Majesty...\" Alex stammered from his throne, his mind completely short-circuiting, his thoughts regarding managing ten worlds shattering and reforming to accommodate twenty, possibly thirty. \"It... it was Immuno’s own idea. I just... I just bestowed the talent.\"\n\"And you were wise enough to create such a demigod, as I have said your creation will become what you desire while creating it\" Sunny replied, his voice a warm, encouraging rumble. \"That is a talent in itself. Do not worry, Alex. Your demigod will receive a personal reward from me as well.\"\nA seed of an idea was already forming in Sunny’s mind; a test. He wanted to see if the unbreakable loyalty of a Divine Embryo, like the one Venus had created, could be swayed.\nHe wanted to know if his Divine Blessing talent, which slowly turned the blessed person into his loyal follower, could override the core of another God’s creation.\nHe looked at the proud, triumphant Alex and the magnificent, unbeatable Immuno in the arena, and he smiled. ’What a perfect test subject.’\nDown in the arena, the atmosphere was complex. Immuno, radiating a newfound confidence, pawed the air, his spiraling horn gleaming.\nHe didn’t wait for Uranus to attack. He lunged. This was not the cautious, probing demigod from the previous round.\nThis was a champion who knew, with absolute certainty, that he could not be harmed. He engaged Uranus in a close-quarters, melee brawl.\nUranus, sensing something wrong, retreated slightly, his focus locked on the deadly, light-emitting horn. He parried a blow, sidestepped a charge, his movements fluid and precise, but he refused to counter-attack.\n\"You think I can’t hit you if you keep defending?\" Immuno’s voice echoed, a beautiful, mocking laugh. \"Neigh~\"\nBefore Uranus could react, Immuno’s horn flashed. It did not fire a beam. It became a sun.\nA wave of pure, white light washed over the entire arena, an omnidirectional blast that was impossible to dodge.\nUranus was caught in it, and he felt the familiar, chilling sensation of a foreign law enveloping his body, connecting him to Immuno, making him vulnerable to the demigod’s primary talent.\nUranus, his face now grim, knew he had no choice. He could no longer evade. He had to fight. He shot forward, his angelic wings flaring, and his fist, filled with super strength, slammed into Immuno’s stomach.\nThe lifeforms watching in the stands, who had been briefed on Immuno’s talents, gasped. They saw the punch land.\nAnd they saw, in the same instant, Uranus’s own arm recoil, a shimmering, dark energy washing back over him; the 50% reflected damage from the Thorns talent.\nThis was the terrifying reality of fighting Immuno. To attack him was to attack yourself.\nThe live chat, now with Thea’s helpful descriptions, was a storm of frantic, confused analysis.\nLifeform1662: \"Wait, so... how does he win? Every time Lord Uranus hits him, he gets hurt too? But Immuno doesn’t get hurt at all? This is impossible! He’s unbeatable!\"\nLifeform53625: \"This is it! This is the most broken talent in the universe! God Alex is a genius! It’s a perfect, unbreakable defense! Lord Uranus has already lost!\"\nUranus didn’t stop. He attacked again, and again, a flurry of punches and kicks, each one a masterclass in combat.\nAnd with every single blow that landed, a new, agonizing jolt of reflected pain shot through his own body.\nHe was bleeding, his divine form bruised and battered, while Immuno, the living punching bag, simply stood there, an arrogant, serene smile on his face, taking the beating without a single scratch.\nBut through the pain, through the agony of his own attacks being turned against him, a grin began to form on Uranus’s face. It was a wide, pained, and utterly terrifying smile.\n\"Do you really think,\" Uranus panted, his wings flaring, \"that only you came prepared?\"\nHe lunged forward one more time. But this punch was different. It felt like something that surpassed the demigod realm.\nA new, strange, and vicious power, a blessing he had purchased with his own hard-won merits, flared to life within him.\nAs his fist slammed into Immuno’s flank, the unicorn demigod’s confident, mocking smile instantly vanished, replaced by a mask of agony.\nA spray of blood erupted from Immuno’s mouth. His body, which had been an unbreakable fortress, was sent flying, tumbling in the arena, his perfect, pearlescent hide now scorched and bleeding.\nHigh on his throne, Sunny smiled. He looked at the talent Uranus had requested.\n[Talent Name: ...]",

This effect stacks infinitely.]\nThis was the talent that Uranus has bought using his hard earned merit, a talent he thought of after looking at the talent of Immuno.\nAs this was perfect counter to the Immuno’s immunity.\nAs the thousands upon thousands of \"weak\" attacks Uranus had delivered, each one harming himself, had been a calculated investment.\nHe had been powering up his engine. Immuno, immune to the damage, had been completely unaware that the force behind each punch had been stacking exponentially.\nThe first punch was a pebble. The ten-thousandth was a mountain. The final punch had surpassed the limits of his immunity, breaking his \"turtle shell\" in a single, catastrophic blow.\nNow, the real fight began. Immuno, no longer invincible, roared in a furious, pained cry.\nHis body also empowered by the stored energy from thousands upon thousands of attacks by Uranus, and his own counter-attack was now ready.\nThe battle descended into a brutal, primal brawl. For an entire day, the two demigods tore at each other, a clash of titans that shook the arena to its foundations.\nIn the end, they stood a few meters apart, heaving deep, ragged breaths. Their bodies were mangled, bruised, and bleeding, their divine energy utterly spent.\n\"Haah... haah... you truly are a best rival, it...\" Uranus panted, a bloody grin on his handsome face. \"It was... fun.\"\nImmuno just laughed weakly, a wheezing sound, and then, in their exhausted state, both demigods collapsed, their bodies hitting the ground at the exact same time.\nAdam looked at the two unconscious, battered demigods and sighed. \"What a bunch of magnificent brutes.\"\nHe was about to declare the match a draw, but his gaze shifted to the edge of the arena.\nA second, angelic figure, who had been watching the entire duel with a serene, worried expression, floated forward. It was Gaia.\nShe drifted over the two fallen warriors, and a gentle, warm light, the Aura of Life, poured from her hands. Their bruises faded, their bleeding stopped, and their broken bones began to knit back together.\nAdam smiled. \"Well,\" he announced to the universe, \"since Demigod Gaia is still conscious, the winners of this round are Uranus and Gaia!\"\nA wave of protests erupted from the live chat, the fans of Immuno crying foul.\nLifeform3672: \"NOOOO! It was a draw! A clear draw! Why is Uranus the winner?! This is rigged!\"\nLifeform8484: \"Technically, the team of ’Uranus and Gaia’ had one member still standing. It’s a valid win, just... an annoying one.\"\nLifeform8494: \"BOOOO! I support a draw! Rematch! Rematch!\"\nBut their protests slowly died down as the next match was announced. The battles continued, but none held the same earth-shattering drama as the clash between Nova and Mammon, or the brutal, tactical war between Uranus and Immuno.\nThe numbers dwindled, until finally, only two demigods remained.\nThe names flashed on the screen, and a hush of pure, confused anticipation fell over the multiverse.\nNexus vs. Mammon.\nLifeform2682: \"I guess this is the end of the tournament. Congratulations, God Emperor. Nexus is unbeatable. He’ll just kick Mammon out like he did the others.\"\nLifeform8383: \"You should wait a little. You might get a surprise. Mammon is not like the others.\"\nAnd then, a new, unexpected person joined the chat, a message from a being of authority and power.\nNova: \"It is going to be a legendary battle.\"\nThe chat exploded.\nLifeform84949: \"WHAT?! A DEMIGOD?! GREETINGS, LADY NOVA! I AM YOUR BIGGEST FAN!\"\nIn the arena, Nexus, the small black slime, quivered. \"Brother Mammon, don’t expect me to go easy on you,\" his voice echoed, polite but firm. He held respect for his elder brother, but he would not lose.\n\"Hehe, you don’t need to,\" Mammon replied, his sinister, aristocratic form materializing on the opposite side of the arena. He raised a hand. \"I just want to see... if I can overcome that little trick of yours.\"\nHe activated Talent Resonance. He wove all of his void and space-related talents together, creating a new, temporary power.\nWith a sharp gesture, he locked the space of the arena, superimposing his own will over Nexus’s.\nThen, he exuded a sphere of pure, devouring void energy around himself, a bubble of reality where nothing but his own law could exist.\nNexus could no longer expel him. The arena was no longer just his territory.\n’A clever trick,’ Sunny thought from his throne, a genuine, appreciative smile on his face.\nHe then shifted his gaze, looking through the perception of his God’s Domain, and saw a lifeform.\nThis lifeform with the aura of a demigod, was sitting by a quiet lakeside in Veridia, fishing. It was watching the match on a system panel. \"Maybe in the next tournament, I will be fighting like them too,\" the lifeforms mused, before shaking his head.\n\"Nah. Your fate is not to fight, fool.\" He said as he popped a peanut into his mouth.\nA shimmering, divine avatar of Sunny materialized next to this lifeform. The lifeform recognizing his God, immediately stood and knelt. \"Greetings, my God,\" he said.\nSunny’s avatar gestured for him to rise. \"I came this time to ask... what is your fate, Thorn?\"\nThorn, the first apostle, the Miracle’s Hand, looked at his God, his eyes burning with the pure, unwavering conviction of his epiphany.\n\"My fate?\" he said, his voice low, passionate and calm. \"My fate is to show all lifeforms the way to live. To show them that coming under your protection, my God, is the greatest blessing one could ever ask for.\"\n\"Good,\" Sunny’s avatar replied, his voice calm, like a father guiding his son. \"But where do you think these lost lifeforms are?\"\nThorn, in his simple, profound faith, pointed to the sky, to the unknown. \"In the Realm of Advancement, my God. Out there, in the chaos.\"\nSunny’s avatar simply shook his head, he said, \"No... The lifeforms that are suffering are not there. The whole realm of advancement is already under my control\"",

My life is yours to take,\" Thorn replied, his devotion towards Sunny was absolute.\nHe was the first chosen, one of the oldest living beings in Veridia.\nHe had seen his wives, his parents, and even his own sons, grow old and die. He had watched the empire he founded prosper.\nHe knew that their God was not a static, perfect entity, but a being who, like them, was constantly growing stronger, constantly evolving.\nHe knew his God was trying his best for all the lifeforms and demigods.\nThe creation of Heaven and Hell, giving the lifeforms buffs, giving 9 lives to each of them, taking billions of Gods under him; all of it was proof that his God was on a level beyond comprehension, and he would be more than happy to help him grow stronger still.\n\"I want you to wander into the true darkness, Thorn,\" Sunny said, his cosmic gaze turning towards the sky, towards the infinite, unknown expanse beyond his territory. \"I want you to find the Godless worlds, the world that have no Gods, no protection. Find the lifeforms who live in constant, genuine suffering. You will be my beacon in the void. You will show them the path to life.\"\n\"I accept, my God,\" Thorn replied instantly, without a flicker of hesitation.\nSunny smiled bitterly. \"Don’t say ’yes’ so readily. This is not a request to walk through a protected realm. The true multiverse is teeming with roaming demon gods. It will be exceptionally dangerous.\"\n\"I know you would not give me a suicide mission, my God,\" Thorn replied, his faith absolute. He stood, his form radiating a new purpose. \"And even if I am to die, I have died once already. I have nine lives left to spend in your service.\"\nSunny looked at his first champion, his heart swelling with a profound, paternal pride. \"Very well, Thron. I will give you the full details of your mission through Thea. Until then... enjoy the show.\"\nThorn nodded, and then asked, \"But my God, the tournament is about to end. What show are you talking about? Is there something... big... coming after?\"\n\"Nice guess,\" Sunny’s avatar said, a final, mysterious glint in his cosmic eyes. \"You will have to see.... or perform that show.\" With that, his projected figure dissolved into nothingness.\nThorn, puzzled yet expectant, turned his attention back to his system panel. He watched as Nexus, the small, unassuming black slime, faced his final opponent. Mammon.\nThe air in the arena was thick with a tension that was almost a physical force.\n\"Little brother,\" Mammon’s voice was a smooth, aristocratic purr, \"you have spammed that same move since the start of this tournament. Did you truly not expect me to devise a way to bypass it?\"\nNexus, quivering slightly in the center of the arena, replied with a voice that was both childlike and ancient. \"I do not need to expel you, Elder Brother. I can win, even without that move.\"\nAnd then, the world screamed. Nexus, who had until this point been a passive, finally attacked.\nThe entire arena, the very ground, the air, the laws of physics, turned hostile. Mammon felt a killing intent not from one being, but from an entire world.\nDark clouds, pregnant with a furious, divine-level energy, formed above him, thundering with colossal bolts of lightning that began to chip away at his defenses.\nThe rivers and lakes of the arena rose up, as towering, liquid mountains, watery fists the size of cities that crashed down upon him.\nFire, hotter and more malevolent than any natural flame, erupted from the very ground, while the roots of the jungle trees, now like living, sentient spears, lashed out, trying to ensnare him and suck his mana dry.\nThis was just the appetizer.\nAs Mammon deftly defended himself, Nexus himself, the true force of the realm, made his move.\nThe small slime expanded. It shot up, a tidal wave of living darkness, and formed a dome over Mammon, sealing him in an inescapable, suffocating sphere of darkness.\nInside the dome, there was no light, no sound, no air. Only Mammon, floating in an absolute, crushing blackness. But he was not scared. He was amused.\n\"Good, good,\" he whispered to the darkness. \"Now this is a fight.\"\nHe dissolved. His body, his aura, his very presence vanished, as he slipped from the physical world into the chaotic, untamable dimension that was his territory: the Void.\nHe focused his will, gathering his power, he used his talent resonance to combine all the physical as well as elemental talents into one.\nHe created a punch with hltbis new talent. He pulled back his arm in the void and, with a silent roar, punched reality itself.\n\"Bye, bye,\" he whispered.\nThe attack, traveling between realities, exited the void. It appeared inside Nexus’s slimy, black body, an energy designed to detonate and annihilate him from within, like what Vel did with Lux.\nBOOM!\nA crackling, muffled explosion, like thunder in a storm cloud, sounded from within Nexus’s massive, dome-like form.\nHis dark, slimy surface rippled violently, like a black ocean in a hurricane. But he did not burst. He did not dissolve. The ripples calmed. He had taken the full, internal, void-infused blast... and was completely unharmed.\n\"I was preparing for that, you know,\" Nexus’s voice echoed, his childish tone now holding a hint of smug, cold calculation. \"I know you are powerful, Elder Brother. I knew that just the ownership of this realm would not be enough to defeat you.\"\nMammon, his form still hidden in the void, was genuinely stunned. He had poured an immense amount of power into that single attack. How had he survived?\nThe answer was as brilliant as it was simple. The moment Mammon’s attack had materialized, Nexus had reconfigured his own body, shifting his vital core away and creating a hollow vacuum at the exact point of the attack.\nMammon’s void-punch hadn’t hit him at all; it had detonated in an empty, perfectly contained chamber, its power dissipating harmlessly against the regenerating walls of Nexus’s balloon-like form.\nA savage grin spread across Mammon’s face. He didn’t reply. He simply attacked again. And again. And again.\nA furious barrage of void-punches, dozens per second, rained down on Nexus’s internal structure from every conceivable angle.\nBut it was useless. Nexus was was a fluid, ever-shifting ocean. With his Controller talent, he could process Mammon’s attacks and reconfigure his defenses at the speed of thought. Mammon was trying to punch a tsunami.\nThis continued for a long, grueling while. Mammon, hidden in the void, relentlessly assaulted his brother. Nexus, a living fortress, effortlessly absorbed and digested every single blow.\nEventually, the attacks slowed, then stopped. Mammon understood. This was a perfect stalemate.\nHis unhittable offense was being perfectly countered by an unbeatable defense. He needed a new plan.\nAnd in the heart of the explosion, Nexus, too, began to think. His control of the realm was absolute, but his brother was not in the realm. He needed to find a new way to win.",

      "content": "Chapter 211: Ch 211 : An Uninvited Guest\nThe final match of the tournament had become a question: what happens when an unblockable, intangible offense meets an all-encompassing, formless defense?\nIt was the boring, and yet utterly terrifying deadlock.\nThe live chat, broadcast to all the lifeforms, was a storm of frantic speculation as the audience tried to comprehend what they were, or rather weren’t, seeing.\nLifeform73939: \"So... is anything happening? Demigod Mammon is a genius for figuring out how to survive Nexus’s ’kick’ ability, but now what? Are they just going to sit there forever?\"\nLifeform4737: \"I wanted Lady Nova or Lady Thea to win... but lady Nova chose to surrender and lady Thea was unfortunate to face Demigod Nexus \"\nLifeform3738: \"Who do you think will win? My faith is on Mammon. He’s an elder demigod. He must have another trick up his sleeve.\"\nThe Gods, however, were not watching the fight. They were, for the most part, checking their faith reserves.\nThe tournament had been the single greatest faith provider in the history of their existence.\nThe sheer excitement from their lifeforms; the cheers, the gasps, the desperate prayers for their champions; had generated a tidal wave of faith.\nMany Gods had earned more in the past few months than they had in their entire lives as a God.\nThey were already calculating how to petition their Emperor to host such a tournament every five hundred years.\nSunny, from his high throne, was also calculating. He looked at the 421 empty worlds of the fallen Gods, the prizes for this tournament.\nHe had initially seen them as a simple reward. But now, he saw the truth. They were not prizes; they were opportunities.\nHe could manifest a million new, empty worlds for a small amount of faith. But these 421 worlds... they were inhabited.\nThey were filled with billions of lifeforms who had witnessed the cruelty of their creator.\nThey were populations living in suffering, desperate for a savior. The faith of his own happy, sheltered lifeforms in Veridia was a gentle, steady stream.\nThe faith of these liberated, grateful, desperate souls? It would be a tsunami.\nIn the arena, Nexus came to a decision. This stalemate was inefficient. It was a waste of time. He would force a conclusion.\nHe did not possess the talent to enter the void himself, but he was the master of the realm connected to it.\nWith a surge of his will, a small, shimmering tear, a wound in the fabric of reality, opened in the center of the arena.\nHe had opened a door to Mammon’s hiding place.\nBut he didn’t stop there. He couldn’t attack Mammon through the void; the void itself would nullify his attacks.\nSo, he would do something else. He would make the void explode.\nNexus reached out with his consciousness, not just to the arena, but to the entire Realm of Advancement.\nHe became a siphon. He began to draw upon the ambient, colossal reserves of mana from the entire realm. The air in the arena grew thin. The magical glow of the distant biomes dimmed.\nA river of energy, a torrent of power so vast it defied comprehension, began to flow from Nexus and pour directly into the small, dark tear in space.\nHe was flooding the void with mana, a substance utterly alien to that dimension of nothingness. He would force him out with an explosion, or simply destabilize it to the point of collapse.\nIn his God space, Sunny was watching this display of reckless power, a proud smile on his face. ’Clever boy.’\nAnd then, his Divine Intuition screamed. It was a scream to warn him for the danger that was about to come.\n’Use your domain! Don’t let it invade!’ the talent shrieked in his mind.\n\"What?!\" Sunny didn’t know what it was, but he didn’t hesitate. He poured his will into his God’s Domain talent.\n\"My domain shall not let any uninvited guest invade\" Sunny commanded.\nA billion faith points vanished in an instant, a cheap price. A shimmering, invisible barrier of law slammed shut around his entire territory; Veridia, his subspace universe, and the entire Realm of Advancement.\nIn the void, Mammon felt it too. His own intuition, a sixth sense roared. A wave of terror, a feeling he hadn’t experienced since his birth, washed over him.\nHe didn’t question it. He tore his way out of the void, his aristocratic form bursting back into the arena, his face pale and shaken.\nNexus, seeing his brother suddenly reappear, chuckled. His plan had worked. And with a single, triumphant thought, he activated his Controller authority.\nThe realm rejected Mammon. The triumphant demigod was teleported out of the arena, his match lost.\nBut there were no congratulations. There was no announcement from Adam. The entire arena was silent, frozen in a new, more profound terror.\nAdam, the God of Growth, was staring at the tear Nexus had made, his face a mask of dread. \"You fool...\" he whispered, his voice trembling. \"You fool! You rang the dinner bell!\"\nHe flew from his high throne, his own divine energy flaring as he shot towards the rift, trying to seal the wound in reality.\n\"Nexus...\" Adam’s voice was a panicked roar, \"You have brought a calamity to our very doors!\"\nBut it was too late.\nAs Adam’s power struggled to close the tear, a gaze pierced through from the other side. It gave a feeling. A vast, cold, and ancient consciousness, a malice so profound and so indifferent it was a physical force.\nIt saw the arena. It saw the Gods. And it saw the small, black slime that had dared to pour a river of delicious mana into its dark home.\nNexus screamed. It was a soundless shriek of agony. His slimy, black body, a form that had been intangible and invulnerable, suddenly turned a pale, sickly gray.\nHe began to boil. He was disintegrating, his very essence unmade by the malice of that single, casual glance.\n\"NO!\" Sunny roared. He poured his own power into his demigod, a torrent of faith points. He tried to heal him. He tried to use Divine Command. \"LIVE!\" he bellowed, his voice shaking the arena.\nIt was useless. His faith, his commands, his very will... they were like throwing pebbles at a black hole.\nThe power of that gaze was on a level he could not comprehend. It was a judgment of eradication.\nBut as Sunny watched in horror, his demigod melting into a puddle of gray sludge, he felt a new, distant pulse.\nThe tiny, core spark of Nexus, protected by the Nine Lives blessing, had already reformed at the center of the Realm of Advancement. His demigod had just been reborn.\n\"Adam!\" Sunny’s voice was sharp, all traces of the calm Emperor gone. \"What is that thing?!\"\nAdam, his face pale as death, his hands still struggling to seal the tear, gave a one-word answer that landed with the weight of a dying star.\n\"...Void. Beast.\"\nHe grunted, \"This one is still young. Just a million years old.\"\nSunny used his God’s Eye, peering through the rapidly closing tear, spending another ten billion faith just to get a glimpse.\nHe saw it. In the absolute, crushing blackness of the true void, a shadow moved. It was a creature the size of a galaxy, a body like a colossal, dark whale, with tentacles of nothingness that seemed to stretch for an eternity.\nAnd it was eating. It was lazily, happily slurping up the river of pure, delicious mana that Nexus had provided.\nThe plan to flush out Mammon had successfully failed. And the void beast after completing his meal was now looking towards the world filled with such abundant mana....",

      "content": "Chapter 212: Ch 212 : The Hunger of the Void\nThe tear in reality, the wound that Nexus had ripped open, remained. And from the absolute blackness of the void, a being of impossible scale gazed back.\nThe Void Beast looked indifferently towards the two specks of light that had dared to fight back: Adam and Sunny.\nIt felt the pressure radiating from them. The aura of Adam, the First-Born, ancient and deep as the void itself.\nAnd the aura of Sunny, a new, searingly bright star, crackling with a dozen different conceptual laws.\nThe Void Beast, a creature of instinct, actually felt a flicker of something it had not experienced in millennia: fear.\nBut then, it felt something else. A sensation that was far stronger, far more demanding. The delicious, intoxicating scent of a million worlds, a billion souls, and the sweet, irresistible river of mana that Nexus had so foolishly poured into its dark home.\nIts hunger, an all-consuming force, instantly devoured its fear. This was a feast he couldn’t miss.\nIts tentacles, each one as vast as a solar system, lashed out, probing the barrier between worlds, striking the tear in the arena. The first tentacle hit the shimmering, invisible wall of Sunny’s God’s Domain.\nSunny felt it as a drain. A sharp, agonizing drain. His faith reserves, which had just crested above 500 trillion, plummeted.\nA single, casual, probing strike had just cost him one trillion faith points.\n\"Oh,\" Sunny whispered, his voice catching in his throat. \"So the barrier will only last until I have faith left.... That’s why it was cheap\"\nOne trillion per hit. He had 500 trillion faith. This beast had thousands of tentacles. He couldn’t even last ten minutes.\nHe wanted to curse Nexus, but he knew it wasn’t his creation’s fault. He wanted to curse Mammon for entertaining void, but he, too, was just acting in character.\nIn the end, the fault was his. This entire tournament was his idea, his grand display.\nHe had been so focused on his own game that he had forgotten he was just a player in a much larger, much more dangerous one.\n\"How much is that domain of yours consuming per strike?\" Adam’s voice was grim, his eyes fixed on the writhing mass of tentacles that were now lashing at the barrier with increasing fury.\nWhip. Whip. Whip. With every strike, Sunny winced, feeling another trillion vanish into nothingness.\n\"It can only take about 500 hits total!\" Sunny replied, the desperation clear in his voice. \"My reserves... they’re not enough!\"\nAdam nodded, his expression grim. \"Then we will make them enough.\" He stepped forward and placed a hand on Sunny’s shoulder.\nSunny felt a torrent of energy, a river of pure divine energy, pour into his very being. His own reserves, which had felt so immense, were a mere puddle compared to this.\nA trillion... a hundred trillion... a quadrillion... one hundred quadrillion. Adam, the fallen God, the dying soul, had just transferred 380 quadrillion faith points into him. It was a divine transfusion, a god-to-god transfer of faith.\nSunny stared at Adam, his mind reeling and confused, he didn’t know how did Adam saved so many faith even after letting them use the system features.\nAs a God he knew how much faith it will take to let 10 billion people use system without any fees.\nEven from the start Adam has been helping them a lot, only after doing something similar did Sunny understand how much Adam has done for them.\nHe knew that microbes, algae etc doesn’t give faith upon dying, but all the faith that the Gods earned from them were provided by Adam.\nEven the buffs from system shop, items and even the divine embryos, all of them were provided by the inventory of Adam.\n\"We can discuss my savings later,\" Adam said, his voice a low growl of command. \"Your domain is the only thing keeping that... thing... at bay. You are the shield. We will be the sword. Call your clones. Call your strongest Gods. We must make a show of force.\"\nSunny nodded, his mind clear once more. He was no longer a panicked God; he was the Emperor, and his territory was under attack.\nWith a single, thought, he summoned his elite.\nHis twelve clones, each a perfect copy of his, materialized around him, their cosmic robes swirling, their masked faces a silent, calculating chorus.\nJoker appeared, a crackle of pure, chaotic energy in his eyes, his aura a was sharp and witty, he was ready to mock the void beast for it’s ugliness.\nAsura appeared beside him, his presence burned with righteous fury, a volcano of controlled power.\nThe other Gods of the Pantheon, though weaker, gathered behind them.\nThe Void Beast, sensing the sudden spike in divine energy, only grew more furious. For him it was just a larger meal.\nIt stopped its probing, exploratory whipping and drew back. Then, with the force of a collapsing star, it rammed its colossal head against the barrier.\nA sound like the universe itself cracking in two echoed in Sunny’s mind. The barrier held, but at a cost that made him sick.\nOne hundred trillion faith points. Gone. In a single, devastating hit.\nThe beast reared back, preparing for another. It was going to brute-force its way in.\nIn that moment terror, Sunny finally understood. He thanked his own past self. He thanked Thalorax. He thanked his Divine Intuition.\nIf he had copied one of Adam’s other, \"better\" SSS-Grade talents, they would all be dead.\nDivine Command? To create a law like, \"You cannot enter this realm\" against a being of this magnitude would have costed something that even Sunny couldn’t think off.\nHis reserves would have been incinerated in a heartbeat. But God’s Domain was different. It was a shield. It was designed to endure. It was the only reason they were still alive.\nThe beast rammed the barrier again. Another hundred trillion vanished. And again. And again.\n\"Now!\" Adam roared. \"All of you! Fire everything you have!\"\nAdam himself, his divine form now blazing with a white-hot light, began weaving an ancient spell, a matrix of law so complex it made Sunny’s own magic look like a child’s scrawl.\nSunny and his clones mirrored the action, their combined knowledge from the past and present forming into spears of power.\nThe other Gods, their hands shaking, poured their own faith-infused magic into the volley.\nBillions of spells, a hailstorm of multicolored sparks, lanced out through the tear in reality.\nMost of them, the weaker attacks from the subordinate Gods, disintegrated in the chaotic energy of the void before they even got close.\nBut the strongest spells; from Adam, Sunny and the God with enough faith reached towards the void beast.\nThey struck the Void Beast’s dark, whale-like hide. They scorched. They burned away its hide, revealing a pale, sickly flesh underneath, but no blood came out.\nFor the first time in a million years, the Void Beast felt pain.\nIt shrieked.\nThe sound was not just a shriek from the pain. It was a weapon. Sunny felt his God’s Domain crack under the sonic, conceptual assault, the remaining quadrillions of Adam’s gift draining away like water from a broken dam.\nThe beast, in its agony, opened its vast, dark maw and fired a blast of its own; a sphere of void energy.\nThe sphere hit the now-faltering barrier. A silent, blinding explosion. The void itself trembled. The Realm of Advancement, protected by the domain, was safe, but the cost was absolute.\nSunny looked at his reserves. The 380 quadrillion from Adam was gone. Vaporized. All that was left was his own, 10 trillion. But the barrier remained the same, as their was still faith left in Sunny to maintain it.\n\"Another volley!\" Adam roared, his form blazing, ready to fight and die.\nBut the Void Beast, floating in the darkness, its hide scorched, its senses screaming from the unexpected pain, panicked.\nIt was a hunter, not a soldier. It had come for an easy, delicious meal. But this meal... this meal had teeth. This meal had cost it more pain than it had ever known.\nIt was not worth it.\nWith a final, killing glare, a look of hatred that promised a future reckoning, the Void Beast turned.\nIt vanished, disappearing back into the deeper, darker parts of the void, in search of easier prey.\n\"Haah... haah...\" A collective, ragged gasp of relief echoed from the Gods. They had survived.\nThey had stared into the true, hungry, terrifying face of the cosmos, and they had, by the thinnest of margins, held the line.\nSunny looked at his own hands, at the faint, residual power of the God’s Domain talent, and he made a silent, unbreakable vow.\nHe would never, ever think of going against his Divine Intuition again.",

      "content": "Chapter 213: Ch 213 : What is your Next Plan?\nAll the lifeforms across the multiverse, who had just been watching the final, universe-breaking battle, found their system panels go dark.\nThe live broadcast, which had become a central part of their lives, was cut, replaced by a simple message.\n[Due to the entry of an unexpected guest, the live broadcast has been concluded.]\n[The winner of the Demigod Tournament is: Demigod Nexus!]\n[We thank you for your participation. As a reward for your wonderful enthusiasm, the Gods have decided to host a new, celebratory event... a ’fun activity’ to be announced shortly.]\nAcross six billion worlds, a collective, frustrated groan went up. The live chat, their connection to the wider universe, was also severed.\nThey were left in a vacuum of information, their minds buzzing with questions.\nWhat guest? What had happened in those final, chaotic moments? And what was this new \"fun activity\"?\nThe mystery of it was almost more agonizing than the abrupt ending.\nIn the quiet corner of Veridia, by a serene, crystal-clear lake, Thorn sat. His new, demigod form, clad in simple robes, was indistinguishable from a mortal’s, save for the faint, jade-green scales that adorned his hands and neck.\nHe had watched the final match, felt the impossible power radiating from both Nexus and Mammon, and was now quietly contemplating about this fun activity Thea spoke of.\n\"Lady Thea, God has told me that I will be participating in this activity too. Can you tell me what it is?\" Thorn pleaded looking at the system panel.\n[You will know soon, Thorn.\nThea’s voice, a soft, melodic sound, chimed directly in his mind. She, as the system, was the only one who could still communicate with all of them.\n\"I am just curious, Lady Thea,\" Thorn said, his voice a low rumble.\nHe was one of the oldest living beings in this new world, a man who had been a king, a father, and a grandfather. He had seen his own son, Anaske, grow into an excellent leader.\nHe had seen his grandson, Light, grow into a demigod. He had seen the entire civilization he founded evolve from a few desperate survivors into a cosmic empire.\nHe had died, and been reborn. His perspective was long, tempered by loss and a profound, unshakeable loyalty.\n\"What about my future path, lady Thea. God said that you would be explaining me what my future holds\" Thorn said, stating his biggest worry and the thing he was most exciting about.\n[Don’t worry too much about it. My particles have already scanned more than half of this home multiverse. The remaining half will be complete in a few years]\nThorn felt a thrill, a resonance in his very soul. He knew if it was scanned by lady Thea then he doesn’t need to worry about anything.\n\"What of Master Shenlong?\" he asked, his loyalty to his master, the one who had granted him the power of Hope, just as strong.\n[Your master Shenlong’s path... will lead him to a much darker and more dangerous place, Thorn. You will be the Emperor’s beacon in the shallow void. He will be the sword in the deep.]\n\"He always was a wanderer,\" Thorn said with a small, sad smile, remembering the decades he had spent with the serene, enigmatic green dragon.\n\"He never took it as a big deal, just... his duty.\" He paused, a new, human anxiety creeping into his heart. \"This new mission... it means leaving Veridia. For how long? Decades? Centuries? I must... I must see my son before I go.\"\n[you really don’t need to worry so much, as I, your big sister, will be there with you.]\nThorn couldn’t help but let out a dry chuckle. \"Yeah, yeah... I’m older than you, though, haha.\" It was his one, simple flex. As one of the oldest living beings in Veridia, he was one of the few who could make that claim.\n[... Be ready, Big... Brother.] Thea’s voice replied, the pause filled with amusement.\n\"You are too polite lady Thea, i was just joking. I know my place, we are just result of evolution. While you are what the God truly wanted to create. A small mishap and i wouldn’t even exist\" Thorn said, he knew that the personal creation the God will always be above the lifeforms.\n[But that’s just your thinking. He spent more time *creating* you than he spent creating me. I was just built in a few minutes. You... you took years of evolution, of planning, of hope. You weren’t just made, Thorn. You were *forged*.]\n\"That’s one way to put it,\" Thorn smiled, the thought warming his heart. He stood, his mind made up. He would see Anaske, his son, the leader of the Cosmic Empire.\nHe didn’t know when he would be back. He took a deep breath of the Veridian air and launched himself into the sky, a green and golden comet streaking toward the Northern Continent.\n[You are stupid.]\nThorn faltered in mid-air, nearly stopping completely.\n[I said I will be *with you*. Don’t you know what that means?]\n\"What does that mean?\" Thorn asked, his mind, even with its SS-Grade comprehension and the buff from Sunny, completely baffled.\n[Portals... You foo... I mean, Big Brother,] Thea’s voice was laced with exasperated fondness.\n[I can create portals. You can come back *anytime you want*. You can spend a day on a mission in a Godless, war-torn world, and step back into your own house in Veridia in time for dinner]\nThorn stopped, hovering twenty thousand feet above the world he had just been preparing to leave forever.\nHe was... not being exiled. He was being made an envoy. It wasn’t a farewell journey, that he was thinking.\nHe nodded, a slow, profound understanding dawning on his face. He still flew towards his home, towards his family.\nEven if he could return in an instant, a father should still see his son.\nIn the quiet, cosmic expanse of Sunny’s God space, two figures sat at a simple, manifested table, the remnants of the Void Beast’s failed assault still a faint stain in the air.\nOne was Sunny, his cosmic robe swirling, his mask an unreadable void. The other was Adam, his newly restored divine form radiating an ancient power.\nHe held the green token in his hand, his thumb gently caressing the name ’Adam’ etched upon it, his thoughts with the sleeping soul within.\n\"That was dangerous,\" Sunny said finally, his voice flat. He was talking about the gaze, the single, malicious glance from the Void Beast that had killed Nexus and cost him quadrillions in faith to repel.\n\"Yes,\" Adam replied, his voice a low rumble. \"If not for that new God’s Domain talent of yours, we would all be dead. That beast would have devoured this entire realm. It was... hungry.\"\n\"Adam,\" Sunny leaned forward, his casual, lazy demeanor gone, replaced by the cold focus of an emperor. \"The universe i created isn’t truly safe, is it? It’s all just floating in the same, dark ocean as that... thing. That thing or something similar could attack Veridia or even the universe anytime\"\n\"The Void is everywhere, Cosmos,\" Adam consoled. \"It is the ocean we all float in. But they cannot tear their way in on their own. We were unlucky. Nexus, rang the dinner bell. And that beast was, unfortunately, close enough to hear it.\"\nThe words settled between them, a grim, new reality. They were safe... as long as they were quiet.\nAdam, sensing Sunny’s dark mood, decided to break the tension. He took a sip of his manifested drink, a swirling nebula in a glass.\n\"So,\" he said, a playful glint in his eyes, \"about that 380 quadrillion faith I lent you... when are you planning to repay me?\"\nSunny looked at Adam, his cosmic mask unreadable. \"Repay you?\" he said, his voice a perfect imitation of shock. \"I think I’ll call it my fee... for saving your life from Maledictus’s curse. A Pill of Life isn’t cheap, you know.\"\nFor the first time in a million years, Adam let out a genuine, hearty laugh, the sound a welcome relief in the heavy silence.\nThe camaraderie between them, forged in shared secrets and a near-death experience, was now real.\nAdam’s laughter subsided, his expression turning serious once more. \"So, Emperor of the Multiverse,\" he said, his voice respectful but sharp. \"What is your next plan of action?\"\nSunny just sipped his own drink, the galaxies in his mask swirling, his gaze distant.\n\"What plan?\"",

      "content": "Chapter 214: Ch 214 : Shameless than the God of Business and Wealth\n\"I know what kind of... God... you are, Cosmos,\" Adam said, dragging the word ’God’ out with a teasing, cynical emphasis.\nHe had spent the last few centuries in Sunny’s territory; first in Veridia, then the God space, then the Heaven realm; and he had been a active consumer of the services in Sunny’s system.\nHe had played the games, read the novels, and watched the endless, chaotic chatter of the God Chat.\nHe had seen the system, the microtransactions, the tiered privileges, the non-stop, perfectly engineered streams of income.\n\"In the old era,\" Adam continued, a reminiscent smile on his face, \"I had a friend. The God of Business and Wealth. A brilliant mind, truly. He forged empires on contracts and built palaces from the interest on his loans. He was, without a doubt, the most shamelessly opportunistic being in the multiverse.\" Adam leaned in, his smile widening. \"But you, my friend... you would have made him weep with envy.\"\nSunny, his posture the very picture of indifference, simply inclined his head. \"I have no idea what you are talking about.\"\n\"Of course you don’t,\" Adam chuckled. \"But your faith reserves just took a hit that would have killed a lesser god a thousand times over. Your wallet is empty. So, I must ask: what grand, fiendishly profitable plan are you concocting to resolve that? I know you are not the type to sit idly by.\"\nSunny’s cosmic mask turned, the swirling galaxies of his eyes seeming to focus on Adam. \"I haven’t thought too much about it,\" he said, his voice casual, \"I should have a few hundred trillion faith back in my reserves within the next half-hour or so.\"\nAdam, who had just been taking a sip of his drink, choked. He sputtered, a nebula of divine energy erupting from his mouth as he coughed.\n\"A few hundred trillion?\" he wheezed, his eyes wide. \"In half an hour? The tournament is over, Cosmos! What in the name of the Void are you planning to do, sell your other kidney?\"\nSunny’s only reply was a mysterious, silent tilt of his head. He looked out into the vastness of his subspace, at the billions of worlds and the quadrillions of lifeforms now under his protection.\nThe current time flow in Veridia, the realm of advancement and the small universe was ten thousand times, which was given by Adam.\nIt was more like the God space was ten thousand times slower but it’s the same thing in the end.\nThe time of all the territory under Sunny was synced, and it would have taken 3.5 days for the cooldown of his innate talent to end.\n\"It’s time for an upgrade for the entire territory\" Sunny murmured. He stood, his cosmic robe swirling, and raised his hand.\nHe was not just a God; he was the Emperor of this multiverse, and it was time to change the very laws of his domain.\nHe gathered his will, his divine power, and his mastery over the Laws of Time onto his world.\nA wave of 5 trillion of faith, erupted from him. It was a silent, beautiful, and utterly profound wave that washed over his entire territory.\nIt passed over Veridia, over the new, small universe, and even over the colossal, million-world expanse of the Realm of Advancement.\nThe very heartbeat of his empire, the fundamental rhythm of its existence, skipped a beat... and then began to pulse at a new, impossibly fast tempo.\nThe time flow, which had been ten thousand times faster than the God’s space, was now so fast that a century, the agonizingly long cooldown for his Skill-Resonance talent, would now pass in a mere eight godly hours like it used to be in Veridia, but now the whole territory of Sunny was under this effect.\nBut as he felt the new, accelerated flow of time settle, he also felt a new, immediate problem, a problem he had, of course, entirely anticipated.\nA subtle, mischievous grin spread behind his mask.\nAcross his empire, six billion Gods suddenly found themselves... blind. Their divine senses, which could once perceive every leaf and every stone on their home worlds, were now hopelessly out of sync. To them, their planets, now moving at a speed which was blue to them.\n\"Oh dear,\" Sunny said to Adam, his voice dripping with false concern. \"It seems my little upgrade has created an unforeseen side effect. My poor, subordinate Gods can no longer perceive their own worlds. How will they manage it now?\"\nAdam just stared at him, his mouth agape, as he watched Sunny’s other hand already manipulating Thea’s system.\n\"Thea,\" Sunny commanded, his voice now crisp and professional, \"prepare a new, item for the Cosmic Shop. We will call it the ’Imperial Perception Filter.’ A small, insignificant blessing of God’s Eye, an item that will allow our valued customers to once again perceive their worlds at the new, accelerated speed. A bargain, really.\"\nAdam just shook his head, a single, stunned laugh escaping his lips. \"You are truly the most shameless God I have ever met, Cosmos.\"\n\"And Thea,\" Sunny added, completely ignoring him, \"prepare a new live broadcast for the ’fun activity’ I promised the mortals. It’s time to give them a real show.\"\nFar away, in another multiverse, in a reality that ran on the laws of cultivation, two figures of immense, oppressive power floated above a world of breathtaking beauty.\nTall mountains pierced a sky so clear it looked like polished jade, and wide rivers snaked through verdant, untouched plains.\nBut the two figures were not admiring the scenery. They were furious.\n\"I don’t know where that newborn God is hiding, Ichor,\" Maledictus said, her voice a low, frustrated hiss. \"We have searched this entire multiverse for years. He is not here.\"\n\"He has to be here!\" Ichor, the Lord of Corrosion, snarled, his rage causing the beautiful rivers below to bubble and hiss, the water turning a sickly, acidic green.\n\"His father, with his dying, pathetic shriek, insisted he had left, that he had gone in search of someone stronger. He was lying!\"\n\"He wasn’t,\" Maledictus replied coolly. \"He truly believed it. This Cai Zhen, this new God, has simply... vanished. He has left his home reality.\"\n\"So what now?!\" Ichor roared, his anger making the very universe around them tremble. \"We are to search the infinite multiverses for one small, cultivation-obsessed fry? When we don’t even know which direction he went in?\" He raised a hand, his corrosive power gathering, ready to melt the beautiful world below out of sheer, spiteful frustration.\n\"Contain your anger, you brute,\" Maledictus snapped. \"Destroying this world is a waste of energy.\" She turned, her gaze already fixed on a new, distant reality. \"We head to the Zerg multiverse. It is time we corrected an old, lingering mistake.\"\n\"The insects?\" Ichor scoffed. \"Why? They are annoying, yes, but they are contained. Send a few demon gods. That will be more than enough to crush those little bugs.\"\n\"That is where you are wrong,\" Maledictus said, her voice dropping, losing all its melodic quality, replaced by a cold chill. \"Two new Gods have been born in the insect race.\"\nIchor’s dismissive laughter died in his throat.\n\"And that,\" Maledictus continued, \"is not all. These new Gods, they have done something that the old Zerg Emperor never could. They have found a way to break the barrier of their home multiverse. They are spreading. And they have already infested a new, neighboring reality.\"\n\"They are taking our territories?\" Ichor’s voice was a low, dangerous growl. \"They are killing our farm animals?\"\nFor the Demon Lords, all other races were just that; livestock, a crop to be farmed for fear, despair, and chaos.\n\"It gets worse,\" Maledictus said, her voice now barely a whisper. \"The multiverse they have just invaded... it belongs to the God of Resources.\"\nIchor, the Lord of Corrosion, a being who had fought Void-born and laughed in the face of Adam, gulped.\nThe color drained from his horrifying face. His mind, against his will, flashed back to a memory from an age long past, a memory he had buried deep in his consciousness.\nA memory of another insect God, an ancient, endlessly-evolving horror that had killed him. Not once. Not a dozen times.\nBut thousands of times, his Corrosion useless against a being that could adapt and evolve faster than he could destroy it. It was the only being in the multiverse that had ever made him feel fear, apart from Adam offcourse.\nAnd now, a new generation of that same, crawling blight... had just found a mine of infinite resources.",

A modest sum.\"\n\"Only thirty?\" Adam joked. \"And here you were, boasting of hundreds of trillions just a few hours ago. I suppose even an Emperor can miscalculate his market.\" He was teasing, of course.\nThirty trillion faith in a half an hour was a staggering amount for any of the new Gods.\n\"Oh? We are making fun of each other now?\" Sunny’s cosmic mask tilted, the swirling galaxies of his eyes seeming to focus on Adam.\nHe didn’t get angry. He simply, and casually, asked, \"Do you know how much faith I have actually accumulated in this last half-hour, Adam?\"\nAdam’s smile faltered. He sensed no boast in Sunny’s tone. Only a quiet statement of fact.\n\"Well,\" Adam calculated, \"thirty trillion from the blessing sales. Then... the residual faith generation from the lifeforms, the excitement from the tournament’s end... another fifty, maybe sixty trillion. And this ’fun activity’ you just started.... that must be the source of the rest.\"\nHe stroked his chin. \"Two hundred trillion? Perhaps two hundred and fifty trillion, at most.\"\nEven as he said the number, it shocked him. He used to earn that much in a single minute at the height of his own empire, but that was with a fully-mature multiverse.\nFor Sunny, a god of only ten days, to pull such a sum from a fledgling empire... it was remarkable.\n\"Wrong,\" Sunny chuckled, a dry, cold sound. \"It’s higher.\"\n\"Three hundred trillion?\" Adam asked, his voice a little quieter.\nSunny just shook his head.\n\"Four hundred? ...Six hundred?\"\nThe masked figure remained silent.\n\"Eight hundred trillion?\" Adam’s voice was now a whisper of disbelief. \"Fck, Cosmos, you are kidding with me.\"\n\"A full quadrillion?\" he finally breathed, the number a guess so absurd it felt foolish to even say. \"You are cheating, aren’t you? We are both Void-born! What makes you so special?!\"\n\"You were close,\" Sunny said, his voice laced with a cold, almost crackling with satisfaction. \"One point one quadrillion. And still increasing.\"\nAdam coughed, his eyes wide with shock. \"How!? How is that possible? The faith from the tournament and the blessing sales... it doesn’t add up!\"\n\"I am not telling you,\" Sunny replied, his tone mocking.\nAdam shook his head, his mind, which had seen the birth of stars and the death of civilizations, completely unable to solve this single, frustrating puzzle.\n\"Aww, don’t make such a face,\" Sunny said, his playful cruelty surfacing. \"I will tell you.\" He leaned in, as if sharing a grand, cosmic secret.\n\"It is a talent. My Gods of the Gods talent, to be precise. It allows me to earn a small percentage of all faith generated in this multiverse... specifically, the faith that is prayed to unknown or unclaimed entities.\"\nAdam stared at him, the color draining from his newly-manifested face. \"The God of... unclaimed faith...\" he whispered.\nHe remembered that talent. He had known a God, in the old era, a friend, who possessed it.\nA God who had, through that single, seemingly minor talent, become one of the wealthiest and most powerful beings in existence, his power fueled by the lost, desperate prayers of trillions who had no one else to turn to.\nIt was a unique, SS-Grade talent, meaning that only one person in an era can have this talent.\n\"I thought you saw it with your God’s Eye?\" Sunny asked, genuinely curious.\n\"I can’t,\" Adam admitted, his voice heavy with a newfound, strange respect. \"Not anymore. Your power level... it is now equal to my own. My God’s Eye cannot pierce your veil without me paying a price in faith that, quite frankly, I am no longer willing to spend.\"\n\"Good, good,\" Sunny said, accepting it as a simple fact. He then looked at the system panel that Adam had been watching so intently.\nAdam’s gaze returned to the screen as well. What Sunny had ordered Thea to do was, in Adam’s opinion, a move of such cold, calculated, and terrifying genius.\nSunny had, locked the entire Realm of Advancement. It was now a one-way prison. Demons could enter, but they could never leave.\nAnd Nexus’s connection had already identified the location of every single demon demigod hiding within its borders. A trillion of them. An army of evil.\nSunny could have killed them all in an instant. He could have had Nexus, the realm’s new master, simply kill them, eject them, or crush them. It would have been a simple, clean, and efficient act of pest control.\nBut that, Sunny had realized, would be a waste.\nWhy simply kill your enemies when you can monetize their execution?\nThe \"fun activity\" he had announced was a Purge. He was broadcasting the hunt.\nRight now, on every system panel, in every home, in every one of the six billion worlds of his Pantheon, the show was live.\nThe lifeforms, their blood still hot from the tournament, their hearts swelling with the strength of their demigods and lifeforms, were now being treated to the ultimate entertainment:\nTheir own demigods, the heroes of their worlds, hunting and slaughtering the demons who had terrorized them for generations.\nThey watched as Nova and her team, an elite, immortal strike force, warped into a demon fortress and annihilated a dozen demon commanders in a flash of light and left for the location of other demons.\nThey watched as Ragnok’s champions, organized into a disciplined army, laid siege to a demonic stronghold, their battle cries a roar of righteous vengeance.\nAnd with every demon killed, every fortress burned, every \"mission completed\"... the faith of the audience, a torrent of gratitude and bloodlust, poured forth.\nIt flowed to the subordinate Gods, who then tithed 25% of it automatically to Sunny.\nAdam watched, his mind processing the sheer, cold brilliance of the plan. Sunny wasn’t just killing demons.\nHe was solving his faith problem, and his entertainment problem in a single, perfect, terrifying way.\nAnd the most brilliant, most chilling part? His new Divine Immortality talent. The Nine Lives he had gifted his followers.\nThe demigods he had sent on this \"hunt\" were not just an army. They were an immortal army. When a demigod fell, overwhelmed by a superior demon.\nThe audience would gasp, they would weep, they would pray... and then, a moment later, that same demigod would be reborn, back in their home planet, stronger, wiser, and angrier, ready to rejoin the hunt.\nTheir \"heroic sacrifice\" was a commercial break, a moment of drama that would only make the faith of the audience burn hotter.\n\"It’s a win-win,\" Sunny said quietly, as if reading Adam’s mind. \"A perfect, self-perpetuating engine of power.\"\nAdam just shook his head, a single, stunned laugh escaping his lips. \"You, Cosmos,\" he said, raising his glass in a toast, \"are a terrifying, terrifying God.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 216: Ch 216 : Two more Clones\nAdam, the newly reborn God of Growth, stood on the pristine soil of his new world.\nA sense of peace settled over him, a feeling he had not known for over a million years. The constant, crushing weight of being the sole protector of the multiverse, a burden he had carried since his birth, was finally gone.\nHe had seen the Sunny’s power. He had witnessed his judgment. He had felt the terrifying, and reassuring scale of his abilities. His multiverse was in good hands.\nHe looked up at the new sun that Sunny had manifested for him, a warm and gentle star.\nAnd then he decided that he would guide his new lifeforms, connect them with Thea, and watch them grow, not as a king of the Gods preparing for a war, but as a loving father, finally free to simply enjoy the act of creation.\nMeanwhile, in his own God space, Sunny was not at peace. He was staring at a number, a figure so vast it felt like a joke.\n[Faith Points: 5,300,000,000,000,000]\n5.3 quadrillion.\n\"I need to quicken my pace...\" Sunny thought, his voice a low, heavy rumble. The 1.1 quadrillion faith he had \"boasted\" about to Adam was not a lie, even though he have more than 5.3 quadrillion fsith.\nThat 1.1 quadrillion was the sum of his blessing sales, the share of 25% from the gods, and the massive faith generation from the lifeforms, so technically he didn’t lie to Adam.\nBut the other 4.2 quadrillion... that was not profit. That was a loud bell.\nHe had felt it the moment his Gods of the Gods talent kicked in. It wasn’t the warm, gentle flow of faith from his own, happy lifeforms.\nThis was a desperate, chaotic, terrified flood of energy. It was the collective terror of souls he had never met, screaming, praying to any unknown entity to save them.\n\"It’s the demon gods,\" Sunny thought, his mind now cold and clear. \"I’m sure of it.\"\nThea’s particles, scattered across the multiverse, confirmed his fears.\nHe saw them: glimpses of Godless worlds, planets that had no protector. He saw a colossal, shadowy being, a true demon god, whose mere passage through a solar system was causing its planets to shake, triggering earthquakes and volcanoes.\nHe saw the lifeforms; terrified, being buried in ash and rubble, their final, desperate prayers a torrent of faith that flowed directly into his reserves.\nSunny felt a cold, familiar fury settle in his gut. This was why he needed to expand, why he needed to conquer this entire multiverse.\nIt was not just for power, but to save them. He had to place these Godless worlds under his God’s Domain to protect them.\nHe immediately cut off his mental connection with Thea and decided that he would not tell Adam. The old God was finally at peace, just beginning to build his new life.\nIf Adam knew, if he saw these images of mortals suffering under the same evil he had fought for a billions of years, his new life would be over.\nThat righteous fire would reignite, and he would charge out alone to face an army of demon gods he was not yet strong enough to fight.\n’Heck,’ Sunny admitted to himself, ’if a truly strong demon god, one of the ancient ones, found either of us alone, we might not be their match. Not yet.’\nHe would not let his only true friend, his only equal, die a second time for his rage. This was a burden he would carry alone.\nHis gaze returned to the system panel, where the \"fun activity\"; the live broadcast of his demigods hunting demon demigods in the Realm of Advancement was still generating a steady stream of faith. The entire enterprise now felt... tainted.\n\"I guess it’s time to end the show,\" Sunny said, his voice cold. He had earned enough faith from this spectacle. It was time to stop treating this war like a game.\nHe issued a single command through his domain. \"Nexus. Finish them. All of them.\"\nHe could not, he decided, allow his own lifeforms to become like the jaded, bloodthirsty citizens of the Roman Coliseums he’d read about.\nThey needed to focus on progress, on science, on magic, on the true expansion of the empire.\n\"Thea,\" he commanded, \"what is the status of the spaceship manufacturing?\"\n[Master, production is proceeding ahead of schedule,]\n[The knowledge of the nuclear reactor was useful, but the scientists of Veridia found it. They have reverse-engineered a new power source based on the divine mana veins you provided for study. They call it the ’Cosmic Mana Generator.’ It consumes ambient cosmic energy and converts it into pure, usable mana at the rate of an A-Grade mana vein.]\nA slow, proud smile spread across Sunny’s face. ’My people. They are geniuses.’\n[The first prototype, the ’Star-Weaver I’, has passed all warp-speed and long-duration tests. They are just finalizing the interior, modifying the blueprints to accommodate a thousand lifeforms for long-term colonization missions.]\n\"Excellent,\" Sunny said. This was the future. This was his grand, two-tiered plan for his empire.\nThea’s portals would be the privilege of the elite; the demigods, the high-merit champions, the Gods themselves.\nIt was a status symbol, an instant, luxurious mode of travel to strive for.\nBut for the masses, for trade, for colonization, for the slow, steady, and safe expansion of his civilization... they would have these. They would have the Star-Weavers.\nNow, he needed more. More progress, more comprehension, more hands.\nHe focused his will. A torrent of energy, one hundred trillion faith points, vanished from his reserves. A new, 13th clone of himself began to form.\nBefore the light of its creation had even faded, he did it again.\nOne quadrillion faith points.\nThe number was so vast that it took a minute to process so much faith. His 14th clone solidified, bowing its head in greeting.\n\"The next one will cost ten quadrillion,\" Sunny muttered, feeling a flicker of headache. \"This talent is a glutton.\"\nBut it was worth every point. He now had a council of fourteen Gods, all of them were he himself.\nIt was time to put them to work.\n\"Two of you,\" he commanded, gesturing to clones 13 and 14, \"will take over the blessing and divine bestowal operations. Your work will be endless, but it will fuel our empire.\"\nThe two clones nodded and vanished, teleporting to the newly constructed \"Hall of Blessings\" in the small universe.\n\"The remaining twelve of you,\" he said, his voice a low, serious rumble, \"your task is the most important. You will go to the Arena of Epiphany. The time flow there, now under my God’s Domain, is accelerated. A century for you would be just 8 hours for me.\"\nHe gave them their assignments: two would focus exclusively on breaking through to the SS-Grade of magic; three would dedicate themselves to the peak of body refining; and the remaining seven would have one, singular, all-consuming task.\n\"Comprehend the Law of Manifestation. Break its secrets. Achieve the SSS-Grade. Now, go.\"\nA portal, a stable gateway to the Realm of Advancement, shimmered into existence.\nThe twelve clones, a identical council of power, walked towards it.\nThe instant the first clone’s foot touched the threshold of the portal, all hell broke loose.\nThe entire Realm of Advancement, a construct of a million worlds, screamed.\nThe realm was Sunny’s territory. The clones were Sunny.\nThe Arena of Epiphany began to shattered. The sky of the realm tore open, not in one place, but in a thousand, revealing the terrifying void beneath.\nTime itself stuttered, accelerating, slowing, and stopping, all at once.\nThe entire Realm of Advancement, the new, central pillar of his empire, groaned, on the very brink of total collapse.",

      "content": "\"What is happening? Is it because of my clones?\" Sunny thought, his consciousness reeling from the violent feedback.\nThe entire Realm of Advancement, his newly claimed territory, was screaming.\nWith a single mental command, he called his twelve clones back through the portal, pulling them from the threshold of the Arena of Epiphany an instant before reality tore itself apart.\nThe temporal distortions, the spatial ruptures, the very fabric of the realm, which had been stretched to its breaking point, snapped back into stabilization.\n\"Nexus! What happened?!\" Sunny’s asked mentally through the connection between them.\n\"Master...\" Nexus’s reply was a pained, shaky thought, a mental whimper from a being who had just experienced an intense migraine.\n\"The moment your... your other selves... set foot in the arena, the Law of Time shattered. It... it went mad. The accelerated time I was maintaining began to run uncontrollably. In some sectors of the realm, time accelerated to a million times. In others, it stopped completely. In one, Master, it even began to run in reverse. I felt the realm... dying.\"\nNexus, the living soul of the realm, had felt every tremor. \"I tried to regain control, to force the Law back into its proper channel. But my will only made it worse. It was like trying to patch a tsunami with a leaf. The moment your other selves retreated, and only then, was I able to calm the storm.\"\nAfter ensuring Nexus was stabilizing the realm, Sunny sat back on his throne, his mind reeling with the possible cause of this phenomenon.\nThe chaotic event had been a failure, but it was also a crucial, invaluable piece of information.\nHe could, of course, simply ask Adam. The ancient God would likely know the answer, would have some wisdom from a billion years of existence to share.\nBut Sunny was not a child. He was an Emperor. He would not run to his elder for the solution to every puzzle he finds.\nHe was a being with SS-Grade Divine Comprehension and S-Grade Wisdom.\nHe would uncover this mystery himself, and in doing so, perhaps this struggle was the very foundation his own Time Affinity needed to break through to the next grade.\nHis mind, now amplified by all the talents and the divine buff he casted upon himself, which gave him a perfect feel for his own territory, raced.\nHe processed the variables, running countless simulations in a matter of seconds. And in just five minutes, he landed on a hypothesis. It was a paradox. A paradox of power.\n\"The time-law I wove over the arena was a product of my SS-Grade Time Affinity,\" he mused. \"But my clones... they are me. They are Gods too.The law of time was not strong enough to force the body of a God to flow with the accelerated speed of the time. The moment the clones stepped inside, reality rejected the logic, and the law tore itself apart.\"\nHe was not sure, but the theory felt correct. And there was only one way to be certain. He needed to test it.\nSunny waved his hand. A small, self-contained subspace, a pocket dimension of only a few acres, materialized in front of him.\nHe poured his will into it, weaving the same law of accelerated time, setting the time flow similar to his other territory; century in eight hours. \"Now,\" he commanded one of his clones, \"go.\"\nThe clone stepped into the pocket dimension. Instantly, the fabric of the tiny universe shrieked.\nThe law of time crackled, flickered, and shattered, just as it had in the arena. The clone, a Godly being, was too heavy for the SS-Grade law to bear.\n\"So, I was right,\" Sunny growled in frustration. He tried again. This time, as the clone stepped in, Sunny forced the law to hold.\nHe poured his own will and a torrent of his faith into the subspace, his consciousness becoming the pillar that manually supported the collapsing subspace.\nIt worked. The law stabilized. The acceleration time held, even with the clone inside.\nBut it was a terrible, useless solution. It required his full attention. He couldn’t move. He couldn’t think of anything else. He couldn’t even observe his other clones.\nHe was a babysitter, trapped in a single, mind-numbingly boring task.\n\"What’s your problem...\" he said, letting the subspace collapse in frustration. This test meant that to make his clones train, he would either have to do nothing else but watch them, or sacrifice one of his precious clones to do the same, dull job.\nHe briefly considered creating a new demigod, a \"Demigod of Temporal Stability,\" but he knew it was a foolish thought. Nexus, the demigod of the realm, had been unable to control a sub-law within it. Even Nova wouldn’t be of help here as she wasn’t even a God, thus she can’t maintain the time flow like him.\n’Adam’s Soul Splitting talent would be a blessing right now,’ he thought, a flicker of envy in his mind. ’I could just tear off a piece of my soul and assign it the task permanently.’\nHe sat back on his throne, frustrated. He tried another test. He set the time flow to a slower speed; one day outside for a century inside, a 36,500x acceleration.\nThe clone entered. The law crackled, it sparked, it violently disrupted, but it held... barely.\n\"I need to reduce it even more?\" he grumbled. He thought back. ’Adam chose to slow down our God space. It is 10,000x slower than the outside world, maybe that’s the amount a law of SS-Grade can hold’\nHe set the flow to 10,000x and had the clone enter.\nThis time, the law held. It was perfect. Stable and absolute. The Godly presence of the clone did not disrupt the temporal flow.\nSo, that was the limit. An SS-Grade law could only support a divine being at 10,000x acceleration.\n\"But this is counter-productive!\" he snarled, doing the basic math. Why have twelve clones training at a 10,000x speed when he could have eleven training at a 100,000x speed, with one clone sacrificed to maintain the temporal lock?\nThe output of comprehension and progress would be nearly ten times greater. It was the only logical choice.\nBut the thought of sacrificing one of his precious clones to be a a time flow maintainer would be a waste. As the more minds tried to comprehend the easier it is to comprehend.\nAnd then, as his mind, amplified by Children of Wisdom, churned on the problem, a new, brilliant idea struck. A thought so perfect, that he almost laughed aloud.\nHe couldn’t create a demigod to do the job. A demigod was a conscious, independent being. But what about an artifact?\nAn artifact was just a tool. It had no will. It only had a function.\nHe could manifest an artifact, an SS-Grade \"Time Stabilizer.\"\nIt’s sole and eternal purpose to channel his divine power and maintain the time-lock. It would be the perfect, tireless babysitter, allowing all twelve of his clones to train at the maximum possible speed, freeing him up completely.\nBut as the complex blueprints of the artifact formed in his mind, a new, crushing reality set in.\nTo manifest an artifact of this complexity would take hours. Hours of his full attention.\nAnd in the real multiverse, the one outside his territory, the demon gods were on the hunt. The lifeforms, the people, were dying right now.\nTime wasn’t a luxury he could afford to waste.\nSunny closed his eyes, his mind running countless simulations. He needed the artifact now. He couldn’t spend hours building it.\nA crazy idea began to form in his mind.\nA grin spread across his face, hidden behind his cosmic mask. He had found a solution.",

      "content": "Far beyond the borders of Sunny’s known multiverses, in a different multiverse, a man and a woman sat across from each other.\nThey were in a garden of impossible beauty, a place where the flowers were forged from light and the trees from a shimmering, non-wooden material.\n\"So, you are saying you are from another multiverse?\" The woman’s voice was a melody, a perfect, harmonious sound that seemed to resonate with the very air around her.\nShe was a being of flawless, celestial beauty, a holy maiden whose every minute movement sent subtle, almost imperceptible ripples of power through her surroundings. This was Thera, the Goddess of this multiverse.\nThe man sitting opposite her was her equal in appearance, his facial features so perfectly sculpted they seemed to defy nature, his long black hair bound in a simple clasp, his deep eyes holding the memory of a thousand years.\nHe was Cai Zhen, a God from the multiverse of cultivation.\nHe nodded quietly, his brow furrowed, his body thrumming with a little anxiety. This place felt wrong.\nHe, a being who had forged his divinity through continuous hardship, who had absorbed the spiritual energy of the heavens for three thousand years, was sitting in a world that had no spiritual energy to absorb.\nThe air was empty. He was suffocating from the absence of Qi, and the woman across from him had no idea.\n\"Now,\" he said, his voice calm despite the growing panic in his soul, \"can you help me?\"\nThera, the Goddess of Divine Annihilation, studied him with an intense curiosity.\nHer multiverse was sealed and protected by a barrier, And yet, this man, this \"Cai Zhen,\" had torn his way into it, appearing like a comet, a being of a power she had never felt before. A power that was now... diminishing slowly.\n\"Help you?\" she repeated. \"You are a God. I am a Goddess. I sensed the power you used to breach the barrier of this multiverse of mine. Why would you need my help to leave?\"\nShe gestsured to the crystal-clear sky above them and said, \"The edge of the multiverse is that way. I am not like you. I cannot traverse my entire realm in a matter of years like you spoke of. For me, it would take thousands of years\"\n\"Goddess Thera, I have a... complication,\" Cai Zhen said, his pride warring with his desperation.\n\"My Walker of the Space technique, the one I used to travel here, requires an immense amount of a specific energy. An energy your world does not possess. We call it Qi. Without it, I am... stranded.\"\nThera’s perfect eyebrows rose. \"No Qi? No power? Still you will be a God, you can try to live without powers here\"\n\"I am a cultivator,\" he explained, trying to find the words. \"My body, my very divinity, is forged from the Qi I have absorbed over three hundred thousand years. I am a vessel of that power. But this place... your air is empty. My vessel is not being refilled. In fact, it is leaking.\"\nHe looked at his own hands, which, to his horror, seemed a fraction less divine, than they had a day ago. \"If I stay here, I will regress. My cultivation will fall apart. I will revert from a God to a demigod, and then... I will become a mortal. And I will die of old age.\"\nThera was truly, profoundly shocked. A God who could regress? A divine being who could just... die... from being in the wrong place?\nHer own power was innate, a talent gifted to her by the multiverse. It was a part of her soul, as inseparable as her own consciousness.\nThis man... he was a different order of being entirely. A God whose power was a resource, not a right.\n\"I... see,\" she said, her mind racing. He was a puzzle, a being from an outside world, and he was dying.\nShe felt a prickle of something, a twinge of... bad karma, as he might call it. \"I cannot have you die here. It would disrupt the balance of my world.\"\nShe leaned forward. \"If you have no energy, and I cannot take you, then you are truly stuck. However, if you have around hundred thousand years left to live, you can take one of my fastest spaceships.\"\nCai Zhen smiled bitterly. \"I cannot survive that long...\"\n\"How... fascinating,\" Thera mused. This changed everything. He was not a powerful invader she thought he was; he was weak.\nA predatory yet curious glint entered her eyes. \"And yet, you came to me for help. What payment could a powerless God possibly offer me, I can just take away anything you have of value?\" she said, as she remembered the promise of Cai Zhen when he asked for help.\nThe promise stated that he would give her something valueable.\nCai Zhen met her gaze, his calm returning. \"I can give you something you cannot take, even if you were to strike me down right now,\" he said.\n\"I can give you my knowledge. The secrets of cultivation. The art of breaking the barrier of a multiverse. These things are locked in my soul, in my memories. You can kill me, and you will gain nothing. But help me... and I will teach you.\"\nThera’s interest was piqued. She thought of her own ultimate talent, Divine Annihilation. It was a power that allowed her to create a thousand divine swords from nothing and obliterate any target.\nBut it had a cooldown. It was a skill she could use only once per day. This man, this cultivator, he spoke of power as a resource he could wield at will, as long as he had this \"Qi.\"\nHe was on a different, perhaps a more efficient, yet controlling path towards godhood.\n\"As much as I would enjoy a new... companion,\" she said, her voice a low, alluring purr, \"I do not want a dying mortal in my garden. \"\nShe stood, her form radiating a new power.\nShe held out her hand to him. \"I will help you. I will use my own power, my own high speed talent, to carry you to the edge of my multiverse. It will still take time, but just around a thousand years.\"\n\"Thank you, Goddess Thera,\" Cai Zhen said, a wave of relief washing over him.\n\"But I do not want your gratitude,\" Thera said, her voice hardening, the warm maiden replaced by the cold Goddess. \"I want payment.\"\nShe leaned in, her flawless face just inches from his. \"You broke into my multiverse. I want to know how. In return for my help, you will teach me your art. You will teach me how to break the barrier of a multiverse.\"\nCai Zhen looked at her, and then past her, his mind’s eye recalling the journey through the endless, terrifying void between multiverses.\nHe remembered the moment, just before he had found Thera’s realm, that he had seen it.\nA different multiverse, a colossal sphere of light so vast, filled with a chaotic and immense power that his own multiverse felt like a dim candle in comparison.\nHe had felt a strange pull from it. A pull of fate. But Thera’s realm had been closer, and midway. Thus he decided to take a breather in this multiverse and refill his reserves only to find the world doesn’t have any qi.\nHe had to get back to the void. He had to find that bright multiverse.\n\"I accept your terms, Goddess Thera,\" he said, his gaze fixed on that distant hope. \"Help me reach the end of the multiverse and I will teach you how to break the barrier\"",

      "content": "In the silent, cosmic expanse of his God space, Sunny sat on his throne.\nHe had faced a paradox: his clones, the very roots of his advancement, were now too powerful to exist within the accelerated time realms he created to train them.\nHe could not waste hours of his own precious Godly time to manually etch a stabilizing artifact. The demon gods were on the move, and time was a luxury he could not afford.\nEven if he enters the realm to do these things which would just be a few seconds in the God space, but he was too lazy to focus on this work.\nBut he wasn’t out of ideas, a smile formed on his face which was hidden behind his mask.\nHis hands, shimmering with the purest form of energy, Faith, moved.\nIn his left hand, he manifested an artifact, weaving it into a physical, intricate form.\nGold, starlight and solidified shadow flowed together, hardening into the shape of an ornate, old-world pocket clock.\nIt was a masterpiece of divine craftsmanship, its case of gleaming gold, its face a flawless disc of polished black obsidian. It was a perfect, beautiful... and utterly dead vessel.\n[Item name : The Timepiece]\n[Grade : SS]\n[Description : Created by God Cosmos for a grand plan]\nSunny chuckled at the unassuming description. It was a blank slate, an empty shell awaiting its soul.\nIn his right hand, he manifested a new Divine Embryo. But this time, he did not shape it into a dragon, or an angel, or a slime.\nHe poured his will into it, forming it into a formless, ethereal sphere of consciousness.\nIt was not in ethereal form like a shadow or energy like Thea, but a \"weapon spirit,\" a soul designed for a single, specific purpose: to inhabit a vessel.\n\"Now,\" Sunny whispered, a thrill of creativity running through him, \"let’s see if this works.\"\nHe brought his hands together. He took the divine soul of the embryo and, with a surge of his will, forced it into the cold, intricate body of the Timepiece.\nThe moment the two touched, the Timepiece shimmered even more brighly.\nThe golden clock began to vibrate violently, The black, obsidian face flickered with a blinding, white-hot light as the two opposing concepts; a living, divine soul and a non-living, manifested object; merged.\nThe blinding light vanished. The agonizing vibration stopped. And from the center of the black, obsidian face, two small, curious, glowing white eyes opened and looked up at their creator.\nThe artifact was no longer a dead object. It was alive. It was a new, loyal, and utterly unique demigod, bound not to a body of flesh, but to a vessel, an artifact.\nSunny laughed, a sound of triumphant joy. The slow, arduous, hour-long process of etching was no longer necessary.\nThis was not an artifact which needs to be etched by talents; it was a demigod. And he, as its creator, could simply give it the talents it needed.\nHe remembered the old saying from Endor, ’Time waits for none.’ He looked at the new, living clock in his hand.\n\"We all were wrong, our understanding was shallow\" he mused.\nHe placed his hand on the Timepiece, the metal now warm with the stabilization of a new life. \"You have a grand purpose, little one,\" he said.\n\"Your first talent,\" he commanded, \"shall be Time Stabilizer.\" The knowledge flooded into the artifact’s new mind.\nIt could use Sunny’s mana, which was the only energy \"heavy\" enough to anchor the law of time for his God clones.\nIts sole, singular purpose: to stabilize the accelerated law of a subspace, to hold the flow of time steady, no matter the cost.\n\"Your second talent,\" Sunny continued, his cosmic eyes glinting with experimental curiosity, \"shall be Rewind.\"\nThis was a new, powerful, and untested concept. The ability to reverse the flow of time in a limited, localized area.\nIt sounded impossibly overpowered, Sunny even thought that it wouldn’t work as it should be an SSS-Grade talent.\nBut as the talent settled into the artifact’s core, Sunny’s God’s Eye immediately perceived the limitation,\nThis talent could rewind matter. It could rebuild a shattered city from its dust. It could mend a broken body. But it could not rewind a soul.\nIf a lifeform had truly died, if its soul had already departed, carried away by the fundamental, unbending Law of Reincarnation to Cerberus’s hell or his own angels’ heaven, Rewind would be useless.\nIt would restore the body, yes, but it would be an empty, hollow shell, a zombie, a perfect, beautiful corpse.\nIt was a chilling and important discovery. His Divine Immortality talent, the Nine Lives he had gifted his empire, was still the only true path to resurrection.\nHe was tempted, for a moment, to copy this new, powerful Rewind talent for himself. His clones had already mastered acceleration and stopping time, but this... this was something else.\nBut he shook his head, his gaze firm. His Divine Intuition was still an insistent whisper in his soul, pointing him toward a single prize: Adam’s First-Born talent.\nThat was the true key to the hierarchy of the cosmos. He would wait. He would stay on target.\n\"You are now complete,\" Sunny said to the sentient clock. \"I will grant you more talents if I think of something, but for now, you have your purpose.\"\nHe poured a river of his own, potent mana into the artifact, filling its reserves, a battery that would last it for at least a week of continuous, heavy work.\n\"With this, I am finally free as a bird,\" he declared. \"My clones will now work for centuries while I live for mere hours.\"\nHe turned to the new, time-accelerated sub-realm, the one that held his twelve waiting clones. \"Now, little one,\" he commanded his new creation. \"Go. Increase the time flow in that realm to the maximum possible. And hold it steady.\"\nThe Timepiece, its new eyes glowing with a fierce, determined light, vanished. It reappeared in the sub-realm, a tiny, golden sun in the center of the pocket dimension. It unleashed its power.\nAs the time started to accelerate. Instantly, the fabric of the tiny universe screamed. The law of time crackled, flickered, and threatened to shatter under the weight of twelve Godly beings.\nThe walls of the sub-realm began to groan, visible cracks of black void began to surface across the entire realm.\nBut then, the Time Stabilizer talent kicked in. A wave of golden energy pulsed from the Timepiece, mending the cracks, soothing the law of time.\nThe breaking realm and the stabilizing force found their equilibrium, reaching a new absolute limit.\nThe Timepiece, now floating in the center of the stable sub-realm, sent a single, clear message to its master. Its black, obsidian face glowed with a new line of text:\n[Temporal Flow Stabilized. Maximum Acceleration Achieved: 1:100,000]\nSunny looked at the number. And his eyes began to shine even more brighter than the golden light of the Timepiece.\nThis meant that in just few minutes, he should be about to break through to the SS-Grade mage, and SS-Grade body Refiner. As for the law of manifestation, he wasn’t sure.... How much time will it take.",

      "content": "In the Heaven realm, a paradise of eternal happiness, two figures walked in silence. The rivers flowed, the trees bore shinning fruit, and the air was filled with a gentle, perfect warmth. It was a flawless, beautiful, and somewhat empty world.\n\"It’s quiet,\" Gaia, the demigoddess of life, whispered, her voice the only sound in the large realm.\n\"It’s dead,\" Uranus, her other-half, replied, his voice a low, frustrated growl. He kicked a pebble, sending it skipping across a glass-like pond.\n\"Master’s Nine Lives blessing... it’s a miracle for them, but it’s a curse for us. Not a single soul has arrived in Heaven in a century. Cerberus is still busy, I suppose; the wicked always find a way to sin, but us? We are... useless.\"\n\"We are not useless, brother,\" Gaia said, her gentle hand coming to rest on his armored shoulder. \"I have been busy. The new worlds of the Pantheon are unbalanced. I have been creating new species, new beasts and organisms to fill their ecosystems. There is much work to be done. There is much life to create.\"\n\"You have a purpose,\" Uranus countered, his voice sharp with an envy he couldn’t hide.\n\"My purpose was to guide the worthy, to be the ferryman to their final, glorious reward. But there are no worthy souls to guide, because there is no end. I am a guardian with nothing to guard, a warrior with no one to fight.\" He slumped onto a bench. \"I am a relic. A demigod without a purpose.\"\n\"If Master created you, then you have a purpose,\" Gaia insisted softly. \"You just need to find it.\"\n\"maybe,\" Uranus whispered, his voice dangerously low, \"my purpose is to find souls. And if no one is dying... then maybe...\"\nGaia recoiled, a flicker of genuine fear in her eyes. The implication was horrifying.\n\"You should ask the Master,\" she said, her voice firm. \"He will know. He will guide you.\"\nUranus looked at his sister, at the fear in her eyes, and a wave of self-loathing washed over him. He was scaring his own twin.\nHe nodded, his magnificent, angelic face a mask of internal turmoil and despair. \"Yes. You are right.\"\nIn his God space, Sunny was in the triumph of his new creation. He had just set the Timepiece in the sub-realm for his clones, their 100,000x accelerated training now underway.\nBut a new, brilliant, and profitable idea had taken root in his mind.\n’Why stop with my clones?’ he thought.\nHe began to pour trillion of faith into the subspace, expanding it, forging new, stable pocket dimensions within it.\nHe was building a realm, where his subordinate Gods; Zir, Asura, Strategist, and the other 5.5 billion, could pay a small fee to enter their own time-accelerated chambers to comprehend their chosen Laws.\nHe would be charging them for the very privilege of becoming stronger, a new path to print faith and also make his subordinates stronger with each passing second.\nHe was just calculating the potential profit margins when the request came, a respectful whisper in his mind.\n’Master, may I come to your God space? I wish to ask for your guidance.’\nSunny sighed, the interruption pulling him from his calculation of the profits. He waved a hand, and the very space in his throne room rippled.\nUranus, in his angelic, humanoid form, stepped through and immediately fell to one knee.\n\"Greetings, Master.\"\n\"Stand, Uranus,\" Sunny said, his voice casual. \"What do you want?\"\nUranus rose, his hands clenched at his sides, his handsome face filled with worry for the future. \"Master,\" he began, his voice trembling, \"I wish to know my purpose.\"\nSunny’s casual demeanor vanished.\n\"I... I do not understand,\" Uranus continued, the words tumbling out of him, \"You have granted near immortality to the universe. There is no death. The Law of Life... what is its purpose, if its cycle is now broken? Why do I exist, if the souls I was meant to guide no longer need me?\" He looked at Sunny, his eyes filled with a desperate, almost fanatical plea.\n\"What is the meaning of life, Master, in a world where no one truly dies?\"\nSunny froze. He looked at his creation, at this perfect, angelic being, and a cold, dawning horror crept into his mind.\nHe remebered the memory of Uranus’s creation, the divine embryo pulsing in his hands, and he remembered his own, casual thought at the time: ’A being to collect the souls of those with good karma, a guide to the afterlife.’\nHe had created his Demigod of Life to be a... soul collector. He had, in his own, foolish, shortsighted \"creativity\", created a being whose fundamental purpose was tied to death.\nAnd now, in the immortal empire he had built, that being was becoming unstable. He may even try to forcefully take away the souls of ’worthy’ individuals according to him.\n\"I created you as the Demigod of Life. Not the Demigod of Death. Life is not about its end. Life is a beautiful, chaotic, creative concept. Look at your sister. Gaia’s purpose is to create. She fills my worlds with new species, new wonders, new expressions of life. That is her path. You are the other half of that same coin.\" Sunny said, his voice calm yet his mind was also in turmoil.\n\"But... what is my purpose, then?\" Uranus asked, his face a mask of confusion. \"If I am not the end... what am I?\"\nSunny looked at his creation, at the untamed power and the confusion warring within him. He could have given him a new, simple purpose. ’Go protect Ragnok.’ ’Go guard the Timepiece.’ But that would just be patching a wound, not healing it.\n\"That,\" Sunny said, his voice softening, \"is something you must find for yourself.\"\nUranus’s face fell.\n\"I gave you an affinity for a Law, Uranus. I gave you a divine will. I gave you life,\" Sunny continued, his voice that of a father’s guiding hand. \"I will not give you a simple, pre-ordained answer that a child could follow. Your purpose is not to collect souls, but to embody life. Is that life in the form of a protector? A healer? The very vigor of combat That is a journey you must walk yourself. Go. Find out what ’life’ means to you.\"\nUranus looked at his Master, his creator, and he saw not a tyrant demanding obedience, but a father demanding growth from his children.\nHe bowed his head, his mind no longer filled with the blackness of despair, but with the light of a new, unknown path. ’I will try my best, Master.’ He bowed deeply and stepped back through the portal, his heart heavy, but no longer empty.\nSunny let out a long, slow sigh of relief as the portal closed. \"He scared me for a second,\" he muttered to the empty room. \"Asking me for the meaning of life... what do I look like, a philosopher? I have no idea what the law of life is.\" He had bluffed, and by some miracle, it had worked.\nHe shook his head, pushing the philosophical crisis aside.\n\"All things are done for now. My lifeforms are advancing. My demigods are comprehending the laws and the subordinate Gods will be comprehending their laws in the accelerated time too.\"\nHe closed his eyes, his mind finally, finally clear to return to his own, crucial task: the comprehension of the SSS-Grade Law of Manifestation.\nHe sank into his meditation. The universe around him faded. The flow of time, the needs of his empire, all of it dissolved, leaving only the complex, beautiful, infinite patterns of the law...\nSlowly.... Half a hour passed, while Sunny was busy comprehending the law.\nSKREEEEEEEEAM!\nJust then his Divine Intuition shrieked. It was an alarm of existential crisis, so loud it ripped him from his meditative state.\n\"HAAAAH~\" Sunny’s eyes snapped open, a groan of frustration erupting from his lips. \"Life never lets me have a single moment of rest, does it?!\"\nHe activated his God’s Domain, his consciousness expanding, his divine sense flaring out, searching for the source of the threat.\nBut before he could even turn his gaze, the universe shook. His entire God space, his new universe, shuddered so violently that planets cracked and his manifested suns flickered.\nSunny leaped from his throne, his divine form crackling with power, his heart hammering in his chest. \"This strength... The Demon Gods are here!\"",

      "content": "Chapter 221: Ch 221 : Silencing The Demon Gods\nFor centuries, the hunt had been a cold, boring, and fruitless affair. Out of the 20,000 demon gods, twenty-six demon gods, a pack of predators unleashed by Deimos’s decree, had swept through this sector of the multiverse and found nothing.\nThe new Gods, the ones born from Adam’s artifact, were cowards. They had hidden themselves away, their worlds hidden by some unknown power, leaving the hunters to starve in an empty space.\nThis endless search had made them irritable. It had made them angry. In their boredom, they had taken to committing casual atrocities; extinguishing suns, consuming the lifeforms of entire Godless planets, and torturing these poor souls just to pass the boredom.\nThen, they found it.\nA scent. A faint whisper of divine energy in a part of the void that should have been empty. It was a trail of life, a beacon of such overwhelming power that it pulled at their very souls.\nThey followed it, a pack of starved wolves drawn to a living feast. And they found its source.\n\"Haha, finally!\" a voice like a roaring furnace echoed in the silent void. \"A planet, protected by a God! This one is mine, brothers! I discovered it!\"\nThe speaker was Kash, a being of pure, sentient, malevolent energy.\nHe was a Legion-Born, a demigod birthed by the Demonic Realm itself, his form a swirling vortex of purple fire, a crown of shadowflame on his head, his ’body’ was a core of burning malice.\nHe and his 25 allies had found the source of the divine energy: a colossal, vibrant planet, larger than a star, radiating an aura of life so potent it was almost making them drool. It was Veridia.\n\"You wish, Kash,\" a new voice rumbled, a sound so deep and vast it seemed to shake the very fabric of space. This voice did not come from the pack; it came from the darkness behind them.\nA new figure emerged, and the other 26 demon gods, including the fiery Kash, instantly recoiled, their arrogant auras dimming to a respectful flicker.\nThe newcomer was colossal, so large that Veridia looked like a mere marble at its feet. Its form was a perfect symmetry.\nOne half of its body was a pristine, polished white, like divine porcelain. The other half was a deep, light-devouring black, a patch of absolute void.\nGolden veins, pulsing with a sick, unholy power, snaked across both halves, stitching them together.\nWhere a face should be, there were only two, perfectly circular, glowing red holes for eyes, and a permanent, crooked, glowing red line for a mouth; a smile that stretched from ear to ear, a show of insanity.\nThis was Edgar, also known as \"Death\" in the demonic realm. He, too, was a Legion-Born, but he was many league above Kash.\n\"We found this planet at the same time, little flame,\" Edgar’s smiling mouth did not move, but his voice echoed in their minds. \"But as I am stronger, I will be the one to have the fun here. All of you... get lost.\"\n\"Edgar... you...\" Kash’s purple flames sputtered with rage. He was a Legion-Born, a being of immense pride. He would not be dismissed like a common cur.\nBut as he looked at the overwhelming size of Edgar, at the cold, red, unblinking circles that passed for eyes, his anger was choked by a cold fear.\nHe knew, without a single doubt, that if he fought Edgar, he would not just be defeated; he would be erased. He bowed his fiery head in a gesture of submission.\nInside the shimmering, invisible barrier of the God’s Domain, Sunny and Adam stood on the surface of Veridia’s moon, observing the silent, terrifying gathering of their new \"guests.\"\n\"Quite a few ugly bastards have come to knock on our door, Adam,\" Sunny said, his voice a casual hum.\nHis God’s Eye was already at work, scanning, analyzing, and categorizing. He could feel the power radiating from the 27 demons.\nTwenty-five of them were cannon fodder, lesser demon gods that his subordinates could likely handle. But the two in the front... they were different. They were monsters on a completely different level.\n\"I know the white and black one,\" Adam’s voice was a low, grim rumble, his eyes fixed on the colossal figure of Edgar. \"His name is Edgar. He was just a lesser demon god during the great war, a minor nuisance. But the power I feel from him now... he has grown strong, Cosmos. He is one of their top-tier Demon God.\"\nAdam turned to Sunny, his face a mask of worry. \"My strength is still returning. I can handle the 26 rabble. But Edgar... in my current state, I cannot fight him.\"\nHe looked at the masked Emperor, the being who had repelled a Void Beast. \"Can you take him?\"\nSunny’s cosmic mask was unreadable. He felt the cold, oppressive aura of Edgar, a power that seemed to want to erase the very laws of life.\nBut his Divine Intuition, the talent that had screamed in terror at the sight of the Void Beast, was now... quiet.\nSunny gave a single, slight nod. \"I will take Edgar. You handle the others.\"\n\"Ants!\" Edgar’s voice suddenly boomed, a roar that smashed against the God’s Domain barrier, a sound that made the invisible wall shimmer and drain a trillion faith from Sunny’s reserves.\n\"Submit to me now, and I shall grant you the mercy of a painless death! Resist, and I will devour your world, one screaming soul at a time!\"\nThe other 26 demon gods laughed, a chorus of cruel sound.\nSunny just looked at them. He raised a hand in a simple gesture of annoyance.\nAnd he spoke.\n\"Shut up.\"\nHis voice was a calm, simple command, spoken with the absolute authority of his Divine Command. It was a law.\nInstantly, the 25 \"fodder\" demon gods froze. Their mouths, open in a chorus of mocking laughter, snapped shut. They grabbed at their throats, their eyes wide with terror.\nThe very concept of speech, of sound, had been stolen from them. They were trapped in a prison of silence, unable to even scream.\nBut the two Legion-Born fought.\nEdgar’s colossal form shuddered, the golden veins on his body pulsing with a defiant light. He strained against this new law, his entire being pushing back against Sunny’s will.\nWith the force of a collapsing star, he tore his \"mouth\" open and forced a single sound from his being. \"Hmph,\" he growled. \"Petty tricks.\"\nKash, the weaker of the two, had it harder. His purple flames sputtered and dimmed, his entire form convulsing as he fought the command.\nHe clawed at his own fiery throat, finally, with an agonizing effort, he managed to stammer, his voice a pathetic whisper: \"Y-yeah... p-petty... t-tricks.\"\nThis single, two-word exchange had established the power hierarchy of the new war.\nIn their own God spaces, the 6 billion Gods of the Pantheon, let out a collective gasp, they wanted to know the cause of these tremors.\nIn the end they decided to ask Thea about what was going on in the space, what was the reason for this sudden oppressive aura.\nThea, couldn’t just show them what was happening without the permission of Sunny, thus she mentally told her master about the questions from the Gods.\n\"They wanted to know what is happening,\" he said, his voice calm. \"I believe it is only right to show them.\"\nThea showed what Sunny had done just now, through the recording, which shook all the 6 billion Gods.\nTheir Emperor... their Emperor had just silenced an army of ancient, terrifying demon gods with two words.\nThe fear that had been coiling in their souls of the demons, was suddenly replaced by a new, fanatical awe for their new master.\nSunny, feeling the sudden surge of faith from his awestruck followers, smiled as he looked at the enormous Edgar.",

      "content": "Chapter 222: Ch 222 : Let me show you, why we are called as Gods\nThe six billion Gods of the Pantheon, watching the live broadcast from the safety of their God spaces, were completely silent.\nThe shock of what they had just witnessed; their Emperor, God Cosmos, silencing an army of twenty-seven ancient demon gods with two casual words, was still settling in.\nBut their awe was quickly replaced by a new terror. They watched as the two leaders of the demonic pack, the colossal Edgar and the fiery Kash, broke the law.\nThey watched them struggle against that command, their forms convulsing, and then, with a final effort, they freeed themselves from the Emperor’s will.\nA ripple of fear went through the Pantheon. Their Emperor was mighty, yes. But he was not perfect. These... Beings... were on another level entirely.\nThis realization, this first taste of the real war, did not break their spirit. This made them even more resolute.\nIn the God space of Asura, the God of the Kshara planet, a righteous fury ignited within him. He stood from his throne.\n\"Thea,\" he commanded, his voice a low rumble. \"Send me to my Emperor. The time for watching is over.\"\nIn another God space, Zir, his face a mask of fanatical loyalty, was already standing. \"What are you waiting for, Thea?! The Boss is in a fight! Send me in!\"\nJoker too stood up from his throne and said, \"Oh, this is a real party. 27 demon gods, and two of them are even at the same level as emperor.\" He too stood, a wicked grin on his face. \"Count me in, Thea. I want a front-row seat.\"\nNyx, Reflection, Strategist... one by one, the sixteen Gods who thought of themselves as capable of fighting these demons began to request Thea to send them into the space.\nThey were not just subjects. They were the Emperor’s sword, and they would not stand idly by while their leader faced the darkness alone.\n[Master,] Thea’s voice chimed in Sunny’s mind, a hint of something he could only describe as pride in her tone.\n[Sixteen Gods wish to join the battle. Should I guide them through the portals?]\nA grin spread across Sunny’s face, hidden behind his mask. \"Why not?\" he murmured, his gaze fixed on the twenty-seven demons. \"They aren’t going to die anyway.\"\nThe Divine Immortality he had gifted them, the nine lives he had bestowed, was a blessing that could only be used in such occasions \"Let them come, Thea. Let them have their fun.\"\nAdam, standing beside him, his eyes blazing with a fire, let out a proud laugh. His million year long gambit, his desperate, final act that had created this new generation of Gods, was finally, finally bearing fruit.\nSixteen portals tore open in the space behind Sunny and Adam. From them, the Gods who wished to fight for glory and pride emerged.\n\"Haha! And here I thought there were only two of you!\" Edgar’s voice boomed, his colossal form looming over them, his crooked red smile seeming to widen in delight. \"Now, it is a true feast! So many new, delicious little Gods to consume!\"\nSunny’s cosmic gaze remained fixed on the giant. He could not get any information. His God’s Eye, which could pierce the veil of any being below him, was useless against Edgar and Kash.\nTheir power, their very existence, was a mystery. He would have to be vigilant.\n\"The plan is simple,\" Sunny’s voice echoed directly in the minds of his allies. \"Adam will take the fiery one. I will take Edgar.\" He turned his gaze to the sixteen newly arrived Gods. \"The rest... are yours. Show me what the Gods of my Pantheon are made of.\"\n\"With pleasure, Emperor,\" Asura’s voice rumbled as his eyes, blazing with a righteous fire, locked onto a hulking, four-armed demon god.\n\"This is going to be expensive,\" Joker muttered, already calculating the faith-cost of the spells he was about to unleash.\nBut his face showed a hidden grin as he knew that he could get back that amount after making fun of these demon gods, and possibly some of the gods too.\nA multi-front war ignited in the dark space. Adam, roaring with the pent-up fury of a million years, shot toward Kash like a golden comet.\nThe sixteen Gods descended upon the 25 terrified, and now silenced, demon gods, their battle a chaotic, beautiful explosion of a hundred different laws and powers.\nAnd Sunny... Sunny was left alone, floating in the void, facing the colossal and utterly terrifying form of Edgar.\n\"You sure talk big\" Sunny said, his voice calm as he looked at Edgar. He raised a single hand. \"Let me show you why we are called as Gods\"\nHe decided to begin this fight with a declaration of overwhelming power. He activated his God’s Authority, which was now good enough to use two talents at the same time, and the two talents that Sunny was using were: Nova’s Charged Explosion and Mammon’s Talent Resonance.\nUsing talent resonance he wove all of his talents; his Time Affinity, his Magic Affinity, and the very authority of his God’s Domain; into a complex, and lethal framework.\nThen, he poured the fuel into that framework. He opened the floodgates of his Charged Explosion talent, unleashing the stored, cumulative power of his entire empire.\nThe power of every lifeform’s breakthrough, every champion’s victory in the tournament, every new birth, every prayer of hope; a torrent of energy surged into the weapon he had just forged.\nThe void itself screamed. An ethereal hand, a hand so colossal it dwarfed even the gigantic Edgar, materialized in the space above him.\nThis was a hand of law. A swirling, multi-colored hand, its \"veins\" a river of white-gold, explosive energy, its \"skin\" a tapestry of a dozen different SS-Grade talents.\nEdgar, the Legion-Born demon, looked up. And for the first time in his long existence, the glowing, red, circular holes widened in what could only be described as shock.\nHe tried to defend. He raised his own massive, black-and-white arms, a shield of his own law forming in front of him.\nSunny’s hand descended.\nEdgar’s shield dissolved. The Hand plunged into his colossal chest with grace. A spray of golden blood erupted from his back.\nBut Sunny wasn’t done. He raised his other hand.\nA second Cosmic Hand, an identical twin of the first, formed in the void below Edgar.\nHe clenched his fists. The two hands, one of heaven, one of earth, clapped together. They crushed the demon god between them.\nA multi-colored explosion of light erupted in the void. The shockwave shot across the battlefield.\nThe 25 demon gods, who had just been engaging with the Pantheon, were sent tumbling, their forms flickering, their silent screams of terror echoing in the minds of all present.\nSunny stood in the center of the destruction, his cosmic robe swirling. He looked at the dissipating cloud of black-and-white energy, the last remnant of the demon.\n\"Are you dead?\" he called out, his voice laced with a cold, mocking tone. \"Even a bug doesn’t die that soon. Stand up.\"\nThe golden blood, which had been floating lifelessly in the void, stopped. It reversed its course. It flew back to a single, central point.\nThe black-and-white energy, which had been dissipating, began to take shape. Edgar’s colossal form reformed, his body a mangled, a massive, gaping, hand-shaped hole in his chest.\nBut he was alive. And the crooked, red, smiling line on his face was wider, more manic, more terrifying, than ever.\n\"Good... good...\" Edgar’s voice echoed, no longer a taunt, but a rumble of hunger. \"You do have some skills, bug. But you made one, fatal mistake\"\nHe raised his own black-and-white hand. The black energy, the white light, the golden veins... they all began to swirl. As a cosmic hand similar to what Sunny had made began to form in the space above him.\n\"Damn...\" Sunny whispered, a genuine flicker of dread in his soul.\nThe Gods in their spaces, watching on the live feed, screamed. Adam, locked in a furious battle with Kash, froze, his face going pale.\nThe demonic hand descended, aimed not just at Sunny, but at Veridia, at the heart of the God’s Domain.",

      "content": "Chapter 223: Ch 223 : A new idea\nThe colossal, demonic hand, a perfect mirror of Sunny’s own attack, descended from the void.\nIt moved with a slow and unstoppable grace. It was not just an attack; it was a mockery, a declaration from Edgar that anything Sunny could create, he could corrupt and use as his.\nThe six billion Gods watching this horrifying spectacle through Thea’s live broadcast, felt an existential dread.\nThis hand was not aimed at them, but they felt as if it were. It was a force that seemed to transcend the very concept of defense, a power so vast that even their nine gifted lives felt like a meaningless, fleeting comfort.\nSunny and Adam, however, stood their ground, their divine forms blazing in the shadow of the descending mountain.\nThey stared at the barrier of the God’s Domain; their last wall of defence that had, just hours before, repelled the hunger of a Void Beast.\n\"It’s horrifying,\" Adam admitted, his voice a low rumble, \"but your barrier held against the Void beast. It will be able to hold against this too. The only question is the cost.\"\nSunny nodded, his mind a already attempting to count the faith drain.\nHe never finished the thought.\nThe hand, a swirling galaxy of concepts, touched the barrier.\nAnd passed through.\nThere was not even a slightest of resistance. The Cosmic Hand, an attack forged from Sunny’s own divine laws, simply phased through the God’s Domain as if it were not even there.\nIn that single instant, the entire multiverse froze.\nSunny’s mind went blank, a void of shock. Adam’s eyes widened in dawning horror.\nThe barrier, their ultimate defense, the very thing that protected their entire territory, their worlds, and the quadrillions of lifeforms within... had failed.\n\"Look at your face, little bug,\" Edgar’s voice echoed, a sound of malice. \"You were talking so big just now.\"\nAs if to punctuate his victory, Edgar, with a lazy, almost casual gesture, raised his second hand.\nFrom the void below Sunny, an identical hand of corrupted law erupted, its palm open, a mirror to the one descending from above.\nSunny’s mind, and the minds of his fourteen clones, exploded into a storm of calculations, running a million simulations per second. ’Why? How?!’ He tried to activate his Time Affinity, to slow the descent, to buy himself a single second to think.\nBut the hands, forged from his own laws, were already imbued with his Time Affinity.\nThey existed in their own temporal state, immune to his will. He couldn’t slow them down. He couldn’t counter them with a normal spell; that wouldn’t affect it any ways.\nThis was an unsolvable riddle.\nThe two hands, one from above and one from below, closed in, their shadows converging on Sunny, Adam, and the 16 allied Gods who had bravely, and perhaps foolishly, joined the fight.\nThere was only one path left. The one he hated because of the faith drain.\nSunny raised his head, his cosmic eyes blazing with a cold, furious light.\nHe spoke a single, divine command, a word that cost him more than the creation of a thousand demigods, a word that ripped one quadrillion faith points from his reserves in a single instant.\n\"DISAPPEAR.\"\nThe universe screamed. The two descending hands suddenly stuttered.\nThey were laws, yes, but this was a decree. A higher authority, backed by a quadrillion-faith point, a surge of will, had just ordered them to cease existing.\nThe hands tore at the seams, the beautiful, swirling lights of their laws unraveling like threads from a tapestry. And then, in a final, silent implosion, they dissolved into nothingness.\nA heavy, panting silence fell over the void. Sunny’s reserves, once a mighty ocean of 4 quadrillions, were now looking a little shallow.\n\"Why... why didn’t the barrier work?\" Adam’s voice was a whisper beside him, his gaze fixed on the spot where the hands had been.\n\"It wasn’t his law that bypassed it,\" Sunny said, his mind replaying the event, the logic behind his own failure. \"It was mine.\"\nThe confused looks from his subordinates were palpable.\n\"My command to the God’s Domain during the Void Beast attack was simple,\" Sunny explained, his voice cold.\n\"Do not let any enemy or any enemy attack enter my territory.\" He let the words sink in.\n\"That hand, Edgar’s attack... it wasn’t his. It was mine. He didn’t create an attack; he just... returned mine. The barrier analyzed the signature, saw my laws, my energy and it did its job perfectly. It recognized the attack as friendly... as internal... and it let it pass right through.\"\nHe now understood. Edgar’s power wasn’t just mimicry. It was something far more terrifying.\nIt was similar to Thorns, an ability to absorb, store, and return any attack, any law, any concept, thrown at him.\nWhen Sunny had hit him with that Cosmic Hand, Edgar had eaten it.\nThe implications were chilling.\nWhat else had this creature \"eaten\" in its long, horrifying existence? Had it survived an attack from the demon lords? From a Void Beast? Did it now hold those powers in reserve, waiting to unleash them?\n\"So, that means... we can’t attack him,\" Adam said, his voice grim as he effortlessly plucked the fiery hair from a struggling, bound Kash.\nWhile Sunny and Edgar had their duel, he and the 16 Gods had successfully, and almost easily, captured the other 26 demon gods. Edgar was now alone.\n\"We can,\" Sunny said mentally to Adam, not wanting Edgar to overhear his weakness, \"but the attack must be a one-hit kill. We cannot give him the chance to absorb and return a second blow.\"\n\"I was right, you are a little special?\" Edgar’s voice boomed, his crooked red smile twisting with glee.\nHe had seen the terror in their eyes, the shock, the dawning realization. \"There’s much more to come, little bugs. You haven’t even seen anything yet!\"\nHe raised his hand, and a new, different energy gathered; a wave of malecious energy.\nIt was not Sunny’s. It was something dark, ancient, and filled with a killing intent that made the Gods shiver. He hurled it at the barrier.\nSPLATTER.\nThe attack, a roiling ball of black energy, hit the God’s Domain and splattered, dissolving harmlessly against the invisible wall.\n\"See?\" Sunny said, a grim satisfaction in his voice as he felt the barrier drain a mere hundred billion faith to block the \"normal\" attack.\n\"That attack was from some other demon he devoured. My barrier can stop those powers, It just can’t stop mine.\"\n\"Oh?!\" Edgar’s red, circular eyes widened in genuine surprise. His focus, which had been on Sunny, now shifted to the invisible barrier that had just repelled his attack. \"A barrier? How cute.\"\nHe lunged with fury. His white-and-black fist, sith the size of a stars, slammed into the God’s Domain.\nBOOM.\nSunny’s entire body recoiled, a trillion faith points vanishing from his reserves in a single, painful instant.\nBOOM. Another punch. Another trillion gone. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.\nEdgar had become a furious punching machine, pummelling the invisible wall, and with every single punch, he was draining the faith of Sunny like water.\n\"How many hits like that can you take?\" Adam asked, his voice now laced with a desperate urgency.\n\"Probably... a few hundred, at most,\" Sunny replied, his own mind racing, his clones too were busy thinking about any solution.\nThe situation was, once again, impossible. They couldn’t attack him. But they also couldn’t let him attack them.\nThey were trapped, forced to sit and watch as this monster beat them into bankruptcy. ’We can’t attack him... what can we even do?’\nBut then, Sunny, his God’s Eye enhanced by his Domain’s omniscience, noticed something.\nA tiny, almost imperceptible detail that the other Gods, in their panic, had missed.\nWith every thunderous, trillion-faith-costing punch Edgar threw, his own star-sized body was... shrinking.\nIt was a minuscule change, a few centimeters at a time, but it was constant.\nA new path, a new bold strategy, began to form in Sunny’s mind.",

      "content": "Chapter 224: Ch 224 : Vengeance\nIn the dark, oppressive meeting hall of the demon lords, the five Demon Lords sat in council.\nAn ethereal projection, a wisp of corrupted energy, floated in the center of their bone table, replaying a scene of chaotic power.\nIt showed the figure of Edgar, locked in a brutal duel with a masked God.\n\"Edgar is fighting Cosmos?\" Deimos’s voice was a low hum, his usual calm replaced by a flicker of genuine surprise.\nHe watched the report, sent by a lesser demon god who was observing the battle from a safe distance.\n\"He is not just fighting, Deimos,\" Beelzebub rumbled, his voice a low growl in hunger \"He is winning. That little toy of yours, the one you’ve been so interested in, he may break before he is even fully developed.\"\n\"Do we stop Edgar?\" Phobos rasped, the hundred terrified faces swirling in his shadowy form all turning to look at their leader.\nDeimos watched the projection, his gaze unreadable. He saw Sunny’s brilliant counter-attack.\nHe saw Edgar’s mocking mimicry. He saw the barrier fail. He saw the Emperor of the Pantheon, the being who had eluded him for a million years, trapped. A slow, cold smile spread across his face.\n\"No,\" he said finally, his voice a final verdict. \"This is his test. If he cannot handle even a single, over-eager Legion-Born, then he is not the opponent I have been waiting for. He should rather die.\" Deimos closed the report, the projection vanishing, and stood, his gaze capturing all the darkness in the vast hall.\nFar away, in a different multiverse, two other Demon Lords stood before a defeated king.\nThe world around them was a dying husk, the skies a sick, yellow-green, the very air thin and choked with the scent of decay.\nThe Zerg, once a teeming, unstoppable tide, were gone, most of their population having migrated to a richer multiverse.\nAll that remained was their dying God, who chose to protect their home multiverse.\n\"You think you know our weaknesses?\" Ichor, the Demon Lord of Corrosion, sneered, his slimy, acidic form pulsing with a mocking light. \"That is pretty lame, insect.\"\nHe and Maledictus, the Demon lord of Curses, had come to this multiverse expecting a war.\nInstead, they had found a near empty multiverse, an empire ruled by a single God, while the two new Gods were out in the multiverse of resources, as Maledictus has said earlier.\n\"You will regret this,\" the Zerg God, Voragos, hissed, his insectoid body, once a magnificent fortress of muscle, now battered and broken.\nHis three remaining eyes burned with helpless fury. \"My son... Beru... he is the chosen one of the heavens. He will make our race... our race...\"\nSLAP!\nIchor’s slimy hand, crackling with corrosive energy, lashed out. The slap sent Voragos flying.\nHis body shot across half a universe, crashing through dead, abandoned planets before finally coming to a stop in the empty void.\n\"Your son?\" Ichor’s voice echoed in his mind, dripping with poison. \"We are going to the Multiverse of Resources next, insect. And I will personally find your precious, chosen son. I will kill him. I will eat his flesh. And I will make him watch as I devour your soul. Then, you can see him in the afterlife.\"\nIchor dissolved into a streak of acidic light, hurtling across the cosmos to finish his prey.\nVoragos floated in the void. He looked at the incoming Ichor. He had no power left to fight. But he had one, final act of defiance.\nHe gathered the last, fading embers of his divine will, and he screamed.\nIt was a message. An inaudible screech, a telepathic broadcast that contained all his love, all his rage, and his final hope.\nIt shot through his own multiverse, bypassed the barrier, and lanced across the infinite void, aimed at a single mind.\nIn the Multiverse of Resources, an ant-like, humanoid insect, taller than any human, his dark-red carapace gleaming with power, suddenly froze.\nHis two long, sensitive antennae, which had been idly tasting the rich, mana-filled air, twitched violently.\nThe message, a scream from a dying God, from his father, pierced his mind.\nHe heard it all. The arrival of the Demon Lords. The defeat. The final, defiant message of his father’s last moments.\nHe looked up at the sky, his eyes, once calm, now burning with a grief so profound it became a physical fire. His father was dead.\n\"I WILL KILL THEM ALL!\" he roared, his voice an inhuman sound of vengeance. \"I will eat their flesh! I will drink their blood! I will... I will...\"\nHis words failed him, his grief too vast to be contained in a simple threat.\nHe was Beru, the Crown Prince of the Zerg. And he was now an orphan.\n\"I will evolve,\" he whispered, his promise now a sacred oath. \"I will evolve past the very Gods of Insects from the legends. I will evolve until I can devour the Demon Lords themselves.\"\nA pair of shimmering ant-wings erupted from his back, and he shot into the sky, a comet of rage. He knew he was not strong enough. Not yet. He had to run. He had to hide. He had to grow.\nAs he flew, he sent his own telepathic message, to his only true friend, another anomaly from his multiverse.\n\"Brother Suba! Run! The Demon Lords... they are coming to find us!\"\nFar away, in another corner of the multiverse, a different, newly ascended Zerg God, his form a strange, mutated fusion of insect and something... else... paused his own exploration. \"My Prince? Is your father, the King, alright?\"\n\"He is dead,\" Beru’s message was a shard of ice in Suba’s mind. \"We are the only ones left who can avenge him now.\"\nFor a few, agonizing seconds, there was no reply. Then, Suba’s voice returned, his tone no longer curious, but filled with a grim, terrible resignation.\n\"Brother Beru... my Prince... I think they have already sensed me. I can feel their... gaze. You must hide. Do not stop. Do not look back.\"\n\"Suba, no! We can fight—\"\n\"We can’t. Not yet. When you reach the edge of this multiverse,\" Suba’s voice continued, calm yet hurried, \"open the box I gave you. It will help you break the barrier. Go. Live, my Prince.\"\nAnd then, the connection was cut.\nBeru, the last son of a fallen King, felt his heart, a complex, alien organ, shatter.\nHis father was dead. His only brother-in-arms was about to be.\nThis defeat, this helplessness, did not dim the fire of his vengeance. It fanned it, turning it from a simple flame into a raging inferno.\nHis anger, his grief, his pain; it all became fuel, and his body burned it, accelerating him, pushing him towards the edge of the multiverse, towards the unknown, at a speed he had never known he possessed.",
