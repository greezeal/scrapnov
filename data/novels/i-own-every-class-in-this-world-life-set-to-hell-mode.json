      "content": "\"Wait a minute… why does this truck have no driver-\"\nA 23 year old man was in the middle of an empty street, a fog surrounding his view, making him unable to see anything past the five meters mark.\nIt was already weird enough he hadn't met a singular person in around ten minutes, even though he was on a friday night, but what the hell was happening?\nHe had just come back from his overtime at his job as a professionnal accountant, but the moment he tried to traverse a seemingly empty road…\nA truck came rushing his way, almost as if it was waiting for him in the shadows.\n\"…\" the man wasn't dumb, after all he had read many novels and mangas, but he couldn't let that slide.\nHe had just been hired to his job three months ago, and he refused to die and let all those hours go to waste.\nSo… he jumped to his left at the last moment, essentially avoiding the truck right as it was about to kill him.\n\"Phew~\" He wiped the sweat from his forehead, \"Nice try, you fucking asshole-\"\nBut right as he turned back his head to see if everything was fine…\nAnother truck came rushing from the opposite direction, yet again with no driver behind the wheel.\n\"Yeah okay,\" this time he didn't even bother to avoid it as it was way too close.\n~SLAM~\nHe was hit in full force by the mysterious driverless truck, and immediately died upon impact with the vehicle.\nAnd just as predicted, almost as if some weird magic was taking place, the two trucks evaporated right after.\nThey had done their job after all…\n***\n(In an unknown space)\nA mysterious and powerful being was looking at the sky, lost in thoughts.\n'When will they arrive…' he was getting impatient, 'I sent those two to catch him, but they're taking longer than expected…'\nJust as the being was about to give up hope and go check for himself, a bright light appeared in the distance. The light grew stronger and stronger until a figure emerged from within it.\n\"Oh,\" the figure smiled as it saw the body of the accountant emerge from the rift and fall on the ground as he was unconscious.\n\"What took you so long?\" it spoke, not to the sleeping man, but to the two figures that were behind him.\nThey were covered in white, and their eyes completely dark, their appearance was grotesque and a pair of white wings emerged from their backs, as well as pure black horns from the top of their heads.\n\"He somehow managed to avoid us once…\" they both kneeled.\nThe two creatures were the drivers of the trucks, also called the 'ascenders' as they were tasked with sending potential individuals to this space, where they would be judged either worthy or unworthy of transmigrating.\n\"Very well,\" Rher sat back on his giant throne, his physical appearance was extremely large, and a single one of his fingers would be enough to crush a hundred humans, \"Bring him here, as the judgment shall begin.\"\nThe two white creatures got up before bowing to their god, then one of them touched the accountant's forehead, a golden light emerging from its palm.\n\"It is done,\" they informed Rher before disappearing yet again, off to continue their work.\nAfter a few seconds, the man slowly opened his eyes, finding himself in a strange and ethereal realm.\nHe sat up, looking around in confusion at the surreal landscape surrounding him.\n\"You are in my dimension,\" Rher's voice echoed in his ears as he regained consciousness.\nAs he slowly stood up, he took in the surreal surroundings of this new dimension.\nThe sky was a vibrant shade of purple, unlike anything he had ever seen before. The horizon seemed endless, stretching on and on into the unknown.\nAnd beneath their feet, the ground was solid yet ethereal, like a floating asteroid suspended in space.\nBut what truly captured his attention were the countless other rock islands that dotted the landscape.\nThey varied in size and shape, some resembling jagged peaks while others were smooth and round. Yet all of them shared one common trait - they too were floating in this bizarre dimension.\nBeneath his feet lay one of the many 'islands' that dotted the vast expanse of this dimension.\nBut this particular island was the largest, capable of holding not only Rher, but also his massive throne and still leaving plenty of room to spare.\n\"Human, the judgment shall begin,\" The being known as Rher smiled, his entire figure concealed by a dark cloak.\nThe only visible features were his piercing yellow eyes, staring intently at the human before them, and his impossibly wide grin.\nAs he leaned back on his throne, Rher's arms rested casually on the edges, showcasing his long, slender fingers adorned with sharp purple nails.\nIt was clear to the man that whatever was about to happen was anything but good.\n\"Judgment?\" he repeated, staring back at the God.\n\"Ohoh~ You don't seem too afraid, I like it!\" Rher laughed, \"Let's just roll in the tutorial!\"\n\"Tutorial? What is that-\"\nIn an instant, three panels appeared before him, each displaying a crudely drawn image and accompanying text.\nThe drawings looked as though they were sketched by a child, yet somehow held a strange air of otherworldliness.\n\"…\" he didn't even feel the need to question whatever was happening, so he started reading.\n[Welcome to the 'Judgment']\n[In this space, many people get judged by the God of Fate, Rher, and only those who are deemed fit can pass on to the next world]\nBelow that was a drawing of Rher sitting on his throne, and of a normal person with the text 'You' above.\n'Who even drew this, these are basically stickman figures…'\n[Those who are deemed unfit are sent to the void]\nThe drawing this time showed the same 'you' falling into the void, which was a dark sphere resembling a black hole, all the while getting zapped by Rher.\n[Amount of people that have passed the judgment yet: 0]\nThe third and final image showed a big 0 with Rher around it, a sad expression on his face.\n'Don't act like you're sad, it's your fucking fault,' he groaned.\nThe man finished reading the 'tutorial', then looked back at the god, who seemed proud of himself for drawing that.\n\"So let me get this straight,\" the accountant sighed.\n\"Yes, do ask.\"\n\"You ripped me from my original world, and unfairly killed me just to bring me here? And now I have a 99.99% chance of dying or being sent to some unknown void?\" he held his forehead, unable to comprehend how ridiculous that situation was.\nRher looked at him for a second before speaking, \"Um… yeah, pretty much.\"\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nThe two looked at one another, and so without hesitation, the man pointed his arms at Rher and gave him the middle finger.\n\"Fuck you,\" he spoke, an annoyed expression on his face.\n\"How violent!\"\nRher blinked, surprised by the man's boldness. No one had ever dared to speak to him in such a manner before. But instead of getting angry, a wide grin spread across Rher's face, revealing rows of sharp teeth.\n\"So what now?\" the black-haired man continued, \"Am I doomed to be judged by some random criteria I'll never know?\"\n\"Human, this test is to make sure that you have your place in this world, it is much harder than you think…\" Rher tried to justify himself.\n\"Who cares, this world probably sucks anyway!\"\n\"Hey, my world doesn't suck-\"\n\"Nuh uh,\" he made a 'no' gesture with his hand.\n\"…\"\nAnd yet again, the two stared at one another.\n\"You are extremely stubborn,\" Rher went back to smiling, \"But I like you!\"\n\"So when does the judgment end?\"\n\"Oh...\" Suddenly, Rher's pupils began to glow with a golden aura, and the surrounding air seemed to shimmer, \"But it has already ended...\"\nA blinding light enveloped the man, causing him to shield his eyes with his arm.\nAnd when it faded, there was a massive hole in the ground in the middle of the previously flat island in front of him, seemingly dug through the solid rock.\nThe man cautiously took a few steps closer to the edge, peering down into the darkness below.\n\"Am I supposed to jump?\" he asked with the most blank of expressions, pointing at the hole, sure that he failed.\n\"Uh? No! You passed!\" Rher laughed again, he really enjoyed that man's personality.\nHis laughter echoed off the surrounding cliffs as he gestured towards the hole, revealing a hidden staircase leading down into the depths below.\n\"You are the first and only person who will be allowed to pass, good luck, and don't disappoint me!\"\nThe man stared down into the depths of the staircases, and once he looked back up, there was no trace of Rher anymore, even the throne had disappeared.\n'Quit trying to act mysterious,' he groaned as he began descending.\n[Amount of people that have passed the judgment yet: 0->1]\nHe was descending the stairs, and the more he went on, the more dark and obscure the aura in his surroundings became.\nAnd when he reached the last step before entering a black portal in front of him, a panel appeared.\n[Congratulations, someone actually managed to convince Rher, making you the one and only transmigrator of this world!]\n'Does this mean i'm getting a system and becoming op in the other world?' the man questioned, having read his fair share of isekai media himself, he always knew it was something the protagonists of these worlds acquired to help them on their journey.\n[Lol, no]\nAnd just like that, an unknown force pushed him inside the portal, plunging him into darkness and silence. The sensation was dizzying, disorienting, as if he was hurtling through space and time.\nAnd after what felt like hours, days, weeks, months, years…\nHe opened his eyes.",

      "content": "The sky was a brilliant shade of blue, with vibrant rays of sunlight cascading towards his eyes.\nAs they adjusted to the bright light and noise, he realized that he was standing on the edge of a building at least 50 meters above the ground.\nA sea of people looked up at him, their voices blending into a chaotic symphony of concern and confusion. The man's mind raced as he tried to make sense of the situation.\n\":I\" the accountant was confused.\nSuddenly, he heard shouting from below, pleading for him not to jump.\nHe looked up and saw helicopters circling above, their cameras pointed at him.\n\"Don't do it!\" They shouted.\n\"I know you have no class, but it doesn't matter, it's not worth it!\"\n'What the fuck kind of argument is that, and what the hell is a class,' the man groaned, pinching himself to make sure whatever he was in wasn't just some dream and that he wasn't in a coma after being hit by the truck.\nBut the pinch only brought pain, confirming that this was indeed reality.\nThe wind blew through his black hair as he stood on the edge, contemplating the situation he found himself in.\nThe chaos below only seemed to escalate as more and more people gathered.\nThe helicopters were also still spinning in the air, broadcasting whatever was happening live to the entire world.\n\"Yeah ok,\" the man laughed as he couldn't hold it in, he couldn't have been put in a more ridiculous situation, but Rher seemed to have a weird sense of humor.\nHe distanced himself from the edge as he didn't want to trip and fall, after all what would happen to him if he found himself back in Rher's dimension, the god laughing in his face for dying less than 5 minutes after being reincarnated was something he did NOT want to experience.\nBut right as he moved away from the edge, he heard a voice behind him.\n\"I knew you wouldn't do it, you fucking pussy,\" said a young-looking boy with tanned skin and blonde hair, who despite his age, which was 15, towered over most people at roughly 180cm tall.\n\"What the fuck did you just say to me?\" not impressed, the transmigrator looked at the boy in the eyes, surprising him.\n\"Haha~ It seems like this attempt made you go crazy,\" The boy smirked in response, activating some sort of power that emitted an overwhelming aura around him, \"I'll have to put you back in your place again, classless boy.\"\n\"...\" Stark didn't even talk, just tilting his head in confusion.\n\"Stark, you are the lowest of the low and can't do anything right, and yet when I give you a chance to prove yourself, you pussy out?\" the man summoned a steel sword out of thin air, it was shimmering with a silver glow, \"I'll show you the power of a 'warrior'!\"\n'Is my name in this world Stark…?' he questioned, seemingly unhappy of the name he had gotten, his previous one was way better.\nHe didn't even seem to care about the fact magic was being used in front of him, instead focusing on some internal questions, he had no memories of this body after all, so he would need to start from ground zero.\n\"PAY ATTENTION, FUCKER,\" the aggressive boy bellowed, his eyes blazing with anger and determination as he charged towards Stark at an alarming speed, his sharp weapon gleamed in the sunlight, ready to slice and dice.\n'Hm…' Stark simply stood there, lost in thought, not even bothering to acknowledge the other boy's presence, but this only seemed to infuriate him more.\n\"Oh! I get it now, Rher! I think this is the tutorial!\" Stark nodded and hit the palm of his left hand with a fist of his right.\nThen without missing a beat, he instinctively took a step back, deftly evading the tanned boy's attack.\nThe sudden movement caused the aggressive boy to lose balance and tumble over the edge as he wasn't able to stop, not expecting Stark to avoid and so using his full speed.\n\"Huh?\" the blond man looked down as he fell.\n\"WATCH OUT!\"\n\"SOMEONE ELSE JUMPED!\"\nThe crowd quickly dispersed, creating a clear path for the falling boy who crashed into the ground with a sickening thud.\nMeanwhile, Stark calmly looked down at where the boy had fallen before shrugging nonchalantly, \"Oh well, I guess I beat the tutorial,\" he muttered to himself before casually walking away.\nWalking down the stairs, he realized the building he was in seemed to be some sort of luxurious apartment building.\nAnd after a minute, he found himself outside, where the crowd and chaos were located.\n\"Someone call an ambulance, QUICK!\"\nThe boy who had attacked Stark was on the ground, moving only slightly as his entire body was covered in blood.\n\"…\" Stark looked at him with a blank expression, then shrugged yet again before walking away, \"Tutorial bosses are really weak, not gonna lie…\"\nThe commotion and all the cameras were now pointed at the blond guy, allowing Stark to walk away without much issues, and even though some people noticed him, they didn't bother to ask him if he was okay.\n\"Damn, was this guy really that unimportant? Anyway, I need to figure out where I am before something else happens,\" Stark sighed as he turned the corner.\nBut when he did…\n\"THERE YOU ARE, YOU LITTLE SHIT!\" a man in his mid-twenties came rushing his way, he also had black hair and looked a lot like him.\n\"Who are you?\" he asked, unbothered.\n\"HUH? I'M YOUR BROTHER! YOU USELESS SHIT,\" the man grabbed Stark by the arm and forced him to seat at the backseat of a luxurious car, \"You are the shame of the family, I honestly think you jumping would have made things easier for us.\"\n'How supportive…' Stark rolled his eyes, but smiled on the inside, 'Where the fuck did you put me, Rher…'\nFrankly, he didn't take any of this seriously, after all, for him, all of this was only the tutorial, which meant the introduction, hopefully he would get basic information about this world soon though.\nStark observed his surroundings as the car sped off, taking in the opulence of the vehicle and the expensive-looking buildings passing by.\nIt seemed like he was in a world technologically similar to his previous one.\nAnd after thirty minutes and many different landscapes, he finally parked in front of a mansion.\n'Nice, if that's my house then life couldn't get better!'\nOr at least that's what he thought.",

      "content": "Stark stepped out of the car and looked up at the grandeur of the mansion in front of him. The architecture was impressive, exuding an air of wealth and power.\n'Nice,' he grinned while nodding, seemingly happy, 'Good job, Rher, I knew you wouldn't let me down.'\n\"Mother and father have called you in, there is a meeting with the entire family because of you,\" Stark's 'brother' commanded, a drop of sweat dripping from his forehead.\n\"Ok,\" Stark didn't mind and walked alongside the stranger.\nThe interior of the mansion was just as luxurious as the exterior, with lavish decorations and expensive furniture adorning every room. As Stark followed his \"brother\" through the halls, he couldn't help but feel a sense of detachment from it all.\nThis world, with its opulence and formality, seemed so different from the one he had come from.\nBut after being sent here as Rher's 'chosen one', he guessed he didn't have much of a choice.\nFinally, they arrived at a grand meeting room where the rest of the family was already assembled. Stark's parents, adorned in fine clothing and stern expressions, sat at the head of a long table.\nThe other family members, which were basically two other woman with red hair were sitting on the table as well.\nHis father had black hair and red eyes, while his mother had red hair and red eyes as well.\n\"Stark, you are fifteen years of age, and the 'Class Showcase' ceremony is in two days, yet you disturb everyone again?\" his father spoke before he could even sit down, his tone filled with authority.\n'…' Stark had to take in most of the information he would get during this meeting, after all he couldn't let it show that he didn't know anything, \"Hmm… yes very interesting father…\"\n\"Are you even taking this seriously?\" his father barked, \"It's already embarassing that us, a reknown family of 'soul wielders' are stuck with… you!\"\n\"My friends keep mocking me for having you as my brother,\" one of the red-haired girls got up and slammed her fists on the table, \"Can't you ever do something right?\"\n\"Interesting, sister, but I don't remember asking!\"\n\"YOU LITTLE SHIT,\" a red aura appeared around the girl, glowing immensely, \"That's why you get bullied!\"\n\"Calm down, honey,\" her mother stopped her from using her powers, then looked back at Stark, \"You attempted to kill yourself, sent one of your classmates to the hospital, and now are disrespecting your siblings?\" she glared at her son as if he was an animal.\nSince the moment Stark was born, he was already recognized as the weakest link of the family, the first words his mother uttered as he was born were \"useless\" and \"weak\" after all as she sensed he didn't have a single trace of magic in him.\nBut nonetheless, they kept him around since they believed that his powers would come out at a later age, and yet nothing.\n'Man… I don't know what is going on with the guy I got transmigrated into, but looks like his situation is tough…' Stark sighed.\nHis thoughts were wandering to all the things he could be doing at this moment to increase his chances of survival in this magic-oriented world, and although he had no idea what or who the threats were, he was still interested in knowing.\n\"Can I leave now?\" he blurted out, his mother and father had been talking for a good five minutes, but he hadn't listened as all they did was berate him, plus they wouldn't give him any info since it seemed the only time they talked was to insult him.\nOf course, under any normal circumstances, Stark would have stayed with his family to take advantage of their money and of the fact he could live in a mansion.\nBut no this time, since he had the feeling that staying in there was asking for death, and even more so when he stared at their eyes, they were cold, ready to kill him if he did anything wrong.\n[Stay if you have a death wish =)]\nEven a panel came to confirm what he suspected, and so that's why he wanted to leave.\nHis parents exchanged a disappointed look before nodding, acknowledging Stark's dismissal.\n\"Stark,\" suddenly, all his family members got up from their chair, \"I'll remind you one last time what makes you so different from us…\"\nAll of them put their right hand on the area of their body where their heart was located, and suddenly…\n~FWISH~\nDifferent colored and textured hearts appeared, one of them was yellow of color and had a lasso around it, another was red with pulsating veins.\nHis mother's was pink, with hearts surrounding it, while his father's was black, with occasional zaps of lightning.\n\"It's because you don't have the 'soul wielder' class that you are so different.\"\nAll of them seemed powerful, but Stark did wonder how any of this worked, and what all these 'classes' were about.\n\"Well… um… bye bye,\" Stark shrugged.\n\"Don't come back then,\" his father looked at him with determined eyes, almost confident his youngest son didn't have the balls to do any of this, he was always a scaredy-cat after all.\n\"Ok,\" Stark took the door out of 'meeting room' and after a few minutes found his way out of the mansion, \"Mannnnn~ Time to figure out what kind of world I'm in,\" he decided that going to his school was probably the best option.\nBack in the meeting room, which was mostly just the dinner room since that's where they ate, all of the family members were flabbergasted.\nHow could Stark change so much in just a day, just yesterday he was his same old self, did he have some kind of enlightenment?\n\"It's fine,\" the father calmed down the atmosphere, \"He is too weak to do anything, and he isn't going to survive the 'Class Showcase' anyway, way too many influential figures will be there and he is probably not even gonna participate… Plus we were already planning to kick him out.\"\nIt wasn't like they really cared anyway, without Stark in the picture, their family lineage would be perfect.\n***\n\"I worked as an accountant for three months, and it took me four years of studying and one year of internship to get to where I was, you think this will scare me?\" Stark exclaimed to himself, he had already slaved up at his job, so he didn't care much about any of these people.\nHe had just been dropped into this random world with no explanation, but he guessed it was part of the 'game' to discover whatever was happening.\nAnd Rher probably enjoyed seeing him struggle, that sadistic bastard.\n'Fuck you, Rher!' he internally shouted.\n~BAM~\nHe hit a middle-sized rock (that clearly wasn't there five seconds ago) and fell to the ground.\n\"FUCK YOU, RHER,\" he repeated while shielding his face, and this time nothing happened.\nBut it looked like this wasn't such an unfortunate event, because as soon as he got up, Stark noticed that a wallet had fallen off from his pants.\nHe was wearing some kind of school uniform currently, but there was only some golden sigil on it, nothing that could confirm the location of his school.\nA wallet on the other hand was everything he needed, plus, after noticing the wallet, he touched his other pocket and realized he also had a phone.\n\"YAHOO!\"\nHe opened the wallet, and inside were four things: his student card, a credit card, a debit card and a note reading: \"have fun exploring this world!\"\n'Soooo funny…' he groaned before tearing up the paper and grabbing the student card.\nApparently he was a student of the 'Lotus' academy, which was some middle school for supposed 'class' prodigies.\n'Bro definitely got in thanks to connections, no other way,' Stark smiled, after all wasn't he supposed to be classless, \"Oh! But that reminds me, can't I check my status window?\"\nThe paper that was on the ground suddenly formed back to its original state, and a giant 'yes' was written on the back.\n\"Status window, I guess, then…\"\nAnd surprisingly, it did work…",

The surrounding area was lush with greenery, with a large fountain at the center of the courtyard.\nThere was also a giant screen at the top, with many videos of students fighting one another being broadcasted for all passersby to see.\n'Huh…' Stark looked at his surroundings for a few seconds before deciding it was time to enter.\nThere seemed to be nobody around since school must have ended a few hours ago, but as the gates were still open, there was no reason to hesitate.\n\"Who's trying to enter at this hour?\" A muscular man with brown hair appeared from behind the gate as Stark tried to pass, and even he was surprised to see the black-haired classless boy, \"Stark? Why are you here?\"\n\"Library,\" he answered with no hesitation in his voice.\n\"Oh…\" the man scratched his head, even he seemed uncomfortable speaking to him, \"It's weird seeing you come back to school after it ended, but yeah… you do you…\"\nStark nodded, and as he made his way into the academy, he couldn't help but roll his eyes.\nThere was nobody in the luxurious looking hallways, but just the aura in the inside of the school made it obvious it wasn't one anyone could enter if they didn't have the power/connections to.\nHe just followed the signs that directed to the 'Library', and after a few minutes found himself in front of two wooden doors.\nHe pushed them open and was met with rows upon rows of towering bookshelves, each filled to the brim with ancient tomes and modern textbooks.\nStark wandered through the aisles, his fingers trailing along the spines of the books as he scanned the titles, and after a few minutes, he picked out three different ones.\n\"Classes for beginners\"\n\"Basic information about combat\"\n\"Important events of the world\"\n'I hope they give me the needed information…' he sat on one of the available tables with the three books.\nBut as he was ready to sit down, he turned his head to the left, noticing he wasn't the only one in the library.\n\"…\" A blonde-haired girl was staring at him with a confused expression on her face, almost as if she couldn't believe that he was here.\n\"What?\" before beginning his long lecture, he asked this question as he didn't appreciate that gaze on him.\nTaken aback, the girl immediately went back to reading the book between her hands, \"Hmft~ Nothing, don't get cocky!\"\n'What the fuck is wrong with people in this world,' he sighed before opening the first page of a book.\n***\n(A few hours later)\nAs the sun began to set, casting a warm golden glow over the landscape, Stark stretched his hands backwards, releasing a content sigh.\nThe third and final book was finished, and with it came a newfound understanding of his surroundings.\n\"Ah~ I guess it's a bit more clear now… huh…\"\nHe now understood what was happening around him, and how all of this came to be, but it would have honestly been better if Rher just told him beforehand.\nBasically…\nThe world he was in was named 'Rheria', with the country named Fellarburg being his current location.\nIn this world, every human possessed a unique power or ability known as a \"class\". It was these classes that set them apart from one another.\nBut Rheria was not without its dangers. Most of the outside world was infested with monsters, forcing the population to seek safety within the 28 countries scattered throughout the land.\nThese countries were immense in size, providing ample space for their inhabitants.\nThe reason for the sudden appearance of powers is unknown, but apparently it had always been like this since the beginning, no asteroids hitting the heart or sudden apparition of rifts/towers to other worlds…\nThis was just basic information.\nBut the things that interested Stark the most were…\nThe many classes that were present in this world.",

      "content": "After understanding the situation around this world, Stark immediately went to learn about the classes and powers that were available.\nInstead of the normal stuff where everyone could get their own skills and improve depending on what they choose to persue, this world was extremely different from the rest.\nBasically: there are 10 classes, and chosen individuals gets placed into one of them (or none if they don't meet the requirements), thus determining their abilities and destiny.\nThe classes are the same for everybody, but it is the inner talent and skills that make the difference.\nStark read more about these classes, and as he absorbed the information, he understood more and more why Stark's family seemed to judge him as incompetent.\nMost of the population don't unlock a class as it is something rare and for powerful individuals, but his family seemed to be one of 'soul wielders', while on the otherhand he was just one of the 'people'.\nIn this world, most people dream to get a class and become 'Classifiers', which is the name for people who fight monsters and have powers.\nAnd the ten classes of this world are…\n…\n[Magus:] master magicians with the power to control elements and cast powerful spells, the spells can be extremely different between each individual, making everyone unique in their own way.\n[Exorcist:] specialists in banishing evil/cursed spirits and curses, possessing abilities to purify their surroundings and protect others from malevolent forces (mainly fight demons and use divine power).\n[Beast Tamer:] able to summon and control beasts, both magical and mundane, they can create alliances with these creatures to aid in battle and exploration, the more powerful their beasts, the more powerful the tamer is.\n[Warrior:] One of the most common classes people get, but still a fairly powerful one as they possess incredible physical strength, durability, and combat skills. They specialize in close-quarters combat and have a wide variety of melee techniques at their disposal.\n[Assassin:] Skilled in stealth, sabotage, and assassination, they are masters of the shadows and can slip past guards undetected, silently eliminating their targets with a deadly precision.\n[Archer:] Specializing in the use of ranged weapons, primarily bows and arrows, they possess a high degree of accuracy and can strike from a distance with lethal force (strangely enough, apparently some of them use their abilities on guns).\n[Soul Wielder:] Ability to summon the power of your soul and materialize your heart in front of you, your abilities depend on your heart and willpower, it is one of the most mysterious classes and also one of the rarest ones.\n[Alchemist:] Able to create potions with different effects, they can both sell them or use them in battle to support others or themselves, potion effects can vary from individual to individual, allowing Alchemists to even fight in close-ranged combats with the right potions and ingredients.\n[Succubus/Incubus:] Control the desires of others through their charm and allure, they can drain energy from their victims through physical contact, although most people in this class use it for sex work and to enjoy a luxurious life since they are the most demanded people in dating/mariage.\n[???:] The last and final class has almost no information because of how rare it is, people who have it do not showcase its powers, the rarest class of them all.\n…\n'Yo, can I get the incubus class?' Stark asked, it would be really great if he could enjoy himself.\nBut of course, he got no response, taking it as a 'no'.\nDuring his entire stay in the library, Stark felt the stare of the blonde-haired girl on him as she would steal quick glances at him every few seconds under her book, then would act as if nothing was wrong when he turned his eyes toward her.\n'Welp, there's also that 'Class Showcase' thing that's coming up, really annoying and dangerous…'\nMany people would die during that event since they only wanted the 'best of the best' to be picked, but Stark had just come to this world and had no class, meaning he was probably at the top of the 'about to die' list.\n'I can always ditch it anyway,' he shrugged, although it would become difficult to find a place in this unknown world after.\nAnd as for how the event would go… well… he would need to see by himself during this fateful day.\n'Well, I guess that's it for today,' he sighed and got up from his seat.\nNoticing that the blonde-haired girl was still staring at him, he just smiled and headed toward the exit door.\nHe didn't know his relationship with her, so he didn't take any risks, being friendly wouldn't advantage him anyway, not after being almost killed and kicked out by his family from their home.\n\"Goodbye,\" he still spoke as to be respectful and then left.\nStark found a hotel nearby afterward, and thanks to the credit card he had, he was able to pay a room for the next few days, although he would need to pay them back at some point.\nHe didn't waste time as he got in his room and immediately went to bed, not even bothering to change as he didn't have any other clothes beside his uniform.\nStark was dropped to the bottom, classless, with no friends or allies, and now he would have to build himself back up.\n\"Yawn~\" he stared at the ceiling of his pitch black room, and slightly smiled, \"I guess i'll figure it out somehow…\"\nThis was how his first day in this new world went, and although he had only found the most basic of information and still had no power (because Rher was a narcissistic greedy bitch, I mean, the guy has the world based on his name), he was still confident in his abilities.\n***\n(The next day)\nWhen the sun began to appear in the sky, Stark opened his eyes.\nAlthough the 'Class Showcase' was tomorrow, he still needed to attend class apparently, it would help him pass the time and gather more info anyway, so he didn't care.\nHe took a shower and then wore back the same uniform while leaving his room, he didn't have a backpack, but honestly who cares.\n…\n[Skill: Class Wheel]\n[Type:] Chosen One (locked)\n[Description:] ???\n…\nHe inspected that panel while taking the walk to the school, but found nothing that indicated any way to unlock it, maybe it would come out later.\nOn the way to 'Lotus' Academy, he noticed many other people wearing the same uniform as him, although most of them either ignored his presence or when they looked at him had uncomfortable looks on their faces.\nHe entered the school but had a hard time finding his class (it took him one failed attempt for a teacher to tell him), and then he finally reached it.\n-Class 3A-\nThe door was opened as people were still entering, and so he did just like them.\nBut when he took the first step inside the class…\nAll eyes fell on him.\n\"Holy shit…\"\n\"He showed himself again?\"\n\"Does he have a death wish?\"\nSuch were the whispers that filled the room as Stark walked in.\nBut even in his past life, he wasn't the type to care about such things, so instead he just took a seat at back and glanced at the outside world from the window.\nAnd thus, his first day of class started.\n[Countdown before the 'Class Showcase: 1 day]",

Looks like I'll be entertaining myself today.\"\nStark raised an eyebrow and smirked, \"Well, if we're going to do this, let's get it over with.\"\nSensing that this wouldn't lead to anything good, one of the teachers, a woman with brown hair that reached her waist and a very voluptuous body put herself between the two boys.\n\"There is no need to continue this charade, just forget about it and go back home,\" she shouted, mainly glancing at Stark as she was sure he would lose.\nBut Daniel didn't care about any of this, and instead he mumbled, \"Duel request: Stark.\"\nAfter whispering those words, a crimson panel appeared in front of Stark.\n[Duel Request: Daniel]\n[Type: Deathless]\n[Y/N]\nWith a smirk on his face, Stark looked at the panel before responding, \"Y.\"\nImmediately, the panel vanished, and the students surrounding them fell silent.\nThe teacher, who was in the middle of the two boys, was ejected out of their circle in full force, then landed on the ground a few meters away.\nA giant sphere had formed around Daniel and Stark: this was the arena of the duel, and nobody would be able to disturb them in there.\n'Very game like, I wonder just how many more things like this will come up,' Stark scratched his chin.\n[Commentary from Rher: My guy, aren't you scared? You have no class and your stats are much weaker…?]\n'Nah, i'd win, plus i'm sure you wouldn't let me just die like this, would you?' he grinned.\n[…Yeah]\nA countdown then appeared above their 'arena'.\n[5…4…3…2…1…]\n[GO!]\nAnd right at the countdown ended, Stark got two notifications.\n~Ding~\n~Ding~\n…\n[New Skill: Perception]\n[Type:] Passive Skill\n[Level:] Cannot be upgraded since it is not combat related.\n[Description:] This skill is always active, and allows the user to check the name, level, class, attributes and skills of the person in front of them (also items).\n…\n'Nice,' Stark didn't waste time and immediately used it to check Daniel.\n[Name: Daniel Pridel]\n[Level: 12]\n[Class: Warrior]\n[HP: 1250]\n[Strength: 42]\n[Speed: 27]\n[Stamina: 64]\n[Defense: 107]\n[Skills: Strike; Force; Buff…]\n'Okay… he is definitely way stronger than me…' Stark was actually surprised the difference was this blatant.\nBut before Stark could even check out the second notification he had gotten, Daniel summoned his steel sword from thin air then dashed toward him.\nSeeing him come at him at full speed, Stark realized he wouldn't be able to avoid it like he did last time.\n'I have made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgment,' he was mainly speaking to Rher while smirking.\n[Do not fret, everything will be fine]\n~SLASH~\nDaniel used [Strike] and hit Stark in the stomach, causing him 374 points of damage, which was way more than his measly 10HP.",

With a newfound skill burning at his fingertips, he knew he had one final chance to turn the tables.\n'See, I told you I would get something,' Stark smiled.\n\"Class Wheel, activate!\" he whispered.\nAnd just like that, a giant colorful wheel appeared before him, each of its ten sections representing a class within this world, ranging from archer, to soul wielder to even incubus. It seemed to beckon to Stark, waiting for him to spin it and choose his fate.\nHovering next to the wheel was a pulsing level, adorned with the words \"pull me\" in bold letters.\n'Welp, here goes nothing,' Stark smiled and raised his injured arm to pull the lever down.\n~SPIN~\nAs the wheel began to spin, Stark looked up to see what he would get, it was basically like a gambling addiction except it would actually determine his entire future.\nThe wheel continued to spin, each colorful segment glowing brighter as it passed by, but nobody seemed to notice it, probably since it was only visible to the host.\nWhile spinning, Stark took the time to notice all the classes available.\n\"Magus, Exorcist, Beast Tamer, Warrior, Archer, Assassin, Soul Wielder, Incubus, Alchemist and… Domination?\" he had never read about a class named domination though, making him wonder if it was the ??? one that had little to no information.\nA simple red arrow at the top middle of the wheel would determine which class he would be getting.\nAnd after a few seconds… the wheel gradually began to slow down, making the pressure ten times as high.\n'Come on… incubus or soul wielder…' he repeated those two classes in his head as it was the ones he really wanted (don't ask him why he wanted incubus).\nWhen the wheel became slow enough for him to actively be able to read the names of the classes, he kept praying.\nAnd after a few seconds…\n~Fsssh~\n'Oh my god, it's heading toward soul wielder!'\nHe was calculating the outcome, and by the low speed and position of the sections, it was indeed going to stop on that class.\nAgaisn't all odds, the wheel stopped at the edge of soul wielder…\n'YES!' he laughed.\nBut of course, it was Stark, it was a given he wouldn't be lucky.\nThe wheel had in fact not stopped moving, its speed was just so low it became almost invisible to the naked eye, and so the section moved, resulting in the arrow to move past Soul Wielder and stop at…\n'Domination? Seriously?' he was frankly angry, he felt scammed, and wondered if he could get a second spin if he asked nicely enough.\n[The host will be able to spin the wheel and unlock a new class once they reach level 25]\n':('\n[Domination is a good class]\n':D'\nNot wanting to waste any seconds, Stark decided to check his class description, making sure Daniel was still paying attention only to the crowd.\n…\n[Class: Domination]\n[Description:] Each class has their strength and weaknesses, but this one is called 'domination' thanks to its ability, with enough training, to absolutely dominate all others, the rarest class of them all, but also the strongest.\n[Class Effect:] Your life will become a living hell.\n[Class Flaw:] The Domination Trial.\n[Class Weapon:] Fists and Magic.\n[Basic Skills:] Focus; Domination\n…\n'Thank you for the explanation my man, I understood absolutely NOTHING!'

He could feel the crowd's growing tension and shock, and the frustration welling up inside him.\nStark using his perception skill could see the amount of health Daniel had left.\n[HP:] 423/1250\nThis meant that the next person to hit the other would be declared the winner, making the pression between the two fighters grow even more.\n'Time to end this,' Stark smiled.\nDaniel on the other hand was losing it: he had always been considered one of the strongest in 'Lotus' Academy, and although he hadn't started his 'classifier' life yet, he was still fairly respected by all.\nGirls were all over him and boys didn't dare to defy him, no matter what he said.\nAnd yet… Stark, the one he always considered to be the weakest, was here, humiliating him in front of others.\n\"WIPE THAT SMIRK OFF YOUR FACE,\" he was actually going insane, and so without waiting no more, he dashed toward Stark.\n\":)\" Stark had indeed been smiling the whole time, enjoying the view as the boy that tried to kill him twice already was struggling.\nSurprisingly enough, the more Stark was in control of the situation, the brighter and stronger his aura was getting, and he did notice it.\n'I need to figure out how this works later…' he thought to himself.\n~SLASH~\nDaniel used both the [Buff] skill, which doubled his stats, and [Strike] to attack Stark.\nBut the black-haired boy saw it coming using Focus, closing his eyes as he avoided the second attack from Daniel, which missed its target again.\n\"YOU-\"\nStark saw the window of opportunity as Daniel was still recovering from his failed strike.\nHe crouched in front of the 180cm tall boy, then focused all his aura into his right hand for this final attack.\nAnd then…\n\"CYA!\" Stark, with sweat pouring down his forehead, laughed again.\nDaniel's eyes widened as he saw Stark below him, positioned in a way that indicated he was about to attack from below.\nHe couldn't see the aura around Stark, but all his senses screamed for him to run away or abandon the duel now.\n\"HELP-\" he tried to scream, but nobody would be able to hear him from this distance, plus most of them were so focused on the fight they couldn't hear him speak.\n\"But nobody came,\" Stark answered as he was the only one that heard his pleads.\n~BAM~\nStark with a sudden movement began uppercuting Daniel in the chin, and of course, the clueless 15 year old wasn't able to do anything against such a fast attack.\n\"-1281!\"\nDaniel was sent flying against the edge of the arena, hitting it in full force as he received the entirety of his life in that singular attack.\n[HP:] 0/1250\nAnd this meant…\n[Winner: Stark Heartsouls]\n\"Playboys like you need to stay put and learn their places!\" he smiled.\nGiant green text appeared above the arena for everyone to see, but most of them were too shocked to even say anything, unable to comprehend the scene before them.\nStark, THE WEAK STARK, had just beaten Daniel?\nSome even rubbed their eyes, thinking that it must be a joke.\nBut everything was reality, and once the transparent sphere that kept the two fighters safe from other people's interruptions disappeared, many students and teachers went to check on Daniel.\nMany thought that he would get up and get angry like usual, or maybe shout at the teachers.\nBut no…\nThe type of this duel was 'Deathless', meaning that the two would fight to the death, then be revived afterward, it is like some sort of 'all in' fight where people could use all their powers without risking death\nAnd that meant…\n\"He is just unconscious…\" one of the teachers announced after checking his pulse, after all a deathless match meant even if your HP dropped to zero, you wouldn't die.\nAnd so right after the news, all eyes fell on Stark.\n\"Why are you all so surprised? Of course the main character would beat the tutorial boss, wouldn't he?\" he grinned, confident that what he did was good.\n[You are not a main character, and this isn't a tutorial boss, but whatever, good job!]\nMaybe hiding his powers was the better move in the long term since most wouldn't suspect the poor little Stark to have any classes, and maybe even believe that the first damage he had caused to Daniel was luck, but now that he had beaten him, there was absolutely no doubt there was something strange going on.\n'Oh well… I usually loved to boast about my work at my company, so it doesn't matter,' he had taken his personality as an office worker to this new world.\n[You have absolutely destroyed that fool \"Daniel Pridel\", gaining 1471 experience points!]\n[Experience: 1000/1000]\nStark was enveloped in a golden glow as he noticed that he had reached the needed amount of experience to level up.\nBeating someone in a duel would of course mean some sort of reward (or else people might just abuse them to train), and in this case Stark had effectively stolen some of Daniel's experience, although not much since he hadn't killed him.\n[Your level has increased to level 2, granting you one skill point and boost in stats]\n[Current level: level 2]\n[Experience: 471/5000]\n'Nice, seems like everything works out in the end, this is what I call a good ending,' Stark was happy with himself.\nBut once he looked away from his screen panels to check his surroundings, he noticed all the surprised, scared, and astonished gazes on him.\n\"What?\" he asked, taking all of them aback.",

      "content": "Everyone in the courtyard, both students and teachers alike, knew the sight of someone's level going up since they experienced it at least once, or because they had seen someone else online.\nBut what scared them the most in this situation, was the fact the first time Stark had level up was from beating up Daniel in a duel, and he didn't even seem to care.\nAmidst the stunned silence, a few whispers began to ripple through the crowd, their voices barely above a whisper.\n\"A monster…?\"\n\"What the fuck just happened?\"\n\"Daniel got beaten?\"\nStark was slightly tired from the encounter, and sensing that his first day of school had been greatly spent improving his abilities, he decided that it was time to head back home.\n[Good job, now everyone knows about your 'powers']\n'I don't think anyone is gonna expect me to be from the domination class though as it is so rare…'\n[…Fair enough]\n\"Yawn~\" Stark stretched his arms, \"But wait… doesn't that mean I wouldn't have died even if he killed me?\"\nHe just understood what 'deathless' meant, yet in the end decided it didn't matter whether Daniel would be revived or not, he had done his part.\nBut as soon as he took the first step toward the exit…\n\"Huh…?\" his pupils started burning, as if they were set on fire, resulting in him putting his hands over his eyes.\n\"AAAAAAAAA-\" he was screaming, taking aback everyone, his entire body surrounded by a crimson aura.\nUsing his quick thinking to try and find an explanation to what the hell was happening, Stark's mind immediately went toward the information he had acquired in the books from the library.\nHis body was still burning, the aura now spread throughout everything, even his hair feeling like it was set on fire.\n[Information about classes: when someone awakens a class, they will, in most cases, immediately collapse because of the power they just acquired, the duration of sleep completely depends on the person, but it is said the faster a person wakes up, the stronger their class and potential is (although that doesn't mean they will be the strongest)]\n[Some people actually fail their awakening even after unlocking their classes, making them just like the rest of people, and some don't even wake up since their potential or mana is just too low]\n[Additional info: it has been recorded that the world record for fastest awakening (which is currently held by Miss.Catherine, also named 'The Dragon Tamer') is of one day and three hours.]\nThe fact Stark stayed up long enough to finish the battle was already a miracle.\n'But wait… doesn't that mean there is a big chance I miss the 'Class Showcase' if I don't wake up…?' Stark thought as he fell to his knees, the pain had become quite numb now, but his mind was screaming for him to just close his eyes and succumb to the tiredness.\nAnd so he did.\nHe collapsed to the ground in front of everyone's surprised gazes.\n***\n(3 hours later)\n\"…\"\nAs Stark opened his eyes, the fiery aura surrounding him slowly dissipated, completely seeping into his body for him to use.\nMeaning that he had indeed been capable of acquiring the 'domination' class, but it wasn't unexpected either since he had already been capable of using it.\nAs he checked his surroundings, he noticed he was located in some sort of infirmary, the sun was beginning to go down, but he guessed that it was still the afternoon.\n\"How long has it been?\" this was his biggest worry, after all, he really wanted to participate during the class showcase as it would allow him to gain more power.\n\"Around three hours,\" a feminine voice answered his question.\n\"Oh, well, I guess it's fine, WAIT WHAT,\" he turned his gaze toward a chair located to his bed side, and there sat the blonde-haired girl he saw at the library yesterday.\n\"…\"\nLooking up close, she was extremely beautiful, and most girls would be jealous of her impressive figure, but Stark wasn't interested in any of that for now.\nHe immediately got out of the bed he had been resting on.\n\"I carried you here by myself since nobody wanted to touch you, but it seems like it wasn't bad,\" she was reading a book while talking to him.\n'Is she expecting some kind of reward for helping me out…? Or maybe a favor from me in the future?' Stark felt like receiving such kindness out of nowhere was extremely weird.\n[Outstanding determination, only three hours sleeping after an awakening? I might have made the right decision picking you]\n'Oh yeah that's true, although she doesn't look surprised…' he was talking about the girl beside him.\n[Most people wouldn't even believe you if you told them you awakened in three hours, so they must believe it's just a coma after exhausting yourself with Daniel]\n'WAIT, DOES THAT MEAN?'\n[Yes, although you have shown incredible power, many people think you cheated or got the luckiest battle of your life]\n\"HOW DOES THAT EVEN MAKE SENSE,\" he shouted, absolutely furious his efforts were reduced to mere 'luck', even in his past, Stark really enjoyed being praised.\n\"Huh?\" the blonde-haired girl looked at him as though he was crazy.\n\"Nothing,\" he began heading toward the exit of the infirmary, and the girl that was sitting on the chair didn't even bother to glance at him.\nAnd then, he left…\nAs soon as he closed the door behind him though, the girl that had taken care of him for the past hours closed down the book between her hands and let out a deep sigh.\n\"What the hell was that?\" she kept thinking about the feeling she had gotten while carrying Stark here, it was an unexplainable power that was emitting from him.\n\"Pfft~ cheater, investigate him!\"\n\"Maybe he used the power he would get during his entire life for that?\"\nShe heard such talk from others, but deep inside, she felt like this couldn't be it, there was no way someone could do 800 points of damage out of nowhere.\nAlthough she didn't believe he had gotten a class either since he hadn't awakened all this time, plus he was sleeping only for three hours, which was a day below the world record, but maybe it was something else?\n\"Well…\" after waiting five minutes, she got up from her seat and began heading toward the exit, \"the beginning of our classifiers lives is tomorrow, so I need to be full of energy and mana to make sure everything is fine…\"",

      "content": "Stark woke up in the morning feeling refreshed, he just had gotten the best night of sleep ever, even in his previous life he couldn't sleep much because of work, but everything in here seemed fine.\nExcept for the fact 5 seconds later he remembered that today was the 'big' day.\nNot only was it his graduation ceremony from 'Lotus' Academy, but this also meant he would have to participate in this 'Class Showcase' event to continue his life in this world.\nHe had absolutely no way of knowing what could happen there except for the book he had read two days ago, but he had the overall gist of it.\nHe took a shower, ate some food he had bought from a convenience store nearby, then left, yet again with the same school uniform.\nOnce outside, he remarked that many people weren't wearing his school uniform, instead opting for armors and clothes with powerful materials (at least for their levels), they also didn't have their usual backpacks, instead they were carrying ones filled with items, and also had their weapons in hand, showing them to others.\nSome had small animals/creatures on their shoulders (beast tamer), while others had a wooden cross in hand (exorcist).\nStark on the other hand had nothing, his only weapon were his fist, and he would make sure to beat up everything in his way, he was especially angry after yesterday since most people didn't even consider his performance yesterday as legit.\n***\nOnce in front of the school gates, he saw text written on the giant screen at the top of the academy.\n[Head to the gymnasium if you are a third year]\nFollowing the crowd of people, he found himself in front of the giant building, many teachers beside the doors to welcome the students.\nThere were at least three hundred people inside the gymnasium, all third years who would participate in the 'Class Showcase' and hopefully become stronger.\nAnd after a few minutes inside, minutes where the atmosphere was filled with talking and flexing, the doors of the gymnasium closed, and all the lights went off.\nSuddenly, everything became silent as all the students were looking at the stage that had been set.\nThe 'Class Showcase' wasn't the only interesting part about this whole ordeal, it was also the fact that the group 'Golden Dragons' would be the ones to explain the event and bring them there.\nGolden Dragons are a mercenary group specialized in the development of the youth, with the sole goal of making the new classifiers stronger and increasing their chances of survival in the 'rifts'.\nObviously, all their members were extremely powerful and famous, many of them envied by many.\n'…' Stark stared at stage with a blank expression, and a few seconds later…\n~FLASH~\nFive golden pillars of light appeared on it, and what came out of them were three men and two women, each with their respective outfits and weapons in hand, all looking powerful.\n\"Oh my god!\"\n\"Is that Yuli, the heart master?\"\n\"And that's Alex, the ice magus!\"\nWhile most people were amazed by their sudden appearance, the one in the middle, a man in his mid-forties with short white-hair as well as a monocle cleared his throat, resulting in the entire gymnasium to go silent.\n\"Today is a big day for all of you, it is the start of your lives as classifiers,\" he began his speech, his voice filled with authority, \"I know many have only been dreaming of this moment all this time, but do not forget that fighting is not a game, and that you will truly be risking your lives today.\"\nNext to him, a woman with long blue hair and magnificent ocean-colored eyes stared at the students, a staff in her hand, \"The rift you will be going to today, as most of you know, is a beginner level one called 'City Ruins', the recommended level is 5 to 15, so it is advised to be within that range, but i'm sure most of you already are!\"\n\"Wait a damn second,\" Stark stopped for a few seconds to check his status.\n[Level:] 2\n'…' he shrugged, 'Oh well…'\n\"You, as well as many other recognized middle schools from Fellarburg will be participating in this event, as you may all know, the best performing people will probably have all eyes on them, so I advise you to try your best, while also making sure not to die, there is no second life after all,\" the man in the middle continued, a bittersweet smile on his face, a sign that he had seen hundreds of people die already in front of him.\nThrough the books he had read, Stark realized that there wasn't just one academy in Fellarburg, instead there were dozens of them, each of them specialized in their own classes or future professions.\nMeaning that most of the population that wanted to improve their skills without going to an academy would need to move away, be scouted by a powerful teacher/guild, or just keep going solo/creating a party.\nAnd so just like that, the Golden Dragons' speech ended.\nFollowing that, the students inside the gymnasium were guided toward several buses that were set outside the school to guide them toward the first rift.\nRifts in this world are basically like dungeons where monsters and items spawn, they are a portal to other worlds, and each of the recognized ones are classed by level and difficulty.\nThere are seven difficulties: Beginner, Novice, Advanced, Hell, Nightmare, Determination, Death.\nThankfully enough, the first one was only a beginner level with a 5-15 level requirement.\nBut this didn't mean this was easy, far from that, it was only the first one they would need to go through, and even then, many will succumb to the monsters.\nWithout delay, all students boarded a bus heading towards Leforia, which is located southeast to Fellarburg.\nAs they drew closer to Leforia, all the students inside the vehicles felt a surge of excitement, and even Stark wasn't spared from that.\nFor many, it was the first time they were going to get first-hand experience in combat as most only got to their levels using their wealth.\n'Pay to win bullshit…' Stark groaned as he looked out the window, the seat beside him was empty as no one wanted to sit next to him.\nThe bus journeyed on, and before long, they reached their destination.\nWhen they did, the sun had already begun descending, announcing the fact the afternoon was soon to end.\nThey were now just outside what was called the 'safe zone', every single rift was outside of it, making it impossible for anyone to go without at least risking their lives just a bit.\nNot far from them, many corpses of decaying creatures eliminated by the Golden Dragons were resting, making everyone realize the extent of what they were going to do from now on.\n\"If anyone wants to give up, speak now or silence yourself forever!\" Oliver, the leader of the Golden Dragons spoke, \"There will be no help inside the rift, and I can promise you way too many new classifiers die before even completing it.\"\nBut nobody spoke, they had gone too far to give up now, plus it was either completion and improvement, or the risk of being disowned or kicked out of their family home.\nIn front of the students was a giant ruin, obscured by a dark aura everyone could sense, no matter their levels.\nIt was the [City Ruins] dungeon!\nNoticing no one was moving, Oliver smiled, \"It is great to see such determination, you may now do whatever you feel is right.\"\nAnd just like that, they were allowed to move around now.\n'…' Stark stared at the ruins before him, a face full of excitement, 'Welp, it's now or never, who cares if they don't believe in my capabilities, I don't need them anyway…'",

      "content": "As soon as the Golden Dragons and all other adults disappeared using some intricate spells, all that was remaining around the ruins were students from many different middle schools, making their numbers range in the thousands.\nInstantly, the surroundings became alike to some kind of market or guild, many people asking for others to create a party with them, and others selling items they brought just for this occasion.\nStark on the otherhand wasn't asked to join any party, and no one even tried to sell him anything.\nBut he didn't mind, he only smiled at the sight of all these people try their hardest.\n'It's fine… because I have my incredible system!'\n[Commentary from Rher: you don't have a system, you have to work just as hard if not harder than them or you'll just die]\n'…'\nStark was one of the first people to approach the entrance of the [City Ruins] and entering it.\nAs he passed through the dungeon entrance, it felt like his consciousness was slapped.\nAnd when he opened his eyes, he found himself in another world.\nThe sun was burning bright in the sky, and instinctively, Stark looked up to check it out.\nBut…\n'Huh?' the sun wasn't normal, not at all, it didn't have its orangeish color, instead…\nIt was completely black, casting not its usual light on the world below, but an eerie darkness that made it just enough to see.\nHis [Perception] skill automatically activated as he looked at it.\n[Black Sun: Capable of transforming dead humans into monsters, the power of its rays slowly but surely infects others, so it is recommended to always be on the lookout]\n[Tip: look for a bonfire every now and then]\nStark then switched his attention from the sun to his surroundings, and he immediately understood why it was called the [City Ruins].\nThe entire area was covered in broken and decaying buildings, as well as abandoned cars, the ruins of a once-great city.\nPiles of rubble and debris filled the streets, and the air was heavy with the stench of decay and the absence of life.\nShadows hid all sorts of lurking threats, and the silence was broken only by the distant sound of battle.\nStark took a deep breath, feeling the tension building in his chest. This was the first challenge he would need to face in this world, and no one would be here to help him, so he would need to solo this dungeon by himself.\nThis meant more danger, but also more rewards and experience point, and he was ready to take that risk.\nWith a determined nod, Stark set off into the ruins, his eyes scanning the surroundings for any signs of danger.\nHe was getting ready to encounter his first monster and see if he was truly capable of dealing with all the shit in this world.\nAfter all, fighting a human was one thing, but fighting monsters with unexplainable appearances was something he had only seen in novels.\nIt didn't take long for him to encounter his first ever monster in this world though.\nAs he walked through the seemingly empty streets of the ruined city, he heard noise in front of him, and suddenly, three creatures appeared from behind a corner.\n[Name: Decaying Corpses (Black Sun curse)]\n[Level: 6]\n[HP: 850]\n[Strength: 32]\n[Stamina: 192 (they don't get tired easily)]\n[Speed: 8]\n[Defense: 28]\n[Skills: Infect; Bite]\n'850 HP…' Stark repeated, his eyebrows raised, it was extremely tough even for a level 6 monster, not that he knew anyway.\nPlus, the thing that worried him the most was the fact that he could only use his fists as weapons, meaning he would have to approach them no matter what.\nThankfully enough, their speed was extremely low, and their defense not so great either.\nAnd so without hesitation, he focused his thoughts on the battle ahead.\n\"Domination, activate!\" he whispered the words, and suddenly the same aura that had aided him against Daniel surrounded his legs and hands.\nNot wanting to waste time, Stark dashed at the monsters, and before they could even attack…\n~SLAM~\n\"-928!\"\nHe hit the first one in the head, causing it to die with a single attack.\nIt was an instant-kill.\nSurprised, Stark backed away to look at his fist again, it was still surrounded by that aura, but it shone brighter than before, a sign that he was starting to dominate the battle.\nWithout any delay, Stark charged at the remaining two Decaying Corpses.\nThey were caught off guard by his sudden attack, and the aura in his fists dealt massive damage to both of them.\n\"-953! -856!\" Stark punched them in quick succession, eliminating the last two monsters with ease.\nThe air was heavy and still, the devastated street silent once more.\nStark examined the bodies of the Decaying Corpses, his eyes narrowing as he noticed a strange symbol inscribed on them.\n'What is this, some sort of mark left by the curse of the Black Sun?' he wondered, his curiosity piqued, but eventually didn't put much more thought into it as he would need to keep going if he didn't want to get ambushed.\n[You have slain three \"decaying corpses lvl6\", gained 1800EXP!]\n'Phew…' He sighed, it would have been devastating if he failed to even defeat a single one of the weaker monsters, but thankfully he was able to deal massive amounts of damage, almost crossing the 1000 mark.\nHe continued his way through the streets as he was officially now in the area where monsters would constantly appear to stop him.\nHe also felt the rays of the black sun on him, but luckily they didn't seem to affect him, yet.\nOn his way, he encountered more decaying corpses and even some 'cursed dogs', the same symbol was on them when he inspected their dead bodies.\n[You have slain two \"decaying corpses lvl6\", gained 1200EXP]\n[You have slain four \"cursed dogs lvl7\", gained 2884EXP]\nEach of these horrifying creatures were extremely fast, enough to almost take Stark by surprise the first time he encountered them, but thankfully enough he was able to avoid them quite easily when his eyes were on them.\nTheir HP was also lower than the decaying corpses, allowing him eliminate them in one hit too.\n[Your level has increased to level 3, granting you one skill point and boost in stats]\n[Experience: 1355/10000]\nHe hadn't paid much attention to it before, but he realized he had gotten something called 'skill points', and so he wanted to check what they were.\n…\n[Skill Points]\n[Description: Able to allocate one to upgrade a skill by one level, once used, it is impossible to get them back, so make sure to use them wisely]\n[In Inventory: 2]\n…\n'Hm…' he thought, 'well, I guess can try that…'\nBut right as he was about to try, he heard a heart wrenching scream behind him.",

Bite]\nStark once using his [Perception] skill on her noticed that her stats were much different than the other 'decaying corpses', possibly because she was an actual human transformed by the black sun instead of an already made monster.\n'Almost feels like i'm about to kill a real girl…' Stark squinted his eyes, but his determination didn't falter, after all he didn't know about the duel's 'deathless' type when he fought Daniel, fully expecting him to die.\nStark's domination power came from the fact he was confident/determined and that he would dominate his battles, a simple disorienting thought like this meant his power would be reduced.\nWith a furrowed brow, Stark focused on the task ahead, calculating the timing of his attacks to maximize efficiency.\nHe dashed at the six decaying corpses, his fists glowing with the same power that had helped him dominate the other fights.\nIt was extremely reckless to fight literal zombies that could transform you into one of them with a single bite of their mouths with your fists, but he didn't have any other choice.\nHe jumped in the air and smashed the transformed girl's head with both his fists.\n\"-1249!\"\nHer head was crushed by the attack, and she immediately fell to the ground.\n\"Rest in peace,\" Stark nodded before using the girl's body as a jump pad toward a second monster.\n\"-938!\"\n\"-858!\"\n\"-873!\"\nAfter a few hits, Stark was able to eliminate every monster that stood in his way.\nBy the end, he whipped the sweat off his forehead and smiled as it looked like he was actually capable of taking on this much monsters if he managed his movements well enough.\n[You have slain five \"decaying corpses lvl6\", gained 3000EXP!]\n[You have slain \"Illay Mondel (cursed) lvl9\", gained 1282EXP!]\n[Experience: 5637/10000]\nHe surveyed the street once more, picking up on the faint whispers of darkness in the air, but thankfully enough, there wasn't anyone around here anymore, no monsters, no humans.\nIt had been around ten minutes since he entered the rift after all, so most people were still probably forming parties.\nStark planned to move on to the next area, but right as he was about to…\nHe noticed a faint glow beside the 'decaying corpses' bodies.\n'…?' he was cautious, but when he saw something shining, Stark's brain immediately knew he wanted to check it out.\nApproaching the source of the faint glow, he noticed it coming from a staff on the ground.\nIt was emitting a faint blue light, unlike the dark aura that lingered around the decaying corpses.\nCuriosity piqued, he picked up the magic staff, using [Perception] to inspect it.\n…\n[Item:] Low-Level Magic Staff\n[Type:] Staff\n[Class:] Magus\n[Tier:] Common\n[Required Level:] 7\n[Quality:] Bad\n[Attributes:] None\n[Special Perks:] None\n…\n'Hmm…' Stark observed the staff, and after reading about the information, he wanted to try something.\nHe held the staff with both hands, and then tried to pour his aura at the tip.\nBut right as he tried to do that…\n[You cannot use this weapon with your current class]\nSuch a panel appeared in front of him.\nStark frowned and looked at the staff in his hands, then sighed, \"I guess I can just sell it, I hope…\"\n\"Spatial Inventory,\" he whispered these words, and suddenly, a void appeared beside him.\nIt seemed a bit small to fit the staff, but once he tried to put it inside, the hole grew in size, enough to accomodate for staff's size.\nInstantly, the staff disappeared into his spatial inventory, and Stark let out a breath of relief.\nIt seemed like monsters were able to occasionally drop items, although it was rare, and the fact the human girl was just transformed increased his odds of getting her staff.\nStark had no idea about the value of any of these items, but it didn't matter, he would take everything with him, whether it was useful or not to his fights wasn't important as he could sell all of it.\nMoney was a big problem for him as he didn't have any.\nAnd just like, Stark kept moving.\nHe was more advanced than almost all others participants of the \"City Ruins\" rift, going solo was risky, but it seemed like he was one of the only ones who went alone that survived, all others were too weak and at a disadvantage against this many monsters.\n'Oh yeah… the skill points,' he immediately remembered about his idea before being interrupted by the group of 'decaying corpses', and so he opened his status window.\n[Name:] Stark Heartsouls\n[Level:] 3\n[Health:] 100/100\n[Bloodline:] Human\n[Class:] Domination\n[Info about class:] The first Domination Trial is coming soon, be ready…\n'What the?' he raised his eyebrows, this wasn't here before, but quickly moved on.\n[Talent:] Chosen one\n[Attributes:] Strength 9;

He reached out and picked one of the cards at random.\nAs he did, the card flipped over to reveal its front, showing a picture of a glowing fist.\n…\n[Skill: Aura Smash]\n[Type: Uncommon]\n[Level: 1]\n[Description: Unleash a devastating punch that deals damage based on the amount of aura used, it is perfect for ranged enemies, and has a 30% chance to stun the target, cooldown of 30 seconds between each use]\n…\nStark's eyes widened as he read the description. This could potentially be a game changer, especially if he was able to stun his enemies first, plus he was already beginning to think that fighting hands-to-hands with enemies that can infect him was bad.\nBelow the skill description was some sort of stickman animation, the stickman which represented Stark focusing his aura in his hand before throwing a punch, and a giant crimson fist of aura launching itself toward some enemies.\n[Aura Smash has been added to your skill list]\n'I'll have to try that later, huh…'\nHe kept going, but of course not before using his skill point.\n[You have upgraded 'Aura Smash' to level 2!]",

The fire was so large that it lit up the entire street, casting a warm and safe glow upon the surroundings, different from the darkness.\n'A bonfire…?' he made sense of what it was when he was close enough.\nBut his view wasn't his only sense that was being triggered right now, his ears too.\nHe heard a faint music, and a voice singing in the direction of the bonfire?\n'Humans? Are these guys dumb, they are going to attract monsters!' he began running in the direction of the bonfire, it was only a kilometer in front of him, so not that far.\n[You have slain a \"Ghoul lv11\", gained 1500EXP!]\n[You have slain a \"Shadow Figure lv10\", gained 1300EXP!]\nOn his way, he had to kill some monsters, but they didn't even put a dent on him.\nHe was now only 100 meters away from the bonfire.\n~Laling Lalang~\nThe music intensified as he approached, now able to hear another person sing alongside it.\n\"And when the fire of your heart burns~ Nothing will be left for them to take~\"\nOnly 50 meters.\n\"The light at the end is growing~ And it transcends everything I know~\"\nAs he approached the 10 meters mark, the heat from the roaring bonfire licked at Stark's skin.\nHe could feel the warmth enveloping him, creating a sense of safety and comfort that he had not felt in a long time.\nAnd suddenly, as if entering a different realm, Stark felt at ease for the first time.\n\"Oy~ Looks like someone else joined us!\" one of the boys sitting on the ground next to the bonfire called out with a smile.\nHis short brown hair was ruffled and a scar adorned his right eye. In his hands, he held a yukulele which he had been playing to lift the mood.\nBeside him sat another boy with black hair and a blank expression. He had been singing along with an unchanging expression this whole time, his magic staff resting beside him.\n\"Didn't expect someone else to come here so soon, and alone at that!\" the yukulele player nodded in agreement, almost as if he was acknowledging Stark's strength.\n\"What is this…?\" Stark asked, confused, he had felt a shiver run down his spine once he approached the bonfire, a feeling of safety taking over him.\n\"Hm… it's weird that you don't know, but I might as well use my knowledge to help ya~\" the brown-haired man got up and brushed off the dirt from his ass , then pointed at the bonfire, \"This thing is the halfway point of the rift, it serves as a landmark.\"\n\"Hm,\" Stark nodded.\n\"But that's not all,\" he smiled, \"You see that sun above you right?\"\n\"The Black Sun?\"\n\"Yep yep,\" he nodded, \"The more you stay under it, the more cursed you are.\"\nAnd just as he said, when Stark thought about the black sun curse, a panel appeared in front of him.\n[Black Sun Curse: 74%]\nBut right as he saw that…\n[Black Sun Curse: 73%]\n'It's going down?'\n\"The bonfire allows you to remove the black sun curse from your body, that's why the two of us are waiting!\"\n\"Oh well… I hope you don't mind if I join you then,\" Stark kneeled down to sit on the ground, then quickly noticed that there were several monsters beside them, so he immediately got up and prepared himself to fight.\n\"They won't attack, they can't attack when you are near the bonfire…\" the black-haired boy spoke for the first time.\n\"What's your name by the way,\" the yukulele player asked.\n\"…\" Stark thought for a second, giving his real name wouldn't be beneficial, especially if they knew he was THE Stark, \"Stalk,\" he answered on a whim.\n\"What a weird name…\" he laughed, \"The name's Kent, and the gloomy guy beside me is Bill!\"\nAnd just like that, Stark sat on the ground beside the bonfire, waiting for the curse of the Black Sun to go before he could continue.\nAfter all, Stark did not plan to stick together with anyone, he would take the boss by himself.",

Stark wondered, but of course didn't say that out loud.\n\"Then you must already be cured from the black sun curse, aren't you?\" Stark continued, \"Why are you here?\"\nKent grinned, clearly enjoying the conversation. \"Well, Stalk,\" he said, using Stark's made-up name, \"Look to your right!\"\nStark did as he was told, and in the distance he could see a wall of silver fog that took up the entire street, impossible to see beyond it.\n\"That's the entrance to the mini-boss area, every classifier must traverse it and defeat the monster there, whether in group or solo,\" Kent pointed at it, \"We don't want to risk it as mini-bosses are stronger than normal enemies, so we're waiting for more people!\"\nAlthough these guys had the strength to come here all by themselves, making them almost equal to Stark in term of power, they were still not delusional enough to attempt to defeat a mini-boss by themselves.\n\"Hm…\" Stark grinned as in comparison to them, he was actually crazy enough to take on the challenge.\n[Black Sun Curse: 0%]\nHe was completely cured from the curse, but that's not all.\n[HP: 400/400]\nIt seemed like the bonfire also had healing properties, allowing him to be healed.\n'Almost feels like a checkpoint before a boss battle,' Stark smiled, 'Unfortunately enough for me though, there are no second chances…'\nAfter discussing with Kent and Bill a bit more, he decided that it was time.\n\"I think i'll go ahead by myself,\" he spoke, getting up from his seat.\nKent and Bill looked at each other with widened eyes before looking back at Stark, \"Are you sure? I mean, this is basically suicide…\"\n\"I think i'll be fine, if I just sit around and wait for people to help me, then it wouldn't help me in the future, i'd rather risk my life and become stronger by myself,\" he shrugged as he left the bonfire space, now allowing monsters to sense and attack him.\n[You have slain three \"Decaying Corpses lv10\", gained 3300EXP!]\n[You have slain two \"Cursed Hounds lv11\", gained 2900EXP!]\nSeeing him fight up close, Kent and Bill were surprised, they had never heard of someone fight with their fists, even alchemists needed to use potions and items to fight after all.\nAnd yet the numbers that were displayed each time Stark hit an enemy were undeniable.\n\"-1927!\"\n[You have slain a \"Ghoul lv11\", gained 1500EXP]\nRight as he reached the edge of the giant silver fog wall, a golden glow envelopped his body.\n[Your level has increased to level 6, granting you one skill point and boost in stats]\n[Experience: 1300/35000]\nHe was ready to enter it, but right as he was about to, he heard a voice from behind.\n\"GOOD LUCK!\" Kent shouted, then gave him a thumbs up, \"I hope to see you another time, Stalk!\"\nStark grinned, he didn't know this guy either, but he couldn't deny he was interesting.\n\"Goodbye,\" he whispered before traversing the fog.\n[You have entered the mini-boss area, there is no going back from here]",

It is advised for you to go back!]\nBut Stark didn't care, and he pushed through the fog, traversing it after a few seconds and now able to see normally again.\n'Holy…' he opened his eyes, and took notice of his surroundings.\nHe found himself in a desolate area filled with decaying corpses, the ground littered with bones and moss that seemed to have grown over everything.\nHe was still in the ruined city as buildings were still around, but the overall atmosphere was different.\n'Am I in the luxury district?' the buildings looked more luxurious than before, and some abandoned jewelry and design clothes stores and could be seen.\n[Level 15 area \"Advanced District\" entered]\n'Hm,' Stark began walking through the district, looking around for any signs of monsters or of the mini-boss.\nMeanwhile…\nHigh above a building, a grotesque creature with jagged wings, sharped talons, and glowing eyes watched Stark's entrance into the district.\nIt was the mini-boss, the 'Feathered Scourge', a demonic creature that ravaged the luxury district, feeding on the souls of the dead and twisting the environment to its liking.\nBut do not be mistaken, it is also under the control of the Black Sun.\nBelow, Stark continued to explore the district, trying to ignore the growing sense of dread as he pushed forward. He had no idea what awaited him, but he was determined to face whatever came his way.\nAnd after a minute or two of that… the creature decided it was time to start the battle, thinking more people would come.\nThe creature leaped silently toward Stark from the building, its wings giving it an incredible amount of speed, and its claws ready to kill the boy.\n'What's that noise…' Stark mumbled as he heard the small flapping of the wings, and instinctively looked up, just to see the giant creature coming at him from above, \"HOLY SHIT!\"\nFocusing most of his aura around his legs, Stark used some last second decision and jumped out of the attack's way.\n~CRASH~\nHe had luckily been able to avoid the attack, but…\n\"-382!\"\nEven that wasn't enough to stop him from being injured as the after shock of the scourge's smash attack managed to send him flying against a nearby building.\n[HP: 118/500]\n'Fucking hell, one more attack and i'm done for…' Stark immediately got up and readied his fists, intense aura pouring out from them as he analyzed his opponent.\nThe mini-boss was at least five meters tall, had massive jagged white wings emerging from its back, a mouthless head with only yellow eyes looking down on him, and long legs and arms that could do a lot of damage to anyone who came in contact with them.\n[Name: Feathered Scourge (Rift MINI-BOSS)]\n[Level: 15]\n[HP: 25000]\n[Strength: 281]\n[Stamina: 738]\n[Speed: 372]\n[Defense: 182]\n[Skills: Wing Dive, Feint Strike, Soul Syphon, Eye Curse, Hellfire, Divine Strike]\n'Defense is low… that might be the key to beating it,' it had an enormous amount of HP, and it would take Stark at least 13 hits to kill it, but the fact he would only attack with his fists against such an impossible opponent was terrifying.\nAnd yet, Stark just glared at the winged monster, determination in his eyes.\nHe clenched his fists, determining his next move. His aura continued to pulsate around him, a testament to his unwavering resolve.\nThe monster in return merely let out a guttural growl (it had no mouth so kinda weird), the sound echoing throughout the abandoned district. It leaped towards Stark once more, its wings slicing through the air like knives.\nStark timed his dodge perfectly, leaping backward as the wings whizzed past, leaving a trail of dark mist in their wake.\n\"Hellfire!\"\nBut the monster used one of its skill as it passed through, making a pillar of fire emerge from the ground where Stark had just landed, forcing him to roll away to avoid the damage.\n\"Feint Strike!\"\nThe Feathered Scourge lunged at Stark again with incredible speed, its claws glowing ominously. But Stark was ready, and he met the attack with a powerful counter strike.\nHe dodged the claws of the monster, and then…\n\"-2182!\"\nStark's fist connected solidly with the monster's face, the impact sending it reeling backwards.\n'Phew… at least I know that I can deal good damage to it…'\n\"Eye Curse!\"\nThe mini-boss looked down for a few seconds as it activated this powerful skill, then right as the skill reached its peak, it looked back at Stark, its piercing gaze on him.\n'HOLY?' the sheer intense and overwhelming aura shook his entire body.\nBut that was all, nothing else.\n[The 'fear' effect cannot be applied to someone with the 'domination' class]\nIt seemed like the 'Eye Curse' skill made it so that the scourge used its aura to scare off its opponents and deal the 'fear' status effect to them, reducing their movements and accuracy.\nBut it didn't work on Stark, and so the scourge, believing that he was affected, lunged itself toward him again, using 'Feint Strike'.\nBut as expected, Stark avoided the attack as if everything was fine, and punched the mini-boss not once, but twice as it was taken aback.\n\"-4920!\"\nHe had dealt more damage than before, maybe because his confidence had gone up…?\n[Mini-Boss HP: 17898/25000]\nThe winged creature, yet again taken aback by Stark's ability to avoid its attacks, growled again, this one more aggressive and louder than the last.\nAnd for the first time, his confidence as high as ever before, Stark was the one who attacked the mini-boss, rushing towards it.\n\"Feint Strike…!\"\nThe mini-boss tried to slice Stark in half, but yet again, the boy avoided the attack, punching the monster in the stomach in return as he wasn't tall enough to reach its head.\n\"-1738!\" seems like it still did a fair amount of damage.\n\"Soul Syphon,\" the feathered scourge's hand suddenly began glowing as if trying to grab onto Stark's soul.\nAt that moment, Stark felt a shiver run down his spine. He knew this skill would be dangerous, and so he backed away, only able to punch it one more time.\n\"-1837!\"\n[You have been hit by 'Soul Syphon', draining attributes slowly for battle]\n[Strength: 26…25…24…]\nEven being close to Soul Syphon was enough to activate it, and now it wasn't his life that was being reduced, but his other stats.\n'I need to end this quick before I do 1 damage per hit…' Stark thought, feeling the aura around his hands shine brighter because of his determination.",

Stark was still running in circles, trying to aim his fist at the mini-boss.\n\"DIVINE STRIKE!\" a golden text that announced the mini-boss's ultimate attack appeared above it, making Stark's eyes widen.\nAnd although the feathered scourge could only use divine strike once on a powerful enemy, it decided Stark was worth it.\nImmediately, Stark looked up at the sky to see a golden shiny halo above him, following him closely, it was shining so bright that even the people at the beginning of the 'City Ruins' were able to see it.\n\"Hey what's that?\" someone asked.\n\"A beam?\" another answered\n\"…?\" Lana on the otherhand looked at the sky after eliminating another monster, \"Weird…\"\nStark instinctively knew that he would die if it hit him, so he focused on his movements.\nAnd then…\n~BOOM~\nA beam of divine light came hurtling toward him from the halo above.\nStark dived forward before the beam could hit him, avoiding it by a strand of hair, and then continued running.\nThe light beam was following him closely, and he knew that if even one of his fingers touched it, it was over.\nThe mini-boss on the otherhand was flapping its wing from left to right to avoid its own attack, meaning that it also wasn't immune.\nAnd this gave Stark an idea.\n\"DIE!\" he threw his aura smash at the scourge, and the giant crimson fist appeared as predicted, heading toward the mini-boss at incredible speed.\nIt hit it directly, creating a massive explosion of aura.\n\"-5281!\" the amount of damage was not enough to kill the monster, but what Stark was praying for was…\n[Enemy stunned!]\n\"YES,\" the mini-boss was suddenly unable to flap its wings and fell to the ground, wondering why it couldn't move.\nStill followed by the 'Divine Strike', Stark began running toward the mini-boss, jumping right above it instead of hitting it, and the reason for that was because… the halo was also heading toward the mini-boss.\nInstinctively, seeing its attack returned against it and because it couldn't move to avoid it, the 'Feathered Scourge' deactivated 'Divine Strike', making the halo and golden beam dissapear.\nBut this was its biggest mistake.\n\"BINGO!\" Stark jumped behind the mini-boss and smashed its head with his aura-filled fists.\n\"-3718!\"\nThe damage was incredible because Stark was absolutely dominating the battle now.\nAnd so what had to be done was done.\n\"-3829!\"\nAnd finally…\n\"-4273!\"\n[Mini-Boss HP: 0/25000]\nThe feathery creature crumpled to the ground, the once-glowing feathers now dull and lifeless.

He had done it. He had defeated the Feathered Scourge, his first mini-boss in this treacherous world.\nRight on top of the scourge's body appeared an item, his reward for the NO HIT achievement, and so he grabbed it.\nIt was a necklace.\nAs Stark picked up the necklace that had materialized atop the defeated Feathered Scourge, a warm sensation spread through his body.\nThe necklace was exquisitely crafted, with intricate designs etched into the metal and a radiant gem at its center that seemed to pulse with energy.\n…\n[Equipment:] Soulbearer's Embrace\n[Type:] Necklace\n[Class:] Domination\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Required Level:] 10\n[Quality:] Good\n[Attributes:] +20 Strength; +100 HP\n[Special Perk:] Grants the wearer the ability to absorb a very small percentage of damage dealt back as health.\n…\nThis was a necklace that required him a level 10 to use, but also the domination class, meaning that only someone with this class would be able to use it.\n'Maybe it's because the domination class is the best that it's so overpowered…?' he frankly didn't know, but getting HP back sounded op.\nHe clearly remembered reading about items and equipments back at the library, and so he listed what he knew.\nThere are 8 tiers for each item/equipment piece/skill: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythical, Godly, Immortal.\nAnd as for the quality, there are seven categories: Bad, Normal, Good, Exquisite, Perfect, Artifact, Unbeatable.\nBut for now, he couldn't use that necklace since it was restricted to only people that were level 10 to use.\n'Spatial Inventory,' he mumbled and the inventory void opened next to him.\nThen he put the necklace inside, 'See ya later, little necklace, when I am capable of using you…'\nWhen Stark beat the boss, the giant wall of silver fog disappeared, meaning that Kent and Bill, who had been looking at it from afar, were now allowed to pass through.\n\"Holy shit, he actually did it alone!\" Kent was astonished.\n\"…\" Bill on the other hand looked at the disappearing fog with a blank expression, he was surprised too, but also very interested in 'Stalk'.",

Stark wondered what the hell was happening, and he looked at the direction the monsters were watching.\nJust to see… nothing?\nIt was completely dark, stopping him from seeing anything beyond that point.\n'What the fuck-' he didn't have the time to finish his sentence because…\nSuddenly, a figure stepped out from the darkness, their form cloaked in tattered robes that billowed ominously in the wind. The figure's eyes gleamed with a dangerous light as they locked gazes with Stark.\n'Ah shit… here we go again!'\n[Name: Outskirts Second Leader (ELITE)]\n[Level: 15]\n[HP: 12000]\n[Strength: 172]\n[Stamina: 581]\n[Speed: 461]\n[Defense: 615]\n[Skills: Summon, Dark Fog, Soul Drain, Cursed Domain, Shadow Magic]\n…\n'Area's have bosses too now…?' Stark pondered, after all this guy had the 'ELITE' title, and more HP/Stats than any other monster he had met until now other than the 'Feathered Scourge'.\nThe 'Outskirt Second Leader' was wearing a massive dark cloak that stopped anyone from seeing its body, and a white smiley-face mask to hide its face.\nIt also had a black staff in hand, one emitting an eerie aura and a ball of void spinning around at the edge.\nSeeing their leader arrive, the 'Gloomstalkers' immediately resumed walking, and the boss just sat down at the edge of the house's roof, watching its minions kill the human.\nThe Gloomstalkers closed in on him slowly, their eerie white bodies moving like specters in the darkness.\nAs the first Gloomstalker lunged towards him with a menacing swing of its mallet arm, Stark swiftly dodged to the side, feeling the rush of air as the attack narrowly missed him.\nIn response, he punched it back in the head.\n\"-3192!\" it's body immediately turned to dust.\nUsing that momentum, Stark launched himself towards the next Gloomstalker, delivering a barrage of punches and kicks with precision and power.\nThe creatures fell one by one, disintegrating into ash as his attacks landed. Despite their overwhelming numbers, Stark's determination burned brighter than ever, fueling his every move.\nBy the end of his rampage, all the gloomstalkers had died, and the leader was still watching from the roof.\n\"Summon!\" it lifted its staff in the air, and suddenly… more gloomstalkers started appearing from the ground and windows.\n\"Is that an infinite EXP generator?\" Stark smiled, he was actively quite tempted to keep going and grind, but he knew he would get tired eventually, plus his time was counted because of the 'Black Sun Curse'.\n'Aura Smash,' he mumbled as his fist started glowing with that crimson aura.\nAnd then he threw it at the unsuspecting leader, who thought it was safe up there if Stark only used his fists.\n\"-2312!\" it's defense was very high, so the damage was reduced a ton, but it was still a good amount.\nTaken aback, the leader was sent flying backward, and once it came back at the edge, it had a dark aura around its body and staff, showing signs it was gonna attack.\n\"Black Fog!\" A thick, inky fog began to swirl around the Outskirts Leader, enveloping the area in darkness. Stark could barely see his own hand in front of his face as the fog crept closer, threatening to suffocate him.\n'God damn it,' his senses were on high alert in case a gloomstalker was close, but it seemed like they couldn't see either.\n\"-3261!\" navigating through the fog, he would occasionally find some gloomstalkers he killed, and also had to avoid some others before they could hit him.\nOne singular touch of their mallets would probably send him flying after all…\nAnd so after thirty seconds of that…\n'Aura Smash!' He hurled his right fist again in the direction the leader was in previously, he used his aura as a landmark toward where to aim, and this time landed it on the leader's legs.\n\"-1937!\" the boss roared in pain, and then…\n~FIOU~\nLosing balance since Stark had aimed for the legs, it fell forward toward the street.\n~THUD~\n\"-728!\" it received damage because of the fall, but it was still relatively fine.\nNot able to see anything because of the fog, the leader deactivated that skill, and after a few seconds, the mist cleared, revealing the Outskirts Second Leader struggling to stand back up.\nDozens of monsters now surrounded Stark, and the leader was pointing its staff at him too.\n'You're close to me now… finally a fair fight,' he smiled while positioning his hands.\n\"Shadow Magic!\" the leader's staff began glowing with an eerie aura, and the ball of void at the edge of it also started growing in size.\nAnd thus, the final battle before the real boss of the dungeon began.",

The impact sent shockwaves rippling through the air, causing even the gloomstalkers to stagger back in surprise.\n\"-3618!\" the damage was incredible.\nThe leader staggered backward, its cloak billowing around it as it struggled to regain its balance.\n\"Summon!\" it summoned more gloomstalkers from the ground in front of it to protect itself from Stark's attacks.\nSeizing the opportunity, Stark followed up with a series of lightning-fast strikes, each blow landing with precision and force against the monsters, not even letting them get out of the ground.\n\"-3739! -2638! -2947!\"\nForced to back away, Stark made sure that nothing was behind him.\n[Area Boss HP: 3405/12000]\n'One or two more hits…' Stark thought.\nHis confidence was its peak, and the leader looked extremely injured, struggling to even stay in place or summon more gloomstalkers.\n\"-3718!\"\n\"-3918!\"\n\"-4183!\"\nEach gloomstalker that tried to attack him was met by an instant punch that made it turn into dust: none of them were capable of touching Stark, even with their numbers.\nRealizing that: most of the minions just stood there, not even moving anymore, knowing it was futile to even try, it seemed like they had a conscience of their own even while being controlled by the leader.\nAnd that's when it happened: behind the smiley-face mask the second leader was wearing, Stark noticed dark and hostile pupils, glowing with a purplish aura.\n\"CURSED DOMAIN!\"\nA sudden surge of dark energy emanated from the leader, enveloping the entire area in a malevolent aura of darkness.\nStark felt a chill run down his spine as his movements slowed, the shadows seeming to constrict around him, sapping his strength with each passing second.\nThe gloomstalkers that remained standing seemed revitalized, their attacks gaining a dangerous edge under the influence of the Cursed Domain.\n[You are in a cursed domain, defeat the enemy boss before it is too late (all enemies receive a stat boost inside the domain)]\nStruggling against the oppressive magic, Stark gritted his teeth and focused on maintaining his resolve.\n\"Shadow Magic!\"\nThe second leader didn't waste time and summoned three darkness arrows again, launching them at Stark.\nHis movements were reduced, and the arrows were faster than before, but 'Focus' still allowed him to see them coming.\nHe avoided one… he avoided two…\nHe couldn't avoid the third.\nSensing that, Stark decided to focus most of his aura around his chest, in the area where the arrow was aimed at, in the hopes of stopping it.\nAnd…\n\"-82!\" the damage he received was minimal as the arrow was stopped by the wall of aura before it could pierce him, meaning that this \"aura barrier\" truly worked.\n[HP: 36/950 (CRITICAL CONDITION)]\n'Fuck that shit!' Stark realizing that he was one hit away from dying focused all his aura into another 'Aura Smash'.\nHe kept avoiding darkness arrows all the while powering up his attack, and after a few seconds…\n\"GO TO HELL,\" he punched the air, sending the crimson fist toward the second leader, who was unable to avoid it.\n\"-2192!\" its defense was higher because of the domain.\nBut…\n[Enemy stunned]\nSeizing the moment of weakness, Stark wasted no time. Channeling all his remaining strength and fury into a final, decisive strike, he launched himself at the stunned leader with a speed and power that seemed almost supernatural.\n\"I'm not stuck with you!\" he jumped in the air, in front of the leader's eyes as it was unable to move any of its limbs or staff, \"YOU ARE STUCK WITH ME!\"\nHe punched it.\n\"-2719!\"\n[Area Boss HP: 0/12000]\nThe leader let out a final anguished cry as Stark's punch connected, shattering its remaining defenses and sending it crumbling to the ground.\nA deafening silence fell over the battlefield as the cursed domain dissipated, leaving only the sound of the wind rustling through the trees.\nAll the gloomstalkers surroundings Stark immediately also began turning to dust as they were all only kept alive by the outskirts second leader's magic.\nAnd just like that, Stark was able to defeat that shitty boss.\n[You have slain \"Outskirts Second Leader lv15 (ELITE)\", gained 22000EXP!]\n[You have slain twenty-two \"Gloomstalkers lvl14\", gained 24500 EXP]\n[Experience: 59310/75000]\n'Not even enough to level up…' he sighed but immediately began running nonetheless.\n[Black Sun Curse: 95% (WARNING)]\n…\n[You have slain 'Shadow Demon lv14', gained 2300 EXP]\n[You have slain 'Water Blob lv13', gained 2150 EXP]\n[You have slain 'Crazy Archer lv14', gained 2200\n…\n[Black Sun Curse: 96% (WARNING)]\nSweat pouring out from his forehead, Stark continued running, his time was counted, and although he wondered just how was any of the other students supposed to survive this, he still had his own safety in mind first.\n[Black Sun Curse: 97% (WARNING, GET TO A BONFIRE)]\nThe warning blared in Stark's mind as he sprinted through the city outskirts, now ignoring the monsters that tried to stop him as he didn't want to waste time.\nHe could feel the Black Sun looking at him, awaiting for him to be consumed by its powers to transform him.\nBut… it would never have this pleasure.\nSince when he turned around another corner, Stark spotted the flickering glow of a bonfire in the middle of a giant street.\nAnd beyond it… a silver fog wall could be seen.\n'BINGO!'\n[Black Sun Curse: 98% (WARNING, GET TO A BONFIRE)]\nRelief flooded through him as he pushed himself to run even faster\nWarning panels surrounded his view as the number reached 99%, but thankfully enough… he was able to reach the bonfire, entering the 'safe space' right before the boss battle.",

Stark smiled and sat beside the bonfire again, enjoying the feeling of finally reaching level 10, meaning he could now equip the necklace he had acquired.\nAnd also…\n[Level 10 Reached: please pick a skill card]\nJust like last time, three cards materialized in front of him out of thin air, this time their color was blue.\n'Oh yeah… that thing,' this had been how he acquired [Aura Smash], it seemed like he would be able to choose a new skill every 5 levels.\nStark gazed at the three blue cards in front of him, pondering his choice carefully.\n\"Oh well, it's not like I can decide what skill i'll get,\" he shrugged and picked the middle card at random.\nThe other two disappeared once he did that, and so he turned the card he picked to see an image of… himself?\n…\n[Name: Clone Frenzy]\n[Type: Rare]\n[Level: 1]\n[Description: Summons a clone of yourself that acts and fights just like you do, giving you a temporary additional character to control in battle, the clone does damage based on how much aura you give it, but its stats are extremely reduced, and its HP is set to 1, cooldown period of 30 minutes between each clone]\n…\nAnd yet again, below the description was some sort of low-budget animation showing how the skill worked: a stickman that was supposed to be Stark used aura to summon another stickman that looked exactly like him, and he was able to control it to fight enemies.\n'I guess it's good…' Stark would need to see it in battle to judge, but this was his first 'rare' type skill, meaning that it MUST be good, right?\n[Clone Frenzy has been added to your skill list]\n[You have upgraded 'Clone Frenzy' to level 2!]\nAfter reaching level 10 and acquiring this skill, Stark just sighed and looked at the sky while sitting beside the bonfire, its darkness was mesmerizing for some strange reason.\n'Spatial Inventory,' he mumbled after five minutes, and the small void appeared beside him.\nHe hesitated for a few seconds, but then put his arm inside while thinking of the \"Soulbearer's Embrace\" necklace.\nSuddenly, he could feel his fingers brushing against the cool metal of the necklace, and so he pulled out his hand, just to see that the necklace was in fact inside it.\n'I guess that's pretty cool and convenient.'\nWithout wasting time, he put the necklace around his neck.\n[\"Soulbearer's Embrace\" Equipped]\nIf he remembered correctly, that necklace was supposed to give him +20 strength, +100 HP, and also…\n[Special Perk:] Grants the wearer the ability to absorb a very small percentage of damage dealt back as health.\nIf there was a way to gain health through damage, then he sure as hell was gonna take it.\n'I guess that's all for now, isn't it?' he lay on the cold ground, maybe it was dirty, but even sitting down left him uncomfortable, so this was his best option.\nHe needed to be full of energy before attempting to kill the boss after all since he would do it alone and only at level 10 while it was probably recommended to do it with a party of level 15 classifiers.\n'I hope that new skill helps… it would be great if it truly worked just as I envisioned it to be…'\nStark kept thinking about the future for a bit… and then… before he even realized it, the ground became strangely comfortable.\nAnd so he closed his eyes.",

      "content": "People began rushing through the beginning areas after the message of the mini-boss being defeated appeared.\nAfter all, this dungeon was supposed to be used to level up (mostly) safely while also gaining experience, so if someone completed it quickly, they would have less time to do so.\nThe deeper they went, the higher amount of experience they could get, and the least the people that would be there to annoy them.\nLana was one of those that prioritized completing the dungeon over leveling up since she already had the gear to do so, although she was alone.\nSoon enough she reached the level 15 area \"Advanced District\", and from now on only the strongest were there.\nKent and Bill had also decided they wouldn't go further inside the dungeon past that point as it was too dangerous, and they also believed that \"Stalk\" was the same.\nAfter all… who was dumb enough to go for the boss in the first day, right…? RIGHT?\n\"-928! -827!\" killing enemies, Lana kept going.\nHer interest wasn't to level up as she was now level 20, more than enough to start going into actual dungeons, not beginner ones.\nAnd although 'Archer' was considered one of the weaker classes, her powers and equipment were still good enough to compete with all the others (except for Domination, obviously).\nHer goal wasn't to level up, but to defeat the dungeon and boss.\n\"Complete that dungeon and be the strongest one inside there,\" her father, an extremely strong classifier, told her.\nSo her goal, just like Stark, was to complete the dungeon as fast as possible and retrieve all the rewards/fame.\nOf course, she wasn't dumb, so she would obviously wait for some high potential people to help her out with the boss, going alone was suicide.\nBut for now… she needed to get to the bonfire before the boss.\n***\n(3 hours later)\n\"I see it!\" Lana smiled, she had successfully entered the \"City Outskirts\", which was the last area of the [City Ruins] rift, and managed her way through all the monsters.\nAll she could see around her was the empty streets, no one was there, meaning that she was probably the first to reach this place.\nNo… she was CONFIDENT that she was the only one.\nAnd right in front of her was the bonfire before the final boss of the dungeon, she would set herself there and wait for around 4 more people to create a party and defeat that boss together.\n\"This dungeon is more dangerous than I thought… but there's definitely no one there, all the others are too weak to fight the monsters here as of now…\" she kept advancing.\nAnd the moment Lana reached the giant bonfire…\n\"Huh?\" she spotted a pair of legs right behind the fire, and as she peeked her head to check what (or who) it was… she spotted a sleeping Stark, \"WHAT?\"\nShe was astonished, not only had someone already reached this area… but Stark nonetheless? How did he do it? Did he avoid every monster and through some godly luck reach this place?\nNo… this wouldn't be possible…\nHer mind immediately wandered to the time Stark defeated Daniel and caused massive amount of damage to him.\n\"Could it be…?\" she approached him slowly, making sure not to wake him up, and got closer to his sleeping face.\nStark seemed to be resting peacefully, his face calm and serene. It was as if this whole dungeon didn't matter to him.\nRealizing this wouldn't lead to anything, Lana just sat on the ground beside the bonfire, waiting for other people to come.\n***\nIn the realm of dreams, Stark found himself standing in a vast, empty space.\nThe air was cool and soothing, a stark contrast to the harsh world he had been navigating just moments ago.\nAs he looked around, he noticed a figure in the distance, its features blurred and indistinct. Something about it drew him closer, an inexplicable pull that beckoned him forward.\nWith each step he took, the figure seemed to shimmer and shift, changing form until it finally solidified into a mirror image of himself.\nStark stared in disbelief at the doppelgänger before him, feeling a strange mix of curiosity and unease.\nThe other Stark smiled, a perfect replica of his own grin, and spoke in a voice that sounded like an echo of his own thoughts, \"Are you ready?\"\n\"Ready for what?\" the real one answered, confused.\n\"The First Domination Trial, you have read about it several times in your status window, right?\"\n\"Yeah…\" he hadn't ignored it all this time, it was just he didn't have any info so he didn't think it was worth it… for now.\n\"It is coming soon, and you will suffer, but in the end…\" the fake Stark didn't have the time to finish its sentence that it vanished.\nAnd suddenly, the dream world started to shake, a proof that Stark was beginning to wake up.\n***\n(30 minutes later)\n'Hm~?' Stark opened his eyes, rubbing them as he got up, then remembered about where he was, \"Holy shit, did I seriously sleep in here? Luckily nobody saw-\"\nHe turned his head, and noticed Lana looking at him.\n\"I'm surprised you could even sleep here with the boss lurking around the corner,\" were the first words she said as she was busy inspecting her bows and arrows.\n\"Gotta be full of energy before fighting the boss, shouldn't I be,\" Stark replied while yawning, not even questioning why she was here, and got up from the ground, his clothes were a bit dirty but it didn't bother him.\n\"Fighting the boss? But you're alone!\"\n\"Hum… yeah? That's kinda the point, y'know,\" Stark wasn't the type to hide his achievements, so he didn't care about telling anyone that asked him about the fact he had killed the mini-boss by himself, although most wouldn't believe him…\nHe stretched for a bit while talking to Lana, the shock across her face growing more and more after each of his replies.\n\"How did you even get here?\"\n\"Killing the monsters…? Isn't that obvious?\" these question were almost becoming silly, and so after a few minutes of back and forth, Stark decided that it was time.\nHis HP were full, he had all his skills, and his necklace was equipped, nothing could stop him now (except an insta-kill attack from the boss).\nAnd so just like that, he left the safe space and headed toward the silver fog.\n\"Where are you going???!!!\" Lana got up too, surprised.\n\"Going to kill the boss,\" Stark grinned and traversed the wall of fog, not even bothering to hear her reply.\nLana stood there, unable to understand whatever the fuck was happening.\nThe only thing she knew was that… she couldn't let Stark defeat the boss by himself if he had some sort of trick up his sleeve- NO, she meant she couldn't let Stark die alone.\nAnd so she followed after him.",

He wore pure white gloves on both hands and shiny black shoes, giving off an air of wealth and power.\nTo further add to his sinister image, Malakar's face was half-hidden by a 'Black Sun' mask while a strange melon hat adorned his head.\nWithout a word, he raised a hand and summoned dark energy that crackled around his fingers menacingly.\nLana began to aim her bow at the mayor, and seeing that Stark was doing nothing actively scared her more than the boss itself.\nOn the other hand, Stark took a few seconds to use [Perception] and check the boss.\n[Name: Malakar, City Mayor (BOSS)]\n[Level: 15]\n[HP: 45000]\n[Strength: 471]\n[Stamina: 289]\n[Speed: 154]\n[Defense: 829]\n[Skills: Dark Pulse, The Cane, Abysall Shield, Godless Demon, The Mayor's Control, Hat Trick…]\nThe Mayor was slowly walking toward them, his stats were pretty good, although more on the defensive side than in the rest, and its speed was extremely low.\nStark smirked at the boss's stats, analyzing them carefully in his mind. His demeanor was calm and collected, a stark (get it?) contrast to Lana's nerves that seemed to be getting the best of her.\nWithout a word, he suddenly sprinted towards Malakar.\n\"Dark Pulse!\" Malakar crouched, both his hands touching the ground, and veins of darkness immediately began spreading toward Stark and Lana.\nWhen he was close enough to one of the veins, it would come out of the ground to try and pierce him, but of course, Stark had 'Focus' and was able to narrowly dodge them by rolling to the side each time.\n'What the fuck is he doing, why is he rolling like this?' Lana pondered, and shot one of her arrows toward the Mayor.\n\"-628!\" it hit him in the chest, but he was so focused on Stark that he wasn't bothered by such an attack.\nLana was shocked that Stark was going to engage with the boss head-on, something most people would consider suicide, strategy was key in the rifts, yet here he was doing random shit.\nAfter 'Dark Pulse' ended, Malakar rose up to his full height (which was approximately four meters) and unleashed another attack.\n\"The Cane!\" he bellowed, as a shadowy cane materialized in his hand. With a flick of his wrist, the cane elongated and lashed out towards Stark like a viper.\nStark reacted quickly, drawing upon his agility and reflexes. He dodged the sweeping strike by a hair's breadth, but then…\nThe cane turned around, controlled by the Mayor and able to defy the laws of physics.\nNot expecting that, Stark only had a few microseconds to adjust, and so the best course of action was to put lots of aura around the area where it was aimed.\n\"-721!\" he was hit, and although he protected himself, he still received a lot of damage, making him stumble to the ground.\n[HP: 479/1200 (+100 from 'Soulbearer's Embrace')]\nHe immediately got up though, and with unwavering determination continued running toward the Mayor.\nLana shot another arrow at the boss, this time infusing it with the 'Dragon Breath' skill.\n\"-1219!\" she was able to deal very good damage to the boss, enough this time to actually make him acknowledge her presence, but too focused on Stark to attack her.\n\"He is actually distracting him very well,\" Lana gently smiled, she was surprised that Stark was able to dodge all these attacks all the while closing the distance between him and the boss, that didn't explain how he would deal damage though since he had no weapon.\nAnd so just like this, the fight against the boss of this rift began.",

The impact created a shockwave that reverberated through the air, causing the ground to tremble beneath their feet.\n\"-627!\"\nThe shield after being hit by such a powerful attack obviously cracked under the immense pressure and was destroyed, meaning the Mayor wouldn't be able to use it for a while.\n\"-1171!\" Lana also used another arrow infused with another one of her skills, dealing more damage to Malakar.\nIt seemed like they were doing it slowly, but little by little, the Mayor was receiving more and more damage.\n[Boss HP: 41355/45000]\nLana was a very good support, dealing damage from afar while Stark held him off.\n'Our chemistry is surprisingly good, although I would prefer if he could actually do something…' Lana hadn't noticed the appearance of the abysall shield right before Stark's attack hit, meaning that she thought he dealt medium damage to it.\nStark continued his relentless assault on Malakar, dodging the boss's attacks with expert precision and slowly but surely approaching him.\nAnd when he was only a few meters away now…\nHe dashed forward.\n\"The Cane!\" the boss still had his cane in his hands, and so he tried to hit Stark with it.\nStark rolled on the ground, and once it came to him, instead of taking the hit like last time, he literally just used his fists to hit and break it.\n\"…?\" The Mayor was taken aback.\n\"Got you,\" Stark smiled as he had completely closed the distance now, he was in the perfect range to attack the Mayor.\nAnd so he did: before Malakar could even use another one of his skills, Stark focused his aura and…\n\"-3712!\" even with his powerful defense, Stark's aura and stats dealt massive damage.\n\"WHAT?\" Lana was astonished, even going as far as stopping to aim with her bow to make sure the number she was seeing was right, and it was.\n'Calm down, Lana, focus on the battle,' She shook her head and began arming her bow to shoot again.\n\"-3819!\" Stark was even able to punch the boss again as it hadn't had the time to counter the first one.\n\"Hat Trick!\"\nThe Mayor used another one of his skills, and suddenly, his hat was enveloped in a dark, ominous energy. The hat lifted off his head, spinning wildly in the air before shooting towards Stark like a spinning blade of darkness.\nStark barely had time to react, but he managed to deflect the hat with a swift movement of his arm.\n\"-281!\" it dealt him some damage, but not enough to actually be worried.\nThe hat ricocheted off a nearby rock and soared back towards Malakar, who grabbed it and bowed like a gentleman afterward, a smirk could be seen on the visible half of his face.\nStark backed away after that, sensing that the Mayor was going to keep attacking.\nAnd after a few back steps… he found himself right next to Lana, who was still aiming her bow and arrows at Malakar.\n\"-718!\" she hit him in the chest again, then armed another arrow right after.\nMalakar on the otherhand was spinning the cane in his hand, almost enjoying the show.\n'I'm low on HP…' Stark thought, he had received two hits already.\nBut as he thought about that… a panel appeared in front of him.\n[Dealt massive damage to BOSS ENEMY, regaining 59HP!]\nThe 'Soulbearer's Embrace' Necklace perk activated, and he was able to gain some of it back.\n'Oh shit, it's small, but it might actually make the difference…' Stark, regaining his confidence, smiled.\n\"I'm gonna go back, keep doing whatever you're doing, i'll keep him away from you,\" Stark spoke to Lana, then began dashing away before she could reply.\n\"I-\" she sighed before smiling, \"You better do your job.\"\nStark sprinted back towards the Mayor, his determination burning brighter than ever. Malakar smirked as he saw Stark approaching, readying himself for another round of combat.\n\"Dark Pulse!\" the Mayor summoned the veins into the ground again, and every single one of them went rushing toward him.\nThis time, however, Stark had a new strategy in mind.\n\"Clone Frenzy!\" he used his latest skill.\n[Description: Summons a clone of yourself that acts and fights just like you do, giving you a temporary additional character to control in battle, the clone does damage based on how much aura you give it, but its stats are extremely reduced, and its HP is set to 1, cooldown period of 30 minutes between each clone]\nAnd suddenly, his aura started seeping out of his body and headed right in front of him, forming a perfect replica of Stark, ready to assist in the battle against the Mayor.\n\"…\" The clone's eyes were completely white, some aura pouring out from them like a fire, and its expression was neutral.\nIts eyes were locked on Malakar with unwavering focus, awaiting Stark's orders.\n\"Let's do this,\" Stark muttered to his clone as they both charged towards the oncoming Dark Pulse veins.\nThe clone mimicked Stark's movements (almost) perfectly, matching his speed and agility as they weaved through the rushing veins.\n\"What the?\" Lana was confused, why were there suddenly two Starks?\nShe aimed her bow at the Mayor as he smiled at the upcoming enemies, then fired again.\n\"-528!\" somehow, it felt like she was doing less and less damage… was there a reason to that?\nMeanwhile, Stark and his clone dodged and countered, working in perfect synchrony to break through the dark onslaught.\n\"The Cane!\" feeling threatened for the first time, the Mayor summoned his cane in hand, then elongated it… towards the clone.\n'Ah shit…' Stark knew that his clone's HP was set to 1, meaning it couldn't even defend such an attack without dying.\nAnd so he positioned himself right in front of the cane and deflected it with a powerful slam.\n\"-72!\" he received almost no damage thanks to that.\nAnd then…\n\"Aura Smash!\" now only 5 meters away from the Mayor, Stark decided it was time.\nAnd so, both his and his clone's hands began glowing with a bright crimson aura.",

      "content": "Thankfully enough though, it seemed like the clone actively thought for itself and subconsciously did what Stark wanted it to do.\nWhich was why it also used [Aura Smash] when he did, copying him.\nBoth Stark and the clone's right hands began glowing with that ominous aura, and after a few seconds…\nStark punched the air in the Mayor's direction, sending a crimson fist of aura toward him.\n\"-3712!\" a powerful blow to the boss, who was forced to back away because of the sheer damage.\nBut that wasn't all…\nStark immediately ordered the clone to repeat what he just did, sending another Aura Smash attack towards the Mayor.\nThe clone, without hesitation, mirrored Stark's movements perfectly, launching a second crimson fist at Malakar.\n\"-1727!\" it was less powerful than the original, but still fairly good for a copy.\nAnd also…\n[Enemy stunned]\n'OH MY GOD,' Stark was bewildered, he didn't believe that the clone could also cause status effects, but oh boy was he wrong.\nThe boss fell to his knees, unable to get up or move any of his limbs, and also unable to use his magic since it required him to move his hands.\n'What the?' Lana thought as she saw both Starks suddenly run toward the boss without caring about anything, she wasn't even aiming with her bow anymore, instead just enjoying the spectacle before her eyes.\nStark ordered his clone to dash toward the boss as it was the perfect moment to cause a huge amount of damage, and so they both did just that.\nThe clone lunged at the stunned Mayor with a fierce battle cry, its aura-infused fist ready to strike. Stark followed closely behind, channeling all his energy into his next move.\nAs they closed in on Malakar, the clone unleashed a devastating blow, hitting the boss with unparalleled force.\n\"-2319!\"\nThe clone backed away after this attack as Stark followed through with a kick to the jaw.\n\"-4312!\"\nThen Stark also moved to the right for the clone to punch Malakar in the face.\n\"-2129!\"\nUsing the clone's back as a jumping pad, Stark then grabbed both its shoulders to jump in the air and smash the Mayor's head.\n\"-6462!\"\nThey had just comboed the boss, and dealt almost 15K points of damage in a matter of seconds.\n[Dealt damage to BOSS ENNEMY, regaining 158HP!]\n[HP: 343/1200]\nAfter receiving all these attacks, Malakar was finally able to move, and immediately used [Hat Trick], sending his hat toward the real Stark.\nTaken aback, Stark asked his clone to place itself in front of him.\nAnd so it did.\n\"-1728!\"\n'My god, the damage is insane, is something wrong with that boss…?' Stark would have definitely died if he had been hit, even if he deflected it or used his aura around his body.\nThe clone after being hit by this attack immediately vanished, and the crimson aura that formed it went back to Stark.\n'You did well,' he smiled, almost feeling like he lost someone close to him, but instantly going back to serious mode as he needed to focus.\n…\n[Boss HP: 11917/45000]\n[The boss is ENRAGED, be careful]\nThis panel appeared in front of them both.\nIt seemed like that in this world, when bosses reach their halfway point (or when their HP gets reduced enough), they go into some sort of second phase/frenzy.\nAnd Malakar was no different.\n\"THE MAYOR'S DOMAIN!\" he got up, lifting both his arms sideways as his eyes began glowing, and even his black sun mask was emanating a dark aura.\n\"-462!\" but even mid power-up, Lana still shot an arrow at the boss.\n'…' Stark turned to look at her, \"Aren't we supposed to let him finish his transformation before attacking?\"\n\"I think killing him while he is powering up is more efficient…\" she replied, somehow during the fifteen minutes they had been fightning, she found it in herself to trust Stark.\n\"Fair enough, but I still wanna see what he does!\" Stark smiled and waited.\nAs the Mayor continued his transformation, a dark energy began swirling around him, creating an ominous aura that sent shivers down Stark's spine.\nHe couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding as he witnessed the dark power radiating from the Mayor's form.\nLana, sensing the imminent danger, notched another arrow on her bowstring, ready to strike at any moment. The tension in the air was palpable as they all waited to see what Malakar's new form would bring to the battlefield.\nAnd then…\n~CRASH~\nFrom all the nearby buildings, the mansion, and even the ground, monsters began to come out.\n\"Hey, that's not a transformation, he looks the same,\" Stark complained, although he couldn't deny the aura around the boss was more sinister, and its figure felt more imposing.\n[Name: City Inhabitant lv8]\n[Name: Businessman lv12]\n[Name: Cursed Dog lv6]\nAll the different monsters they had met in the dungeon appeared all of a sudden: all under the control of the Mayor as they followed his every command.\nLana shot a monster, killing it, then armed her bow again, sweat pouring from her forehead as she knew the sheer number of monsters was too much for her to take currently.\n\"Survive, i'll go kill that bastard,\" Stark looked at her with his determined eyes, and all she could do was nod.\n\"Be quick… please…\" she mumbled, low enough for him to not hear her.\nWith a nod of understanding, Stark focused his attention on the Mayor and his horde of creatures.\nThe monsters moved with unnatural coordination, their eyes filled with a malevolent gleam as they closed in on Stark.\nBut Stark wasn't interested in any of them, and so he began running toward the Mayor: his arms were still lifted up, probably because this is how he controlled the 'inhabitants of his city'.\nHe avoided most of the monsters, and occasionally killed some that were fast enough to catch up to him.\nAnd so, just like this, Stark closed the distance between him and the boss.\nAnd thus, the final showdown could begin.",

Mayor, taking the hit in its place.\n\"-627!\" the Mayor received minimal damage since he was protected.\nMalakar smirked as he saw his monster take the blow for him, clearly enjoying the show of power and the feeling of being in total control.\nStark was surrounded, and surprisingly enough, Malakar ordered his monsters to mainly target Stark, leaving Lana to deal with a low amount of monsters.\nStark gritted his teeth in frustration at the interference, but didn't let it deter him.\nHe swiftly followed up with a series of lightning-fast punches, aiming to break through the defenses and land a crippling blow on the Mayor himself.\nNo monster that was in his way stood a chance.\nMalakar, however, remained calm amidst the chaos, his eyes locked onto Stark with an unsettling calmness.\nWith a swift gesture of his hand, he activated \"The Cane\" skill, summoning the object in his right hand.\nHis left one however was still in the air, controlling the monsters.\n\"It seems like it's losing control over them when one of its hands is down…\" Stark noticed that some monsters weren't even moving anymore, giving him the chance to close the distance further.\nOnly five meters before reaching the boss now.\nThe cane came rushing toward him, changing directions everytime it met a monster, and then…\n\"-272!\" Stark saw it coming, but even while deflecting it, it still did good damage.\n\"His defense and attack are higher than before,\" he thought, not even stopping after that hit, \"But it doesn't matter…\"\nStark wanted to end it, and so he used the back of a monster to jump in the air, high enough to avoid any incoming attacks from the Mayor or his minions.\nHe soared through the air, his aura blazing around him like a fiery comet, looking down on all the monsters below.\nWith a fierce battle cry, Stark descended upon Malakar, his fist aimed straight at the Mayor's face.\n\"-3718!\" as Stark's fist connected with the Mayor's cheek, a shockwave resonated through the battlefield.\nUsing in the momentum in his favor, Stark used the Malakar's body to launch him in the air again, avoiding both the [Hat Trick], [The Cane], and all the attacks from the monsters.\n\"LET'S END THIS,\" the sea of monsters below awaiting for him to fall, Stark spinned in the air.\n\"Aura Smash!\" he activated the skill, ready to launch it down, this time confident he would hit all his targets as he had the boss in his vision.\n'Holy shit…' Lana was astonished, and she found it quite beautiful as Stark's figure perfectly aligned with the giant Black Sun in the sky, creating an effect where Stark's aura was perfectly visible around him.\nIt only took Stark a singular second to aim his attack below, and so he launched the giant crimson fist at the monsters under him.\n~FWISH… BOOM~\nThe explosion was bigger than any other this attack had ever caused.\n\"-6371!\" the Mayor couldn't use his minions to protect himself, and so being hit by the center of the attack meant he received the highest amount of damage.\nPlus…\n[Enemy stunned!]\nAll the monsters in his surroundings cleared from the crimson fist, Stark began dropping down toward Malakar as he couldn't move his body anymore.\nThe boss used every ounce of strength it had left to lift its face just a bit, and thus he saw the sight of Stark diving toward him, his fist full of aura, ready to end the battle.\n'It's the end,' It thought, acknowledging that it couldn't do anything anymore.\nWith a fierce determination in his eyes, Stark descended upon the stunned Mayor Malakar, his fist crackling with intense energy as he prepared to deliver the final blow.\nThe air around them seemed to vibrate with anticipation as Stark's attack loomed closer and closer to its target.\nMalakar, unable to move due to the stunning impact of Stark's previous strike, could only watch in helpless horror as the inevitable approached.\nAs Stark's fist made contact with Malakar's form, a blinding explosion of energy erupted from the point of impact, sending shockwaves rippling through the battlefield.\n\"-5372!\"\n[Boss HP: 0/45000]\nMalakar fell to the ground, his body lifeless as his HP had been reduced to 0.\nAnd so, unable to control his domain anymore, all the monsters inside the boss area fell, disappearing a few seconds later.\nLana, who was overwhelmed by the monsters, almost let a cry of joy when she noticed that they were all gone, and so without wasting time she dashed toward Stark.\n\"YOU DID IT!\" she jumped to hug him.\n\"…\" Stark, a neutral expression on his face, didn't reciprocate the hug.\n\"O-Oh,\" realizing how embarassing what she did was, she let go of him, \"G-good job!\"\n\"Yes,\" Stark nodded, unaffected by her presence, after all he had done most of the job.\n[You have slain 'Malakar, City Mayor lv15 (BOSS)', gained 75000EXP]\nAnd adding the experience gained from the many monsters he had defeated while rushing to the boss…\nStark was enveloped by the golden glow again.\n[Your level has increased to level 11, granting you one skill point and boost in stats]\n[Experience: 2617/100000]\nLana was also enveloped with the glow, meaning she had leveled up as well, and even though she hadn't done much, she was still a participant.\n[Dealt killing blow to BOSS ENNEMY, regaining 507HP!]\n[HP: 578/1450]\nBut of course,

something began shining: an item had appeared.\nImmediately, Stark began walking toward it.\n\"I'm taking it by the way, I did everything,\" A neutral expression on his face, he informed Lana, who was also reading the panels.\n\"I-… Okay,\" she had nothing to say, he had done most of the work after all.\nAnd just like that, Stark was able to defeat the boss.\n'I wish she hadn't followed me though… I would have probably gotten an amazing item if I beat it solo…' he groaned while crouching to take the item.",

It was a ring with a glowing crystal in the center, radiating a soft, soothing light.\nHe immediately decided to use [Perception] to analyze both these items.\n…\n[Item:] The Ice Bow\n[Type:] Bow\n[Class:] Archer\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Required Level:] 20\n[Quality:] Good\n[Attributes:] +30 speed, +20 Stamina\n[Special Perks:] While using this bow, arrows have a 5% chance to freeze enemies\n…\n[Item:] Crystalheart Band\n[Type:] Ring\n[Class:] Domination\n[Tier:] Epic\n[Required Level:] 15\n[Quality:] Excellent\n[Attributes:] +50 Health, +40 Mind, +10 to all other stats\n[Special Perks:] Grants the wearer a shield that absorbs 10% of incoming damage.\n…\n'Holy shit, this is OP!' Stark laughed, he had gotten an incredible item again, and he would also be able to sell the bow at a fair price, making his journey totally worth it.\n\"Wait, there are two items, one is a bow, and i'm an archer, so can I get it?\" The bow in front of her was better than the one she was using currently, and she also had the required level.\nWeapons with perks weren't that rare, but those that had one were much more expensive than the ones that didn't.\n\"…\" Stark stared at her for a few seconds, then back at the bow, \"Nah, it's mine.\"\nHe activated [Spatial Inventory] and put the bow and ring inside.\nLana didn't even question the weird void that opened and that was somehow able to store both the items, she was just shocked Stark wouldn't even give her that while he wasn't even an archer.\n\"If you want the bow,\" Stark maniacally smiled at her, \"You'll have to pay up,\" he rubbed three of his fingers together, mimicking the sign of money.\n\"I-\" Lana didn't know what to reply, on one hand she knew that Stark was the sole reason she survived the boss fight, whether it was from stopping him from approaching her, or forcing most of the monsters to go toward him, it was undeniable that he had helped her.\nAnd yet… she couldn't believe he was so petty over such a small matter.\n\"You can take them,\" she made up her mind, but she would make sure to buy a bow way better than the one he had acquired.\n\"Good girl!\" Stark patted her shoulders, then began walking toward the exit.\n\"…?\" she had never been treated this way before, it was always respect and admiration that surrounded her, as well as undeniable love from all those around her.\nAnd yet… when she saw Stark so nonchalantly call her a 'good girl' without even being embarassed, it was like something snapped inside of her.\nHer face was bright red, and she tried her hardest to hide it, \"What the hell is happening… calm down me… you can't be aroused by this…!\"\nLeaving Lana behind to fight with her inner conflicts, Stark decided it was time for him to leave the dungeon, he had nothing else to do in there, and wanted to sell his items as well.\nBut as he began taking steps toward the exit…\nA panel appeared in front of him.\n[Congratulations for completing your first dungeon, Host! As a reward, you have been granted new information!]\n'…?'\nStark stopped for a few seconds to read, 'What kind of information do I need at this point.'\n[You can read the information now or leave it for later (not recommended)]\nCuriosity getting the better of him, Stark decided to read the new information he had received as a reward for completing his first dungeon. As he focused on the panel in front of him, the words started forming a message:\n[New Information Unlocked: Domination Class]\n'Hm…' he guessed that it was actually interesting, he had absolutely no information about this one after all.\n[The domination class is possibly the most powerful class in this world, but it is also the hardest!]\n[Classifiers who own this class are bound by many rules:\n-Their life is immediately set to HELL mode, meaning that enemies are a lot stronger while fighting them.\n-The amount of experience needed to level up is also increased by a ton, but in exchange, every level up grants a lot more power than any other class.\n-The monsters are stronger, but they also grant more EXP!]\n'Huh… I guess the amount of experience needed between each of my levels is indeed much more than anyone else…'\nThinking that was all, Stark continued walking toward the exit of the boss area: the mansion, as a portal had appeared there.\n[WAIT.]\nA crimson panel that exuded a menacing aura appeared again before.\n[5 days left until the 'First Domination Trial', GOOD LUCK]\n'The fuck? It stopped me again for that?' this was all that appeared in front of him, and once that panel disappeared, nothing else came, 'The trial is happening in five days…?'\nSubconsciously, Stark remembered that such a thing was written on his status window, and so he decided to open it.\n…\n[Level:] 11\n[Health:] 578/1450\n[Bloodline:] Human\n[Class:] Domination\n[Info about class:] The first Domination Trial is in 5 days, good luck.\n[Talent:] Chosen one\n[Attributes:] Strength 103; Speed 92; Mind/Soul 73; Stamina 73; Defense 78\n[Skills:] Spatial Inventory; Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv5; Focus lv3; Aura Smash lv4, Clone Frenzy lv2\n…\n'What the hell is the domination trial…' Somehow, he had a really bad feeling about it, one that told him he would meet his end there.\nThe fact it was so soon meant he wouldn't be able to look for an academy/organization/guild to go to after showing his achievements to the world.\nThe first thing he would need to do was to… participate in that thing.\nStark was a bit overwhelmed by the new information about the Domination class, but he didn't have much time to think about it.\nHe had to focus on selling his items and on the impending \"Domination Trial\" in five days.\nHe reached the portal that was beyond the mansion's door, and after giving one last look to the embarassed Lana, he passed through it.\n'Fuck that shit, i'll find a way…' he thought.",

      "content": "With new information about the Domination class in mind, Stark appeared in the area where he had first entered the [City Ruins] from, in Leforia.\n[Congratulations on completing the rift, Stark Heartsouls]\nThis panel appeared as soon as he left, of course invisible to everyone but him.\nThere were still a lot of people still outside the [City Ruins], mostly just engaging in pointless conversations and forming teams, while some others just procrastinated or waited for the first layers to be less crowded.\nSome people noticed him coming out of the rift, but of course they just thought he was another one of those that took a break as many did.\nAnd right after that…\n[THIS RIFT HAS BEEN COMPLETED BY REDACTED]\nThis giant red text appeared above the portal to the dungeon, taking everyone aback as they hadn't expected it.\n\"WHAT?\"\n\"SO SOON, BUT I DIDN'T EVEN ENTER?\"\nPanic spread through the crowd, and after a few seconds…\n~BOOM~\nFive beams of lights appeared at the entrance area, it was the Golden Dragons military group.\n\"Is there some kind of issue with the rift…?\" their leader, Oliver, wondered, unable to understand how could it be completed so fast.\nThey had expected at least three days, giving the time for all the students to gain experience and sort out the ones unfit to fight the enemies.\nYuli, a white-haired girl beside him, analyzed the portal for a bit, using some sort of skill to check out whatever was happening, \"No… the boss has truly been defeated by someone…\"\n\"Ohoh~\" Oliver chuckled, we have a high potential individual/team in our hands, don't we, \"Welp, the rules are the rules, order everyone to be back here in less than 30 minutes.\"\nIt had only been half a day since the start of the 'Class Showcase', and yet it had already ended.\n\"It is unfortunate,\" Alex, a magus with a blue staff in his hands, sighed, \"We'll find some way to make the students gain more experience, probably just by allowing them to go back inside the rift, but for now we need everyone to leave for a check-up…\"\n'…' Meanwhile, Stark stopped in the distance beside some other classifiers who hadn't even gone inside, no one would ever suspect that he was the one who did it, except if Lana spilled the beans, and even if she did, he honestly had no issues showing his powers.\nSome of the Golden Dragons went inside to relay the message about the immediate call back of everyone inside.\nAll of them had also received the message of defeat of the boss, and it was an understatement to say that they were shocked.\nAnd after thirty minutes… all of those still alive after the few hours inside the rift had already gone out, some annoyed they weren't able to keep going, others relieved as the world inside was terrifying.\nThose that didn't come out had either been killed by monsters, an unfortunate end, but proof that they weren't fit for this life, while the remainder had been cursed by the black sun, forcing them to transform into these… beasts.\nThe Golden Dragons after making sure everything was set used a [Voice Enhance] spell to make sure everyone heard them.\n\"The busses that will bring you back to Fellarburg will be coming in less than an hour, until then we will be holding an inspection on everyone!\"\nDozens of men in black suit were postponed all around the perimeter of the dungeon, and most people hadn't even noticed their presences until they were actually pointed at by Oliver.\n\"Please do not do anything reckless, these men are trained to be violent in case of any sign of resistance.\"\nTheir suits were shining, proof that they were actually enhanced to increase their defense, and the atmosphere around them made it obvious they would be at least level 50 or above.\n'All that for low-levels students…?' Stark thought, and his mind immediately went to the scenario of them forcibly taking items from people.\nLuckily enough, he had [Spatial Inventory], meaning no one beside him could ever find these items as long as he didn't take them out.\nAs a giant queue was beginning to form around all the different 'inspectors', Stark like many who were uncertain just stood in the middle of ruins, waiting for time to pass.\nAnd suddenly… after ten minutes of that.\n\"YOU!\" Stark heard a voice from behind, and when he turned to look, he saw an angry Daniel running toward him alongside his goons, \"I FOUND YOU!\"\n'Does this guy want to get beat up again…?'With determination in his eyes, Stark braced himself for the confrontation with Daniel and his minions.\nHearing Daniel's shout, most people in the crowd began looking at him, and even those from afar tried hard to see what the commotion was about.\n\"I didn't find you in the dungeon, and it was because you didn't even enter it, you fucking pussy,\" he laughed, his steel sword in hand.\nIn response, Stark just stared at him, confused.\n\"Uh… okay.\"\n\"You got lucky the first time we fought, but this time… it's over, i'm really gonna kill you!\" his sword began glowing with a silver aura.\n\"Holy shit, what's happening?\" someone spoke.\n\"Are they fighting?\" another replied.\nEven the Golden Dragons watched from afar.\n\"Should we stop them,\" Alex wondered, he frankly enjoyed this type of drama, but not among young folks that weren't even adults yet.\n\"No,\" Oliver smiled, a bright aura shining in his eyes, \"I think we should let them do whatever they want, if someone dies, then it means they weren't fit to be a classifier.\"\nBack to Stark, he just stood there, a neutral expression on his face, looking down.\nTo most people, it just meant that he knew he was cornered with no way out, and that he was just begging for mercy.\nBut no, it was the complete opposite: he was stopping himself from laughing.\nAfter a few seconds, the black-haired boy looked up, a wide grin on his face, \"So let me guess, you wanna fight again?\"\nHis confidence was enough to even make Daniel uncomfortable, a drop of sweat pouring from his forehead.\n\"Yes asshole, i'm going to kill you-\" the tanned boy doubled down though, ready to slash Stark with his sword.\n\"Domination!\" Stark didn't waste time and activated his main skill, aura enveloping his hands and feet.\nHe was ready to avoid Daniel's attack and absolutely decimate him in front of everyone.",

      "content": "His fists full of aura, Stark positioned himself for the battle against Daniel, and this time there would be no deathless duel or anything of the sort, it was all or nothing.\n\"I am going to kill you…\" Daniel was starting to doubt his judgment now, the atmosphere around Stark was different than it was ten seconds ago for some reason.\nBut he couldn't let it show that he was hesitating, he was part of the Pridel family, one of the biggest ones in Fellarburg, if not the entire world.\nLuckily for him though, someone came to stop whatever was happening: Lana Moonless.\n\"Stop whatever you're doing,\" she spoke with an emotionless voice, placing herself between the two.\n\"Oh my god, that's Lana!\"\n\"THE Lana? From the Moonless family, the ones that own lots of businesses, guilds, and are all extremely powerful…?\"\n\"I heard her father is called the 'Archer King'…\"\nFrankly, Lana would never stoop so low as to stop ongoing battles between people as she all considered that extremely childish, but for some reason… she felt like she needed to stop this one, and it's totally not because Stark is there, obviously!\n\"Lana, what are you doing?\" Daniel showed his soft spot for the blonde-haired archer, unable to defy anything she said, both because of his obsession for her and because her family was stronger.\nStark, on the otherhand just looked at her with a neutral expression, it was as if his eyes were staring at her soul.\n\"That black-haired guy is done for… of course Lana is gonna side with Daniel!\"\n\"It's business matter, that guy is cornered.\"\n\"I guess the weak really should just stay back huh…\"\nLana really wanted to say something to Stark at that moment, not to criticize him or anything, just to make sure everything was alright, but seeing his expression and aura while looking at her, she switched her gaze and looked at Daniel.\n\"Aren't you tired of causing problems,\" she spoke to him, giving him a harsh look, completely different from her expression with Stark, \"Seriously… I HATE men like you…\" she groaned and began walking toward Stark.\n\"W-what the?\" Daniel was astonished, he had not expected to be called out by Lana in such a way.\nAnd honestly, no one did, they all expected her to lash out at Stark for being a nuisance.\n'Well, she's going toward him anyway, so he is also getting it!' Daniel smirked again, ready to see Lana unleash another barrage of insults at him.\nBut… when she approached Stark, none of this happened.\nShe just grabbed his arm and took him away, toward one of the men in black.\nThey disappeared into the crowd before anyone could do anything, and everyone present to see the scene was left speechless, Daniel the first.\nHe had known Lana since she was little, falling in love with her the first time he saw her as a little girl, and their families were on good terms, so to him, everything was going well.\nWhen they reached middle school, he relentlesly persued her, but she would always shrug him off, not even interested in him a single bit.\nAnd it wasn't like she was making a bad choice: Daniel is a hypocrite, vowing his love to her but still sleeping around.\nJust like that, the inspection kept going.\n***\nWhen it was Lana's turn to be inspected, the guards let her pass without checking anything: it was obvious, she was famous and her father was probably the boss of these guys, no wonder they didn't check her.\nStark on the otherhand was right behind the blonde archer, and of course, he was stopped like everybody else.\n\"Please show us the items you acquired, and inform us about what you did in the rift.\"\n\"No items,\" he lied, \"And also, I am the one that beat-\" he tried to speak about his achievements to the guard, after all Stark was someone who loved to boast.\nBut Lana came to interrupt them, \"He is with me, no need to inspect him either.\"\n\"But miss, we were tasked to-\" the guard was put in a tough spot, he had been given strict instructions to not let anyone that isn't Lana or from a big faction/family pass without a search\n\"This guy is my friend, is it so hard to understand or do you want me to tell my father about it?\" she hated abusing her powers, but this time was a special occasion as she didn't want Stark to tell them about his fight with the boss.\n\"V-Very well!\" the guard let Stark pass, \"Next in line!\"\nAnd so just like that, Stark was allowed out.\nThe busses had already arrived by now, and people were leaving little by little.\n\"Welp, thank you I guess,\" Stark smiled before heading toward a half-full bus that was ready to take off in less than five minutes.\nIt was currently around midnight, and so all he wanted to do was take advantage of this ride to sleep.\nHe sat on a bus chair (with no one beside him), and yawned, he had been the one that probably had done the most things inside the rift, so of course he was tired.\n'I just want to sleep…' he closed his eyes, and after a few seconds, he sensed a presence beside him, \"…?\"\nHe looked to his right, just to see Lana, \"Do you have a crush on me or something? Why are you following me?\" he asked.\n\"HUH? ME? There are just no other chairs beside this one I feel comfortable sitting on!\"\nStark took a few seconds to notice many empty chairs in the bus, but just decided it wasn't worth it, and went back to closing his eyes.\nSoon enough, he fell asleep.\n***\n(Many hours later)\nThe sun was starting to rise, casting its warm rays through the windows of the bus. Stark slowly stirred, feeling the uncomfortable stiffness in his neck and shoulders. He opened his eyes and sat up, blinking away the gritty remnants of sleep from his eyes.\nThey had finally arrived back at the Lotus Academy, and soon enough most of the people left the bus, greeted by their parents or other figures related to them.\nFor this special occasion, even Lana's father, the 'Archer King' went to check on his daughter, hugging her as soon as she left the bus, Stark right behind her.\n\"My little princess, did you do well?\" he smiled, a proof that he really cared about his daughter.\n\"Of course I did, dad, I beat the boss!\"\n\"THAT'S MY GIRL,\" he was extremely tall with blond hair and a beard, and lifted her up while spinning.\nStark wasn't interested in such a scene, and so he decided to go back to his hotel room as nobody had come to check on him, he had a rough day ahead of him as he wanted to sell his items, and maybe, just maybe, try to find anything related to that Domination Trial.\nBut right as he was about to leave…\n\"Wait, you,\" Lana's father shouted, and gestured for him to approach him, for some reason, he had the feeling that Stark was an important person.",

      "content": "\"Wait, you,\" Lucas, Lana's father, called out, he was able to spot Stark's aura thanks to his formidable archer eyes, and of course that's how he was able to spot people with high potential.\nHis daughter was the same, which was how she knew if someone only wanted to speak to her because they had ulterior motives, and also able to gouge their strength that way.\nStark was one of the few people that were actually genuine and strong, so he decided to call out to him.\n\"Oh come on,\" Stark rolled his eyes, he didn't want to get involved in such a matter, and so he did the thing he thought was best in this situation: run away.\nAnybody else that was called by the Archer King would of jumped in joy since it was an opportunity to get closer to the big boss and his daughter, yet Stark just wanted to rest and sell his items.\n\"Hahahahahahah~\" Lucas laughed, he of course had the speed to catch up to Stark instantly, but didn't bother to do as it was more interesting this way, \"He seems to be important to you, Lana!\"\n\"H-Huh?\" she didn't understand how her father could see that, and she visibly blushed at his remark, \"W-well… just a friend…\"\n\"A friend is more than enough for me, finally someone that can understand you, I feel like he is gonna achieve great things!\" and so the two of them climbed inside a luxurious car that had been waiting for them and took off.\n***\nStark went to his hotel room, which was only around ten minutes away from his middle school, Lotus Academy.\nHe arrived in his room, and it was the same as ever, thankfully they hadn't given it to another person as he hadn't come back for an entire day because of the 'Class Showcase'.\nHe took his wallet with him, it contained his credit card, debit card and student card, which would probably make things easier for him.\nHis phone was also on a table beside his bed, and out of frustration, he grabbed it and decided a few pass-codes.\n[1234… INCORRECT]\n[2024… INCORRECT]\n[0000… INCORRECT]\n'…' he thought for a few seconds, and an idea came to mind as he took his student card in hand, 'Even in my previous world, my phone code was the same…'\nStark's birthday was the 21st of May, and so that meant…\n[2105…]\nAnd surprisingly, it actually did work.\n'Holy shit, the FBI needs to hire me!' he was proud of himself.\nBut not wanting to waste time, he took his wallet and phone with him and left the hotel room.\nHe had done his research beforehand, and so instead of taking his time to rest or go back to the library to acquire information, he hailed for a taxi and drove to the biggest classifier trading district in all of Fellarburg.\nIt took him only 20 minutes since he was close to the center of the city he was in.\n\"Thank you for the ride,\" he thanked his driver and exited the car, now standing in the bustling trading district of Fellarburg.\nIt was around 7am in the morning, yet hundreds of people were coming and going from different buildings and talking to one another.\nThe buildings around him had massive neon signs hanging above them, advertising various items and services that could be bought and sold at their respective establishments.\nStark walked past the familiar sounds of negotiations and deals being made, his heart pounding with anticipation.\nSoon, he arrived in front of the biggest building of them all, and the one that attracted the most people.\n\"Classifiers Trading Association,\" he mumbled, and guessed that it was probably the right place to be at.\nHe entered the building, leaving the bustling streets behind him, he frankly didn't enjoy the noise too much as he would much rather stay in silence, something he had inherited from his past and calm life.\nInside, he found himself in a massive lobby with a high ceiling and bustling with other classifiers who were here for the same purpose as Stark.\nAll over the place, holographic screens could be seen advertising items, equipments and weapons that could be useful to people.\nFeeling a bit lost because of the sheer amount of people, Stark stopped for a few seconds to observe his surroundings.\nThankfully enough though, a woman in a stylish suit approached him with a friendly smile, \"Welcome to the Classifiers Trading Association, sir, how may I help you today?\"\nHer attitude, posture and entire posture had probably been rehearsed hundreds of time to make her seem as friendly and professional as possible, and even Stark couldn't deny that it was working.\n\"I'm looking to sell some items i've acquired inside a dungeon recently,\" Stark explained, smiling back.\n\"Oh~ very well, please follow me to one of our special rooms and I will call a professional appraiser to evaluate the prices.\"\nThe receptionist didn't seem very interested in him based on her expression, after all, the 'Classifiers Trading Association' was mainly interested in buying items and weapons that were from higher classed rifts, and Stark's appearance screamed \"hey I just started my life as a classifier\".\n'Low level items' were also appreciated since they could be bought for cheaper and were a good way to start your journey, even more so when they had perks, but it was just that, they were just temporary until you could acquire better loot as your level got higher.\nThe woman took Stark to a reception room, and inside of it, sitting on a couch, was a middle-aged man with glasses and a soon-to-be balding head.\nHe was enjoying a cup of coffee while using his phone, probably just waiting for his next customer.\nAnd so as soon he saw Stark, he switched his attitude and went into 'business' mode.\nStark sat in front of the man, neither of them exchanging a greeting as they knew they were here for one thing: trading.\n'Spatial Inventory,' Stark with a blank expression opened the void that stored his items, which appeared beside him and surprised the man.\nThen he thought about the items he acquired in the rift, and suddenly, he was able to grab them.\nHe pulled out the [Low-Level Magic Staff] and the [Ice Bow], placing them in front of the table.\n\"What a weird… skill?\" the man stared, confused.\n\"Don't worry about it, just check these items please,\" Stark smiled, staring at the man with his deep aura-filled eyes.\nThe man nodded and began to examine the items.\nAfter a minute or two, he put the staff down, then spoke, \"the staff seems of bad quality and only of common rarity, we are ready to offer 53,000 rher coins for it.\"\nRher coins are the currency of this world, and yes, that stupid god of fate actually named the money after himself.\n\"Hm…\" Stark thought, but was satisfied enough with the first price even though it was extremely low, possibly because it was one of the lowest rated piece of equipment there was, \"I accept.\"\n\"Very well,\" the man grabbed the staff and put it beside him, then immediately began inspecting the bow, which interested him much more.",

      "content": "The appraiser grabbed the ice bow from the table, and just like with the staff, he grabbed a magnifying glass enhanced with the [Appraise] spell and began inspecting every centimeter of it.\nIt took him much more than with the staff, instead of a minute, he spent around five just inspecting and mumbling, \"Hm~\"; \"Interesting~\"; \"Ohoh~\".\nAfter that, the appraiser put the bow on the table and smiled at Stark, \"Our association is willing to exchange this bow for around 150,000 rher coins.\"\nAt first, Stark was ecstatic as he was gonna be able to pay off many things he needed in his journey, and maybe rent an actual appartment instead of that expensive hotel he was in.\nSuch an amount would guarantee some people to live comfortably for many months, yet for a classifier, this was a sum that would disappear as soon as he wanted to buy better equipment, skill scrolls or items.\nYet, somehow, Stark felt a hunch, and decided to activate his [Perception] skill to check out the bow.\n…\n[Item:] Ice Bow\n[Type:] Bow\n[Class:] Archer\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Required Level:] 20\n[Quality:] Good\n[Attributes:] +30 speed, +20 Stamina\n[Special Perks:] While using this bow, arrows have a 5% chance to freeze enemies\n[Price:] 180,000\n…\nA new category had appeared all of a sudden, one that wasn't available for even the staff, maybe it was because his skill felt that it was unfair and showed him the actual fair price.\n\"Are you trying to scam me?\" Stark looked at the man with a deep menacing stare, grabbing the bow from the table, \"This bow should be worth at least 180,000 rher coins.\"\n\"Yes but…\" the man suddenly explained to Stark that even though what he was saying was right, the association still need a marge to profit from the items that were bought.\n'…' Stark looked at him for a few seconds as he explained, \"I want 165,000 rher coins.\"\n\"Very well,\" the appraiser gave up and agreed to the amount before grabbing the bow and putting it beside him, \"You would be a great businessman sir, are you maybe interesting in joining us-\"\n\"I'd rather not,\" Stark immediately answered.\n\"Very well, then please register your name in the association's data base and we will proceed with the payment in the shortest of times,\" the man gave Stark a tablet, and so he did as he was told.\nSoon after, Stark was allowed to leave the reception room and found himself yet again in the lobby of the 'Classifiers Trading Association', there were still hundreds of people walking around, and several hallways leading to different sections of the giant building.\n[Market Section]\nA sign next to it explained: \"Where people can buy/sell/trade items with the help of a middle-man from the association, it can range from armor, weapons, items and equipment.\"\n[Gambling Section]\n'Gambling? Seriously?' Stark had experience in his past life, and he sure as hell wasn't taking that chance in here either.\n[Party Formation Section]\n'Self explanatory I guess…'\nAfter scouring the area for another 30 minutes, Stark decided it was time to leave, plus a notification on his phone alerted him to a deposit of 218,000 rher coins into his account, bringing a sense of satisfaction to him.\nExiting the bustling 'Classifiers Trading Association', he emerged onto the crowded streets, now even more packed due to the \"busy hour\" rush.\n'Classifier' was probably the most dangerous job in this world as you could probably start your day thinking you would gather material inside a dungeon, and never come out of it, so that's why many just enjoyed their life of luxury.\nStark made his way into a nearby clothing shop. Despite his eccentric taste in fashion, he purchased four sets of decent shirts and pants to replace his now dirtied middle-school uniform, he obviously put them inside the [Spatial Inventory].\n'I guess that's it for today,' he was satisfied, and while navigating the streets of the giant trading district, which went on for kilometers upon kilometers, Stark decided to open his phone and look out for information.\n[Domination Trial] was what he typed in the search bar, but even after many minutes of searching, absolutely no information came out, it was either it was censored, or that no one had ever talked about it online.\n'…' this put Stark in a bad situation, after all he had five days before the first domination trial, and having no information with such a thing was suicide.\nHe didn't know how hard it would be, but even his status panel had told him that he would 'suffer'.\n\"Ah~ this is gonna be difficult-\" not seeing where he was walking because of his focus in his search, Stark bumped into someone, managing to balance himself not to fall.\nHe instinctively looked up, and once he did, he saw a giant man, at least 195cm tall, muscles all over his arms, legs and body, as well as red hair and a beard; there were two women gripping his arms, their breasts pushed against him.\n\"Can you not see where you are going, kid?\" the man spoke, looking down on Stark.\n\"Oh, i'm sorry I wasn't watching-\" Stark was the type to not seek unwanted problems, so he just apologized and began moving on.\nBut of course, annoying people will always be annoying.\n\"You think you can get away after that?\" the man replied, driven by the thought of his pride being hurt and to impress the women in his arms.\n\"Yes, I think I can,\" Stark looked back, he had already apologized, and if someone wanted to cause problems, he sure as hell was gonna retort.\nAt this point, many people in the streets stopped to look at whatever was happening: it wasn't that rare for two classifiers to disagree and duel, most of the times it would break into a fight that would be recorded and sent all over the internet, the winner of course being praised.\n\"Let's settle this the 'adult' way, kid,\" the tall man laughed, and the two girls that were holding his arms stepped back, a circle had now formed around them, many other classifiers holding their phones, filming the scene.\n'What the fuck is happening?' Stark, a neutral expression on his face, wondered, he was just walking minding his own business, yet somehow it had turned out like this in less than a minute.\nAnd suddenly… a crimson panel appeared in front of Stark, one he had already seen before.\n[Duel Request: Aaron]\n[Type: Deathless]\n[Y/N]\n'…' Stark smirked, 'I'm going to destroy that guy.'",

He had learned that people would always look for reasons to stir up trouble, and sometimes, it was hard to avoid such situations.\nHe hailed for a taxi and after a short ride, arrived in front of his hotel, where his room was waiting for him.\nNot even bothering to change clothes, he jumped on his bed, plunging his head into his pillow even though it was only around 8am.\nAnd soon… he fell asleep.\n***\nBy a string of fate, though, Stark found himself in the same space he had first entered when he slept beside the bonfire inside the [City Ruins].\nIn his sleep, he saw the infinite void, stretching on and on, and of course, just like last time, the doppelganger of himself could be seen in the distance, standing idle and smiling.\n\"Maybe it can help…\" he mumbled, approaching it slowly, though he found it hard.\nPanels appeared in front of him each time he got closer to the other him.\n[The Domination Trial starts in 5 days, it is something every person with the 'domination' class must go through once they reach the adequate level.]\n'…'\n[Though these trials are extremely hard, they aren't impossible: there is always a way to survive, but it depends on the person inside the trial.]\n'…'\n[These trials are classified in five categories: Hell, Nightmare, Doom, Godless, Death.]\n[These are based on luck, but are still possible, just much harder.]\n'Keep pushing,' he was getting closer and closer to the other Stark, who was still smiling, almost inviting him to come.\n[Those that complete the domination trials are granted incredible rewards, so be one of them, Stark Heartsouls.]\nHe was now right infront of his other self, but as he extanded his arm to touch it, the figure vanished, and the world began to shake again.\n[Good luck, more information will be given later.]\nAnd then, Stark woke up.\n***\n~Beep, Beep, Beep~\n'Hm…?' Stark opened his eyes, hearing the sound of his phone ringing beside him even though he had set no alarm.\nHe didn't know how much time had passed, but it was still morning and the sun was in the sky, so it couldn't have been more than a few hours, right?\nTaking a few seconds to adjust to his surroundings, he grabbed his phone to see who was calling him on this number.\n[Unknown number]\n'…'\nHe didn't know who it was, maybe someone close to Stark, although he doubted that since no one had called him before and that he wasn't liked in general.\nCuriosity got the better of him, and he pressed the green button to answer the call.\n\"Hello?\" he heard an extremely familiar voice on the other side.\n\"…\" Stark blinked a few times, trying to make sense of it, \"Lana…? Is that you?\"\n\"O-Oh, you found me out! What have you been doing these past two days, i've been calling you non-stop yet you weren't answering at all!\"\n\"The past two days? What are you talking about-\" Stark didn't know what she was talking about, after all there was no way that…?\nHe looked to his right, and he saw a panel that confirmed what she said:\n[The first Domination Trial is in 3 days, good luck.]\n'Ah shit…'\nHe had slept for two entire days, maybe it was because of that weird dream of his, or because he used so much aura inside the rift that he was finally able to rest from all the action.\nIn the end, it didn't matter.\n\"How do you even have my phone number? I don't remember giving it to you,\" Stark raised an eyebrow, confused as to how the archer got his contact.\n\"Huh… surprise…?\" on the other end of the call, Lana was lying on her stomach on her bed, swinging her legs back and forth while in her luxurious condo in the capital of Fellarburg, \"Anyway, it doesn't matter, I have called you for a job opportunity!\"\n\"Not interested,\" he tried to hang up.\n\"WAIT! It involves getting stronger, and i'm sure you won't be going back to the [City Ruins], so it's a good way to increase your level!\"\n\"…\" Stark wasn't interested at all, after all he had the domination trial to expect in three days, but… \"Okay, just explain.\"\n\"It's a level 35-50 Hell-Level rift that just appeared, many classifiers will be there to explore it-\"\n\"NOW WE'RE TALKING!\" Stark nodded.\n\"Well, I won't talk more on the phone, let's set up a meeting in the capital, and we'll meet there in one week as I have things to do in the meantimes\"\n\"…\" Stark thought about how long it would take for him to beat the Domination Trial, but not knowing the answer, he still responded positively to her request, \"Okay, i'll try to be there, but not guaranteed.\"\nAnd just like that, both of them hang up the call.",

      "content": "Stark got up from his bed, feeling refreshed and slightly more awake.\nChecking the date on his phone and based on the fact the Domination Trial was now in 3 days, Stark guessed that he had truly slept for two entire days, something no normal person should be doing.\nAfter taking a shower and changing his clothes into ones he had bought two days ago, he felt extremely hungry, and went outside to eat.\nAnd so, just like that, Stark passed the time.\n…\n[The first Domination Trial is in 2 days, good luck.]\n…\n[The first Domination Trial is in 1 days, good luck.]\n…\n[The first Domination Trial is in 12 hours, good luck.]\n…\nThe last days went on smoothly without anything happening, Stark spent them mostly outside exploring Fellarburg to familiarize himself and have fun before the big day.\nLana didn't contact him anymore either, maybe because she truly had things to do, or because she felt like it would be too obvious she was stalking him if she did that.\nAny how, these days passed peacefully while Stark regained his strenght, now able to confidently fight through another rift if possible.\nBased on the timer shown in his status window, the Domination Trial would start at exactly midnight of the next day, and even though he had no idea how this trial worked and how he would even go there, Stark still waited.\n***\nOn his last night of sleep, Stark dreamt yet again of that void with the other Stark looking at him, a blank expression on his face\nAnd surprisingly, he was able to talk.\n\"Is this… an obligation?\" he asked.\n\"Yes,\" the doppelganger nodded, \"Everyone with the 'Domination' class that successfully awakened will go through it, and as you know, those who succeed are granted an amazing reward.\"\n\"Okay, and what are my chances of actually completing it?\"\n\"Hm…\" he put his hands against his chin, \"I would give you a good 1/10000 chance of you getting out of there alive.\"\n\"A 1/10000 chance?\" Stark's eyes widened in disbelief.\nThe other Stark simply nodded, a solemn expression on his face.\n\"But don't worry,\" he continued, \"It's a fair challenge. It's just that only a small amount of people complete it.\"\nStark frowned, but he couldn't help but feel a sense of determination. This trial might be nearly impossible, but he was a 'Domination' class fighter. He had to give it his best shot.\nAs the doppelganger vanished once more, the world around Stark began to shake violently, and he woke up, his heart pounding in his chest.\n\"21:37…\" he checked the time on his phone as he decided to sleep the entire day to be in perfect condition.\n[The First Domination Trial is in 2 hours 23 minutes]\nStark looked out of the window, the streets of Fellarburg were starting to fill with the bustling nightlife. He took a deep breath, calming his nerves.\nTonight, everything would change.\n…\n[The First Domination Trial is in 1 hours 52 minutes]\nIn the two hours leading to the Domination Trial, Stark found himself restlessly pacing around his apartment.\n[The First Domination Trial is in 1 hours 15 minutes]\nThe anticipation of the unknown was almost too much to handle, but he couldn't afford to lose focus now.\n[The First Domination Trial is in 30 minutes]\nNo information, nothing but himself and his class to survive.\n[The First Domination Trial is in 10 minutes]\nOnce the ten minutes mark was reached, more panels began to appear around Stark as he kept going back and forth in his room.\n[Upon the timer reaching 0, you will be forcibly put to sleep, in a state of unconsciousness nothing will be able to get you out of: it is either you complete the trial or… become one of 'them']\n[The level of the trial will be decided the moment you enter it, each trial has a different theme and different challenges, so use your brain]\nIt was almost as if the class in itself was giving him a tutorial to increase his chances of survival.\n…\n[The First Domination Trial is in 1 minute]\nThe timer ticked down to its final seconds, and Stark felt a sudden surge of energy coursing through his veins.\nIt was time.\nAs the last second struck, the room around Stark dissolved into a swirling vortex of darkness.\nHe struggled to keep his eyes opened even though he had slept the entire day, almost as if a curse had been put on him.\n[Do not fight it.]\n'…'\nStark's consciousness faded.\n***\nAnd then he opened his eyes again, finding himself in a competely different realm.\nBut there was nothing around him, it was just black void again, almost making him believe if he wasn't in the dream world again.\nHe was soon proven to be wrong as a panel appeared.\n[Information every classifier gets before the trial! Please read carefully!]\n[Stark Heartsouls; Code Name: \"The Chosen\"]\n'…'\n[Your goal: get to the end of the trial alive, do not die (you aren't affected by hunger and thirst inside)]\nThe screen faded away, and Stark was left standing in complete darkness, unsure of what to do or where to go.\n[Good luck, it will be needed.]\n'Okay,' he nodded.\nAnd suddenly, his surroundings began to change, the black void beginning to be replaced by a small clearing, surrounded by impenetrable walls and flowers everywhere.\nFor a second, it almost felt like he was sent somewhere peaceful.\nBut the crimson text that appeared afterward brought him back to reality.\n[Domination Trial: Glass Purgatory]\n[Difficulty: DEATH]\n'Ah shit…'\nThis was the most difficult category of them all.\nAs he stood in the center of the clearing, Stark couldn't believe what was happening. His surroundings were no longer just a black void, but now a strange and surreal landscape.\nThe ground beneath his feet was made up of gravel and dirt, leading up to towering walls that boxed him in.\nPillars rose up to the sky, casting long shadows across the area.\nBut what caught Stark's attention even more were the skeletons scattered at the base of each pillar, dozens upon dozens of them, their bones bleached white by some unknown force.\nIt was an eerie sight.\nAnd in the middle of it all, there was a giant mirror, reflecting everything around it, its frame made out of human bones.\nJust as he was trying to make sense of it all, Stark heard a voice behind him. Turning around, he saw four figures resting against a pillar, their eyes fixed on him.\n\"Looks like the last one is here,\" one of them said, breaking the silence.\n\"Hm… Is it time to start the trial then?\"\n\"I guess so… but don't be too hasty, it is a 'Death' difficulty one after all…\"\nStark was confused: why wasn't he alone.\nAnd just as he thought of that, a panel appeared.\n[The five most promising new 'Domination' class users have been chosen to participate in this trial, have fun =)]\n'Ah shit…' Stark looked at the four figures, not trusting them at all as they were just like him: people who would do anything to survive this trial and its challenges.\nAnd so just like that, the Domination Trial began.",

      "content": "Stark stared at the four other 'Domination' users that were with him in this trial.\n\"Seriously? Only guys here…? Man this is gonna be a sausage party…!\" a muscle-head with black hair held his forehead, laughing out loud.\n\"Shut up, we aren't here to have fun,\" another boy with short white hair replied, he seemed to be of the extroverted type.\n[These are the other participants of the trial, stay together to increase your chances of survival or… go alone (not recommended)]\n\"Can we at least introduce ourselves,\" a green-haired boy adjusted his glasses and smiled, \"We were waiting for the last one before doing anything after all.\"\n\"Who cares about that, all of us are gonna die anyways, this is a death difficulty trial…\" a nervous looking boy finished, he had short red hair and a burn scar on his right cheek.\nStark raised an eyebrow, this wasn't what he expected, but it seemed like they were all just like him, although their aura indicated that they weren't clueless either.\n'The 5 most promising new 'Domination' class users,' he remembered this panel, meaning that in this small clearing with the mirror in the middle were the domination users with the most potential to be the strongest, maybe some of them were stronger than him…\nJust as he thought of that… a panel appeared above the mirror, and all the guys looked at it.\n[5 minutes to enter the 'Glass Purgatory' before 'Skeleton Revival']\n\"The skeletons are gonna wake up probably,\" Stark spoke for the first time, pointing at the skeletons at the feet of the pillars, their eyes were shining, giving their owners an unnervingly lifelike appearance.\n\"Well then let's introduce ourselves quickly, code name is Dreamer,\" the glassed-man spoke, referring to himself with the code name he was given in the void, just like Stark.\n\"Oh~ We're doing that?\" the white-haired one spoke, \"then my name is Hero!\"\n\"Chosen,\" Stark introduced himself too.\n\"Orasio…\" the nervous boy added.\n\"Just so you fuckers know,\" the muscled man, who was much older than the rest, looking at least twenty-five years of age, talked, \"I am not your friend and I will never be, this is just a temporary alliance to get out of this shit-hole, the name's Boxer by the way.\"\n[2:38 minutes remaining before the 'Skeleton Revival']\nThe atmosphere in the clearing was tense, all the boys looked at one another.\n[Participants: Chosen, Dreamer, Hero, Orasio, Boxer]\n\"Let's go, then,\" Dreamer advanced toward the mirror in the middle of the clearing, after all it seemed to be the most obvious way to get inside the 'Glass Purgatory'.\nThe others followed closely, and after a few seconds, they found themselves in front of the glass that reflected their appearance perfectly.\nBut this wasn't all they saw: in the reflection, a huge doorway leading to a long corridor could be seen, looming over them.\n\"What the?\" Orasio turned around, but of course, there was nothing behind them.\nIt was inside the mirror.\n\"I guess that makes sense,\" Hero put his arm forward and touched the glass, but nothing happened.\nThey expected to be able to pass through the glass to begin their descent of the 'Glass Purgatory', but even entering it was a difficult task it seemed.\n[1:32 minutes remaining before the 'Skeleton Revival']\nThey tried many things in thirty seconds, which seemed like hours for them: hitting the glass, rushing toward it, slowly reaching it, activating their aura, but none of it worked.\nStark stared from afar with a blank expression, he had noticed that even though the boys had activated their aura, they never went as far as to show their powers, probably all cautious as they couldn't trust anybody.\n\"Let me try something,\" after analyzing for a bit, he decided to act.\n[22 seconds remaining before the 'Skeleton Revival']\nMaking way for him, the others allowed Stark to place himself in front of the mirror.\nAnd so he did something illogical: instead of heading toward the mirror, he went backward all the while keeping his eyes on the glass showing the corridor.\nSoon enough, he was engulfed by the walls of the mysterious hallway, entering the 'Glass Purgatory'.\n[Only those who observe the world with eyes of glass will find their way into the Purgatory]\nThe explanation appeared as soon as the puzzle was solved.\n[7 seconds remaining before the 'Skeleton Revival']\n\"HOLY SHIT,\" realizing that he was onto something, the others repeated his actions.\nAnd so just like that, they were able to enter the 'Glass Purgatory'.\n[0 seconds remaining before the 'Skeleton Revival']\n[Skeleton Revival]\nThe hundreds of skeletons in the clearing began to stir, their empty eye sockets glowing red as they slowly rose to their feet, their bones creaking and cracking with each movement.\nBut luckily for the five participants, they managed to get away from that place, and so the skeleton monsters were left standing aimlessly as no opponent was in their view.\nSoon enough, they all crumbled back.\n***\nBack to the five boys, they found themselves inside the corridor they only were able to see from the mirror's reflection.\n\"Nice thinking my guy,\" Boxer patted Stark's back.\n\"…\" Stark didn't answer, instead just looking ahead, the corridor was long, with torches illuminating the path.\nThe torches cast flickering shadows on the walls as the five boys walked cautiously down the corridor.\nEach step echoed ominously, making them acutely aware of the oppressive silence surrounding them.\nHero kept talking, possibly to enlighten the mood, but it was no use: they all knew they were in the face of death, and only themselves could save their skin.\nSurprisingly enough, they didn't meet any monsters or horrors for the ten minutes they were inside the hallway, it stretched on endlessly, so nothing surprised them.\nIn the distance, they saw a blue light.\n\"FINALLY,\" Hero jumped in joy, \"I was getting tired of these stone walls, i'm kind of claustrophobic…\"\n\"…\"\nBut as they approached the source of the blue light, their excitement turned into dread.\n[Welcome to the 'Colossal Paths', good luck participants]\nThe corridor opened up into a vast chamber, and at the circular center rested an eerie statue under a pillar of light.\nThere were no walls limiting the room, the darkness ahead made it feel like it went on infinitely.\nBut thankfully, at the center of the room, three paths converged: flights of stairs led to three gargantuan glass-faced effigies with massive mirrors under them, inviting the participants to enter.\nThese were the 'Colossal Paths'.\nThe five boys got out of the hallway and went down the stairs toward the center of the chamber, reaching a statue.\n[The Sphinx]\nSuch a name appeared above the statue, almost as if it was informing them of its name, light poured out from the face of the sphinx, a contorted grin visible and a ghastly aura enveloping the stone beast.\n\"I guess that's it,\" Dreamer advanced to examine the Sphinx, then pointed at the three paths, \"Look at the forehead of the effigies.\"\nAnd just as he said, there were numbers displayed on them, heading from 1 to 3.\nWhich meant…\n\"We need to complete all the paths and head back here,\" he pointed at the Sphinx's forehead, where three pearls could be seen, meaning that each time they completed a path, a light would manifest in that pearl.\nAnd so just like that, the participants understood what they needed to do.\n[5 participants alive]\nBut they didn't know... that only one could come out alive, since this is how the [Domination] trial works.",

This is suicide, who knows what awaits us, this is probably harder than a Death-Level rift in the real world,\" Boxer shouted at the stupidity, and the remaining three agreed with him.\nEven if somehow one of them managed to beat his path, it didn't mean the others would too, meaning they would be forced to fight all the other things that awaited them.\n\"Fighting together is the safest option,\" Dreamer spoke while adjusting his glasses, \"And don't get me wrong, I am the first to think it is a bad idea to associate with the likes of you.\"\n\"The likes of you?\" Boxer took a step toward Dreamer, his fists clenched, centimeters away from his face, \"Don't get ahead of yourself asshole.\"\n\"No need to fight… we need to win after all… killing each other isn't an option…\" Orasio put himself between the two, and somehow the atmosphere calmed down after a few seconds.\n\"The first thing to do is choose the path we take, after all we are not forced to pick the first one,\" Stark pointed at the paths and numbers, \"Trying to get rid of the easier ones is a good start.\"\n[Please choose your path.]\nAfter a moment of tense silence, Hero stepped forward and pointed confidently at the third path, marked with the number 3.\n\"How does this even make sense, let's just get to the first one to see,\" Boxer sighed, unable to understand why they wouldn't just follow the order.\n\"The order is supposed to show the difficulty, isn't it?\" Dreamer spoke, it was just a theory, but a very comprehensible one.\n\"Who ever said that? It probably doesn't even mean anything!\" Hero replied.\nStark watched them argue for a while, after all it was an important choice, taking a difficult path on their first try could end up in all of them dying, while taking an easy one could allow them to gain experience.\n\"I'm going for the first,\" Stark began walking toward the staircases of the effigy with the number 1 engraved on its forehead, and he was soon followed by Boxer, Dreamer, and Orasio.\n\"You guys aren't fun,\" Hero pouted, but still followed them regardless as it was the group that decides, and he knew deep down trying to clear another path by himself was a bad idea.\nAs the group descended the stairs of the effigy marked with the number 1, they felt a sense of foreboding wash over them.\nA massive mirror stood before them, covered in intricate carvings that seemed to shift and move as if alive.\nStark being the first in the group, he decided to push through, and was able to pass through the mirror.\n[The Glass Purgatory is a place divided between two worlds, floating in an eternal limbo between reality and illusion]\n[Its four guardians are keeping it together, kill the first three, and the path to the 'Greater One' will open, participants]\n[Once you do, the 'Glass Purgatory' will cease to be what it is and disappear]\n[Good luck]\nThis much information was shown to all the boys as they passed, and now they found themselves in yet another giant chamber, illuminated by many torches.\nStrangely enough though, there seemed to be no exit door from this place, it was giant, bigger than a football stadium, yet there was nothing other than the rocks that formed its walls and floor.\n'Wait,' Stark thought, 'Maybe it's blocked until we complete another path?'\nHe decided to turn around, but once he did, instead of facing the mirror that transported them here, he found himself staring at a stone wall.\n\"Hey, there's actually something in the distance, look closely,\" Dreamer pointed at the very far end of the room, his glasses seemed to be able to zoom.\nAnd he was right: there was a small door there.\n\"I guess that's our exit path,\" Hero took a step forward.\nBut once he did…\n[Glass Guardian #1: The Conjoined Siblings]\n[Good luck]\nThese panels appeared before everyone, and as soon as they vanished.\n~FWISH~\n~BOOM~\nA loud explosion echoed in the distance, and suddenly two figures appeared out of nowhere.\nTo the right stood a… creature, dressed in a cloak and holding a scepter. It also wore a pointed hat, giving off a witch-like appearance. The head was disturbing, with two female faces merged together in all directions.\n[The Conjoined Witch lv20], its name appeared above its head.\nNext to it stood a massive skeleton only wearing some small cloak over its head and upper half, the rest was naked, it had a necklace with a purple gem in the middle, and was brandishing a sword; just like the other monster though, it had two skeletal heads on its neck.\n[The Conjoined Warrior lv20]\nThe first guardians of this trial appeared before the five participants, and immediately all of them got ready to fight.\n[Eliminate the guardians to be able to leave]\nThis was all they needed to hear, and they all activated [Domination].\nStark of course began being enveloped by the crimson aura around his body, but it was the other four that felt new.\nBoxer, just like his name described, was now wearing magic boxing gloves around his hands, ones that gave him power and strength.\nHero had two floating swords appear in both his sides, and he didn't even bother grabbing them, instead just crossing his arms and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\nDreamer, on the other hand, had a series of floating magical books spinning around him, their content emenating a dark glow.\nFinally, Orasio had a shield materialize on his arm, its surface covered in mysterious runes that seemed to shimmer and shift with energy.\nAll of them had the [Domination] skill, yet it seemed to react differently to each of their aura, creating a unique power.\n\"Pretty cool, isn't it,\" Hero laughed, his pupils burning with a white aura.\n\"…\" none of the others replied, too focused on the boss ahead to speak now.\nStark decided to be smart and use [Perception] on his enemies like he always did.\n…\n[Name: The Conjoined Witch (GUARDIAN)]\n[Level: 20]\n[HP: 75000]\n[Strength: 50]\n[Stamina: 892]\n[Speed: 128]\n[Defense: 927]\n[Skills: Beam, Spark, Buff, Witch's Domain, Glass Attack, Life Share, Heal, Conjoined Bond, Chain Block…]\n…\n[Name: The Conjoined Warrior (GUARDIAN)]\n[Level: 20]\n[HP: 75000]\n[Strength: 721]\n[Stamina: 523]\n[Speed: 637]\n[Defense: 398]\n[Skills: Strike, Skeletal Aura, Final Stand, Warrior's Domain, Conjoined Bond, Split…]\n…\n'Ah shit, these guys are tough, and there's two of them…' Stark positioned himself for combat like the others.\nAnd thus, the first fight of the 'Domination' trial could begin.",

We need to find the guardian and beat it,\" he said after finishing his business, his eyes scanning the dark water as he stepped forward.\nBut just like last time, the moment one of them took a step forward…\n~SPLASH~\n~BOOM~\nAnother explosion echoed behind them, and once they turned their heads to see what it was.\nThey saw it.\n[Glass Guardian #2: The Black Water Devourer]",

Its razor-sharp teeth and multiple rows of fins give it a menacing and predatory appearance, and its eyes were like black holes, sucking in everything around it.\nAnd that very monster now stood in front of the four participants, looking at them.\nThey were in its territory, giving them a massive disadvantage, and yet none of them backed away.\n\"Domination!\" they all activated their powers and got ready for battle.\n[3…2…1…]\n[FIGHT!]\nThe water was shaking because of the Devourer's appearance, but it still remained fairly possible to navigate.\n\"How is this thing even fitting inside the water if it only reaches our knees, it's literally giant,\" Dreamer wondered, and it was a very good question.\n\"Don't think too much about it, trial magic I guess…\" Hero shrugged, his nonchalant attitude never went away.\nDreamer was right though, the eel-looking guardian was at least fifteen meters tall.\nIn the end, Stark shook his head, and like he always did at the start of any fight, he activated [Perception] to analyze his enemy.\n…\n[Name: Black Water Devourer (GUARDIAN)]\n[Level: 25]\n[HP: 120000]\n[Strength: 738]\n[Stamina: 1271]\n[Speed: 1128]\n[Defense: 213]\n[Skills: Tail Whip, Bite, Absorb, Reject, Toxic Coating, Reinforce, Evolution, Water Bending, Black Storm, Tidal Wave…]\n…\nHero, Dreamer and Orasio looked at Stark as he analyzed the monster, waiting for him to speak like he did the first time.\n\"…?\" after a few seconds, he turned his head and saw them staring.\n\"120000HP, it has high strength and extremely high stamina and speed, but a very low defense, we should focus on killing it as fast as we can dealing damage,\" he gave them the information they wanted all the while adding a strategy.\nEveryone nodded as they prepared for the battle.\nThe devourer's black eyes glinted, and the boys could see themselves in the reflection.\n\"Tail Whip!\"\nThe fight began as the Black Water Devourer lunged at them with its tail, sending a succession of attacks. They all dove to avoid the attack except for Orasio who used his shield to block the tail.\n\"Just how strong is your shield?\" Dreamer wondered, he was able to take on so many attacks and receive zero damage.\n\"Haha… I don't know…\" Orasio shrugged, clearly hiding something.\n\"Bite!\" seeing that its attacks were doing nothing, the devourer used another one of its skills and jumped from the water, at least ten meters in the air in Stark's direction.\n\"Focus!\" like always, he activated the skill that helped him see the attacks before they even hit.\nBut this time, it seemed different: he was able to see more, and the afterimage of the devourer was more clear than ever before.\n~SPLASH~\nThe guardian opened its mouth as it was about to snatch Stark, but the boy jumped out of the way at the perfect moment.\nHowever, the eel-like guardian swiftly changed its strategy and lunged at Dreamer, its massive tail cutting through the black water towards him. He tried to dodge, but the tail's momentum proved too strong, and he took a direct hit.\n\"Argh!\" Dreamer cried out, the pain radiating through his body. Even with his magic, he wasn't invulnerable to such attacks.\n\"-1251!\" he was injured, but quickly got up and used some of his books to cast [Healing Prayer] on himself.\n\"+1000!\" he regained most of his HP.\n'Interesting…' Stark observed from afar, gaining information on the other participants was always a plus.\nIn response, Dreamer got angry and started using his most basic skill [Spell Fury], and all the books around him began to cast spells at the devourer, who was unable to avoid them all.\n\"-462! 449! -536!\" it was hit at least a dozen times.\n\"Aura Smash!\" Stark didn't waste time either and used his skill, and this time it wasn't only his right fist that was surrounded by that aura, but his left one too.\nHe punched the air twice in the devourer's direction, and it was hit by the attacks.\n\"-8371! -7263!\"\n[Enemy stunned!]\n[Dealt massive damage to GUARDIAN, regaining 271HP!]\nThe Black Water Devourer fell into a brief stupor, unable to move its body around the water anymore.\n\"It's stunned!\" Stark shouted again, and immediately all of them took advantage.\nHero slashed the guardian with his swords three times.\n\"-18387!\"\nOrasio used his most powerful skill (that Stark knew off), [Explosive Shield], and launched it at the devourer.\n\"-16283!\"\nDreamer's [Spell Fury] had a cooldown, so he wasn't able to do anything but launch simple spells.\n\"-3634!\"\nAfter that, the devourer was able to move, but injuries could already been seen on its body as it received a massive amount of damage.\n\"Stunning enemies sure is convenient,\" Dreamer sighed.\n[Black Water Devourer HP: 58432/120000]\n'My god, it's already down to half of its health.'\nIt seemed like the devourer really had nothing on them, the fact that it was alone also made it much easier to hunt.\nMaybe the order of the paths really meant nothing, huh?\n…\n\"ABSORB!\" The devourer roared and used this skill, putting its head inside the water and absorbing some of it.\nAnd after a few seconds…\n\"REJECT!\" it used a follow-up skill, and a ray of black water came rushing toward the four boys, almost as if it was following them.\nHero cut the water using his swords, Orasio used his shield, Stark kept avoiding the rays as he saw them before they even came close.\nBut Dreamer… it seemed like LUCK wasn't on his side.\n\"FUCKING HELL,\" he shouted, forced to use his last skill to save himself, \"BARRIER!\"\nAll the books around him placed themselves in front of the ray, blocking all the damage.\nInformation was important in this place as there was no saying when any of them could betray each other, so hiding a skill or two was essential, yet now he had been forced to use all his tricks because that stupid guardian was targetting him.\n\"Tidal Wave!\" not giving them any rest, the devourer disappeared into the water.\nAfter the eel-like guardian disappeared, a giant wave could be seen coming in the distance.\n\"A tsunami?\" Hero questionned.\nThe wave was at least twenty meters tall, and was sure to hit all of them if they didn't do anything.\n\"Come close to me,\" Orasio suddenly spoke, the nervousness in his voice disappearing.\nAll the participants listened, and suddenly, Orasio lifted his shield in the air and activated [Ally Protection].\nA giant green sphere surrounded them all, and when the wave came crashing…\n~SPLASH~\n~CRACK~\nThe shield cracked, but it survived the attack.\n\"Thanks buddy,\" Hero patted Orasio, without him they would have probably all died.\n\"…\" Orasio didn't answer.\n\"Aura Smash!\" Stark sent two crimson fists at the devourer, who came out of the water after using its skill.\n\"-7382!\" but only one hit as it avoided the second.\n[Dealt massive damage to GUARDIAN, regaining 129HP!]\nThe devourer was at half HP, and the boys a bit exhausted.\nBut that's when it decided to use its ultimate skills.\n\"EVOLUTION!

To top it off, it had covered itself in a thick, toxic coating that would harm anyone who came into direct contact with it.\n'Is that the second phase?' Stark wondered.\nAnyway, Stark now knew that attacking with his fists wasn't an option anymore.\n[HP: 1238/1800]\nThanks to the necklace that gave him back life every time he hit an enemy and to his level upgrade, his HP was still fairly good, but he still didn't want to risk it.\nHe would need to keep using Aura Smash, and hope that the others attacked more than he did since all of them relied on weapons and long-ranged damage.\nEveryone watched the devourer in awe, choosing to stand still and assess the situation. The transformation was a clear indication that the guardian was preparing for an all-out attack.\n\"BLACK STORM!\"\nThe sky above became darker than it was before, and clouds appeared, lightning coming out from them.\nThe Black Water also became much more agitated than before, making it harder for them to move, even Hero and Stark, who had the highest speed of the group, struggled.\n\"Aura Smash!\" Stark sent two fists of aura again, and the monster didn't even bother to avoid it, too focused on controlling the storm.\n\"-4312! -3927!\"\n'Holy shit, it can actually tank damage now…'\n[Enemy stunned]\n'YES!'

Tail Whip! Absorb! Reject!\" the guardian was using everything in its power to kill them, but Dreamer would use his barrier and Stark just avoided.\n\"Aura Smash!\" he sent two crimson fists at the beast again.\n\"-4621! -4427!\"\nAnd after a few minutes of that…\n[Black Water Devourer HP: 12660/120000]\nThe devourer looked extremely injured, and its attacks were now so jagged that they weren't even precise enough to hit any of the targets.\nHero also finally recovered, and with his two swords in hand, he began approaching the devourer again.\nIt was the end for it: Dreamer was ready to fire more spells, Stark had his aura smash, Hero was spinning his swords in the air, and Orasio was going to activate [Explosive Shield].\nThere was no way it could win.\nAnd it knew it.\nWhich is why, when it saw Stark throw his crimson fists, Hero his magic swords, and Orasio his shield…\nIt used one final skill.\n\"WATER BENDING!\"\nThe water around Dreamer began to shake, and suddenly…\n~CLANG~\nA cage of water surrounded him, trapping him within.\n\"Huh?\" Dreamer was surprised, but it couldn't be that bad, right?\n~ZAP!~\nA lightning strike came rushing from the sky and hit the cage with Dreamer inside of it.\n\"NOOOOOOO!\"\n\"-3628!\" the damage was enough to kill Dreamer, and he fell to the ground afterward.\nIn the mean time…\n\"-3526! -4315! -2371! -7462!\"\nThe devourer received the damage of all the other attacks.\n[Black Water Devourer HP: 0/120000]\nThere was a moment of silence as the team watched in horror, realizing what had just happened. Dreamer lay motionless on the ground, and the devourer was defeated.\n\"Ah shit… we lost another one,\" Hero shook his head, \"I really believed we could all get out alive too…\"\n\"…\" Orasio was staring at Dreamer's body with a blank expression.\n\"Well, let's go,\" Stark, not showing any emotions, pointed at a door that appeared beside the Devourer's body.\nThey began walking toward the door, and soon enough passed through it.\nYet again, they found themselves in a chamber with stone walls and at the end were four small oval mirrors hanged against the wall.\nAnd for the second time, each of them approached a mirror and broke it, which resulted in them being transported back to the 'Colossal Paths'.\nAnd of course, the panels appeared soon after.\n[3 participants alive]\n[You have slain \"Black Water Devourer (GUARDIAN)\", gained 250000EXP!]\n[Second path cleared, one remains]\n'Damn, this much EXP…'\n[Your level has increased to level 13, granting you one skill point and boost in stats]\nBut surprisingly enough, he wasn't enveloped just once with the golden glow… but twice!\n[Your level has increased to level 14, granting you one skill point and boost in stats]\n[Experience: 77617/180000]\n[HP: 2500/2500]\nAfter checking their level and status windows, the three participants of the trial pointed at the statue of the Sphinx.\nThe second pearl on its forehead was now glowing with a deep blue color, and only one was unlit now.\n\"We take a break and then we finish this, I really want to get away from this place,\" Hero spoke and sat on the ground.\nAnd so just like that, only one guardian remained before they could meet the 'Greater One'.\nDreamer had died out nowhere in front of their eyes, but it served as a lesson: don't be confident until the enemy is actually dead, or else you might just die.\nThis was a Death-Level trial, one of the hardest ever, so they would need to be warry of anything that could kill them.\n'I made it this far, I really want that reward now,' Stark smirked.",

Stark used perception to check out why he had been hit, but he couldn't have imagined such a skill existed.\nNot only was Orasio's defense incredible, but if you tried to attack him physically, he could stall for enough damage to kill you.\nBasically: he was the worst kind of opponent Stark could meet as he had only physical attacks other than 'Aura Smash' which had a cooldown and would be blocked.\nThe shadow stood there, shield up, waiting for the next attack, it wasn't engaging in combat, just waiting for Stark to make the move as it knew there was no reason for it to attack.\n'These things are smart… probably mimicking their owner's intelligence as well…'\nStark dashed again, he would not be dominated by such a thing, they both had the domination class after all, so it meant that the winner was the one that dominated the battle the most.\n\"AURA SMASH!\"\nHe needed to act, and quick… It wasn't about outsmarting a shadow anymore, but Orasio himself since they had the same skills and thought process.\n'Let's do this,' he breath in and out, then opened his eyes, his pupils burning with that same crimson aura that enveloped him.\n~FWISH~\nHe punched the air once in the shadow's direction, which just got ready to absorb the attack, a wide grin on its face.\n~FWISH~\nHe punched it again to send the second crimson fist, not toward the shadow though, but beside it.\n\"Block!\" the shadow blocked the first fist easily, dealing not damage.\nBut this wasn't what Stark wanted to do… instead he focused on the second crimson fist, the hand he used to send it stretched and his palm open in its direction.\n'COME ON,' he tried to do something he didn't even know was possible, all he wanted to do was try.\nWith determination glowing in his eyes, he closed his hand while thinking of the fist's trajectory, and then…\n~FWISH~\nThe fist, which was behind the shadow since Stark had sent it beside it, suddenly changed directions and came back toward him, essentially aimed at the fake Orasio's back.\n'GOTCHA!'\nThe shadow sensed the fist, and so it turned to block the attack, absorbing all the damage.\nAnd as he turned again to face Stark… it saw that his fist was right in front of its face.\n~SLAM~\nHe punched it in the face with an extremely powerful attack, sending it flying against one of the mirror walls, and destroying at least a dozen of them.\n\"-4728!\" Stark thought that this attack would be enough to kill it, but it seemed like it wasn't just Orasio's style that was based on defense, his defense stat was also extremely high to begin with.\n'Alright, I only need to outsmart it once or twice more,' Stark sighed while grinning.\nKnowing that Orasio's shadow wouldn't attack, he decided to observe how the red-hair was doing against himself.\nOrasio was having a tough time, too.\nStark's shadow in comparison to Orasio's was actually the one initiating the attacks, perfectly copying his combat style.\nOrasio used his shield to cast [All-Time Protection], but it would soon enough crack under the pressure of the punches.\nAnd right when he used [Block], the skill the real Stark struggled against…\n\"-362! -436! - 572! -421! -479\" Stark's shadow even though it received damage kept attacking, not caring as its HP was fairly high.\nAnd of course, Orasio couldn't block forever, so in the end he had to remove his shield, and that's when he was punched.\n\"-2718!\"\nHe was sent flying against one of the mirror walls, and many were destroyed again.\n[Orasio HP: 482/3200]\nSafe to say he was one hit away from being killed, Stark's shadow was just too aggresive for him.\n\"Ah shit…\" Orasio fell to his knees, breathing hard as even though his HP hadn't dropped to zero, the damage was still a lot, \"Didn't know Chosen could punch this hard…\"\n\"Aura Smash!\" in response, Stark's shadow punched the air twice in Orasio's direction, sending two crimson fists at him as it thought he wouldn't be able to block anymore.\nBut that was a big mistake, and it was one the real Stark would have never made, making obvious it was just a mere mimic.\n\"EXPLOSIVE SHIELD,\" Orasio threw his shield with so much force at the shadow Stark while it was using its skill that it didn't have time to dodge.\nThe shield burned with a bright fire and aura while it was flying toward the fake Stark in mid-air.\nAnd then…\n~BOOM~\n\"-8362!\"\n[Shadow Stark HP: 58/10000]\n'It's my win,' Orasio smiled.",

Stark and Orasio shared a silent moment of determination, a steely resolve shining in their eyes as they stood up from their brief rest.\nWithout uttering a single word, they began their descent down the grand staircase, the air growing colder with each step they took.\nThe darkness began more overwhelming each second they descended, the platform and 'colossal paths' quickly getting further and further from them.\nSoon enough, they couldn't even the chamber while looking up.\n\"Five at the start, now only two remain,\" Orasio suddenly said without even looking back at Stark, \"Do you think we will survive this?\"\n\"…\" Stark didn't answer, he knew that most people would of died already while fighting the guardians, and less than 1% of domination class users would reach the 'Greater One', but it didn't matter, \"We are here now, whatever happens happens, even if one of us dies.\"\nAs they reached the bottom, they found themselves in a vast chamber shrouded in darkness.\nThey were in the deepest parts of the 'Class Purgatory'.\nAnd just to make them understand how fucked they were, the staircase that led them down there disappeared too.\n[Good luck.]\nThey began walking toward the center of the chamber, their footsteps echoing ominously in the darkness. Suddenly, a faint light flickered in the distance, illuminating a weird structure.\nIt was set against a wall, and there seemed to be nothing else around it.\nWhen they reached the structure, which looked like a massive, ancient door, Stark and Orasio exchanged a glance filled with uncertainty. The door was covered in intricate carvings of unknown symbols that seemed to shift and writhe in the dim light.\nAnd as they approached… a panel appeared before them.\n[Only one participant is allowed to meet the 'Greater One']\n[One sacrifice is needed to continue]\nWithout hesitation, Stark turned to Orasio, a solemn expression on his face. Orasio met his gaze with understanding, knowing what had to be done.\nThere was no emotions on their faces as they both activated 'Domination' and faced one another.\n\"Of course that shitty trial would only let one person win,\" Orasio laughed, his shield in hand, ready to block Stark's attacks.\nBut in contrast to Orasio, Stark didn't activate his aura to fight the red-haired boy, instead, he decided to try something.\n\"If it doesn't work, then we'll have to fight,\" Stark smiled, \"But until then…\"\n\"CLONE FRENZY!\" he hadn't activated that skill even during the fight against the shadows both because he didn't want his shadow to also use it, but also because he wanted it as a trump card in case anything happened.\nStark's aura seeped out of him and created an exact copy of himself.\n[One sacrifice is needed, if you want to be the sacrifice, please approach the altar (door) and put your palm against it for three seconds, you will receive 99999+ damage instantly]\n'Go, other me,' Stark ordered his clone to do exactly what that thing wanted it to do.\nIt was a futile attempt in most situations, but he didn't feel like fighting his teammate for now.\nOf course… if the skill failed… then he would be forced to, but that is another story: he was already putting himself at a disadvantage by using one of his most powerful skills, but he really wanted to catch onto that small hope.\nThe clone followed Stark's orders without hesitation, walking up to the ancient door and pressing its palm against the surface. A blinding light engulfed the clone, causing it to disintegrate into nothingness.\n\"-99999\" it received so much damage not even a level 100 classifier could be able to withstand that, luckily it only had one hp.\nStark and Orasio watched in tense silence, unsure of what would happen next.\nSuddenly, the symbols on the door began to glow brightly, and a low rumble filled the chamber. The intricate carvings shifted and rearranged themselves until they formed a new message:\n[Participant, step forward and face the Greater One.]\n\"YOU FUCKING TRICKED IT!\" Orasio was astonished it actually worked, meaning that it wasn't just one of them that would face the Greater One, but two!\nThe ancient door opened, and beyond it was another chamber, although this time they could see light pouring out from it.\nStark and Orasio exchanged a surprised glance before stepping through the door into the illuminated chamber.\nThey were in a clearing with towering pillars and walls around them… it almost felt like… they were back at the beginning!?\nBut no, it was different, since there were no skeletons, and also the mirror in the middle wasn't present either.\nBut at the far end of that clearing… was a giant mirror, and on the reflection could be seen a giant figure shrouded in darkness, it was turning its back to them.\n\"Good job, participant, you have reached the end of this trial-\" it turned around, then stopped talking, \"What the…\"\nIt tilted its head in confusion, its red eyes squinted, almost as if it was making sure it was seeing things right.\n\"How are there two of you… it doesn't make sense…\" even though it was the king of this place, it looked like it wasn't able to predict everything.\n\"Aura Smash!\" Stark punched the air in the giant mirror's direction, and the crimson fist came hurtling toward it, shattering it upon impact.\n\"Damn, you didn't even let it finish…\" Orasio sighed.\nAnd suddenly…\n~BOOM~\nThe figure that was previously in the mirror's reflection suddenly materialized in front of it, its feet touching the green grass.\n\"Annoying bugs…\" it sneered, pulling out some sort of glass fragment from its cloak.\nIt was wearing a dark cloak, and its face was covered by a glass mask emanating a dark aura that didn't allow them to see its face, the only thing visible was its eyes and mouth.\n\"You are alone, three of you already died, no one has ever completed a death-level trial, so WHY, WHY DO YOU STILL FIGHT!\" it shouted, almost angry that Stark and Orasio made it this far.\nStark and Orasio stood their ground, undeterred by the intimidating presence before them.\nIt was the final thing that was stopping them from leaving this place, and they would make sure to shut it up.\nStark's fists glowed with an aura brighter than ever before, while Orasio's shield was ready to block all the attacks that were sent at it.\n[Greater One: The Mirror Master]\n[3…2…1]\n[FIGHT!]\nAnd so the last fight began inside that weird clearing.",

All-Time Barrier!\"\nOrasio activated both these skills on himself and Stark, creating a green sphere that protected them both from the hundreds of shards that were dropping, it would honeslty be impossible to avoid them all, so Stark felt relieved he kept Orasio around, he was an excellent support.\n\"Aura Smash,\" he tried to calculate the trajectory to send it toward the mirror master, but…\n\"World's Reflection,\" the boss suddenly raised his arms upwards alongside the shard that he used to summon his powers, then turned it.\n~FWISH~\nThe gravity changed again, and Stark came crashing against a mirror.\n\"-326!\" Orasio on the otherhand protected himself using his shield.\nBut of course, that wasn't the end of it.\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWISH~\nLike a madman, the Mirror Master began changing the gravity of his domain over and over, resulting in Stark hitting almost every mirror in the area where he was, and blood pouring out from his body.\n[HP: 732/2800] he wasn't able to recover his HP thanks to his necklace because it was previously full, and so now he really needed some.\nChanging the gravity of the room also resulted in Stark being unable to aim his crimson fist.\nBut of course, that wouldn't stop him.\nAfter thirty second, he used his skill again.\n\"Aura Smash!\" he tried to aim and punched in the master's direction, but the gravity changed yet again, \"NOT THIS TIME!\"\nBut he switched the trajectory using his willpower, and although it was harder than usual since he was constantly moving…\n~BOOM~\n\"-7462!\" the master was hit.\n[Dealt massive damage to Mirror Master, regaining 135HP!]\n\"DON'T GET COCKY,\" he was getting more and more angry, \"SHARD THROW…\"\nHis anger pushed him to focus his attacks on Stark, who had to keep avoiding more and more.\nAnd of course, that was a mistake since…\n\"Explosive Shield,\" he was yet again hit by Orasio's shield, which exploded upon contact with his body.\n\"-18273!\"\n[Mirror Master HP: 12373/160000]\n\"You… annoying… PIECE OF SHITS,\" he was actively bleeding now, the injuries he had received until now finally taking a toll on him, \"I- I will…\"\nHe couldn't understand how he was defeated by Orasio and Stark, not matter how strong they were, it was not possible they could dominate him this easily.\nAll the other 'promising' domination class users that had been sent to a Death-Level trial had all succumbed up until now, so WHY, WHY WERE THEY ACTUALLY WINNING?\n\"OK, NOW LET'S END THIS,\" he shouted, his eyes burning with aura, and the crystal shard between his hand emanating a weird power.\nHe used his final and most powerful skill.\n\"ALL-AREA STRIKE!\"\n'…?' both Orasio and Stark were confused.\nBut what they hadn't realized yet was that [All-Area Strike]… was an unavoidable attack in the Master's domain.\nThe shard the master was carrying began floating above his head, a dark energy surrounding it.\n\"GOODBYE, PARTICIPANTS!\"\nAnd so he unleashed his skill: a giant dark fire mixed with glass shards appeared over them, on the room's ceiling.\nUnavoidable attacks are not common at all, some might as well say most people will encounter one in their lifetime because of the sheer stupidity of those things.\nAfter all, it was in the name: an unavoidable attack is truly impossible to avoid, no matter your speed, especially in closed off areas.\nAnd right now… Orasio and Stark were experiencing an extremely powerful one.\n~FWISH~\nThe dark fire grew and grew, until eventually taking up the entire ceiling.\nAnd that's when it came crashing down on the participants: it was impossible for them to avoid it since it was taking the entire space.\n'Oh wow,' Stark looked up, 'I think I get why no one completes that shit now,' he shrugged.\nBut he wasn't scared for a good reason: he had [Invincible Dodge], his newly acquired skill.\nHe would need the right timing while never using it before, but it was all or nothing, being hit by that thing was game over after all.\nAs the dark flames were at the half-way point of the room, Orasio activated all his defensive skills, [All-Time Protection], [Ally Protection], [Block], then kneeled down while looking up to the flames.\nStark on the other hand crouched a bit while observing the attack go down at an alarming speed: he was analyzing it to use [Invincible Dodge] at the perfect time.\nTime seemed to slow down as the dark fire and glass shards drew closer, the heat becoming unbearable, and the threat of being pierced by countless sharp edges loomed over them.\n\"IT'S THE END FOR YOU TWO,\" The Master laughed.\n~CRASH~\nThe dark fire and glass shards descended upon Stark and Orasio, enveloping them in a searing blaze and piercing shards. The Master's maniacal laughter echoed through the chamber as the flames consumed everything in their path.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\"\nRight as the attack was about to hit him, Stark combined [Focus] with his new skill to activate it at the perfect time.\nAnd so as the flames were millimeters above him, he rolled ahead, giving him the invincibility frames he needed to avoid the attack while the unsuspecting Mirror Master thought he had won.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" he punched the air twice in the boss's direction, sending two crimson fists that hit him directly.\n\"-12127! -13129!\"\nThe damage was insane, a proof of Stark's constant growth.\nAnd so the mirror master fell to the ground, his HP having reached 0.\n\"I-IMPOSSIBLE, I-I CANNOT LOSE TO YOU…\" he looked up to see Stark in front of him, a wide grin on his face.\n\"Seems like we won,\" Stark smirked, provoking the Mirror Master as it was his undeniable defeat.\nBut…\nThe Mirror Master grinned too for some reason, \"At least… only one of you will escape this place,\" and right as he said that, he lay on the ground, his body now lifeless.\n\"What do you mean-\" Stark turned toward Orasio's direction, and that's when he saw it: the red-haired boy was covered by those dark flames, burning his entire body to crisps.\n\"…\"\n[Mirror Master Defeated]\n[One participant alive]",

      "content": "Stark stood frozen, unable to believe what had just happened. The Mirror Master's words echoed in his mind: \"At least... only one of you will escape this place.\"\nBefore him was Orasio's burning figure.\n[Orasio HP: 0/4300]\nHe tried to move, to help Orasio, but there was no point: he was already dead.\nAll he could do was watch as Orasio's body was consumed by the dark flames, and soon enough ,his aura vanished, then his body turned to dust as the flames were extremely powerful.\n\"…\" Stark looked at the remains of his companion's body with a blank expression, \"I guess… sigh… anyways.\"\nOrasio had indeed activated all his skills, but the sheer pressure of the flames were enough to shatter his barrier, and so without any back-up plan, thinking that his barrier would be enough, he was consumed by the flames and killed.\nStark would have suffered the same fate without his [Invincible Dodge] skill, but there was no reason to think too much about it.\n[Congratulations, CHOSEN ONE, you have completed the Death-Level domination trial: 'Glass Purgatory']\nThe world around Stark began to change, and soon enough he found himself in the clearing he and the others were in since they appeared inside that trial, there were five of them at the beginning, all of them smiling, and now, only one was allowed out.\nThe towering pillars were still there, and the skeletons were back to their original spot, and the path to the mirror with the frame made out of bones was still proudly standing in the middle of that clearing.\n[You are the first person to ever clear a Death-Level domination trial, good job!]\nStark began walking toward the mirror where it all started, he didn't know why, but there was something in him telling him it was the right thing to do.\nHe took his first step, and more panels appeared.\n[You have slain \"Mirror Master lv30 (TRIAL BOSS)\", gained 340000 EXP!]\nHe was enveloped by the golden glow again, it had become familiar for him to level up after defeating each of the guardians now because of the sheer amount of EXP they gave.\nAny normal person would be able to shoot from level 1 to at least 7-10 with this amount, and yet…\n[Your level has increased to level 16, granting you one skill point and boost in stats]\n[Experience: 187617/225000]\n'…' Stark kept walking.\n[You have completed the 'Glass Purgatory', granting INCREDIBLE rewards]\n[+1 LEGENDARY Skill, +4 Equipment Pieces, +3000 HP]\nWhile heading toward the mirror that would be his exit from this hell, he saw the figures of Boxer, Dreamer, Hero, and finally, Orasio, staring at him.\nThey were transparent, but it was obvious it was them from their aura and appearance, and by their expressions, it didn't seem like they were mad.\nInstead, Dreamer and Boxer were nodding their heads in approval, while Hero and Orasio were smiling bitter sweetly, clapping their hands to applaud for his victory.\n[You have proven your worth, Stark Heartsouls, now leave]\nAnd right as this panel appeared, Stark found himself in front of the mirror, the reflection showing his hotel room.\n'Sigh, let's get this over with,' he looked at the mirror while stepping backward, just like how they did it to enter the purgatory in the first place.\nAnd soon enough, he passed the portal and was sent back to reality.\n[Domination trial: Glass Purgatory… CLEARED]\n***\n\"HWAHHH~\" Stark opened his eyes, he had been lying on the ground when he collapsed and was sent to the Glass Purgatory, and he found himself in that exact position when he woke up.\nStark stood in his hotel room, still relatively shaken by the experience he'd just went through.\nHe was glad he was able to complete the trial, but in exchange all the others had to die: he was the sole survivor.\nEven the most promising and powerful domination users at their level died, so he could only wonder how any of the other folks could dream of defeating even the first guardian.\nBut the answer was obvious: they wouldn't be able to, even a level 40 classifier would struggle.\nThen he immediately remembered about the reason he had gone through everything in the first place: those damn rewards.\n[+1 LEGENDARY Skill]\n[+4 Equipment Pieces]\n[+3000 HP]\n[Click to unlock!]\nThese four golden panels appeared in front of him.\nWithout hesitation, Stark clicked on the HP one, and as soon as he did so, a green aura enveloped his body.\n[Gained 3000HP!]\n[Health:6100/6100]\nHis health was extremely high now, especially for his level, meaning he could tank more and do more risky things.\n'Nice…'\nHe turned his eyes toward the second panel, the one with the four pieces of equipment, and he clicked on it without much thought.\nAs soon as he did, two rings, a piece of clothing, and the crystal shard the Mirror Master was using appeared in front of him, dropping to the ground.\n'Let's check it out I guess…'\n\"PERCEPTION!\"\nHe analyzed the two rings, the first had a black flame burning in the spot where a gem is supposed to be, while the second had a blue gem that emanated a beautiful aura.\n…\n[Equipment:] The Purgatory Shadows\n[Type:] Ring\n[Class:] Domination\n[Tier:] Epic\n[Required Level:] 15\n[Quality:] Perfect\n[Attributes:] +100 speed\n[Special Perk:] When receiving a hit, a shadow of yourself appears to take the hit in your place, whether it is 1 point of damage or 10000.\n…\n[Equipment:] The Devourer's Ring\n[Type:] Ring\n[Class:] Magus/Domination\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Required Level:] 20\n[Quality:] Good\n[Attributes:] +500MP\n[Special Perk:] Your resistance to water type magic increases by 100%, and your water type damage increases by 200%.\n…\n'I don't have water type skills, so it doesn't matter to me, but it seems like every single one of those items is linked to one of the guardians…'\nThe first ring was linked to the Creeping Shadows, while the second to the Black Water Devourer.\nAnd that left two items on the ground: the clothing, which was basically just a weird cloak, and the crystal shard.\nStark picked up the cloak, feeling its texture against his fingers.\n…\n[Equipment:] Conjoined Warrior's Cloak\n[Type:] Cloak\n[Class:] All\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Required Level:] 15\n[Quality:] Good\n[Attributes:] +150 strength, +100 speed\n[Special Perk:] Wearing this cloak while fighting will result in the chance of inflicting a critical hit on your opponent (dealing massive damage), the chance is only 5%.\n…\n'It's the same one that warrior skeleton was wearing… no items from the witch I guess.'\nFinally, he picked up the crystal shard, wondering what it could be.\n…\n[Equipment:] Mirror Master's Crystal Shard\n[Type:] Cast\n[Class:] Domination\n[Tier:] Legendary\n[Required Level:] 20\n[Quality:] Exquisite\n[Attributes:] It is a caste item so no stat boost\n[Special Perk:] You can use this crystal to cast a giant glass shard that deals incredible damage to one enemy, there is a cooldown of ten minutes between each use, and it is recommended to infuse the shard into a ring for better use.\n…\nThe rewards weren't disappointing, at least for now.\nAfter all… he still had one more golden panel in front of him.\n[+1 LEGENDARY Skill]\nAnd so he clicked it, expecting something incredible, something that was worth the other four's deaths, something that would help him conquer everything.",

      "content": "As soon as Stark clicked on the golden panel with the legendary skill, he was surrounded by a golden aura that made all of his body tingle slightly.\nEven his eyes and pupils were blazing with that same golden aura, a proof that what he was getting was truly a LEGENDARY skill.\nLegendary skills are only the 5th type out of the 8 available, but they were still incredible, and nobody that was only level 16 could even dream of having one as it would take either reaching a high level, buying a skill scroll, or getting lucky inside of a rift.\nIn all cases, most classifiers Stark's age wouldn't get one any time soon.\nSoon enough, the panel that explained the skill appeared before him, and Stark could only read in excitement.\n…\n[Skill: Double Assault]\n[Type: Legendary]\n[Level: 1]\n[Description: Upon activating this skill, all of your stats double in numbers, making you a beast in the battlefield, it only lasts ten seconds, but it should be enough to make both people and monsters fear you, cooldown is 20 minutes.]\n…\n\"Holy…\" Stark smiled, this was an incredibly interesting skill, and although it only lasted ten seconds, it was still a fair amount of time in a battle to deal damage and reverse the tides.\nMaybe if he had such a skill in hand before, then Orasio wouldn't have died…\n'No,' Stark shook his head, 'What had to happen happened, now I need to live.'\n[One last question]\nA transparent panel appeared, different than the ones with the rewards.\n'…?'\n[Were these rewards worth the death of the others?]\nStark read the panel a few times before looking at the new skill he had acquired, his now giant HP pool, and the items on the bed.\nHe grinned, \"Yeah, it was pretty damn worth it.\"\n[Interesting =)]\nAnd so it disappeared afterward.\n\"Spatial Inventory,\" he called out the name of his extremely convenient skill, and the void appeared beside him, he put every single item on his bed except for the [The Purgatory Shadows] ring as it was useful and he could wear it currently with his level.\nHe also pulled out the [Crystalheart Band] from it, he had kept it inside his void since the required level was 15, but now that he leveled up, he was able to wear it.\n…\n[Item:] Crystalheart Band\n[Type:] Ring\n[Class:] Domination\n[Tier:] Epic\n[Required Level:] 15\n[Quality:] Excellent\n[Attributes:] +50 Health, +40 Mind, +10 to all other stats\n[Special Perks:] Grants the wearer a shield that absorbs 10% of incoming damage.\n[Note:] This ring is a passive so the damage you receive is reduced by 10% the moment you wear it.\n…\nHe wore the two rings on two of his fingers, allowing them to link with him and for their perks to be active.\n'That's done for at least,' he jumped on his bed, fighting four (more if you considered that there were two shadows and the conjoined siblings?) bosses in a row was exhausting.\nImmediately, he grabbed his phone to check the time.\nBur right as he started it up…\n\"WARNING, WARNING!\"\nA red screen appeared on it, and a woman's panicked voice shouted.\n\"We just have reported the appearance of a calamity-level monster inside of Fellarburg!\"\n\"There have been three other cases in the world these past few hours, if you are in Fellarburg, please refrain from going outside and seek refuge!\"\n\"It has been reported that the amount of casualties is already in the thousands, and experts are actively trying to kill those beasts, as well as find their origins, but it has been years since they have been appearing, yet no one seems to know how.\"\nStark's eyes immediately widened as he heard the message and saw the pictures of the beasts in question: a giant, humanoid creature with glowing red eyes, horns, and a terrifying scowl, it had giant dark wings, and it used them to fly wherever it wanted at incredible speed, as well as a giant crimson shield.\nBut there was one single thing that allowed Stark to confirm what he feared: the monster in Fellarburg had a burn mark on its face at the exact same spot of Orasio's.\nAnd that's when he remembered those words.\n[It is either you complete the trial or… become one of 'them']\nNot completing the trial didn't cause death, instead you turned into one of these calamity-level beasts that caused havoc in the city/country.\nMonsters in this world were spread across ten categories: Fodder, Weak, Normal, Strong, Elite, Boss, Calamity, Immortal, Universal, Divine.\nAnd now, all four participants of the trial except for Stark, had turned into one of these things, and their appearances were widely different from one another.\n\"…\" Stark's face was cold as he turned on his television and saw the reports of whatever was going on, the pictures of classifiers fighting the beasts across the screen, all the world watching in terror.\nAnd with that, Stark had realized that time inside the trial moved just like in real life, meaning that he hadn't been gone for more than ten hours that such a disaster occured.\nAll the others calamity monsters had been taken care of by now, except for Orasio, who relentlessly blocked all the attacks using his shield, he was avoiding conflict and using his wings to fly somewhere nobody knew off.\nNobody… except for Stark, because deep down, he knew that Orasio was coming for him.\n~FWISH~\nAn arrow came hurtling toward the transformed Orasio's head, and he succumbed to the attack.\nLana's father, the Archer King, was the one responsible for getting rid of the monster after being called, and he had done his job.\nBut before falling to the ground, Orasio used his last bit of willpower to scream something incomprehensible to most.\n\"CHOOOOSEEEEENNNNN!!!!\"\nThere was fury in his eyes, but soon enough he fell.\nIt was Stark's code name in the trial, and all he could do was watch with a blank expression as his companion died.\n\"It seems like all the monsters were taken care of for now, but professionals will be on the look-out for any sign of another attack, stay safe!\"\nThe reporter ended the diffusion, and Stark shut down his TV afterward.\n\"Only the strongest will survive,\" Stark quoted while remembering his companion's scream, it was probably the transformation that pushed him to try and find Stark, but it didn't matter.\n\"Anyways, less than ten hours since the trial started, meaning that ill be able to go to the meeting with Lana about that Hell-Level rift…\" Stark made sense of time, he thought that days would have passed after he woke up, but luckily not.\nAnd so Stark lay down on his bed and closed his eyes, he would need to sell some of the items he acquired that he didn't need to make money, and also get ready for whatever awaited him.\nDuring that nap he took, Stark had a nightmare.",

      "content": "Meanwhile, in the noble district of Fellarburg, near the capital, within a luxurious mansion, Daniel stood on the balcony, observing the whole city.\nDespite only being 15, he had a glass of wine in his hands, after all, the rules of this world were extremely different than from Stark's previous one.\n\"It has been confirmed, sir, the Hell-Level rift located near Fellaburg will open in exactly three days, and there are already hundreds of Elite classifiers that are planning to participate in the raid,\" One of Daniel's right hands, a level 127 classifier from the Alchemist class named Alphis, spoke.\n\"Hm… seems like this is becoming bigger of an issue than we thought, do they know?\" Daniel asked, looking at Alphis.\n\"Many do not seem to know about the presence of 'that' yet, giving us the utmost advantage,\" Alphis replied, his face blank.\nAlphis was a renown researcher and also a very powerful classifier, making him an incredible ally to the Pridel family.\n\"I did hear about the fact the Moonless family will participate,\" Daniel smiled as he mentioned the 'Moonless' name.\n\"That is true, but it is not surprising, such a rift appearing is a rare occurrence, which is why so many people are gathering, lots of them are confident this could be linked to the 'Godless Demon' as well as the 'Black Sun'…\" these unexplainable beings are always there, watching, but no one knew about their plans.\nIt was also extremely rare, if not impossible, for these two to acknowledge anybody, although it had been proven to be possible.\n\"Very well,\" Daniel nodded while sipping into his wine, \"I won't be able to participate this time, but make sure to send some of the Pride Family warriors to make sure they know we are present, I need to score points with Lana and her family.\"\nDaniel's obsession with Lana would never go away, no matter what, he wanted her, and he wouldn't let anybody take her away from him.\n\"Stark,\" he suddenly said, fury in his eyes, as he remembered Lana take that loser away.\n\"…?\" Alphis tilted his head in confusion, he knew of 'Stark Heartsouls', but he didn't seem to be a very important person.\n\"I want that fucker gone… he got lucky once, and the second time he was saved by Lana, but the next time I see him…\" he broke the glass with his hands.\n\"Do not fret, Daniel, it is impossible for someone to enter the rift without the major classifier families to allow them to, so we should be fine.\"\nThis brought a smile to Daniel's face.\n\"Make sure to send our finest warriors there, I want everyone to know and fear the Pridel family name.\"\nWhether it was House Potter, House Sunny, House Moonless and many more, all of them would send their most talented young lings to that rift, and the winner would be the one who defeats the boss or brings the most materials.\nAnd so just like that, their plan was set in motion.\n***\n~BEEP, BEEP, BEEP~\nStark's alarm rang, but he ignored it for a few seconds, before suddenly realizing he had a meeting with Lana.\nHe took his phone to check the time… and…\n\"11:28AM? THE MEETING IS SUPPOSED TO BE AT 12, FUCK!\" he would undeniably be late at this rate, and he didn't dare to offend a person such as Lana, even more so after checking on the internet and realizing the scale they were at.\nEven though Fellarburg was one of the less remarkable countries in the world, there were still many powerful houses there, and there has also been a surge of interest recently because of that Hell-Level Rift.\nTaking a quick shower, then wearing the most average of clothes, Stark left his hotel room in a hurry.\nHe had to take yet another taxi, taking him 30 minutes to reach the capital of Fellarburg since it was close to the 'Classifier Trading District'.\nThe atmosphere was extremely joyful, and thousands were roaming around, enjoying their peaceful lives outside the rifts.\n'Altar Restaurant…' Stark repeated the name of the meeting place while looking at his phone for the location.\nHe was already late by fifteen minutes, and he could already sense Lana's gaze on him.\nOn his way to the restaurant, he had to pass through what they called the 'Fun District', which was basically the place where most of the popular love hotels, bars, and people who wanted to have intercourse were.\nOf course, the most wanted people in that district were those with the 'Succubus/Incubus' class.\nStark ran for a good five minutes, but as he turned the last corner before reaching the restaurant…\n~THUMP~\nHe bumped into someone, and looking up, he found himself staring into the lustful eyes of a young woman with shiny black hair that seemed to shimmer in the sunlight.\nBeside her were two other girls, just as beautiful as the first.\n[Class:] Succubus\n\"Hey~\" she stared at Stark, but the only thing the boy was interested in was the restaurant as he could clearly see it from behind their figures.\nThey were just as tall as he was (roughly 1,75cm), and so not allowing him to leave.\n\"Not interested,\" Stark immediately said, trying to avoid them, but the girls stopped him regardless.\n\"You're pretty cute, wanna have fun~?\" a blonde-haired one right next to the first smiled, an aura was in her eyes, almost as if she was undressing him.\n\"I already said it once, not interested,\" Stark's tone became more aggressive, and yet again he tried to pass.\nBut the girl's succubus tails entangled themselves around his arms and legs, \"Oh come on~ We love virgins like you, let's just have fun for a few minutes…\"\n'I swear to god… these people do not give up,' now actually angry, he activated his aura and used it to remove the tails around his body.\n\"I wouldn't let a SLUT take my virginity,\" he looked at the three girls as if they were mere objects, surprising them, they hadn't expected that guy to be so… dominating?\nBut when he tried to leave…\n\"HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\" He heard a feminine voice come from his front, and he saw Lana run at them, an angry look on her face.\n'Great job, assholes,' he groaned at the succubus for wasting his time.\nBut which surprised Stark the most was that Lana wasn't angry at him, instead she placed herself in front of the three girls, and shouted at them, \"Get out of here, and don't approach him anymore if you know what's best for you…\"\nLana hated to use her influence for such things, but she had already done it for the second time with Stark.\n\"Holy… that's Lana…\" one of the girls said, sweat pouring out from her forehead, \"Haha… w-we were just joking, you know…?\"\n\"I don't care, GET OUT!\"\nAnd all three walked away, not expecting the boy they stopped to be with such an important person.\n\"Fucking hell…\" Lana cursed, her eyes on the girls until they turned around a corner, \"I was wondering why you were late, and that's because you were entertaining these… succubi?\"\n\"Um… no, they just stopped me thirty seconds ago,\" Stark shrugged.\n\"Oh well… it doesn't matter, we'll talk inside the restaurant, I reserved a seat for two after all…\"\nThey began walking toward 'Altar Restaurant', but it was once taking the first few steps that Stark realized something:\n\"Wait… WAS I GETTING HIT ON?\"\nHe quickly recovered though, 'Heh, who cares...'\nHe wasn't interested in woman for now.",

      "content": "In opposition to Stark, who was wearing the most average clothes, and had overall the appearance of a guy nobody would pay attention to normally, Lana was completely different.\nShe was wearing an elegant dress that hugged her curves in all the right places, her long blond hair reaching her waist, and not even needing makeup to be beautiful.\nEven during the few seconds it took them to reach the restaurant, dozens of people stopped to observe her beauty (some males attracting the angry gaze of their companions).\nShe exuded confidence and poise, a true representation of the Heiress of House Moonless, although she did lose her cool when Stark was being hit on for some reason.\nAs they entered the restaurant, the staff greeted them warmly, and Lana led Stark to their reserved table in a cozy corner.\nStark glanced around the restaurant, taking in the lively atmosphere and the hustle and bustle of the people.\n\"As you know, I organized this date- I mean meeting to discuss the Hell-Level right that appeared recently,\" she spoke, and Stark looked at her with the blankest of expressions.\n\"We have little to no information about it, but all that we know is that it is gonna open in two days, outside of Fellarburg,\" she tapped on her phone to show the location to Stark, \"It is reserved for powerful houses and conglomerates, but there will be hundreds of people, so you should watch out…\"\n\"Ok.\"\nSuddenly, Lana clapped both of her hands, and one of the waiters came to their table with a suitcase, placing it in front of Stark.\n\"You have to wear this attire and mask when outside and inside the rift, after all, your presence is supposed to be a secret.\"\nStark opened the suitcase, and just as she said, there was a smoking, alongside a bunny mask that covered only the upper half of his face.\n\"Why are you doing this to me? This seems a bit too good…\" Stark asked, looking into Lana's beautiful eyes.\n\"I will be frank with you, I think you are extremely powerful, and that you will be useful to me in the future, also this is a great opportunity for you to level up,\" she smiled for the first time, a genuine one.\n\"Ok, but I have one simple request.\"\n\"Yes?\"\nMost classifiers would dream of entering a Hell-Level Secret Rift, yet here he was, asking her for a request, anyone watching this would consider him crazy.\nPlus, Secret Rifts were basically a treasure trove since no one had explored them before, allowing dozens upon dozens of equipment to be available for grabs.\nHigh risk, high reward, basically.\n\"I want to be allowed to roam around the rift alone.\"\nLana raised an eyebrow, slightly surprised by his request, but she just nodded.\n\"Very well, but you'll have to act as if you are part of the 'Crimson Moon Squad', it is our team that is participating in the raid of the rift.\"\n\"Okay,\" Stark didn't care, he was probably out of place among all those powerful classifiers, but he still believed in himself, after all he was sure none of them would have been able to complete that Domination Trial.\nHe had already experienced Hell once, so there was no way he would be scared.\nStark didn't know how to talk to women, but he somehow held up a decent conversation with Lana as they were eating.\n\"Did you see those calamity-level beasts that appeared-\" she tried to initiate again after a few minutes of silence.\n\"No, I don't know,\" he immediately replied, not wanting to talk about his previous companions transforming into these beasts.\n\"Oh well… okay.\"\nSoon enough, they finished eating, and said goodbye to each other.\nTime passed quickly, and before he knew, two days went by.\nStark woke up early in the morning, before dawn.\n\"…\" he knew it was time to leave.\nThe Secret Rift was very far, so Lana had requested for him to come to an underground base the 'Crimson Moon Squad' used to meet the members, and also to go there.\nIn contrary to what he believed though, 'Crimson Moon Squad' wasn't truly part of the Moonless family, instead it was more like a group of powerful classifiers they had formed for such occasions, and Lana was only a member too.\nIt was her father that was the leader (although when he wasn't present, Vex took his place), and so he asked her to join them for experience, but surprisingly enough also allowed him to be part of it for this expedition.\nStark grabbed the suitcase he had been given in the restaurant and pulled out its contents.\nHe wore the black and purplish smoking, one that went extremely well with him for some reason.\nAnd as for the white bunny mask, he placed it on his face, covering the upper half. He looked in the mirror, at his transformed appearance, and a strange smile played on his lips.\n…\n[Item:] Crimson Moon Bunny Mask\n[Type:] Mask\n[Quality:] Good\n[Perk:] Hides your face perfectly, nobody that doesn't know about your identity will recognize you.\n…\nThere were two other things inside the suitcase though: a red badge adorned with a half-moon on it, it was the 'Crimson Moon Squad' logo.\n…\n[Item:] Crimson Moon Communication Device\n[Type:] Badge\n[Quality:] Good\n[Perk:] Allows all 'Crimson Moon Squad' members who wear this badge to communicate with one another using a powerful 'Telepathy' and 'Voice Transmission' spell.\n…\nAnd the final item was a weird potion in a glass, the liquid inside was green.\n…\n[Item:] Max Health Potion\n[Type:] Consummable\n[Quality:] Perfect\n[Perk:] Heals to full health, and removes any status effect as well as exhaustion.\n…\n'Thank you, Lana,' she was surprisingly considerate even though he had believed she was just a girl who used her family's money to get what she wanted.\nWearing his two rings, his necklace, the bunny mask, and the 'Crimson Mood Squad' uniform, Stark finally set out for the base.\nThe sun was rising in the east when he arrived in front of an empty bar near the Capital.\n\"Crimson Light Bar\" was the name, and Stark could only guess it was the right location with the name.\nIt was still mostly night, and the street he was in was mostly empty, so he knocked twice at the wooden door of the bar.\nAnd after a few seconds, it magically opened.\n'Great, another group who tries to seem mysterious,' he groaned as nobody was behind when the door opened.\nAnd so he entered the bar, the wooden door closing behind as if it was controlled by an unknown force.\nAfter marching through the hall for a few seconds, he arrived in the main area with the bar, tables, and drinks.\nAnd in there, seven people could be seen, three women and four man.\nThey were the 'Crimson Moon Squad'.",

I'm glad you could make it. My name is Lance, I heard lots of things about you from our little Lana here,\" he nodded in approval.\n\"Shut up, old man, don't say anything else if you know what's best for you…\" Lana groaned, a fierce expression on her face.\n\"Haha~ sure sure, wouldn't wanna put off your crus-\"\nAn arrow came flying toward Lance, landing right next to his head.\nOf course, Lance was a powerful Magus, so such an attack wouldn't hard him, plus he would have had the time to cast several spells, but he still let it go since it was Lana.\nStark nodded politely, returning the smile.\nNext, he noticed a tall, muscular man with short, curly black hair. He wore a leather vest and had a gruff look on his face.\n[Class: Warrior]\n[Level: 97]\n\"I'm Thorn, the muscle of the team. Nice to meet you,\" he grunted, giving Stark a firm handshake.\nStark replied, but immediately as he did so, he felt Thorn's pressure on his hand, almost as if he wanted to crush it.\n\"…?\" Stark looked at him with a blank expression, not hurt at all since he had immediatly activated [Domination] and put the entirety of his aura around that hand.\n\"Hm…\" Thorn was confused, he had the idea of hurting Stark a bit to show him it would be difficult, but he didn't seem affected at all, \"Good strength kid, I approve,\" he finally let go, finally giving him a smirk.\nStark continued to scan the room, his eyes falling on a woman with long, flowing red hair and striking green eyes, she had glasses and seemed to be focused on some potions that were placed on her table.\n\"Hehe~ almost done,\" she giggled, not even acknowledging Stark and his arrival, but still telling him her name, \"Olivia!\"\n[Class: Alchemist]\n[Level: 116]\nThe next person that caught his attention was a man, draped in a cloak that seemed to meld with the shadows of the room. His eyes glinted with a keen intelligence as he met Stark's gaze.\n[Class: Assassin]\n[Level: 105]\n\"Max…\" that's all he said, and Stark nodded.\nHe then turned his attention to a woman with long, golden hair that cascaded down her back like a waterfall. She wore a simple white dress and had an ethereal quality about her.\n[Class: Exorcist]\n[Level: 112]\n\"Stella!' they were stars shining in her eyes, and anybody who saw her from afar could guess that she was a saint, \"Nice to meet you!\" she grabbed both of Stark's hands with hers, and smiled.\nFinally, his gaze settled on a man who exuded a dark aura, his eyes glinting with mischief and power.\nHe had a green heart with a hat on top of it pulsating in his right hand, and he seemed to be playing with it.\n[Class: Soul Wielder]\n[Level: 124]\nHe had white hair and wore an intricate suit that hinted at his agility and skill in combat, fairly similar to the one Stark was wearing.\n\"Well, well, if it isn't the new recruit,\" he smirked, crossing his arms over his chest confidently, \"Call me Vex.\"\nVex seemed to be the leader of this small squad, both because his aura was the most powerful, but also because of his level.\n\"Stark Heartsouls,\" Stark replied while staring at all the people in the room.\n\"Welcome, Stark,\" Vex's voice was smooth and commanding, \"We've been expecting you.\" He gestured for Stark to take a seat at the table where the squad was gathered.\nAs Stark settled in, Vex continued, \"No need for lame explanations, all you need to know is that the Secret Rift opens in exactly 7 hours from now on, so we need to be going there soon.\"\n\"Very well, any information I need to know?\" he replied.\n\"You requested to be alone, so all you need to do is seperate yourself from us at the start, that rift is Hell-Level so it is so big we might not see each other until we leave…\"\nStark nodded in understanding, mentally preparing himself for the upcoming challenge.\nThe atmosphere in the bar became tense as each member of the Crimson Moon Squad geared up for the mission ahead.\nLana's eyes sparkled with determination, Thorn cracked his knuckles, and Max's gaze sharpened even more.\nAfter the rest of them (except for Stark) sipped into their wine, which he clearly found to be dumb since what would happen to you if you were drunk inside a dangerous rift, all of them left the bar.\nStark had been given some information along with that alcohol break: dozens of organizations woukd participate in this it was a perfect moment to conquer a powerful rift and attract the media and also gather materials.\nWhether it was several powerful houses from other countries, military groups, conglomerates, and even solo classifiers, all would be there.\nAs they exited the bar, there were a black limousine-like cars waiting for them.\nIt hadn't been there when Stark had arrived, but looks like these guys were prepared.\n\"Good luck, let's hope you aren't too late,\" Vex smiled as Stark and Lana entered the car.\n\"You aren't coming?\" Stark was confused, why were they the only one that needed to take that car?\nIt didn't take more than a few seconds for him understand.\nVex, using his 'Wielder Heart', began flying in the air, shooting in to the sky with a magnificent green flash.\nMax, the assassin, also just hid in the shadows and disappeared out nowhere.\nThorn, the burly man, jumped on a building and dashed toward the location of the secret Rift at an incredible speed.\nLance used some sort of spell and teleported away.\nAnd as for the two women on the group that didn't go inside the car: Olivia, the achemist, just drank a potion and turned into a bird before flying into the horizon.\n\"What the fuck?\" Stark was astonished.\nAnd as for Stella, the exorcist, she summoned a giant golden cross and got on top of it before also flying, like she was on a magic carpet.\n\"We aren't that strong… are we not?\" Stark awkwardly laughed.\n\"Maybe not…\" Lana shrugged, \"But i'm sure we'll reach that level some day.\"\nStark was honestly confident in his speed, he could of course always focus all his aura around his legs and be way faster than the car, but he decided to be prioritize rest over showing off as it was useless.\nSix hours passed after they got inside of the car, and soon enough, they left Fellarburg.\nThey were now in a giant plain with green grass, and in front of them were dozens of other cars, as well as hundreds of people, some still arriving from the sky or even ground.\n\"That's our stop,\" Lana nodded, and the two got off the car.\nEveryone was there was one simple thing: the Secret Rift that was bound to open soon.",

      "content": "As Stark and Lana stepped out of the car, they were immediately greeted by the sight of numerous fellow classifiers, each huddled in their respective groups, discussing strategies and final preparations.\nIn front of them all was a weird monument, and a crimson closed off portal that looked like a shut-eye from afar in the center.\nThe Crimson Moon Squad had already reached the location before Lana and Stark, a proof that their travelling method was way more effective.\nThey soon enough found the leader, Vex, and from there regrouped all the members one by one.\n\"Only 20 more minutes,\" Vex spoke while pointing at the closed portal, \"Then let's prove to all those fuckers that we're the stronger ones…!\"\nThis was a competition between all factions, and every single one of them was looking at one another, the sole purpose would be to come out of this shitty place alive while conquering it.\nWhatever there was inside, they would need to face it.\nNot even ten minutes later, they heard a voice coming from their left.\n\"HAHAHA VEX, YOU LOOK DESPERATE!\" a burly man with a brown heart in his hands laughed, he seemed to be another 'Soul Wielder'.\n\"Jack… you never get tired of doing shit like this, do you?\" Crimson Moon's leader sighed.\n\"You have a reached a new low it seems,\" his eyes were burning with an aura the same color of his heart, \"Inviting two newbies to such a rift is basically suicide!\"\nBy this point, many people were looking at the commotion.\n\"I do understand Lana since she is extremely talented and you will actively make sure she is fine, but him?\" he pointed at Stark, a wide grin on his face, \"You are begging for him to be eaten or what? Plus what is that stupid mask?\"\nIt was obvious from all the different powerful people in this space that Lana and Stark were some of the weakest ones, plus their auras were also lower (although on Stark's part it was only because he hadn't activated Domination, otherwise it would be just as much as all the others)\n\"Stop caring about my members so much, Jack, maybe it's because you don't focus on your team that you all have been slacking off lately,\" Vex retorted, and many people laughed, enjoying the show.\n\"…\" Jack was furious, \"Well… let's see if your little newbie will survive inside that rift…\" he groaned, \"A LEVEL 16 PARTICIPATING IN A LEVEL 35-50 HELL-LEVEL RIFT IS CRAZY,\" he shouted that last part on purpose for everyone to hear.\nAnd immediately, all eyes fell on the masked Stark.\n\"Is Crimson Moon crazy, did they hire a level 16 newbie?\"\n\"And look at that ugly mask, pfft~ that guy is as good as dead…\"\n\"This is suicide, does he have a death wish?\"\nMurmurs spread across all the groups of classifiers.\n\"…\" Stark was just looking at everything unfolding with a blank expression on his face though since he didn't care about any of these people and their opinions.\nPlus, what good would it be for him to get mad over such petty things.\n\"You are a grown adult, and i'm a kid, so please act like one,\" Stark smiled while responding to Jack, and yet again another row of laughter echoed.\n\"You little…\" Jack gritted his teeth, but a white-haired woman, probably his teammate, grabbed his shoulder and asked him to let it go, so he went back to his group.\nAs the tension in the air eased slightly, Vex turned to Lana and Stark with a reassuring smile,\"Don't worry about Jack, he's all bark and no bite,\" he said, patting Stark on the back, \"You'll prove them all wrong once we enter that rift.\"\nBut almost all the Crimson Moon Squad members were thinking like the others: Stark is pushing his luck with that rift, and he is surely gonna die inside, although they weren't saying it and acted friendly.\nThey had no bad intentions, but logic was their priority, and it didn't make sense for someone that is level 16 to attempt that.\nWell… every member except for Vex that is, since he could sense Stark's aura and determination, and without any doubt they were some of the strongest he had seen.\nStark felt a surge of determination coursing through him as he stood before the closed portal, the hushed whispers and doubtful gazes of the other classifiers fading into background noise.\nHe adjusted his bunny mask, the intricate design seeming to gleam with an inner light as he focused on the challenge ahead.\nVex gathered the team together, his voice cutting through the tension in the air. \"We're not here to back down from a challenge. We're here to show what we're capable of. No matter what lies beyond that portal, we face it together, well except for Stark since… you know…\"\nThe countdown began, marking the final moments before the portal would open. As the numbers dwindled, a sense of anticipation hung heavy in the air.\nStark could feel the energy crackling around them, a mixture of fear and excitement swirling within everyone.\nAnd then, with a resounding hum, the portal slowly creaked open, revealing a swirling mass of dark energy pulsing within.\n[PORTAL OPENED]\nThe crimson portal was now available for everyone to use, and so people rushed inside, wanting to be the firsts to explore that place.\n\"Nobody is allowed to leave a Secret Rift before it is completed, so watch out, especially you, Stark,\" he patted the black-haired boy's back and headed toward the portal alongside the other members.\n\"Are you sure you wanna go alone?\" Lana stayed back for a few seconds to confirm with Stark, and he simply nodded, so she went alongside the others.\n'Welp,' he stretched while grinning, still sensing the gaze of those that were still outside on him, it seemed like he had become a target to many in such a short amount of time, 'Let's just… level up…'\nAnd so he entered as well, ready to reach level 25 and spin the [Class Wheel] again, and maybe, just maybe, complete that rift and get all the rewards too…?\nAs he stepped inside the portal, the world around Stark blurred and twisted, the once familiar scenery dissolving into a whirl of colors.\nA rush of wind tugged at his clothes, and his heart pounded in his chest as he was pulled deeper into the unknown.\nIt was a completely different sensation from the one he had when getting inside the [City Ruins], but it was just to remind him that this rift was on a whole other level.\n'No… it can't be worse than this…' he remembered the Domination Trial and the hellish bosses he had to defeat, in comparison, this would be NOTHING.\nAnd so he entered.\n[Level 35-50 Hell-Level Rift: The Valley of Shadows]\n[Good luck!]",

The other participants shuffled nervously around him, whispering among themselves in hushed tones.\nBut he knew he shouldn't waste time, and so while all the others waited for their teammates or got ready to strategize…\n\"DOMINATION!\" he activated his skill, and his crimson aura surrounded by feet.\n~DASH~\nHe began running toward the entrance with incredible speed, surprising all the others.\n\"Already going? The fuck\"\n\"Holy shit… isn't that the level 16 guy?\"\n\"Yeah he is definitely going to die…\"\nThe mountain was extremely tall, even reaching the dark clouds with lightning that decorated the red sky.\n\"Even high level rifts have low-levels monster in some location, try to find one and gain experience there,\" was what Vex told him, and that's exactly what Stark planned to do.\nGoing head to head with several level 35 monsters was absolutely suicide when he thought about it, even with his upgraded health and incredible stats.\nMany people followed after Stark after he began rushing toward the real start of the rift, these grass plains were in fact only the 'safe' area, the real challenge beginning when you entered the valley.\nThe entrance of the mountain was akin to some sort of cave, except there was no way to check inside, a black fog stopping anyone from seeing past it.\n[Once you enter the level 35 area: \"Mountain Challenge\", you will not be able to return until at least reaching the Valley of Shadows, so be careful =)]\n'Why is it called the valley if it's inside a mountain...' Stark pondered, but he guessed that it was because this was only the beginning: meaning that the rift was just testing them, only those able to pass the Mountain Challenge would be allowed to traverse.\nThe darkness of the cave enveloped Stark as he stepped through the threshold, the black fog swirling around him like shadows come to life.\nUpon coming out of the other side, he found himself in a labyrinth-like area inside the mountain, all walls were made of the same texture as the mountain.\nAnd so he began walking.\n[You are the first to enter the 'Mountain Challenge', how BRAVE!]\nAnd of course, what would be his reward for being so brave? Well…\nA monster! Of course!\nAs he rounded a corner, a pair of glowing eyes pierced the shadows, fixating on him with predatory intent.\nThe creature emerged from the darkness - a massive beast with sleek brown fur and razor-sharp claws.\nBut of course, it wasn't alone, and behind it, another three pairs of eyes appeared, and then these monsters emerged too.\nThey looked like wolves.\n…\n[Name: Mountain Wolf]\n[Level: 30]\n[HP: 37000]\n[Strength: 938]\n[Stamina: 738]\n[Speed: 1103]\n[Defense: 492]\n[Skills: Ferocious Bite, Shadow Pounce, Pack Tactics…]\n…\n[WARNING! Your level is low (16), do not attempt to fight, run!]\n'Nah, i'd win,' Stark positioned his fists in front of his face, ready to take on the four wolves, who somehow almost had as much HP as the boss of the [City Ruins].\n\"AURA SMASH!\" he sent two of his crimson fists toward the wolves, but two of them avoided them, while the other two were hit.\n\"-19231! -20271!\" and just like that, the two wolves had died since they both received this incredible amount of damage.\n'Huh…?' Stark was confused, but he didn't have the time for that since the other wolves that had avoided his attack were already on their way to attack him.\n\"Ferocious Bite!\"\nHe dodged the first wolf's attack, feeling the rush of wind as its teeth snapped shut just inches from his arm.\nThe second wolf lunged at him from the side, but Stark was quick to react, planting a firm kick into its chest and sending it tumbling backward.\n\"-7261!\" even his kick dealt massive damage, but not enough to truly injure it.\nWith two wolves down and two remaining, Stark knew he had to act fast. The remaining beasts circled him, their eyes glinting with hunger as they closed in for another attack.\nAs one of the wolves lunged towards him, Stark made a split-second decision. Instead of dodging, he grabbed the beast by its fur mid-air and used its momentum to swing it into the other wolf, knocking them both off balance.\nTaking advantage of the momentary confusion, Stark unleashed a flurry of punches and kicks, each strike hitting with precision and strength.\n\"-13622! -14361! -12838!\"\nAnd so, all the wolves were dead, their defense was low, so hit attacks damaged them greatly, only taking him three hits for each of them to send them back to the shadow realm.\n[Experience: 187617/225000]\n[You have slain two \"Mountain Wolves lv30\", gained 38751EXP!]\n[You have slain two \"Mountain Wolves lv30\", gained 39817EXP!]\nAnd so immediately, the influx of experience headed toward Stark's body, and he was enveloped by that golden aura again.\n…\n[Your level has increased to level 17, granting you one skill point and boost in stats]\n[Experience: 41185/268000]\n[You have upgraded 'Domination' to level 7!]\n'Yeah… the amount of experience needed is really getting out of hand…'\nBut he didn't really have the time to think about it that he heard more noise behind and in front of him.\n[Name: Sneaky Mole lv32]\n[Name: Sound Bat lv31]\n[Name: Rock Golem Lv30]\n'Ah shit… here we go again…' Stark got ready to fight them all, after all, nobody would come to save him in this place, especially since he had made himself a target for others, plus they wouldn't benefit from it.\nAnd so he dashed forward, toward one of the many monsters, and punched it as hard as he could.\n\"-15472!\"\n\"LET'S DO THIS, MY EXPERIENCE POINTS,\" he laughed before going on a rampage.",

As the mole popped up right behind him, Stark spun around and delivered a swift kick that sent the creature flying back into the dirt.\n\"-17837!\"\nThen he sent a crimson fist from 'Aura Smash' inside that hole, killing the mole.\n\"-21263!\"\nNext, the Sound Bat swooped down from above, screeching loudly in an attempt to disorient Stark. However, he remained focused and timed his jump perfectly, meeting the bat mid-air with two powerful uppercuts that silenced it for good.\n\"-18263! -17702!\"\nThe Rock Golem lumbered towards Stark, its massive stone fists raised to crush him. Stark knew he wouldn't be able to take this monster down with just brute force. Instead, he dodged its first strike and aimed for the gem embedded in its chest - the source of its power.\nWith a calculated move, Stark dashed around the golem, avoiding its heavy attacks and striking precisely at the gem. As his fist connected with the crystal, a blinding light burst forth, causing the golem to shudder and crumble into a pile of rubble.\n\"-37162!\"\nThis was the most amount of damage he had dealt to an opponent, but it seems like aiming for an enemy's weak point caused more damage, just like in video games.\n[You have slain one \"Sneaky Mole lv32\", gained 21627EXP!]\n[You have slain one \"Sound Bat lv31\", gained 19880EXP!]\n[You have slain one \"Rock Golem lv34\", gained 23726EXP!]\n'Fair,' he cracked his bones and kept going, after all this was only the starting area, and he didn't want to stay there too long although it was a perfect opportunity to farm levels.\nHe continued his journey deeper into the heart of the mountain, each step echoing in the dimly lit cavern.\nThe path ahead twisted and turned, leading him further away from the entrance and into the unknown depths.\nAlong the way, he encountered more formidable foes - giant spiders with dripping fangs, elemental spirits crackling with power, and even a towering golem made of pure iron.\nBut in the end…\n[You have slain one \"Silky Spider lv33\", gained 23182EXP!]\nNot a single one of those monsters…\n[You have slain one \"Mountain Spirit lv31\", gained 22619EXP!]\nPut a dent on him.\n[You have slain one \"Iron Golem lv32\", gained 24271EXP!]\n…\n[Your level has increased to level 18, granting you one skill point and boost in stats]\n…\n[Your level has increased to level 19, granting you one skill point and boost in stats]\n…\n[Experience: 8261/310000]\nBy the time he reached the end of the level 35 area, which took quite a while since he had been lost and also struggled to fight some of the monsters, he was already level 19.\n[You have upgraded 'Domination' to level 8!]\n[You have upgraded 'Aura Smash' to level 6!]\nIn front of him was yet another black fog, the same as the one as the entrance, making him unable to see anything past it.\nHe took a deep breath and stepped forward, unsure of what lay ahead. The darkness of the fog enveloped him, and a strange sensation washed over him.\nAs his eyes adjusted to the lack of light, he could see faint wisps of energy surrounding him, a message appeared before him:\n[You have entered Level 40 area: The Valley's Forest]\nHe emerged from the other side, and then found himself outside again, except it was completely different.\nHe was now surrounded by trees, and much like the area's name described, he was inside of a forest.\nThe sky was still a crimson red, and the three moons were still looking down at… him?\n'Almost feels like these things are looking at only me…' Stark didn't like it, but he couldn't do anything about it.\nSurrounding him were not only trees, but giant mountains in all directions, blocking anyone from leaving this place.\nAnd his objective? Well… the rift itself showed it to him.\n[You are the first person to reach the 'Valley's Forest', granting you information!]\nThe message turned into a sparkling light, and hurtled toward a giant mountain in front of him like a shining star, one he could hardly see because of the tree leaves.\nObserving closely, Stark could see that there was some sort of structure on that mountain, and a flight of stairs were leading up to it, but it was extremely far.\n'Welp, need to keep going…'\nStark took a few steps forward and then suddenly hear a weird noise.\n~BEEP, BEEP, BEEP~\nIt didn't take him more than a few seconds to look down and see that the \"Crimson Moon Communication Device\" he was wearing was glowing repeatedly.\n[Please click on the badge to answer the call!]\nStark hesitated for a moment, debating whether to answer the call or ignore it and continue his journey into the Valley's Forest. Curiosity got the better of him, and he tapped on the badge, activating the communication device.\nAnd as soon as he did, Vex's voice rang in his ears, even though he wasn't wearing earphones or anything of the sort.\n\"Yo, Stark, everyone received a message that someone just entered the level 40 area, are you doing good on your end?\"\nAll the 'Crimson Moon Squad' members could hear or engage in their discussion, but they preferred to listen.\n\"Yeah… I just entered it, I guess…\" Stark answered nonchalantly.\n\"WAIT WHAT?\" Thorns intervened, \"IT'S YOU?\"\n\"…?\" Stark was confused, after all wasn't the reason they called him because they knew?\nBut unbeknownst to him, Secret Rifts were different from normal ones since they were never explored before.\nEverytime someone entered a new area or defeated an elite/mini-boss/boss, everyone inside the rift would be notified (it was the same in the 'City Ruins' except only for mini-bosses and bosses).\nBasically, everyone had received this message.\n[Someone has reached the level 40 area, hurry up!]\nVex had indeed called to check on Stark, but he hadn't expected him to be the one to reach it.\n\"You really are stronger than you look, you know?\" the leader praised him.\n\"I hear that often,\" Stark smiled.\n\"Well, i'll let you go, we need to make sure not to let any of the other factions take the lead!\"\nAnd just like that, the call was ended.\nThe shadows of the trees ahead of him and the overall atmosphere of this forest were very eerie, but Stark didn't care.\n'Level 25…' he mumbled over and over, he wanted to find a good spot to farm experience, and he believed that this rift would be perfect for it.\nBut of course, just as he was about to head deeper inside the forest, he heard noise behind him, from the 'Mountain Challenge's' exit, and…\n~FWISH~\nFour people came out from the black fog.\n\"Haha~ this isn't hard at all, let's just beat the boss and get this over with!\"\nInstinctively, Stark hid behind a tree, he didn't know whether these people were aggresive or not, and he didn't want to risk it.\nEven more so knowing there was the possibility of their level being way higher than his.\nIn such a rift, where nobody would question what happened, it is kill or be killed, and no one will know the truth even if you were murdered.\n\"We can also just loot the guy that already came here, he musn't be far since the message appeared three minutes ago…\"\n\"Good idea, let's kill that fucker and take his equipment!\"\n'…' he had gotten his answer.",

He had never encountered living trees before, let alone ones with a malevolent intent.\n…\n[Name: Fake Trees]\n[Level: 38]\n[HP: 48500]\n[Strength: 1782]\n[Stamina: 966]\n[Speed: 102]\n[Defense: 736]\n[Skills: Branch Strike, Root entangle, Life drain, Fakeout…]\n…\nStark quickly assessed the situation and knew he had to act fast. With a deep breath, he activated [Domination] and focused his energy.\nThe Fake Trees began to advance slowly, their branches creaking as they moved closer to him.\nThey were extremely slow as they were basically using their roots to move slowly, but their reach and strength were on a whole other level, and he felt like even one attack would kill him.\n\"CLONE FRENZY!\" he decided to summon one of his clones beside him to increase his odds since fighting such opponents alone could never be good.\nStark's clone appeared by his side, mirroring his every move as they faced off against the menacing Fake Trees.\nThe Fake Trees, sensing the increased threat from the appearance of the clone, moved more aggressively towards Stark and his doppelganger. Branches lashed out with incredible speed, aiming to strike them down with brute force.\nStark and his clone leaped and dodged with expert agility, narrowly avoiding the deadly strikes of the Fake Trees. They worked in tandem, coordinating their movements to confuse and outmaneuver their wooden adversaries.\nAnd thanks to that, the clone was able to reach one of the trees before Stark did so.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" it jumped in the air and threw its two crimson fists toward one of the trees' eyeball.\n\"-25918! -24277!\"\n'Holy, the damage is insane even for the clone…' Stark thought after seeing that first tree fall to the ground, meaning that their weaknesses was indeed that vulnerable eyeball.\nStark knew that he needed to exploit this weakness to defeat the Fake Trees. With determination in his eyes, he focused his energy and dashed towards another tree, his movements quick and precise.\nAs he approached the towering wooden creature, branches swiped at him viciously, but Stark anticipated the attacks and ducked, narrowly avoiding them.\nWith a burst of speed, Stark leaped up high and aimed two powerful crimson fists toward the eyeballs of two other 'Fake Trees'.\n~BOOM, BOOM!~\n\"-39272! -38128!\" both of them were hit, and put on one HP.\n[Enemy stunned]\nAnd in addition to that, one was stunned, allowing Stark's clone to punch the two trees and kill them both.\n\"Root Entangle!\" but he didn't have much more time to do anything else that roots came out of the ground beneath his clone and grabbed it, slamming it to the ground while restraining its movements.\n\"-5623!\" the damage was insane, and of course the clone died since it only had one point of health.\nStark didn't want to summon his second clone either as there could be a risk of losing it, so he decided to face off the last two alone.\nStark stood alone against the remaining two Fake Trees, their crimson eyeballs fixed on him with malice.\nHe took a deep breath, then began running toward the two trees as they were both right next to one another.\nBut of course, even monsters had brains.\n\"ROOT ENTANGLE!\" seeing that their branch strikes were all avoided by Stark, they decided to ambush him by summoning hundreds of roots from the ground, making it almost impossible for Stark to avoid them all.\nThat is… if he didn't have 'THAT' skill.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" at the perfect timing, he rolled forward and passed right through the attack using his invincibility frames.\nAnd so he found himself right in front of the monsters, a wide grin on his face as he knew that it was over.\n\"CHECKMATE,\" he laughed as he activated [Aura Smash] and sent the two fists at each of the trees.\n\"-42718! -43772!\" and then he followed through with two punches while they were recovering from that.\n~CRACK, CRUNCH!~\nThe two Fake Trees crumbled to the ground, defeated by Stark's strategic prowess and powerful attacks.\n[HP:7650/7650]\nStark observed that with each level he completed, his HP would increase significantly more than it did in the previous level, which was why he was already at 7650 while being only level 19.\n[You have slain one \"Fake Tree lv38\", gained 32619EXP!]\n[You have slain one \"Fake Tree lv38\", gained 31993EXP!]\n[You have slain one \"Fake Tree lv38\", gained 32182EXP!]\n…\nHe had gotten over 150000 experience points in this singular battle, and although he had almost died many times, it was still worth it to him.\nAnd so he kept going inside the 'Valley's Forest', fighting his way through the monsters he would encounter.\n…\n[You have slain one \"Forest Spirit lv37\", gained 30736EXP!]\n[You have slain one \"Grass Wolf lv39\", gained 34012EXP!]\n[You have slain one \"Fire Bear lv36\", gained 29824EXP!]\n…\nAnd so soon enough, he reached level 20.\n[Your level has increased to level 20, granting you one skill point and boost in stats]\n[Level 20 Reached: please pick a skill card]\nThree red cards appeared in front of him just like the previous times, and Stark took the one in the middle since he didn't really have the time to decide in this dangerous environment.\nHe took the card and flipped it, and there he saw the drawing of a crimson spear.\n'…?' he immediately read the name of the skill.",

Stark was taken aback, his confusion quickly turning into unease.\nThe injured fox was on the brink of death, what could it possibly do to save itself?\nAnd then, as if in response to his thoughts, a feeling stirred within him. It was a deep instinct, almost primal in nature, urging him to move and dodge 'it'.\nDodge what? He didn't know, but in his mind, a message appeared.\n[Above you]\nHis pupils burning with aura, he dived forward at the last second.\n~BOOM~\nSomething came crashing at the spot he was at before.\n\"-27182!\" the clone had been hit and died, the aura that formed it seeping back into his body.\n\"FUCKING HELL!\" he shouted, then positioned himself.\nAs the smoke from the sudden attack cleared, he could finally make out the figure in front of him: a towering green gorilla with vines sprouting from its back.\nThe creature's powerful arms slammed into the ground, leaving behind a massive crater.\n…\n[Name: Vine Gorilla (ELITE - FOREST GUARDIAN)]\n[Level: 40]\n[HP: 120000]\n[Strength: 2182]\n[Stamina: 627]\n[Speed: 736]\n[Defense: 1595]\n[Skills: Vine Whip, Vine Grapple, Earthquake, Leap Strike, Earth Force, Muscle Enforcement, Vine Shield…]\n…\n\"TWO OF THEM?\" Stark didn't like that, but he still had a neutral expression on his face, he hadn't expected the 'Call of the Forest' skill to be used to summon another one of the guardians.\nThat panel when he appeared in this area had informed him there were three of them, and he honestly didn't want to find out what would happen if all three came to him.\n\"VINE WHIP,\" dozens of the vines that came from the Gorilla's back suddenly rushed toward Stark, and he swiftly avoided them all.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" he answered with sending a crimson fist toward the Gorilla, and another at the Fire Fox.\n\"-12372!\" it hit the gorilla since its speed was low, but the guardian didn't even look bothered by his attack.\n\"FIREBALLS!\" the Fire Fox obviously didn't stay put and dodged the crimson fist all the while beginning to send another barrage of fire balls at him.\n'Fucking hell…' Stark began running in the opposite direction.\n\"VINE GRAPPLE,\" vines came hurtling from the ground around Stark, catching his leg as he didn't expect it.\n\"SHIT,\" he saw a fire ball coming, and with the right timing used [Invincible Dodge] to save himself before cutting off the vines with his aura-infused palm.\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS,\" Stark knew that the fox would just avoid them all, but he summoned back his spears and threw at the gorilla, who didn't even bother avoiding them either.\n\"Muscle Reinforcement,\" The gorilla flexed its muscles and its chest began shining.\n~PAF, PAF, PAF~\nThe spears had indeed reached their target, but…\n\"-0! -0! -0!\"\nThey just bounced off the gorilla's chest like they were made out of plastic.\nThe guardian smirked at Stark afterward, taunting him.\n'I'll sell your fur at the market when i'm done with you…' Stark groaned, but he was too preoccupied with avoiding the vines and fireballs that came from all directions to say it out loud.\n'This isn't working…' he thought, he knew he couldn't hit the fox this way since it would avoid all his attacks, and the gorilla would tank everything.\nHe also didn't want to use another clone or [Double Assault] yet since they could be needed later.\nSo he did the next best thing: run.\nBut of course, the point of running wasn't to cowardly escape the fight, in contrary: he wanted to outsmart the two monsters while they were chasing him, and if they didn't, then who cares.\nStark sprinted through the forest, dodging the vines and the constant barrage of fireballs. He kept glancing behind him, making sure he could see both the gorilla and the Fox following him.\nHe could hear the gorilla's heavy footsteps behind him as it tried its hardest to keep up with Stark's and the Fox's incredible speed.\nThe fox easily catched up to Stark several times and tried to slash him with its claws, but of course, the boy would just avoid the attacks and force the Fire Fox to back away.\nAnd after a few minutes of that, where none of his [Aura Smash] fists dealt any damage, and where his [Crimson Spears] were all avoided or blocked, he heard something in the distance: the sound of people fighting.\n\"BINGO!\" if they were a higher level than he was, then they could definitely assist him in defeating these monsters.\nAnd so he rushed toward the sounds.\nBut once he got close enough… the noises suddenly stopped.\n\"GRRAAAAWWWRRR~\" and a massive roar echoed from the location of the sounds.\n\"What the hell?\" Stark kept going, and soon enough he reached the place he had heard the noise from.\nAnd that's when he saw it: the bodies of four classifiers were on the ground, all mutilated or decapitated.\nThe responsible was the creature that roared: a giant blue bear that was standing up on its two legs, a fierce blue aura in its eyes.\n[Water Bear lv40 (ELITE - FOREST GUARDIAN)]\nRight behind Stark were the Fire Fox and Vine Gorilla, and in front of him was the Water Bear.\nHe was surrounded by the three guardians, and the people he believed could help him were already dead.\n'Life is terrible,' he sighed.",

His strength, speed, agility, and aura were all doubled, making him a fearsome force to be reckoned with.\nThe Vine Gorilla and Water Bear immediately took notice of the sudden change in Stark's abilities, but they didn't back down.\n[10 seconds left for 'Double Assault']\nHis time was counted, and so Stark decided he would make the best of it.\nHe leaped towards the Vine Gorilla, his crimson fists glowing with immense power.

-6744! -7261!\"\n…\nBy the end of the ten seconds, the clone had dealt 88726 points of damage to the bear, placing it on its final 5k health points.\nStark had already finished off the gorilla by then, and was just watching how his clone was doing, he was ready to intervene, but honestly, he wanted to see how far it would go.\n'Of course, I don't expect it to win,' he shrugged, but was immediately proven wrong as even without the increased speed, the clone managed to land three more good punches on the bear before the 'Water Cannon' finally hit it.\n\"-3261!\" the clone disappeared as it was hit, but it had already done its job.\n[Water Bear (GUARDIAN) HP: 0/100000]\nThe Water Bear let out a final cry before falling on its stomach.\n\"…\" Stark looked at the surrounding chaos, then back at the three guardians he had defeated (or just two because a clone had pretty much taken one by itself).\n\"I WON!\" he shouted as hard as he could, although he was bleeding from his back and leg because of the attacks, and there were traces of fire because of the burning.\nMeanwhile, back to the 'Wyvern's Wrath' group that had been observing Stark.\nWell… saying they were astonished would be an understatement.\n\"ISN'T THAT THE LEVEL 16 GUY, HOW?\"\n\"No idea... that boy is insane... I don't think even I would have done something so reckless...\"\n\"But his aura was insane! Did he just take on three guardians at the same time?!\"\nMurmurs spread around, and Stark's brother, the leader of the group, composed himself, \"Probably one of those prodigies, I wonder what his class is…\" he scratched his chin.\n\"Well… we did what we needed to do, let's keep going,\" he told his members, and they all nodded, what they had just witnessed was insane, but they had more serious things to take care of as the rift was far from completed.",

      "content": "[Many people have reached the level 45 area!]\nSuch a message appeared before Stark while he was walking through the Valley's Forest and killing monsters left and right in the hope of leveling up.\nBut honestly, he wasn't surprised, after all he had spent a good fifteen minutes fighting the guardians, and most of the classifiers were already inside the forest by now.\n'Gotta go faster if I wanna fight the boss myself…' he mumbled, but knew deep down he couldn't afford to waste energy.\n\"-28172!\" his aura had indeed gotten stronger, and he could now two-shot most enemies, and even one-shot those that have visible weaknesses like the 'Fake Trees'.\n[You have slain \"Forest Spirit lv39\", gained 33736EXP!]\n[You have slain \"Rock Python lv40\", gained 35128EXP!]\n[You have slain one \"Fake Tree lv38\", gained 30736EXP!]\n…\n[Experience: 281627/415000]\nStark wondered if the 'Crimson Moon Squad' had already gone ahead and passed the forest, after all Vex and the members were much stronger than he was, so it wouldn't be surprising.\nHe didn't want (and didn't know how) to call them anyway.\nAnd soon enough, he reached the end of the 'Valley's Forest'.\nLittle by little, the trees became less and less apparent, until eventually, he left the forest and found himself at the entrance of the next area.\nRight in front of him, not even 5KM away, was the giant mountain with the staircase leading to the monument at the top: it was the final area of the rift.\nBut what stopped him (and many others) from passing was… a giant canyon, cutting the area into two.\n'…' Stark approached the canyon and looked down, noticing that at the very end of it was not only spikes that would kill anybody that touched them, but also hundreds of monsters, their eyes looking up at the humans.\n[You have entered Level 45 area: The Death Canyon]\nOf course, being in such a large space with monsters roaming, and no real visible way to pass it, meant that Stark could see dozens of people fighting around him.\n'Why aren't they using their powers to pass… I mean… aren't many able to fly?' he pondered, after all the canyon that seperated this side from the other only looked to be 100 meters in size.\nIt didn't take long for a panel to appear and explain everything.\n[Abilities that allow you to fly or cheat your way to the other side aren't allowed]\n[To pass the Death Canyon, you have to either find the item drop \"TP Pearl\" from a monster (extremely low chance to appear), or… wait twelve hours since it was first discovered]\nThe latter was obviously the safest solution there was, but when inside a Secret Rift, the true winner would be the one to accomplish the greatest feats and acquire the most material, so waiting around for all the others to arrive was a bad idea.\nBasically… those who found that 'TP PEARL' would get a massive advantage.\n'Huh…' Stark scratched his chin, he also wanted to be the first to defeat the boss, so this did put a strain on his quest…\nAlthough… he had the [Chosen One] talent, one of its perks being the fact many events, both good and bad will appear, so maybe… with enough luck…\n~FWISH~\nBut something came interrupting his thoughts as he suddenly felt a presence behind him, and moved to the site to avoid the attack.\n~BOOM!~\nA giant hammer hit the place he was previously in.\n'Wowow~ almost forgot I wasn't alone,\" he grinned and looked up to see a giant minotaur, with a steel hammer in its brown muscular hands.\nIt wasn't surprising, after all, almost everyone around the canyon was currently fighting a monster.\nAnother one of the bad things about waiting in this area was that you would need to constantly fight for the next 12 hours, and it was bound to tire out most people, forcing them to take a rest and waste precious time again.\n\"MINO SMASH!\" the minotaur yet again swung its hammer at Stark, forcing him to dodge again by crouching.\n…\n[Name: Canyon Minotaur (STRONG)]\n[Level: 46]\n[HP: 80000]\n[Strength: 1121]\n[Stamina: 426]\n[Speed: 293]\n[Defense: 1214]\n[Skills: Mino Smash, Enraged Charge, Berserk State, Horn Frenzy, Ground Pound…]\n…\n\"ENRAGED CHARGE,\" the beast didn't waste time and dashed at Stark with its… very low speed.\nIt was at least 7 meters tall, but it ran very slowly as it took it three massive steps (that shook the earth) to reach Stark and swing its hammer at him.\n~FWISH~\nStark knew better than to ignore a charging minotaur and moved every time to avoid the attack.\nEnraged charge seemed to allow the minotaur to strike at Stark several times.\nBut honestly… what was the point of aimlessly trying to hit an opponent faster than you?\n\"…\" Stark jumped in the air after the minotaur got angry and used both its hand to smash the hammer to the ground, creating a giant crater.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" he spinned in the air and sent a crimson fist of aura toward the minotaur.\nIn response, the minotaur tried to use its hammer to hit the fist that was flying toward it.\nBut of course… it didn't work.\n~BOOM~\n\"-18271!\" almost a fourth of its life was consumed, and it could honestly thank its high defense and HP pool, else it would be just a fodder monster.\n'That guy is slow, and dumb, we got a combo,' Stark dropped to the ground and summoned [Crimson Spears] to make his three spears appear behind him.\nThe minotaur seemed stunned for a moment (not the status effect), not expecting such a sudden change in Stark's strategy. Its slow reflexes made it hard for it to react in time.\n\"GROUND POUND!\" it jumped in the air, extremely high, and then used its strong legs to slam the ground, creating tremors and sending a shockwave in all directions.\nDespite its slow speed, it was a powerful blow that could knock down even the fastest of opponents if they weren't careful.\nAfter all… the point of this attack wasn't to cause damage, but if the shockwave even scratched your little pinky, then you would 100% receive the 'stun' status effect, essentially guaranteeing your death.\nBut in response, Stark just threw his three spears at the minotaur, who clenched its chest and crossed its arms, ready for impact.\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWISH~\nThe three spears hit the minotaur respectively, in the leg, the torso and… the head.\n\"-7261! -3625! -13152!\" the one in the head did massive damage.\nAt that very moment, Stark understood just how powerful it was to be fast, and that having the highest strength in the world wouldn't mean anything if you were too slow.\n\"Invincible Dodge!\" not wanting to risk it, he rolled as soon as the shockwave was centimeters away from him, essentially avoiding it.\n\"ROOOOARRR~\" the minotaur screamed, a shout that passed through the entire canyon, everyone inside of it able to hear it and turning their heads to see what was happening.\n\"BERSERK STATE!\" it activated its most powerful skill, its eyes flashing with a crismson berserk aura, readying its hammer to strike down the human.\n\"Alright buddy,\" Stark's eyes also glew with that same crimson aura, \"Come at me, big boy!\"",

      "content": "The clash between the powerful Canyon Minotaur and Stark was unlike any other battle anyone had witnessed in the Death Canyon (at least for now).\nHe didn't know why, but somehow, the strongest monster of them all had approached Stark, maybe it was because of his aura, or maybe since he had the [Chosen One] talent?\nThe mighty creature, aided by its high defense and health pool, tried its best to overpower Stark with its superior strength and brute force.\n~BOOM~\nIt smashed the ground with its hammer, and when Stark avoided it, it would try to use its body to slam him to turn him into a pancake.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" the first time, Stark was taken aback, forcing him to roll away using his invincibility frames and avoid the slam that would surely kill him.\nAt this point, most of the people surrounding the 'Death Canyon' were watching Stark's fight as it was the most interesting one, all others were too one-sided or just plain up boring, and it seemed like they had wiped out the monsters available already, meaning they would need to wait for more to spawn.\nDespite his impressive evasion skills, Stark was not immune to the minotaur's raw power.\nEvery now and then, the creature, using its increased speed from the [Berserk] state it was in, would managet to take him by surprise and almost hit him.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" Stark dodged another hammer blow and sent a crimson fist at the monster, who received it in the head.\n\"-5351!\" the damage was very low, it's high defense in addition to the berserk state made it immune to pain too, resulting in it not even budging with this attack.\nBut Stark sent another one, which the minotaur yet again didn't avoid.\nIt now believed that although Stark was dealing quite decent damage to it, it could overpower him and in the end win by hitting him with a single attack.\n~SWING~\nIt shielder itself from the crimson fist using its hammer vertically, but there was no use.\n\"-3721!\" the damage yet again was extremely low compared to Stark's usual standarts.\nBut what it didn't expect was…\n[Enemy stunned!]\nThe minotaur felt a shiver go through its spine, and suddenly… it couldn't move anymore, it was like an external force was not allowing him to do anything anymore.\n'…?' it looked at the boy with widened eyes, its pupils on him.\n\"Gotcha!\" but all it could see was Stark's wide grin.\n\"He can stun enemies?\" one of the classifirs that had already fought their monster mumbled.\nThe 'Stun' affect was very rare in comparison to what Stark believed: he had gotten used to it since it was the first real skill he had gotten, but it never really went through his mind just how overpowered being able to stun an enemy was.\nAnd in addition to that, 'Aura Smash' had a 30% chance to stun the enemy, making it one hell of a powerful skill.\n\"Hmm~ interesting,\" a white-haired woman grinned as well, she was floating in the air (but of course a magical wall was stopping her from passing the death canyon that way).\n\"That little shit…\" Jack, the one that had caused a commotion at the beginning of the rift sneered, visibly upset that the 'bunny masked' boy was attracting so much attention.\nBut getting so much attention from powerful classifiers from all over the world was both a good and bad thing, since now even though they didn't know his face, 'the 'bunny masked boy' was an alias they gave to Stark, meaning that he was bringing both people with good intentions, and those who on the otherhand wanted to get rid of him.\n\"CLONE FRENZY!\" not caring about the gazes of everyone, Stark summoned one of his clones since it had been more than thirty minutes since the last use.\nThe crimson Stark appeared beside the original, looking at him before staring at the minotaur with a blank expression, it then nodded, understanding what it was supposed to do, and dashed at the monster.\n\"Clones that react to you and can actually fight…\" Vex observed from afar alongside the 'Crimson Moon Squad', they had arrived shortly before Stark, and were surprised to see him go all out.\nBut unbeknownst to them, Stark wasn't going all out at all, it was the complete opposite, he was frankly enjoying toying with the minotaur.\n\"CRIMSON SPEAR,\" the clone sent three spears at the minotaur's right leg, the three weapons piercing it and making huge holes appear.\n\"-3259! -4361! -3972!\"\n\"GAK~\" the minotaur fell to its knee, its right leg completely useless now.\nA monster didn't need to reach 0HP to become useless, not at all, they could lose both arm and be unable to use their weapons, or both legs, forcing them to be in place.\nThis was the reason why aiming for the head caused much more damage than anything else, and why decapitating a monster (even if it had 1 million HP), would result in an instant death.\n[Canyon Minotaur (STRONG) HP: 17027/80000]\nStark had already caused massive damage to it before it was even stunned, so putting it at such a disadvantage and even summoning a clone to do the work was overkill.\nBut needless to say, Stark enjoyed this type of things, he was a full-on sadist.\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS,\" he summoned his own spears while the clone took the hammer from the minotaur's arm while it could only watch in terror.\n\"How is that clone even lifting such a massive weapon, it doesn't make sense…\" murmurs spread, and the reason was obvious: even though it was only a clone, it was able to easily take that heavy hammer from the minotaur's strong grip and lift it away.\nBut the real question everyone was asking was: 'Just how strong is that guy if even the clone is that powerful…'\nOh boy… what could their reactions be if they knew Stark actually had two clones, and all of them could use 'Double Assault', a legendary skill.\n\"CYA, MONSTER,\" his eyes burning with aura, Stark sent the three sears that appeared behind him toward the minotaur's head.\nThe first two passed right through its eyes and skull, rendering it blind.\n\"-18272! -17264!\"\nAnd the last one was aimed for the throat.\n\"-37618!\" the damage was phenomenal, the highest amount Stark had ever caused to an enemy yet.\nAnd the reason was obvious: he had aimed for one of the minotaur's weaknesses.\nMonsters also have weaknesses in this word, just like the 'Fake Trees' weakness were their eyes, many monster have their heads, throat, or heart, as their weakness.\nAlthough most time it was difficult to reach them since… y'know… you are mid-battle and have to take many things into account.\nAnd so just like that, Stark defeated the minotaur, the beast crumbling to the ground as its HP reached 0 and also because its neck was basically pierced.",

      "content": "[You have slain \"Canyon Minotaur lv46 (STRONG)\", gained 63125EXP!]\n'Haha…' Stark smiled after seeing the minotaur's lifeless body fall, it wasn't a very hard battle since he avoided all the monster's attacks, but he couldn't say it didn't come close many times since even one hit from its hammer would be enough to kill him.\nStark knew that many people (if not most) inside the 'Death Canyon' were observing his every move, both thanks to the 'highlight replay' that was seen by everybody, but also since he had basically fought the strongest monster inside the canyon (at least for now).\nHe didn't know what to do now, and he didn't feel like interacting with anybody while waiting for the next batch of monsters to spawn, it seemed like no one had gotten a 'TP Pearl' either.\nBut as if some grand entity (well… probably Rher to be honest) heard it…\n[Talent: Chosen One, activated!]\n'What the?' he was confused, why would it activate now, was another bad thing bound to happen soon?!\nHe looked down at the minotaur's body, and suddenly, he saw not one, but two shiny sparks, one was red, and the other dark blue.\n'Ohoh~ the talent gave me equipment,' he grinned, actually happy that it finally was helping him out after fucking him so many times over.\nHe first reached out to pick the equipment with the red glow: it was a helmet, one that had two horns much like the minotaur ones, it had a brown color, its interior almost feeling like it was made of fur.\n'Great, it's useless…' he groaned, but still inspected it regardless.\n…\n[Equipment:] The Minotaur's Helmet\n[Type:] Helmet\n[Class:] Warrior\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Required Level:] 40\n[Quality:] Normal\n[Attributes:] +250 Strength, +400 Defense\n[Special Perk:] Allows the wearer to go into a berserk state, essentially using the 'Berserk State' skill of the Canyon Minotaur, which greatly enhances strength, defense, and stamina (+50% increase) for a minute.\n…\n\"I don't want to sound ungrateful, but I could really do without this helmet at the moment,\" Stark grumbled, hefting the helmet in his hand, it was maybe good for a warrior, but to no use for him currently.\n'Spatial Inventory,' he mumbled and put the equipment inside the void, before closing it shortly afterward.\nMost people had stopped looking at Stark now since the fight ended, instead discussion strategies with their respective team or taking a rest, but those who were still paying attention to him had yet again been surprised: what the fuck was that void next to him, and how did he put an item inside.\nPeople when they wanted to store an item for later would need to use an item called the 'Store Watch', its price depends on the amount of items you want to store inside, but usually it's around 10 for a normal one.\nAnd yet… what did that guy just do? Summoning a void next to him and putting the item inside of it like it was nothing.\n'An inventory skill?' they thought, unsure whether such a thing existed as it was only rumors.\nStark paid no attention to them and quickly moved on to the second item drop.\n[Talent: Chosen One, activated!]\nYet again, the notification appeared.\n'…?' he reached for the dark blue light, and it immediately disappeared once he touched the item, revealing it to be…\nA pearl?\nIt was a dark blue circular pearl that had aura emanating from it, Stark tried to look through it but saw nothing.\nOf course, in the back of his mind, a thought was slowly but surely emerging, but there was no way right?\nAfter all… the percentage chance of it dropping was extremely low… RIGHT?\nBut Stark didn't know that 'Chosen One' could defy anything to bring misfortune (or fortune) to its owner.\nOr at least, he had underestimated it.\n…\n[Item:] TP Pearl\n[Type:] Throwable\n[Quality:] Perfect\n[Perk:] Throw the pearl in the direction you want, and when it hits the ground, you will be teleported to that exact location.\n[Hint:] Throw it on the other side of the canyon to pass.\n…\nStark stared at the TP Pearl in his hand, trying to comprehend what was happening.\n'Chosen One' had actually helped him out, giving him the item he so wanted on his first try against one of the monsters.\nThe extremely low chances of dropping seemed to be completely defied.\nHe almost wanted to laugh out loud, but doing so would attract unwanted attention, so he just grabbed the pearl and tightened his hand around it to hide it from the others, all the while slowly approaching the edge of the canyon.\n\"Yo, what is he doing?\" someone asked, pointing at Stark.\n\"Huh… maybe he is trying to inspect the canyon?\"\n\"What a way to die, anybody could push him off if they felt like it…\"\nEven Lana was worried, what could Stark be doing, why was he approaching the edge of that deadly space, with spikes and monsters ready to kill whoever came down.\nBut once Stark reached the very edge.\nHe enacted his plan: use the TP pearl.\nHe slightly opened his hand, and suddenly, the glow of the pearl could be seen by everybody.\n[TP Pearl acquired!]\nA panel appeared in front of everyone, and an arrow pointed to Stark's location.\n~FWISH~\nStark threw the pearl as far as he could, easily making it fly over the canyon.\nMany people read the message and reacted immediately, dashing toward Stark with an impressive speed, wanting to steal the pearl and use it on themselves.\nBut it was too late.\nDozens of people reached Stark, but right as they were about to attack him and take it from him…\nThe pearl hit the ground on the other side of the canyon.\n\"Invincible Dodge!\" Stark used his skill and avoided everybody's attacks, giving him the invincibility frames he needed to teleport.\nIn a flash of dark blue light, Stark was surrounded by an aura by the same color and disappeared from his current location, leaving behind a confused and frustrated mob of players.\nReappearing on the other side of the canyon, he stumbled slightly from the disorienting teleportation before regaining his balance.\nAs he looked around, Stark realized that he was indeed on the other side, since just in the distance he could see the many people that had tried to attack him.\n\"SEE YA SUCKERS!\" he laughed out loud and shouted loud enough for everyone to hear.\n\"THAT LITTLE SHIT!\" Jack cursed again, he was among those that tried to attack Stark but miserably failed.\n\"Pffttt~ look at those dumbasses,\" those that didn't move from their places mocked those that actually tried to steal the item, leaving them embarrassed.\n\"Stark…\" Lana mumbled, impressed by his ability to avoid everyone, but also by his insane luck, getting the needed item on the first try was phenomenal to say the least.\n\"Ahhhh~ that feels good,\" Stark grinned and turned his back to the crowd of furious classifiers, waving his hand from behind to spit them even more, \"Anyway… now I have the complete advantage, I need to complete that rift before more people get the TP Pearl…\"\nAnd so he began running toward the other direction, ready to get to that monument at the top of the mountain.",

      "content": "\"THAT FUCKER!\" Jack smashed the ground with his wielder heart, he was absolutely furious Stark had somehow gotten past his attack.\nHe was level 114, and although that was only the middle-range for classifiers, it was still extremely powerful.\nAnd yet… how did a level 16 classifier avoid them all?\nPlus, the worse thing of all was Stark's taunt.\nNot many would let that slide usually, but they could go nothing when he was on the other side of the canyon, with no possibility for them to traverse except if they found the 'TP Pearl' or waited the 12 hours.\n[Someone has just passed the 'Death Canyon']\n[Unlocking a replay for credit purposes!]\n'Ah…' many sighed as this could only mean one thing…\nAnd although they knew, they still clicked on the video regardless, resulting in it playing in front of everybody.\nOf course, the content was obvious: Stark getting the pearl from the minotaur, approaching the edge, and throwing it, resulting in everyone dashing at him.\nBut this wasn't what surprised people the most.\nThere was a subtle detail when you zoomed and turned the camera on any angle.\nAnd that detail was… HOW THE FUCK DID STARK AVOID THEIR ATTACKS?\nThey were far stronger than he was for sure, and yet even with their speed, he somehow… passed through it all?\n\"Doesn't make sense,\" Old Kai, a beast tamer with a crow on his shoulder, sighed, he was part of another powerhouse of beast tamers, a guild called, \"The Monster Raiders\".\n\"Did you see him avoid my scythe?\" a blond-haired girl with stars in her purple eyes exclaimed, she was a warrior and her family was very well off as well.\nBut no… everyone who was watching the video could see it: he didn't avoid the scythe… IT LITERALLY PASSED THROUGH HIM WHILE HE WAS ROLLING.\nIt wasn't the only attack, many others also somehow passed through as if he was air, feeling like reality was distorted around that boy.\n\"I've seen lots of skills in my life,\" Vex laughed, playing with his heart again, \"But this is definitely a legendary skill at minimum, no other way!\"\n\"…?\"\nEvery single one of them (except for Lana) ranged from level 100 to 125 at most (since at some point the rift doesn't allow you to enter if it is too easy).\nAnd yet… they all knew the implications of what a legendary skill was.\nAfter all, even among them, many didn't have one.\n\"No way he got a skill that is legendary at level 16?\"\n\"What if he is dirt rich and bought it using his family's money?\"\n\"Doesn't make sense, even if you buy a legendary skill scroll, you still need to meet the requirements, and there are enormous chances to fail the awakening of the skill as it is based on your level!\"\nNone of them knew of the domination trial, and it was better that way since probably none of them would have survived if they had been placed in Stark's position.\n***\nBack to the black-haired boy, he turned after mocking all those that tried to attack him, honestly thanking everything for the [Invincible Dodge] skill as it was truly a blessing.\nIt was only 'Epic' in its rarity, but he honestly believed it should at least be legendary if not more because of how useful it was.\nBut unbeknownst to Stark, it wasn't that the skill was powerful, it was just that he had the perfect combination to use it at its full potential.\nHe had never thought about it, but the fact he had the [Focus] skill, which allowed him to see one micro-second in advance, was basically the perfect blend with [Invincible Dodge] who required perfect timing.\nAnybody else would have failed to dodge an attack at least once until now, and yet Stark had always succeeded.\nIt was like he was in a character in a souls game, able to dodge the attacks of every enemy and leaving them with absolutely no chance to retaliate or hit him.\nStark felt happy about what he had done.\nBut suddenly…\n~FWISH, CRASH~\n\"Huh?\" all the people on the other side of the canyon looked in horror as they saw a giant thing coming out from it.\nStark also heard noise behind him, so he turned, thinking that those losers on the other side were still fussing over his small victory, and then, coming from the canyon, a massive black golem with twisting metal appendages sprang forth from it, its rock-hard body glowing with an ominous aura.\nIn addition to that, its giant cubic head had three cubic eyes looking down at him.\nAnd once it stood completely, it became obvious the golem was at least twenty meters tall.\nStark's eyes widened, a few seconds ago he was at the top of the world, and the moment he turned, he was now facing an impossible opponent.\n\"DAMAGE WALLS!\" before he could even analyze it using [Perception], the monster attacked.\nSummoning four rock-solid walls in all directions, which were all closing in on Stark.\n…\n[Damage Wall: 10000/10000]\n[Perk: deals massive damage if crushed by it, the damage is doubled every other wall that touches the target]\n…\nThis meant… that if he was hit by that thing, it was game over.\n~FWISH~\n\"THAT'S WHAT YOU GET!\" many classifiers laughed at Stark for being too certain of himself.\nThe [Damage Wall] might as well be called an 'unavoidable attack' if the opponent doesn't know about it since it closes off too quick for them to react.\nAt least… that would be the case if Stark didn't have a skill to get out of this situation.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" he rolled away, and completely avoided the walls crashing on him thanks to his invincibility frames.\nThe walls all crumbled as they all hit each other, the absence of Stark making them take all their damage and go back into the ground.\nBeyond the rubble and the dust that formed, Stark could be seen standing, a smirk on his face while he was wiping his sweating forehead.\n\"Nice try~\" he smiled, \"Try that again and it might work!\"\n\"SEE, HE DID IT AGAIN!\" a young boy, possibly Stark's age (although he had a bigger level somehow), \"HE IS FINE WHILE BEING HIT BY THAT!\"\n\"I'm telling you, this is a legendary skill!\" Vex confirmed, enjoying the show as he didn't know his newest recruit had such talent (of course Stark had no plans to stay with the 'Crimson Moon Squad').\nAnd suddenly, a panel appeared in front of everyone as Stark began facing the giant golem.\n[Secret Rift Mini-Boss: \"Obsidian Golem lv50\", was found!]\nAnd just as they all guessed, that was the thing Stark would need to fight… ALONE!",

spike ball with his sheer hands while risking his life.\nAll of these things were risks many people would never take, and yet he had done it all in succession.\nPlus he had done it so perfectly it was as if… he knew what he was doing since the beginning, with no place for doubts.\n[You have beaten the boss while being alone (SOLO achievement), granting you better equipment pieces]\nBeside the

didn't feel the need to for now.\n\"SEE YOU FUCKERS!\" then he turned at the classifiers on the other side of the canyon and waved at them.\nBut they couldn't even be mad at him after what they had just witnessed.\nPlus, they couldn't really curse him long since the monsters began spawning again, meaning it was their chance to get a TP pearl.\n***\nStark ran toward the giant mountain with the

afford to be vulnerable now.\n'If only there was a bonfire… somehow I really miss those…' he sighed.\nThe harder a rift is, the less bonfires there are, and it was safe to assume that there was none

slow, and his eyes tired.\nAnd after a few minutes, he arrived, then rested against the rock, his eyes dizzy.\nOf course, sleeping in a rift was the worst possible idea anybody could have.\nOnly a

depleted.\n\"…\" the clone nodded and positioned itself, it was allowed to use every skill and do anything to protect Stark, so it was ready to battle all night as it was like a bodyguard that could

-16268!\" two of them were hit directly while the other two avoided the attack since they were further.\n[Enemy stunned]\nOne of the two wolves fell to the ground as it couldn't flap its wings anymore.\nAnd so the clone took advantage of that while the others were still trying to recover.\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS,\" it sent the three spears at the fallen wolf's head, which basically acted as its weakness.\nAnd the three pierced it.\n\"-27362! -28284! -26837!\" it died immediately as holes were left in the places the spears were aimed at.\nThen without wasting time, it dashed at the second wolf which had been hit by the crimson fists as its HP was already down.\n~FWISH~\n\"AERIAL ASSAULT!\"\n\"FEROCIOUS BITE!\"\nOne of the two monsters which escaped the crimson attack flew in the air then dived at the clone, attempting to kill it as it sensed that a single attack would be enough.\nBut…\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" the clone rolled forward and avoided the wolf's claws, which kept flying as it didn't expect for such a thing to happen.\nThen the second one got on its feet and dashed at incredible speed toward the clone, which just looked at it with the same blank and calm expression it always had.\nA clone couldn't feel emotions after all… or could it?\n~SMASH~\nInstead of avoiding the 'Ferocious Bite' from the wolf, it just surrounded its hands with aura and smashed its head.\nThe momentum sent it flying very far.\n\"-28372!\"\nBut the clone didn't let go.\n\"-29329! -27624!\" it killed the second wolf, then dashed toward the one that was hit by its crimson fists.\n\"PARALYZE!\" it roared at the clone, as the skill [Paralyze] basically paralyzed enemies if they had just an ounce of fear while looking at them.\nBut of course…\n['Fear' and 'Paralyze' don't work on 'Domination' class]\nAnd anyway, it was a clone, it couldn't sense fear.\nSo while the wolf was getting ready to use another skill…\nThe clone smashed its head, killing it instantly.\n\"-48371!\" their weaknesses were their heads, so destroying it was an insta-kill.\n\"CRIMSON FIST!\" then finally, the clone sent two final fists as the last wolf which was just coming after flying too far.\nAnd it was killed.\n'…' the clone went back in front of Stark after getting rid of the enemies, its mission wasn't done yet as there were still two hours before waking up its owner.\n[You have slain four 'Flying Wolves lv56', gained 28271EXP!]\nAnd of course, the experience was massively reduced as in under normal circumstances, he should have gotten at least 200000.\n***\n~SHAKE~\n'Huh…' Stark slowly opened his eyes, rubbing them after a few seconds.\nHe sat up, glancing around to find his surroundings eerily quiet.\nThe clone stood vigilantly nearby after waking up its owner, its eyes meeting Stark's with an unreadable expression.\nStark couldn't help but feel a sense of pride at the clone's success in protecting him while he slept.\n\"Good job,\" he smiled before making the clone disappear.\nIt had been exactly five hours since he slept, and now he felt that his stamina was recovered thanks to that.\nPlus… it seemed like nobody had traversed the canyon yet, the odds of a pearl appearing were even lower since someone had already found one after all.\nOr at least, that's what he thought.\nBecause before the clone disappeared, it pointed in the distance at the direction Stark came from.\nAnd there he saw… a group of classifiers marching toward him.\n'…?' it hadn't woken him up because the time was up, but because people were arriving!\n'Ah shit… need to go!'\nStark quickly stood up, feeling the adrenaline pumping through his veins, then he began running, using the giant rock as some sort of vision-blocker.\nHe counted the number of classifiers there, and there were at least seven of them.\n'How is that possible… aren't pearls rare…?'\n…\n30 minutes ago, on the other side of the death canyon…\nOne of the classifiers had finally gotten hold of a pearl, and so just like Stark, they approached the edge of the canyon, and threw it before anyone could do anything.\n~FWISH~\nThey teleported to the other side, then grinned.\nAnd that person was none other than… Stark's brother.\nHe didn't waste a single second and dashed toward the giant golem's body, using his 'Soul Wielder' heart and powerful [Creation] skill to use the rocks and form a bridge that traversed the entire canyon.\nIt wasn't obvious, but once someone passed the canyon using a 'TP Pearl', they were basically allowed to use any cheats to go back or to help the others.\nAfter forming the rock bridge, Stark's brother gestured at the members of his group to come while most of the others were too focused on resting or fighting.\nAnd so just like that, the 'Wyver's Wrath' group was able to pass the canyon.\n\"HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,\" Jack realized what was happening and tried to use this opportunity to catch up.\nBut…\n~CRACK, CRUMBLE~\nThe bridge was destroyed the moment all the members passed, they wouldn't allow anyone else but them to get an advantage after all, right?\nAnd so just like that, a group was able to pass, heading toward the final area, and most importantly… toward Stark.",

He was determined to outrun them and protect his position as the first.\nBut of course…\n~FWISH~\nA blue trident crashed in front of him, halting his run.\nInstinctively, Stark looked behind him, and there he saw that the seven figures were much muuuchh closer than he expected them to be.\n'…' he switched directions to avoid the trident that had stopped him…\nBut another interrupted him again, the head of the trident hitting the ground.\n'FUCK…'\nNo matter where he would try to go, another trident would be there, slowly but surely blocking all his options.\nAnd after only 30 seconds, he was now surrounded by a circular cage of blue tridents, aura pouring out from them as they encercled Stark like a rat in a testing lab.\n~FWISH~\nIn a flash of light, the tridents disappeared, and instead of the weapons, Stark was now surrounded by the seven classifiers.\n[Group: Wyvern's Wrath]\nA panel appeared to tell him who he was facing, probably thanks to [Perception].\n[Tip: Idk, just don't anger them]\n'Nice tip!' Stark nodded.\n\"What took you so long?\" one of the members of this group, a burly man with dark skin and refined muscles laughed.\n\"Sleeping,\" Stark replied while smiling.\n\"HAHAHAHAH~\" the man held his forehead, \"You were sleeping in this rift?\"\n\"How is that even possible?\" a woman with short pink hair in a bob cut scratched her chin, she was holding a scepter with a heart on it, and even her eyes had hearts in them, Stark thought that she could either be a succubus (he read too many cultural books) or a magus.\n\"Secret technique,\" Stark shrugged, \"Why did you guys interrupt me?\"\nThere was absolutely no reason for them to go as far as to throw weapons at him to make him stop.\nExcept if… they wanted to kill him.\n\"Just for your information, I have no items on me, you can check my body,\" it was the complete truth, and he wanted to get the 'trying to steal from me' theory out of the lot as it would hopefully dissuade them from doing anything.\n\"Of course there is no items on you if you used that weird void thingy to put them inside…\" a black-haired woman with glasses nervously said.\n\"…\" Stark didn't expect them to catch on so quick, but it meant he couldn't outsmart them.\nA blue-haired guy with tridents floating around him, probably the guy that sent them to capture Stark, was just staring at the conversation, not saying anything.\nStark lowered his gaze, feeling a mixture of irritation and respect for the Wyvern's Wrath group's cleverness.\nThen he looked back up, staring at the leader's eyes with his most calm eyes, ones filled with aura, enough for none of those present to not notice that he was serious.\n\"Ok, and so what do you want me with me,\" he looked at his brother, he had the same black hair and red eyes he did.\nBut of course, he had no plans to reveal that since he was currently wearing the bunny mask, which perfectly hid his identity to anyone who didn't know who he was.\n\"Nothing much,\" Stark's brother grinned, \"Just wanted to see why you were still there after so long, plus are we not allowed to talk?\"\n\"I would rather not talk with you all,\" Stark smiled and lifted his arms.\nEven to those that were stronger then he was, they could sense that his aura was weird.\nThey knew he was weaker, and yet they felt like there was a risk in approaching him.\n\"Funny guy,\" two red-haired boys that looked exactly the same, apparent twins, spoke at the same time, \"Don't think you can get away with that.\"\nAnd with that, Stark saw all the members of this weird group.\nAfter one minute of silence, Stark knew they couldn't let him off the hook.\n'…' he sighed, then out of nowhere… took a fighting stance, putting his aura-filled fists in front of his face.\n\"Oy~~ is this guy insane?\" the dark-skinned man was bewildered.\n\"I wouldn't underestimate him…\" the nervous woman adjusted her glasses, she seemed to be the smartest of the group.\n\"I'll repeat, what do you want from me,\" Everything about Stark's stance and aura indicated he wasn't kidding, yet his face remained calm.\n\"I'll tell you what we want, then…\" Stark's brother took a step forward, putting his hand on his chest before pulling out his 'Wielder Heart' from it, \"We just want to be the first to complete this rift.\"\n\"Fair enough,\" Stark nodded, but he obviously wouldn't let them be.\n\"So I hope…\" a small grin began to form on the black-haired leader's face, \"You don't hate us for what's about to happen.\"\nRight as he finished his sentence, a blue magic circle appeared around Stark, and blue chains appeared, slowly approaching Stark.\n'I can't move,' no matter how hard he tried to fight it, there was no way he could move.\n\"Should have been smarter than this,\" the leader winked at Stark, mocking him for just standing there while they restrained him behind the scene.\nThe owner of that attack was the blue-haired guy with tridents around him, its name was [Timed Chain], and if the opponent stays still for five seconds in the domain of the circle, they would be forcefully paralyzed, then restrained, with no way to escape.\nAnd so this meant…\n\"It's our victory, bunny masked guy,\" the dark-skinned man laughed, enjoying the show.\nAs if to mock him even more, the chains that were supposed to restrain him were moving very slowly toward his body, to make sure that Stark could see them.\n'Their victory…?' Stark internally grinned.\nOn the outside, it seemed like he was perplexed and taken aback, but on the inside… he was laughing.\nHe had [Perception] and [Focus], how the hell would he have not noticed it?\nHe had seen the circle since the moment it appeared, but just let it do what it was supposed to do, even going as far as reading the skill's description to make sure that it would work.\nThe objective of this small plan of his was obvious: take all of them aback to be able to reach the boss area before they did.\nAnd so right as the chains were going to wrap around his limbs…\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" Stark focused all his aura around his legs, all the while summoning [Aura Smash] and [Crimson Spears] around him.\nAnd then… he dodged the chains, essentially getting out of the [Timed Chains] skill's range thanks to the invincibility frames.\nAnd so just like that, Stark began his plan to reach the boss of the Secret Rift before this group of classifiers more powerful than he was.",

reaching the middle point.\n\"SELENA, SEND YOUR BEASTS AT HIM, ALEX, INTERCEPT HIM WITH YOUR SCEPTER!\"\nStark heard his brother speak, and immediately as he did so, the task of 'avoiding them' became much more difficult since they knew they wouldn't be able to catch up under normal circumstances.\nSelena, the nervous black-haired woman put her palms together, and in an instant, shadowy beasts materialized around her, growling and snarling as they leaped towards Stark with menacing intent.\nShe was a [Beast Tamer] and her sub-class was [Shadow Tamer].\nAlthough there are only ten classes in the world, sub-classes ranged in the thousands if not hundreds of thousands, which was what allowed each individual to be mostly unique.\nAlex, the pink-haired girl, on the otherhand, raised her heart scepter high as crackling energy formed around the tip, she was either a succubus or magus, and in both cases it wasn't good.\n~FWISH~\nHe crouched to avoid a shadow wolf that jumped toward him, and the beast crashed against a wall, disappearing into a puff of eerie black smoke.\nStark quickly turned his attention to Alex, who was now sending pulses of magical energy in his direction.\n\"ALEX BEAM!\" it was a pink beam with hearts around it, but in contrast to its cute nature, the attack was deadly as it hit the stairs and completely destroyed them, following Stark closely as he needed to zigzag to avoid the laser.\n\"Use your heart, Jay!\" Alex said, looking at Stark's brother.\n'So his name is Jay…' this made Stark realize he didn't know his supposed brother's name in this world.\n\"WIELDER HEART,\" Stark's brother summoned his heart in his hands, and just as he remembered, it was a red one with pulsating veins on it.\n~FWISH~\n\"CREATION!\" Jay held his heart high just like he did when he created that bridge to pass the canyon, and suddenly, parts of the mountain and stairs began morphing around his heart, transformig into spiky spears.\n~THUMB, THUMB, THUMB!~\nHe could create an endless amount of spears with no cooldown, and he would continuously send them toward Stark, who tried his best to avoid them.\nAdd the 'Alex Beam' and several shadow creatures from Stella that were constantly jumping at him, and you have a very disadvantageous chase, where Stark was forced to avoid everything if he didn't want to die.\nWhich was most surprising though was that even his close somehow managed to avoid the attacks, following Stark's commands perfectly.\nBut of course… they couldn't forget about something that was very crucial…\nIt's that they were still in a rift area.\nAnd although the level 50 'The Final Stretch' area didn't have any monsters as the stairs wouldn't allow that… it still had a single danger that could cause chaos.\n\"ROOOOOOARRRRRR~\" a giant red bird appeared above them, flying around the mountain and occasionnaly stopping to look at the humans that were climbing its area.\nSecret Rifts aren't line normal ones at all, they abide by their own rules, and they are much more dangerous than the other ones, which was why they were so sought after by classifiers who seeked fame or thrill.\nAnd this one was no different.\n\"Perception!\" Stark analyzed the bird, it had vibrant, scarlet feathers that glisten in the sunlight with ocassional white motifs, it's wingspan was immense, casting a shadow over a large part of the mountain, its beak was sharp and pointed, and its eyes were a piercing yellow.\nThe flapping of its wings was like thunder, sending vibrations through the air, and when it let out a loud roar, it echoed through the entire valley, maybe even those still at the canyon had heard it?\n…\n[Name: Crimson Raptor (ELITE MINI-BOSS)]\n[Level: 55]\n[HP: 190000]\n[Strength: 762]\n[Stamina: 826]\n[Speed: 2362]\n[Defense: 2184]\n[Skills: Wing Slash, Feather Storm, Flame Breath (Blast), Claw Swipe, Bone Crush, Bird Vision, Prey of the Raptor, Wind Gust, Babies Summon…]\n…\n'ANOTHER MINI-BOSS?' this was the only monster of this area, yet it was probably much more deadly than the obsidian golem since they were basically in its territory, falling from the stairs being guaranteed death.\nSo now, in additions to the three beasts that were following him closely from behind to either kill him or capture him, there was a mini-boss flying around them, ready to strike.\nAnd so, in this hopeless situation where Stark could really death getting closer and closer as his stamina was going down and the attacks not stopping…\nHe did something to get himself out of this situation… which was facing the mini-boss.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" all his precious fists and spears were being sent toward the people that were chasing him, but this time he changed his approach.\nHe punched the air in the giant bird's direction, sending two fists toward it, and of course, although it had incredible speed, easily avoiding them…\n~SWISH~\nStark used the technique he had learned during the Domination trial and switched the fists' directions, making them go back toward the bird, who didn't suspect anything\n~BOOM, BOOM~\nIt was hit twice.\n\"-15736! -18216!\" the damage was decent, but no stun.\nAnd it was fine, since now, Stark could only hope that his plan would work.\nThe 'Crimson Raptor' was furious that it had been hit by such a cheap attack, and so it dived toward Stark and his clone, trying to kill them both.\n\"CLAW SWIPE, WING SLASH,\" it activated both skills, making both its wings and claws shine.\nStark looked up, seeing the bird now only a few meters above him, still diving to kill him off.\n\"…\" he grinned, 'Bingo.'\n~SLAM~\nThe bird landed on the stairs on Stark.\nBut…\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" he dived forward, avoiding both the bird's attacks and also continuing to climb upward alongside his clone who also used the skill.\nThe raptor was so big that it took up the entirety of the stairs, essentially blocking the three classifiers that were chasing after Stark as they couldn't do anything: they were forced to get rid of it if they wanted to pass through.\nThis was Stark's plan.\n\"YOU FUCKKERRRRRR!\" Jay shouted as hard as he could, figuring out that Stark had outsmarted them again.\n'I guess using your brain is useful, isn't it,' he grinned, continuing to climb the stairs while the others were stuck with the mini-boss.\n\"FLAME BREATH,\" the raptor immediately turned its head toward them and sent a fire blast at the three classifiers, who were forced to go on the offensive to kill it.\nAnd so just like that, Stark was getting closer to his goal.\n'Easy win!'\nOr at least… that's what he thought.",

THUMP~\nEven though he knew the three were distracted, he didn't slow down his pace at all.\n'After all...'\n~BOOM~\nHe heard a massive explosion behind him.\n'I know they are monsters…'\nBack to Jay, Alex and Stella, they were absolutely furious, they had been tricked again by that bunny-masked guy, and were now forced to fight off another mini-boss.\nBut it didn't matter to them, they were way to strong.\n\"Flame Breath,\" the raptor unleashed a blast of fire.\n\"CREATION!\" but Jay just raised a wall using the materials and rocks around him, essentially blocking the attacks.\nTrails of aura were in each of their eyes, and as soon as the [Flame Breath] ended…\n\"ALEX BEAM,\" the pink-haired magus used the beam attack yet again, sending a pink laser toward the bird's wings to stop it from flying away.\n~BOOM~\n\"-47261!\" a massive hole was left in the middle of the right wing.\nAnd when the raptor sensed the danger and tried to use its last wing to leave…\n\"SHADOW BEASTS!\" Stella used her signature move to send dozens of beasts of all sorts toward the raptor's feet/tallons.\nMany of them biting it and eating pieces of its flesh, stopping it from doing anything else.\n\"-21721! -19288! -26454!\"\n\"BONE CRUSH!\" knowing it couldn't move anymore since both its feets had been massively injured and that its wing had a hole in it, it tried to use one of its more powerful attacks, strenghtening its body and rushing at the classifiers to try and fall on them.\nBut…\n\"CREATION!\" Jay's skill creation was so powerful that he could do pretty much anything with it, which was why he only reserved his other ones for special occasions.\n~FWISH~\nJay formed a giant spiky rock in the air above the bird's head while it was rushing at them.\nAnd after a few seconds…\nThe rock began falling at incredible speed.\n~BAM~\nThe 'Crimson Raptor's\" weakness was its head, and once the powerful rock absolutely demolished it, it died.\n\"-102826!\"\nWith the mini-boss defeated, Jay, Alex, and Stella turned their attention back to the stairs which Stark was climbing and dashed, their speed much higher than before since they were much more angry.\n\"DON'T LET THAT FUCKER GO!\" they had defeated the boss in three attacks, and in under thirty seconds, proving that whatever Stark attempted to do from now on was futile.\nStark was now almost at the top of the mountain, and as soon as Jay, Alex and Stella defeated the mini-boss…\n[The Mini-Boss 'Crimson Raptor' has been defeated by Jay, Alex and Stella from 'Wyvern Wrath'!]\n[Unlocking a replay for credit purposes!]\nHe, just like the rest of the people at the canyon who were bored to death waiting, clicked on the video and saw the thirty seconds battle, which ended almost just as quick as it started.\n'They are not fucking around,' he mumbled, but immediately grinned as he saw that he had reached the top of the staircase.\nHe was now at the peak of the mountain, which was basically just a large area of flat ground, and a monument at the end.\nBut what was most interesting wasn't the monument in itself, instead, it was the giant doors that led to it, and obviously, the silver fog that appeared in the door frame.\nHe knew from the moment he saw them that they were the doors he had been looking for.\n\"Alright, time to see what's on the other side,\" he said to himself as he took a deep breath.\nEven though he was excited for what might be waiting on the other side of the door, he couldn't help but feel a bit of unease.\nHe had battled everything by himself until now, and even went as far as fighting people and monsters much more powerful than he was.\nAnd yet… he felt like that going against the boss of this area alone was a bad idea, almost as bad as attempting to beat the 'Domination' trial alone.\nNevertheless, he took a step forward, placing his hand on the cold, metallic frame of the door, right next to the silver fog.\n'Welp… here goes nothing,' he took a step inside of the fog.\nBut at that exact moment…\n\"ASSHOLE!\" he heard the sound of the wind slashing., and the three classifiers he had seen on the video were now right in front of him, fury in their eyes, \"STOP RIGHT THERE!\"\n'…'\n\"Y-you are really annoying…' Stella, the nervous beast tamer, mumbled.\n\"Let's just kick his ass, Jay!\" Alex spinned her scepter in her hands.\nStark currently had a foot inside of the silver fog, meaning that he was pretty much guaranteed to pass through alone now.\n\"I enjoyed the chase,\" Stark bowed, a chilling grin on his face, \"But I think i'll take my leave for now.'\nStark's brother, seing his foot half through the fog, immediately dashed toward him, his 'Wielder Heart' ready to cut him in half.\nBut he was too late.\n\"Cya, loser!\"\nAnd so, Stark passed through the fog alone.\nJay, of course, tried to follow closely after him as to try and get him on the other side.\nBut…\n[You are currently in the 'Wyvern Wrath' party, cannot enter!]\nHe was locked out of the boss area since he was already in a party, meaning that Stark had essentially gotten away with everything he did.\nAnd to add even more to the embarassment of getting outsmarted by a level 23 classifier…\n[Something INCREDIBLE has happened inside the rift!]\n[Unlocking a replay for credit purposes!]\nIn addition to everyone being able to see who defeated a boss/mini-boss/elite enemy, when something spectacular happened inside of a Secret Rift (or any rift that was at Hell difficulty or above), such replays would be available for everyone to see.\nAnd the fact a level 23 classifier escaped the 7 members of the 'Wyvern Wrath' group could only be deemed as spectacular by the 'Greater Force' that judged such things.\n\"No way,\" Stark's brother's eyes widened as he saw the panel, and he clicked on it reluctantly, sensing that he would see something he would regret.\nAnd as expect…\nWhether it was at the start of the rift, in the forest, the canyon, and even those that passed it and were heading toward the stairs of the mountain… everyone could see the chase between Stark and the 7 members of the group.\nFrom the beginning to its end, from the moment Stark stunned the blue-haired man to him reaching the boss area.\nIt was visible for everyone to see.\nAnd so immediately, the 'Wyvern Wrath' group was humiliated, and given the name 'Cannot catch up to a level 23 bunny!'\n\"YOU ASSHOOLLLLEEEEEEEEE,\" Jay shouted as hard as he could, blood pouring out from his mouth because of how hard he bit his tongue.",

He knew it would be a difficult battle, but the thrill of the unknown kept him going.\nFinally, after what felt like hours of walking through the fog, he reached the end of the tunnel, and passed through it…\nThe boss area was bathed in a deep blue light, casting eerie shadows on the ground.\nHe was in a very small chamber, and around him were walls with intricate and uncomprehensible scriptures.\nAnd in front of him was a giant door: it was the final thing that separated him from the boss.\n'…' Stark opened his [Spatial Inventory] and took both the [Conjoined Warrior's Cloak] and the [Max Health Potion] from the void.\n~GULP, GULP~\nHe drank up the entirety of the green liquid inside the glass, and immediately, he felt all his wounds being closed, as well as his strength, stamina, and HP recovering.\n[Level:] 23\n[Health:] 8900/8900\n[Bloodline:] Human\n[Class:] Domination\n[Talent:] Chosen one\n[Attributes:] Strength 887; Speed 997; Mind/Soul 1184; Stamina 773; Defense 806\n[Skills:] Spatial Inventory; Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv10; Focus lv5; Aura Smash lv6; Clone Frenzy lv5; Invincible Dodge lv2; Double Assault lv1…\n…\n[Skill Points: 2 Available]\n[You have upgraded 'Double Assault' to level 2!]\n[You have upgraded 'Double Assault' to level 3!]\nHe knew this skill would be his saving grace inside this monument area, so that's why he decided to upgrade it.\nThen he wore the [Conjoined Warrior's Cloak] around his head and upper half.\n[Special Perk:] Wearing this cloak while fighting will result in the chance of inflicting a critical hit on your opponent (dealing massive damage), the chance is only 5%.\n\"Alright, here we go,\" Stark said to himself, mentally preparing for the upcoming battle.\nHe took a deep breath, stepped forward, and pushed the door wide open.\nThere was a path drawn from the door he had opened to the end of the giant room by a giant red carpet, dozens of pillars placed across the room in random positions.\nIt looked like he was in an empty museum, although there was no furnitures or anything of interest other than the pillars and the white walls, which were still inscribed with weird symbols and text, one of them reading: \"The apostles want revenge…\"\nAnd at the very end of the room, at the end of the red carpet… stood a stone statue, placed on a giant display which ressembled those from colosseum's.\nThe statue was that of an angel with pitch dark wings on its back, a crimson sword with spikes coming out randomly from its sides, and a crown with pointy edges was placed on its head.\nThe statue was surrounded by a red mist, making it very hard to see the actual figure.\nIt didn't take a genius to figure out that this was the boss of the 'Shadow Monument'.\nHe began walking toward it, the statue was two times Stark's size, which was still relatively smaller than most other monsters or bosses he had faced.\nAs he got closer to the statue, he noticed another inscribed text on the walls, and it read: \"The Chosen One shall come face to face with their destiny…\"\n'Chosen…' that was his code name, and also the name of his talent, but it's only a coincidence, right?\nAnd when he was ten meters away from the statue… he heard a voice coming from all directions, making it impossible to pin point its source, yet he knew that it was the angel who spoke.\n\"The Chosen One has appeared…\" its voice was like a mixture of a deep and resonant echo, filled with an ominous aura that sent a shiver down Stark's spine.\n~BOOM~\nThe layer of stone that formed the statue desintegrated, forcing Stark to back away if he didn't want to get it.\nAnd suddenly… it started moving, jumping from the display to the ground of the chamber, its crimson sword in its hands, and its crown and wings shining from the deep blue aura that emanated from above.\n\"You have come alone, it is your biggest mistake,\" a powerful aura surrounded the angel as it began walking toward Stark, a neutral expression on its face.\n'Alright… let's go…'\n[Judicator, the Fallen Angel (BOSS)]",

BOOM!\" he was hit twice while trying to cut the fists in half.\n\"-16251! -15728!\"\nBut surprisingly enough, once the smoke from the explosion disappeared, Judicator stood there, at the same spot, unfazed, almost as if he hadn't just received 30k damage.\n\"Hm~ seems like I cannot cut such attacks, what an interesting way of fighting…\" he looked like he was actually having fun, everything was but a game for him.\nStark looked at Judicator, his expression unchanged. He had never seen an opponent who could take that much damage and not be affected.\nThis was not going to be an easy fight.\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS!\" he summoned the three spears beside his body, then crossed his arms, a trail of aura pouring from his eyes, \"Let's see how well you can do then, angel!\"\n\"You use your hands… huh… =)\" Judicator exclaimed, dropping to the ground and setting his crimson sword aside.\nHe put both of his palms together before shouting: \"CELESTIAL PUNCHES!\"\nAnd suddenly, his hands glowed with a golden/divine aura, and with a loud roar, he hurled himself at Stark like a meteor.\nStark sent his spears toward the angel with a calm expression, getting ready for impact.\nBut… the angel avoided the first two, and even grabbed the third one to break it in half.\nThe room was filled with an electrifying atmosphere as Stark and Judicator engaged in their intense battle.\nThis wasn't a fight between sword and fists now, it was a full on boxing match.\n~BAM, BAM, BAM~\nStark blocked the blows from the angel using his fists.\n\"-1! -1! -1!\"\nThen he would try to sneak in an attack on Judicator, who just avoided it using his wings, which gave him a slight speed boost every time he flapped them.\nThis was an unfair match to begin, and so Stark needed to figure out a way to get him out of his tail since he seemed a bit faster and stronger than he was.\n\"GOTCHA!\" Judicator laughed as he grabbed Stark's shirt and sent him against one of the marble pillars of the chamber.\n~CRASH~\n\"-3147!\" Stark equipped his 'protective barrier', which tanked the blow, but it was still too much.\nThe pillar he had hit crumbled from the sheer strength of the throw and also because of how durable Stark's body was when surrounded by aura.\n\"Shit…\" he wiped the blood that came from his mouth, and got ready for another barrage of attacks as he saw that Judicator was dashing at him using the speed boost he was getting from flapping his wings, 'Those damn wings…'\nStark gritted his teeth, his eyes entirely focused on the wings, not even paying attention to Judicator who was approaching.\nAnd if he wanted to hit that angel… if he wanted to win… he would need to get rid of them.\n\"You're no fun anymore!\" Judicator laughed, his perfect face contorted into a large grimace as he prepared to punch Stark and end his life.\n\"CELESTIAL PUNCH!\"\nStark didn't back down, he felt like he had an idea and decided to go for it.\n~FWISH~\nHe grabbed the first hand that came toward him with his own aura-filled one.\n\"-272!\" it caused some damage, but it was worth it, he hoped.\n\"CELESTIAL PUNCH!\" Judicator used the skill again, this time tried to kill Stark with his free hand.\nBut Stark did it again, now grabbing of the angel's hands with his own.\n\"Is that your plan?\" Judicator smiled, increasing the strength of his hands and moving forward, pushing Stark.\n\"No…\" Stark smiled as he looked up.\nAnd then…\nHe pulled his head back, then filled his forehead with an immense amount of aura.\n~SMASH~\nWith a surge of power, Stark headbutted the fallen angel's face, sending him flying back with tremendous force.\n\"-21826!\" his forehead was really solid, maybe because he was so smart (heh).\n\"You little…\" Judicator was taken aback, his nose bleeding from the impact.\nBut before he could do anything else as he was recovering…\nStark was already behind him.\n\"…?\" Judicator felt the aura behind him, and for the first time, he lost his smile, sensing that whatever was behind him wasn't something he could joke around with.\n\"I'LL TEAR THOSE WINGS FROM YOU,\" Stark shouted then jumped on the angel's back.\nAnd in addition to that situation Stark was put in…\nWhatever was happening inside the monument…\nEveryone was seeing it from the outside.",

His opponent had somehow become even stronger and more durable.\nAnd what was that [Angel's Eyes] skill anyway?\n\"I see all paths, I see all possible attacks, you cannot defeat me, FOOL!\"\nThis was true, as [Angel's Eyes] basically showed every move an opponent could do, which meant that currently, he could see shadows of Stark try all sort of things, whether it was throw the crimson fists or spears, dash at him, stand back to defend himself, or die, he saw it all.\n\"It is my victory…\" however, something strange happened as the angel spoke those words: a sigh escaped him, perhaps because he had considered the possibility of losing for a brief moment, after all, Stark had surprised him.\nBut at the end of it all…\n~FWISH~\nOnly one would emerge victorious from this confrontation.\n~SWISH, DODGE, SLAM~\n\"-3726!\" Stark deftly avoided the angel's attacks and quickly adapted to his speed. He even managed to land some hits on the angel (although they were very painful).\nStill, the angel continued to attack with calm determination.\nBecause deep down, he knew he wouldn't lose - he had seen it in his visions.\n~THROW~\nHe threw his scythe towards Stark, who crouched to evade it.\nAnd then…\n\"DIVINE BLINDNESS,\" the angel raised his sword with a golden aura glinting at its edge.\nAnd in that split second when Stark looked at the light... he was completely blinded.\nDivine Blindness worked like this: the more sins you had committed, the brighter and more blinding the divine light became.\nNeedless to say, Stark wasn't a saint.\n\"FUCK!\" he shouted, his vision was completely yellow, and the only thing he could see was a reversed crimson cross that appeared before him, almost as if the angel was mocking him.\n\"Goodbye, human.\"\nJudicator summoned his scythe back, sending it flying in the opposite direction toward his free hand while it was positioned behind Stark.\nAnd so what had to happen happened.\n~SLASH~\nStark's body was sliced cleanly in half.\n\"-54152!\" The damage was critical, but ultimately unnecessary since...\n[Stark HP: 0/8900]\nAnd so, the black-haired boy let out a painful gasp and fell to the floor, his upper and lower body separated.\nOutside the [Shadow Monument], people from all class and levels gasped in shock.\n\"…\" Even Jack didn't even dare say that he knew Stark would die, proof that whatever just happened was truly shocking.\n\"N-No way…\" Lana put her hand against her mouth, tears forming in her eyes.\n\"Ah shit… we need to watch out for this angel guy...\" Thorn scratched the back of his head.\nThe sight of someone getting cut in half and dying wasn't surprising to most, but this time, for some strange reasons, they felt emotions they had never felt before.\nIn the end, all of them thought of one thing: we need to get rid of that angel before he becomes too powerful.\nJust observing his skills and powers, they knew that thing was no joke.\nAlmost all had seemingly already accepted Stark's death, and honestly, it wasn't their fault since who would survive after such an attack?\nInside the monument, Judicator gazed at the floor at Stark's half-cut body, feeling his power at its peak: he had won.\n\"You were… interesting… but still weak,\" he turned around, heading toward the display where he had been standing previously to rest and recover his HP.\nHe didn't see any visions anymore, meaning that Stark's heart had truly stopped beating, confirming his victory.\nHe didn't deactivate his skills though, his body was still dyed in platinum, and he still held his two weapons in case any other intruders wanted to defy him.\n\"It's our turn soon,\" Jay, Stark's brother, remarked to his two companions who were still at the top of the mountain, \"Let's kill that boss and get all the fame!\"\n\"Yeah!\" the two girls nodded.\nBut there was something strange.\nThirty seconds had passed, yet they were still not allowed to enter the boss area.\n\"What is happening?\"\n\"Huh…?\"\n\"Maybe we have to wait?\"\nUsually, when someone or a party gets completely annihilated, a message appears to confirm that they lost, and that the boss area is now open again, yet there had been nothing of this sort for some reason.\nThe camera was centered on Judicator's body, the entirety of the rift seeing his handsome platinum face slowly walk toward his rest area.\nNone of them could see what was happening behind…\nAnd that was great, as it would make the surprise even better.\nSuddenly, Stark's body began to convulse, and a bright crimson light illuminated the area where he had been cut in two.\n~TREMBLE, FWISHHHH~\nStrands of crimson aura intertwined between the two parts of his body, and within moments, Stark was fully restored as if nothing had ever happened.\n[Talent: Chosen One, activated]\n[Stark HP: 1/8900]\nStark immediately understood that he had died, and that he had been saved by his talent.\nA vortex of crimson aura that sucked the air off the room could be seen in his eyes: he wasn't kidding anymore, he was more serious than ever before.\nAnd so… he slowly got up from the cold ground, ready to end this battle.",

What's that in the back…?\"\nPeople began to speak about weird things, and quickly, all the others decided to check their screens.\nAnd it was true: behind Judicator, three small points appeared, heading at incredible speed toward him.\nThe camera zoomed out…\n~FWISH~\nAnd right behind Judicator…\n\"HOW?\"\n\"NO WAY?\"\nThree Stark(s) could be seen behind him, all their eyes glowing with a deep aura.\nBut their aura had changed, it wasn't only crimson anymore, no… now it was also blue, resembling some kind of blue fire that could never go out.\nThe life-threatening situation, his talent usage, his determination, and the upgrade of his [Domination] skill, all of that led to Stark's aura to change.\nIt was almost purely visual, but to him, it meant that he had grown.\n\"…?\" Lana's eyes widened as she saw Stark smiling right behind an unsuspecting boss.\nAnd then… the fight continued.\n\"It's over…\" he whispered at the fallen angel's ears, sending a chill down its spine.\n\"…?\" Judicator didn't have the time to turn around that…\n~SWASH, SWASH~\nStark's two clones grabbed the angel's wings and ripped them right off his back, their increased strength enough to do that easily.\n\"AHHHHHH!\" the angel shouted in pain, losing his balance as he had lost two of his most important things, \"Y-YOU LITTLE, HOW ARE YOU NOT DEAD-\"\nHe didn't have the time to finish his sentence that Stark punched his face.\n\"-15837!\" his stats were still upgraded from [Anger of the Fallen], and his body still dyed in that platinum texture that increased his defense.\nAnd yet… that punch hurt like hell.\nStark's hand didn't hurt this time, his entire fists, face, and body surrounded by that crimson/blue fire as his auras were now mixed.\nOf course, Stark's clones didn't just sit around and do nothing while their leader punched Judicator, they just dropped the pitch-black wings on the ground as they were useless now, and dashed at the angel, who fell to the ground from the punch.\n\"Y-YOU, YOU FUCKING CHEATER!\" Judicator shouted as hard as he could, trying to get up, and sending his scythe toward the human.\nBut Stark didn't even bother to avoid it.\nInstead…\n~GRAB~\nHe grabbed the scythe's handle and broke it using his hands and knees.\n\"No more weapons,\" Stark looked at Judicator while throwing his scythe away in front of his face.\n\"I-I still got my-\" Judicator tried to dash toward Stark with his crimson blade, after all Stark couldn't have that much HP after being cut in half.\nBut the clones both grabbed Judicator's shoulders, stopping him from moving.\nAnd once he looked back to see what was happening…\n~SLAM~\nOne of the clone's smashed his face while the other took the blade from his hands.\n\"-13724!\"\nThe angel was unarmed and stepped back, trying to back away from the clones as he felt that even they could defeat him.\n\"You can't run,\" Stark appeared under Judicator and punched his jaw from below, sending him flying toward a pillar.\n\"-21721! -3937!\"\nBy this point, both of his ultimate skills had been nullified, meaning that his skin was back to normal, and his stats too.\n'How… is this… possible' he lay against the bottom of the pillar he had landed against, his body too weak to do anything, and his eyes slowly closing, 'I… I killed him… and yet…'\nStark and his clones were advancing toward Judicator, a blank expression on their faces.\n\"M…Monster…\" this was the only word he could utter as Stark's face was now right in front of his, a wide smile spread across it, one that made his skin crawl.\n\"No matter what you try, even if you kill me again, and even if you reincarnate to another rift… i'll be sure to find you and end your miserable life…\"\nBoss monsters aren't supposed to feel fear, their sole goal was to cause trouble to classifiers from their sheer confidence, and yet… even he, an apostle of the 'Godless Demon', could see that this boy was something else…\n\"Angel's Eyes!\" his eyes glew bright, and he smiled as he looked at Stark's face, \"I knew it…\"\nEven in the thousands, millions or even billions of different moves that could happen in that very moment, even if he summoned back his weapons in hand or activated his ultimate skills.\nHell… even if he got back all his HP, wings, skills, and weapons…\nIn not a single one of those visions did he win.\n\"Bye bye,\" Judicator just put his head down as he saw Stark ready to charge his final punch, accepting his fate.\n~BOOM~\nThe explosion shook the entire rift, sending tremors through the air.\n\"-69372!\" Judicator gasped in pain before smiling.\n\"Y-You… are… going to die at some point… do not worry…\" then he closed his eyes, and his body disintegrated into a pile of white ash.\nNobody in the outside audience dared to cheer or celebrate, the atmosphere was heavy, and the silence was deafening.\n[The BOSS of the Secret Rift has been defeated by REDACTED!]",

Star's eyes widened, he was so close now…\nAnd surprisingly enough… he was surrounded by the golden glow again.\n[Your level has increased to level 25, granting you two skill points and boost in stats]\n[Experience: 8391/500000]\n'I DID IT!' he jumped, the adrenaline granting him a boost in stamina.\nBut getting to level 25 was much more overwhelming than Stark believed since many panels suddenly appeared around him, taking over his entire surroundings.\nIt was a new milestone, and a giant one at that.\nHe calmed down and decided to check them out one by one.\nThe first thing he noticed was that familiar text: [Level 25 Reached: please pick a card].\nJust like all the previous times, three cards appeared before him, their color was orange.\nWithout hesitation, Stark reached out to pick one.\nAnd once he turned the card, he saw the drawing of a… beam?\n…\n[Name: Heaven's Wrath]\n[Type: Legendary]\n[Level: 1]\n[Description: Unleash a powerful ray of crimson light from the heavens that destroys all enemies within a certain radius, the damage they receive is only in effect when they are inside the beam, otherwise they won't be damaged if they leave it, cooldown is thirty minutes!]\n…\n'My first skill to get rid of big amount of monsters, huh?' Stark immediately thought of using that skill on armies of monsters to get rid of them, and it was even better since he could control where the beam would go.\nOverall, it was a great skill, but its cooldown was higher than 'Double Assault' for some reason.\nAfter knowing what skill he had gotten from reaching level 25, Stark turned his eyes toward the next panel.\n[You have beaten 'Judicator, The Fallen Angel' while being alone (SOLO achievement), granting you AMAZING equipment pieces]\nAnd just as it said, right on top of the pile of ashes that were previously Judicator's body stood not one, not two, nor three, but FOUR equipment pieces, their small lights shining, inviting Stark to take them.\n'I'm rich,' Stark nodded, proud of himself.\nHe crouched and grabbed one of the items to inspect it, it was a pair of black wings, and he immediately knew that these could do as they ressembled those from Judicator.\nMost items that came out of monsters/mini-bosses/elites or bosses were related to their monster, so it was pretty obvious.\nBut right as he was about to check it out…\n~TREMBLE~\nThe entire chamber began shaking violently, and the pillars that were still standing after the battle began to crumble.\n'What the…?' Stark thought, he didn't know what was happening.\n[The boss has been defeated, the boss area is now crumbling since its power source has died, please leave shortly]\n'Ah shit…' Stark didn't waste time and immediately took all the equipment pieces that were on the pile of ash and put them inside his [Spatial Inventory], making sure not to drop anything as it was the rewards of his hard work\nAnd as for the panels… he would check them out later, but he knew that there were many incredible things to uncover from there.\n~SHAKE, SHAKE~\nThe 'Shadow Monument' shook more and more, until eventually, a part of the ceiling almost fell on Stark, which he only avoided thanks to [Invincible Dodge].\n'This place is actually crumbling, I need to get out of here, and quick,' Stark mumbled while looking around him, trying to find an exit.",

      "content": "Stark was alone, and the chamber of the 'Shadow Monument' was currently falling apart.\nHe needed to find a way out before it was too late.\nHe took the items from Judicator's ash body, minimized all the panels (but made sure not to close them as he would read them later), then began running and jumping over collapsing debris, while also avoiding the ceiling that was falling on him.\nHe looked up as a major part of the ceiling was now gone, and he hoped that there could be a way to get out from there since he had technically entered the monument at the top of the mountain.\nAnd yet…\nIt was pitch black, there was no crimson sky, no clouds, nothing.\nNothing… except for those three giant crimson moons with eyes on them, and they were all staring down at Stark, almost mocking him.\nSeeing them blink was disgusting, and Stark couldn't help but shiver at the thought of these things being alive.\n[Do not be disgusted by us, puny human!]\n[Hah~ he beat the boss and now thinks he is hot shit?]\nThe moons spoke, they were much closer to him than before, almost as if they were… GETTING CLOSER?\nAfter a few seconds (which kept increasing the amount of damage around the chamber), the ceiling was completely destroyed, and the moons were now so close that Stark could perfectly see their eyes and pupils, he was like an insect in comparison.\n…\n[Name: The Crimson Moons Trio (Immortal-Level Monsters)]\n[Level: ???]\n[HP: ???]\n[Strength: ???]\n[Stamina: ???]\n[Speed: ???]\n[Defense: ???]\n[Skills: ???]\n…\nImmortal-Level monsters were the 8th category of monsters in this world, even above calamity.\nThere was not a single chance Stark could win if he fought them.\n[Haha~ look at him, so scared!] Stark could hear their voices in his head\n[Makes me want to crush him!]\n[Don't do that… it's not our time yet!]\nThey were talking with one another, ignoring Stark who was just standing there, taking in the view of those monsters: he realized that there were truly some things beyond comprehension in this world, and these moons were one of them.\n\"How do I leave?\" Stark shouted at the moons, and the three of them turned their eyes toward him.\n[Look at this kid, really getting confident, huh~]\n[What's the point of telling if he can't hear us!]\n[Yeah, humans can't listen to our holy voices, so just sit and die!]\n\"Stop talking and tell me already!\" he repeated, \"Plus your voices are anything but holy!\"\nAnd suddenly, the moment he responded to them, all three moons stopped what they were doing and slowly turned their pupils toward Stark.\n[…]\n[…]\n[…]\nEven though it was their only feature, Stark could see that they were surprised.\n'Fucking hell…' Stark realized that they wouldn't help after a few seconds, and so he looked around again.\nThe floor of the monument was beginning to crumble too, and just as expected, below was also a black void: it was certain death if he fell.\nThankfully enough, he noticed that on top of the display the fallen angel's statue had been on appeared a portal.\n'Phew…' he began running toward it, avoiding the debris and the destroyed floor.\n[You… can hear us…]\n[Ohoh~ interesting… I think 'Godless' will be interested]\n[Hm~ what's the point of telling if he is gonna die anyway?]\nAnd so before they could even finish their sentences or say anything else, Stark jumped into the portal to get out of this place.\nHe didn't know what the hell had just happened, but it was weird.\n***\nAs Stark emerged from the portal, he came out of the silver fog and found himself at the top of the mountain again.\nAnd as soon as he did that…\n~CRUMBLE~\nThe giant monument that was taking up the majority of the flat mountain top suddenly fell appart, and the silver fog also dissipated.\n\"Ah shit…\" Stark sighed, he had been this close to dying again.\nHe looked around, but there was nobody, his brother and the 'Wyvern Wrath' group had seemingly already left since they weren't interested in a rift with no rewards anymore.\nHonestly, he had expected many classifiers to ambush and steal his items away as soon as he left (which he would have never given because they were in his inventory void), but it seemed like he was wrong.\nAs Stark began to make his way down the mountain, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.\nHe looked up to the sky, and the crimson moons were still there, looking at him, amused expressions on their faces.\n[The exit portals are located at the start of the rift and at the death canyon, please head there to leave!]\nSuch a panel appeared to inform Stark, and he nodded, descending the stairs of the mountain very slowly: winning didn't mean he wasn't injured, and he planned to buy many [Max Health Potions] when he got back.\nEven when he walked in the plains, heading toward the canyon, Stark couldn't shake the feeling that he was being hunted by those three crimson moons.\nHe knew that he had beaten the boss and claimed victory, but he couldn't for a moment believe that he was out of danger.\nThese things were… terrifying.\nBut Stark didn't even bother looking too much into it as they couldn't do much if they were so high in the sky, otherwise they would have already killed them all, right?\nSoon enough, he reached the death canyon, and he noticed that there weren't that many people remaining as the majority left.\nThose that remained were fighting monsters.\nAfter he defeated the boss, a path to pass the canyon had appeared, meaning that anybody could keep going now.\nBut once he did pass the small bridge that had formed… all eyes fell on him.\nAll the classifiers stopped what they were doing once they saw him, their faces showing all kinds of emotions.\n\"…\" Stark didn't mind, and he immediately spotted the exit portal.\n\"W-WAIT!\" Stark heard a voice behind him, and once he turned around, he saw that it was Lana, the blonde-haired archer.\n\"What's up, Lana?\" Stark asked, raising an eyebrow, he was so nonchalant about it that it almost looked like he hadn't just killed the rift boss by himself.\nMany people were skeptical of Stark, Lana included, they had seen him come back to life, who could guarantee he couldn't do that over and over?\nLana took a deep breath and approached him, looking nervous, \"I-I just waited for you since… huh… y-you need a ride back home, right?\"\n\"Oh…\" Stark nodded, he felt thankful to her, and out of pure habit, he patted her head, \"Thanks!\"\n\"…\" Lana's face flushed as she felt Stark's hand on her hair, but she couldn't say she didn't enjoy that feeling, \"L-Let's go!\"\n\"Yeah!\" Stark replied, already starting to walk towards the portal.\nNo one dared to approach Stark, some were hesitant since it was obvious that his level didn't indicate how strong he truly was, and others because Lana Moonless was with him, and they feared her father, the Archer King.\nIn the end, it didn't matter since Stark successfully left the Secret Rift alive.\n[Congratulations, Stark Heartsouls, you have completed the Secret Rift 'Shadow Valley'!]",

Thank you,\" Stark left the car, and just as Lana said, they were right in front of his hotel.\n\"No problem, I'll contact you later if anything comes up,\" Lana waved goodbye to him with a small smile, her eyes lingering on Stark for a moment before she closed the window of the car and let out a sigh.\n\"Stark Heartsouls,\" she mumbled under her breath, shaking her head slightly as if trying to clear her thoughts, he was a mysterious guy, and deep inside of her she realized that she didn't really know anything about it beside that he was extremely strong, stronger than his level showed.\nShe hated to admit it, but he was also much stronger than her, and she felt like that no matter how much she extended her arm to reach for him, she would never be able to do that.\nAnd so she began heading toward her mansion in the luxury district.\nBack to Stark, he began to head towards the lobby of the hotel, until a realization hit him.\n\"Wait a damn minute, how does she know where I live-\"\n***\nStark didn't waste time and climbed to his room, opening it thanks to his keys (which he put inside the inventory void) and then jumping on the bed.\nBut surprisingly, he wasn't tired anymore.\n'Hm…' Stark got up, he planned to sleep for a good two days again to make up for whatever happened inside that rift, but his body didn't respond no matter how long he closed his eyes.\n\"Did my body adapt?\" maybe his increase in level and stats had made it so that he didn't need to sleep that long after each rift anymore, and that was a good thing.\nNo.\nHe was wrong.\nAnd he knew it, instead he just decided to deny the truth.\nIt wasn't that he wasn't tired anymore, it was just that now that he had already slept inside the car, whenever he tried to close his eyes, the sight of the three crimson moons' pupils looking at him greeted him.\n[Funny human… it's futile]\n[You can't escape us!]\n['Godless' will kill you!]\nEven when he was far away, in the actual world, he could still hear their voices.\nBut in the end, it didn't matter, since this small boost in adrenaline meant he didn't need to sleep anymore.\nAnd that meant one thing and one thing only…\n\"Open panels,\" he mumbled, and suddenly, the remainder of the panels that he had minimized previously were there.\nHe wasn't able to check them all inside the shadow monument since it was falling apart, but now that he was in the safety of his hotel room, he could do whatever he wanted!\nHe couldn't deny it, but checking those panels brought immense excitement to him, like a child having to wait the night before opening his christmas gifts.\n\"First panel is…\" his eyes wandered toward the first panel to the left, it was the one he hadn't been able to read at that time.\n[You have reached level 25, you can now initiate the 'breakthrough' sequence to increase the skill level limit from 10 to 15!]\n'Ohoh~ I knew that level 10 couldn't be the last level, it wouldn't make sense,' Stark smiled, this meant that he could upgrade [Domination] and his other skills even more.\nBut he didn't know what that breakthrough sequence was about, so he would need to check the internet or possibly go to the trader district to buy an item for it (if a panel didn't explain it to him).\nFeeling happy, he immediately looked to the right, toward the next panel.\nAnd that's when he saw it.\nTHE panel he had been waiting for…\n[You have reached level 25, congratulations, you can now spin the 'Class Wheel' again!]",

      "content": "[You have reached level 25, congratulations, you can now spin the 'Class Wheel' again!]\nStark's heart raced with anticipation as he read those words.\nSince the moment he had first spinned the wheel and gotten the Domination class, he had always been waiting to reach level 25.\nIt was more difficult because of the 'Domination' class's [Hell Mode] curse, but now that he had done it, he felt extremely proud of himself.\nHe wanted to spin the [Class Wheel] immediately to check out what he could get, and hopefully begin training using his new class as his entire fighting style would change whatever the class he would get was.\nBut…\n[Please read all panels and information before spinning the 'Class Wheel']\nHe was restricted, and even when he tried to push through and attempted to activate the [Class Wheel] skill…\n[You are not allowed to use the wheel for now, please try again later]\n'Ah shit…' it wouldn't be long until he was gonna be able to use it anyway, so he just looked to the next panel.\nAnd it was… a surprising one, much more than even the 'Class Wheel'…\n[The ApostleDex has been unlocked, please do check it out (you are allowed to right now)]\nStark felt a strange mix of doubt and curiosity at the words, his eyes widening slightly as he scanned the panel.\nHe had no idea what the ApostleDex was, but the fact that he was allowed to check it out right now intrigued him.\n'Sounds like a cheap copy of poke-' he stopped himself before getting struck by another zap, he had learned from his lessons.\nBut basically, it was something he knew from his past life.\nIn the end, he decided to check it out as there was no reason not to.\nHe clicked on the 'ApostleDex' word since it was highlighted, and suddenly, another crimson panel appeared before him.\nBut instead of the normal ones which only contained text, this one looked more like a quest window.\nOn it were 15 square cases, meaning three lines of 5.\nThe title: \"Godless Demon Apostles\" could be seen written in white above them.\nAnd as for the content of the cases… well… it was basically like in any video game.\nEach one of the cases represented one of the Godless Demon's apostles.\nThe first two of the first line had the images of [Malakar] and of [Judicator], the two bosses he had fought, and of course, there was a giant X on them as they had been defeated.\nThe rest of the apostles couldn't be seen, instead, all Stark could see was their shadows inside of the square cases, with no way to know of their appearances until he saw them.\nIt was truly like some kind of 'Assassination' quest inside of a game, where he would need to find all of them and kill them all.\nOr at least… that's what he believed, since when his eyes slowly moved to the 5th square of the second line… it wasn't a shadow that he was seeing, but an actual image of the apostle that is supposed to be there.\nAnd it was one he had already seen before.\n[Crimson Moons Trio] was written below the image of the three moons with a giant eye on them.\n'…' Stark's eyes widened, he had figured out that those things must be part of the 'Godless Demon' group, but he couldn't believe that they could be fought.\nThey were massive monsters, and he looked like an insect in comparison to their sizes, there was no way he could fight them, right?\nAnd yet…\n[Upon defeating 5 of the apostles, you will receive a MYTHICAL reward!]\n[Upon defeating 10 of the apostles, you will receive a GODLY reward!]\n[Upon defeating 15 of the apostles, you will receive an IMMORTAL reward!]\nHe immediately reminisced the different categories for skills and items: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythical, Godly, Immortal.\nThis meant that he would get something incredible after each milestone he reached.\nIt was a massive risk to fight those bosses, but the rewards given for that were also amazing.\nHigh risk, high reward, basically.\nAnd in the end… the fact that he could be rewarded for killing them all meant that the [Crimson Moons Trio] could be defeated at some point.\nAt the very end of the window, a pair of black eyes could be seen, ones that looked like they were piercing his soul.\nAnd right above those eyes… stood a crimson text.\n[Upon defeating all of the apostles… you will be allowed to meet the 'Godless Demon']\n[Enjoy!]\nBefore he could do anything else, all the panels related to the [ApostleDex] closed, and there was no way for him to open it back up for now until he checked out all the other information.\n\"Wow, this is a lot to process,\" Stark muttered to himself as he looked at the remaining two panels.\nHe knew he had to keep going, though, because there was no way of knowing what these two panels might contain.\n[Survey: Are You Happy?]\n[Y/N]\n'…' Stark titled his head, this was just becoming confusing at this point.\n\"I guess I am…?\" he clicked on yes.\n[Thank you for the answer, see you later for the next survey =)]\nAnd so that panel also disappeared.\n'What the actual fuck?' Stark didn't even know the purpose of such a thing.\nBut deep down… he felt that the [Survey] would be important, so he kept it in mind… just in case.\nAnd so now, there was only one panel remaining.\nIt was different from all the others: it wasn't crimson or blue, instead… it was entirely black, and its edges were moving like waves, almost as if it was alive.\n[You have proven your strength…]\nThe panel was black with no text on it, but as soon as he lay his eyes on it, white text started slowly appearing.\n[But you need to be stronger…]\n[Thus, you have been granted access to the…]\n[MEMORIES MUSEUM]\n'Huh…' the text stopped as soon as the words 'Memories Museum' appeared, and after a few seconds resumed.\n[Inside of the memories museum, you will be able to access the memories of your previous battles and fight the bosses you have already defeated inside the arena to increase your technique…]\n[Note that you can only relive the memories of the bosses you have fought!]\n[The museum serves only one purpose: training, fight against the bosses you have already beaten and find new ways and techniques to come out victorious]\n[You can now access the museum, good luck!]\nAnd before he could even say anything since he was speechless, a black door that emanated a dark aura appeared in front of him.\n'…' Stark looked at the door in front of him with widened eyes, but then clenched his fists and stepped forward.\nDeep inside, he really wanted to see what this was all about.",

      "content": "As he stepped through the dark portal, Stark found himself in an entirely different realm.\nWhen he was transported to the 'Domination trial' or when he dreamt about meeting with his doppelgänger, he didn't actually leave the real world, instead his physical body stayed behind.\nBut this time, his body had actually gone somewhere else from his hotel room, and it was safe to say nobody would find him if he decided to stay here.\n'At least I know how to escape the cops or assassins,' he smiled before looking around the area.\nHe was inside the 'Memories Museum'.\nIt was a large space with a red carpet rolling down toward an endless hall that seemed to never end.\n[Welcome to the 'Memories Museum', please select the memory(ies) you want to experience!]\nOn both sides of the hall (which weren't very far from him) were marble displays, and on top of these displays weren't any sort of item or statue, but an image shaped like a thought bubble: it was a picture of a boss he had fought.\nStark looked around, going from left to right to check all the displays that were available., and he counted that there were 6 of them, 3 on each side.\nWhen reaching out for one of the images, a holographic screen would appear in front of him, displaying the name of the memory and a short description of the boss he had faced.\n…\n[Judicator, The Fallen Angel]\n[Description: Judicator is the second apostle of the 'Godless Demon', he is an arrogant piece of shit who thinks he owns the world, but you taught him his place and took him by surprise, he uses his dark wings to fly and has a multitude of skills that are able to end a battle in a single attack.]\n…\nThis was the same for all the other displays: Malakar, The Conjoined Siblings, The Black Water Devourer, The Creeping Shadows and The Mirror Master, as these were all the bosses he had faced.\n'But… what's the point of that?' Stark couldn't understand.\nWhat did it mean by relive the memories of his battles, maybe he would be able to rewatch them all and analyze every bit of them?\n[Please select the memories you want to experience!]\nNot knowing what to do, Stark approached the memory of [Malakar] and of [Judicator], selecting the two of them by putting his hand inside the image.\n[You have selected… 2 memories: Malakar; Judicator]\n[Do you want to experience those memories now?]\n[Y/N]\nStark clicked \"Y\" without a second thought.\nBut the moment he made the choice, he found himself consumed by the memories, his body surrounded by a dark aura as he was transported somewhere else.\nAnd the moment his eyes were cleared from that aura, and he regained his vision…\nHe found himself inside of a giant circular arena, and before him… were the two bosses he had selected.\n'Huh?' Stark's eyebrows arched in confusion and his heart rate quickened as his eyes grew wide with shock.\nHis senses were on high alert as he took in the sight before him: [Malakar], wearing his elegant suit and black sun mask, and [Judicator], the angel with black wings, were both in front of him.\n\"SHIT? THE TWO OF THEM?\" Stark immediately got in position, why were they both here? Hadn't he killed them?\nThis was bad, really bad.\n[3…]\n\"WAIT!\"\n[2…]\nHe could already see Judicator summon his scythe in hand, now wielding his two respective weapons.\n[1…]\nMalakar also summoned his cane in hand, spinning it, a wide grin on the visible half of his face.\n[FIGHT!]\n\"THE CANE!\" Malakar extended his cane toward Stark, which elongated.\n'It's fast! Way faster than before!' he used his arm to deflect the cane away.\nBut…\n~SLASH~\nJudicator used that opportunity, and unlike last time when he was playing around, he didn't let Stark a single chance to retaliate.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" Stark rolled away.\n\"DARK PULSE,\" but Malakar answered immediately, and a dark vein that came from the ground was rushing to pierce Stark.\n[The Purgatory Shadow took the hit in your place]\nStark didn't know what the fuck was happening, he was currently fighting two bosses he had struggled against so much, and at the same time.\n\"ANGER OF THE FALLEN!\" Judicator didn't waste any time, and instead of waiting for Stark to deal damage to him, he immediately activated one of his ultimate abilities.\nAnd so while Stark was still avoiding the dark veins that came out from the ground…\n~SLASH~\n\"-57784!\"\nHe was cut in half by Judicator's scythe.\n'Oh… I guess… I lost…' he closed his eyes, thinking it was over as he felt the world around him spin.\nHe had been completely overwhelmed by these two bosses as they kept launching skill after skill at him…\nBut…\n\"HAH~\" he took a deep breath as he opened his eyes, and found himself back in the memories museum again, with the displays of the memories still at their respective places.\n'What the?' he reached for his stomach, but there was no wound at all, yet he could swear he had been cut down by Judicator…\n[Do you want to try again?]\n[You can try as many times as you wish, you cannot die inside the memories museum, but you also do not receive any experience defeating the bosses]\nImmediately, everything clicked inside of Stark's brain: the museum was a way for him to train in battle without the risk of death, basically… it was a way for him to get stronger without going anywhere else.\n\"This is… amazing,\" Stark put his hands on his chin and smiled.\nHe was easily defeated by the two bosses, who were both at his level... but what if he persisted and tried again and again? What if he adapted to the situation and improved his movements to dodge even more attacks?\nWouldn't that help him in the future too?\n\"Now…\" Stark loved that new feature, \"It really does feel like a game…\"\nAlso… couldn't it help him try out all of his skills, finding new ways to use them and also testing out his new ones?\nEven more so knowing that he is bound to unlock a new class soon…\nThis was perfect.\nThis was actually so great that Stark couldn't help but laugh.\n'Oh yeah… I need to spin the wheel,' he remembered after thinking about his new class.\n\"Class Wheel!\" he mumbled to himself, and this time he was actually able to use it since he had checked all the panels.\nAnd so just like last time, the giant colorful wheel appeared in front of him.\n\"Let's do this,\" he smiled.",

You have unlocked the class: Alchemist!]\n'I mean… sure?'\n[You can spin the wheel again at level 50!]\nNot wasting a second, he checked that class's description.\n…\n[Class: Alchemist]\n[Description:] Masters of potions and of random experiments, the alchemists are able to brew potions using their precise hands and sell them or even use them in battle themselves (although watch out for side effects), this may seem like an average class, but with the good ingredients, you can pretty much do anything.\n[Class Effect:] Now able to brew potions with different effects depending on the ingredients\n[Class Flaw:] You cannot use any sort of weapon, you have to rely on your potions.\n[Basic Skills:] Alchemist; Potion Crafting\n…\n'Huh… I mean, I guess it makes sense, but I wonder how I'll be able to make potions without the real equipment,' Stark wondered, and decided to check out the two new skills he had gotten.\n…\n[Skill: Alchemist]\n[Type:] Basic Class Skill\n[Level:] 1\n[Description:] This is just the basic skill for alchemists that confirms you are one of them, it increases your craftsmanship skills and precision while making potions and using 'Potion Crafting', the higher your level, the strongest your potions will be.\n[Note: Also this skill allows you to check what could be an ingredient so that you pick it out, very useful to not waste time on ingredients that don't work on any potion!]\n…\n[Skill: Potion Crafting]\n[Type:] Basic Class Skill\n[Level:] 1\n[Description: Well, it's in the name…]\n[Note: The higher the level, the stronger your potions become, finding potions depends completely on you, you can buy recipes, or find them out by yourself while experimenting!]\n…\nHe was in the 'Memory Museum', with the possibility to fight all the bosses he had previously defeated with an infinite amount of lives at his disposable, meaning that he could test out his new ability.\nBut he would need to figure out how to be an alchemist first.\nDomination was great since it was just 'haha punch punch', but now he would actually need to do things and prepare.\nHe couldn't deny though that this was probably the best mix of classes ever beside probably beast tamer or incubus, since he would continue fighting with his fists while using potions to get effects that aid him in battle.\nHe was frankly excited… and he couldn't help but smile.\n\"Potion Crafting!\" he immediately decided to use his skill.\nAnd suddenly…\nA panel appeared in front of him.\n'Huh…'\n[Do you want to summon your brewing station?]\n[Brewing station level: 1]\n[Y/N]\n'Sure, I guess,' he shrugged and clicked on the Y option.\nThe panel immediately disappeared, and out of thin air appeared a wooden table in decent shape with a small cauldron placed on top of it, as well as a brewing stand.\nBut this wasn't how he would be able to make potions, these two objects were solely here to make sure the process go smoothly.\nInstead, another panel appeared in front of a confused Stark.\nIt wasn't crimson, blue, or dark, instead it was brown of color, mimicking the texture of the wood.\n[Welcome to the Potion Crafting panel!]\n[You have… 3 recipes available as a start!]\nThese two window disappeared after a few seconds, and another one appeared, but this time it was truly the one he had been looking for.\nIt contained the images of three potions, each inside of a crimson glass with a liquid inside of it.\nWith no hesitation in his actions, Stark clicked on one of the potion images.\n…\n[Potion of Strength]\n[Effect: Increases the user's strength stat by 10% for 5 minutes!]\nAnd below was a list of ingredients he couldn't understand how to get.\n[Ingredients: x2 Wolf Teeth, x1 Ogre Ear, x1 Strength Flower…]\n'I guess I need to go to some sort of market to acquire those…'\n[Note: Ingredients can be acquired through exploring different rifts, it is always good to pick any material you encounter in case you need them later, many alchemists go to great length to acquire just one ingredient needed for a potion, and they also take commissions from classifiers!]\n'How about just buying them from the trading market?' Stark shrugged, this seemed like a much better solution.\n[Lame, plus the ingredients there are mostly expensive when they are of higher quality, and you won't find incredible ingredients to discover powerful potions there since some are unique or bought instantly!]\n'Oh well,' Stark shrugged and immediately moved to check the two other potions that were available for him to craft.\n…\n[Potion of Speed]\n[Effect: Increases the user's speed stat by 10% for 5 minutes!]\n…\n[Potion of Regeneration]\n[Effect: Heals 1000HP to the user, effect is instant but it does not heal severed limbs!]\n…\n'That last one is very good if I can stack them,' Stark thought.\nHe didn't really think much of it, but he had basically the best skill ever for this class: [Spatial Inventory], since he could store an infinite amount of ingredients or potions and take them back whenever he wanted.\nThis meant that he truly had the potential to be a master alchemist, all the while fighting close range thanks to [Domination]!\nBut first… he wanted to sell all his unneeded equipment, and stock up on ingredients and food.\nThe reason?\nWell… it's obvious!\nBasically… Stark planned to train like hell inside the Memories Museum.\nTrain until he could at least take down both Malakar and Judicator at the same time… no… he wanted to take down all 6 bosses at the same time!\nHe had an unlimited amount of tries after all… =)!\n'Well… let's get this over with,' he slowly went toward the black door, which was located at the start of the hall.\nAnd so he went through it, ready to deal with the outside world to begin his training.",

outside the 'Memories Museum' worked the same, meaning that if he wanted to train inside, it would mean stocking up on food and also not expecting anyone from the outside to come look for him (this wouldn't be a difficult task).\nPlus, he hadn't realized it yet, but the sun was already mostly up.\nHe had gotten up very early yesterday to go to the rift, but it still took him around 11 hours to complete it, as well as around 12–13 hours of travel to go and come back.\nAdd that to the time he spent checking out his new panels, as well as the many different waiting periods, like for example waiting for the opening.\nAnd so as soon as Stark checked the time… he noticed that it was 7:30am.\n\"Spatial Inventory!\" he opened his inventory, and pulled out all the equipment he had gotten inside of the secret rift.\nThere were a total of 7 items, 1 from the Minotaur, which was the [Minotaur's Helmet], two from the obsidian golem, and 4 from Judicator.\nHe would need to sell many of them since he either didn't have the required level, wasn't interested, or it wasn't for his class, but in the end it was fine since it would increase his assets.\n…\n[Equipment:] The Minotaur's

before, but just made sure that it was correct.\nIt immediately went to the 'sell' list though, since he could only use it if he was a warrior.\nHe decided to skim through the rest quickly, only paying attention to the items that could actually be used by him (class related, not for required level).\nAnd the two items the obsidian golem had dropped were…\n…\n[Equipment:] Obsidian Gauntlets\n[Type:] Gloves\n[Class:] Beast Tamer, Magus\n[Tier:] Uncommon\n[Required Level:] 35\n[Quality:] Normal\n[Attributes:] +250 Mind, +450 Strength\n[Special Perk:] Summons two obsidian beasts to aid you in battle.\n…\n[Equipment:] Obsidian Golem's Ring\n[Type:] Ring\n[Class:] Assassin, Warrior, Soul Wielder\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Required Level:] 30\n[Quality:] Good\n[Attributes:] +500 Defense\n[Special Perk:] Like the obsidian golem, create a layer of obsidian (like an armor) that can tank up to 20k damage.\n…\n'None of these are useful either,' he groaned as he put the two obsidian equipment beside the Minotaur helmet.\nThis left him with four equipment pieces: the ones that had dropped from Judicator.\nOf course, Stark remembered that one of the items was wings as he had picked it up before the monument began to collapse, but he hadn't checked the window either.\n…\n[Equipment:] Judicator's Black Wings\n[Type:] Wings\n[Class:] Domination\n[Tier:] Legendary\n[Required Level:] 25\n[Quality:] Perfect\n[Attributes:] +200 Speed, +300 Stamina\n[Special Perk:] Ability to use [Dash], which basically gives the user a boost in speed to evade an attack by flapping the wings in the direction you want to go.\n[Note: the wings become invisible when put on!]\n…\n'Interesting…' he moved on to the next two items, which were respectfully a mask with Judicator's face on it and a staff with a golden orb at the edge of it.\n…\n[Equipment:] The Fallen Angel's Mask\n[Type:] Mask\n[Class:] Assassin, Soul Wielder\n[Tier:] Epic\n[Required Level:] 25\n[Quality:] Good\n[Attributes:] +500 Mind/Intelligence\n[Special Perk:] Grants the user the ability to see through illusions and detect hidden traps or enemies within a certain radius.\n…\n[Equipment:] Judicator's Staff\n[Type:] Staff\n[Class:] Magus, Exorcist\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Required Level:] 40\n[Quality:] Normal\n[Attributes:] +250 Mind, +100 Stamina\n[Special Perk:] Highly increases proficiency in divine magic, and also allows the user to blind the opponent with a divine light.\n…\n'Everything except for the wings is fucking useless…' Stark groaned, he knew that all these items would fetch him a good amount of rher coins, but he also wanted to be able to gain more power from his equipment.\nAnd finally, Stark turned his gaze to the last item he had gotten from the angel, and it was a rather… surprising one.\nIt wasn't a ring, or any weapon/wearable piece actually, instead… it was a key.\n…\n[Item:] Devil's Abyss Key\n[Type:] Key\n[Quality:] Artifact\n[Perk:] The key that allows to open the 'Devil's Abyss' rift and its secret final chamber (home of three 'Godless Demon' apostles)\n…\nBelow the crimson with a demon shaped stone on it was a note, Stark immediately picked it up to read its contents.\n[Good job on killing the angel, now come see us if you want to meet your demise, little human =)]\n'…' Stark was shocked, but not because of the content of the note, instead it was because… \"What the actual fuck is that writing, I'm going to these guys and teaching them a lesson of basic english.\"\nThe text was almost incomprehensible, and it took Stark a few minutes to make sure he understood whatever was written on there.\n'Well… I get it,' Stark put all the equipment he had gotten, including the wings (he would use them when he was back) and the key, inside the [Spatial Inventory], then immediately left his hotel room and hailed for a taxi to the trading district of Fellarburg.\nIt was still early in the morning, but he got used to going there at this time since there were fewer people, and he truly enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere.\n'What about the breakthrough for my skills, though?' he remembered that he needed to do something to increase the limit from 10 to 15, yet he didn't know what or how.\n[You need to purchase a 'Lv25 Breakthrough Stone', which is also called the 'Iron Breakthrough Stone']\n'Hm… Why is that?'\n[Classifiers are only usually ranked based on their level, but for their overall strength, there are several categories: Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Ascendant, Prodigy, Immortal and Classified]\n[Note: these categories are only used for breakthroughs to another tier, so you probably won't hear them much…]\n'Like a competitive fps game!' Stark nodded, being an avid Volarant player (typo is on purpose).\n[Huh… yeah, whatever that is…]\nAnd so, Stark reached the trading district, he had lots of things to do since he had reached level 25, and he was excited to do all of that quickly to get back to the 'Memories Museum' and finally start training.",

It was insane, I wish I was there to meet that guy,\" his friend replied.\n\"I mean, fucking hell, he came back from the dead,\" another classifier spoke while showing his phone to his friends, and all of them gasped in shock after a minute.\n'Hm…' Stark was skeptical about all of this: wherever he went, he could hear people talk about the secret rift conquest from yesterday.\nAnd the main topic of discussion was… as guessed, the bunny-masked man.\nThe videos and highlights of all his fights had spread throughout the internet, not only inside Fellarburg, but through the entire world.\nMany people called him 'a powerful classifier that hides as if he is weak', and others preferred to call him a 'prodigy with immense talent'.\nBut what all the organizations looked at was the fight with Judicator, and the fact that he had been cut in half by the boss, yet somehow came back to life to get revenge, was the most interesting part of all.\nStark reached the 'Classifiers Trading Association', but even on the massive screen at their entrance was played the replay of him fighting Judicator.\n'Can't escape, but what can I say, I'm just him,' he shrugged and entered the massive building.\n\"I wish to sell some items,\" he told a receptionist who approached him as soon as he entered, and just like the previous times, he was guided toward a room.\nAnd his appraiser… was that white-haired woman with a cigarette in her mouth again.\n\"Oh, it's you again,\" she smiled, letting out a trail of smoke from her mouth, \"Sit down and let's see what you got for us again!\"\nShe was extremely friendly, and one of the best appraisers in the association, but…\n\"Yo, can I get another appraiser?\" Stark tried to talk to the receptionist as she was about to close the door, \"I don't want to be in a room full of smoke-\"\nBut the receptionist didn't care and closed the door on him.\n\":(\"\n\"Sit down… BOY!\" the white-haired woman had a cold smile on her face, not liking the fact he had refused her services.\n\"Sigh…\" he agreed as he just wanted to get this done, trying to ignore the smoke, \"But I would much rather you didn't smoke in front of customers.\"\n\"As long as it's allowed by the rules, then can't do anything about it kiddo,\" she shrugged, \"Show me those items!\"\nIn their room was a big TV that also showed his fight with Judicator.\n'…' Stark looked at the screen for a few seconds, it was a strange feeling to know the entire world was looking at you, yet didn't know you were the one who did all of that.\n\"Interested in that classifier too, huh?\" the woman smiled, \"He is fascinating, can't deny it!\"\n\"…\" Stark looked back at her and pulled out the five equipment pieces he didn't need as he couldn't use them, placing on the table five shiny-looking items that immediately grabbed the woman's interest, \"Oh, and by the way, I'm not interested in that since it's me.\"\nStark smiled as he said those words, a nonchalant expression on his face.\n\"Hm~\" the woman raised her eyebrow, \"Sure, let's just get your appraisal going, then,\" she didn't believe him, but Stark didn't care enough to prove that it was him.\nAfter a few minutes, the woman's eyes widened as she inspected all the items.\nAnd the first thing she instinctively did after that was look at the screen, where Stark was fighting the angel.\nEventually, she shook her head and gave Stark his items, \"These items are incredible, let me tell you the amount we are willing to give for each…\"\n…\n[Equipment:] The Minotaur's Helmet\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Quality:] Normal\n[Price:] 470,000 rher coins\n…\n\"This is a rather powerful helmet, many warriors will jump on the opportunity to buy it, the berserk state is a very nice perk,\" the white-haired woman added as commentary.\nStark almost choked when hearing the amount: was it always this easy to earn money?\nHe could probably already have a wife and a dozen kids with this amount! (if anybody was willing that is...)\nBut of course, this wasn't all the items, so he just sat down and waited.\n…\n[Equipment:] Obsidian Gauntlets\n[Tier:] Uncommon\n[Quality:] Normal\n[Price:] 248,000 rher coins\n…\n[Equipment:] Obsidian Golem's Ring\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Quality:] Good\n[Price:] 535,000\n…\nWhile reaching this item, the white-haired appraiser didn't seem that surprised, although she couldn't deny that these were good items.\nBut upon looking at the mask and staff… she knew that something was up.\nShe couldn't read the name of the items, so the trading association would usually name them themselves to something that makes sense considering their perks and appearance.\nBut this mask… she couldn't help but look at Judicator's face and notice that they look extremely similar.\n\"I'm not interested in that since it's me,\" she remembered that boy's words, and looked at him, he had a blank expression on his face.\n…\n[Equipment:] The Fallen Angel's Mask\n[Tier:] Epic\n[Quality:] Good\n[Price:] 783,000\n…\n[Equipment:] Judicator's Staff\n[Tier:] Epic\n[Quality:] Good\n[Price:] 601,000\n…\nSelling all these items would mean that Stark would be getting around 2.63 million rher coins.\n'Nice!' he smiled and began to get up from the couch he had been sitting on.\nBut…\n\"Where did you get these items?\" the woman suddenly spoke, a powerful and chilly aura surrounding her body.\n\"…\" Stark saw in her eyes that she wasn't kidding, and so he smiled, \"I already told you once, didn't I?\"\n'Perception!' he decided to use his skill on her as he sensed that her power was way too much for a mere appraiser.\nAnd he was right.\n…\n[Name: Violette Winkson]\n[Level: 194]\n[Class: Magus]\n[HP: 89000]\n[Strength: 4716]\n[Speed: 12842]\n[Stamina: 15198]\n[Defense: 13184]\n…\nShe was extremely powerful, even more than the people inside the Secret Rift, and yet… here she was… standing before Stark.\n\"Who… are… you?\" she tilted her head.\n\"You can call me Stark, ma'am, I need to go now,\" Stark immediately headed toward the door, and she didn't stop him at all, instead just glaring at the boy with her aura out.\n\"Goodbye, customer,\" she gave him a smile that sent a shiver down his spine.\nBut after a few instants, he immediately recovered and returned the smile.\n\"See you later, Violette.\"\nHe had the feeling she wasn't just an appraiser, and that they would meet again soon.",

      "content": "Stark left the reception room with the white-haired woman still inside, leaving her to wonder who that boy was as he knew her name.\nFrankly, Stark didn't care enough to show off or not do it, if he was asked something, he would just answer accordingly, which was something Lana would probably tell him to hide.\nStark immediately went to the market section of the trading association, then guided himself to the 'boost items' part of it.\nStanding on luxurious displays stood many items.\n...\n[Item:] Skill Level Candy (lv1-10)\n[Tier:] Epic\n[Quality:] Perfect\n[Perk:] Each time you consume a candy, the level of the skill you choose will increase by one, note that it only works on lv1-10 skills.\n[Price:] 500,000 rher coins.\n...\nThere were also other variants of this candy (which was already expensive as fuck) but these candies were just for skills with greater skill limits, for example it wouldn't work for level 10-15, so he would need to buy the next variant.\nBasically, it was something only rich people could afford, he wasn't interested.\nInstead... what interested him was placed in another hall, and there was a wooden sign next to it that displayed the words he wanted to read: 'breakthrough stones'.\nThe halls were pretty empty, a big reason why he loved to come during early mornings.\nAnd only a few seconds later, he found the item he wanted as it was the first one that was placed on the right.\nIt was a rune with the word 'iron' written on some sort of small magic circle in the middle, and a small aura emanated from it.\n...\n[Item:] Breakthrough Stone (Iron-Level)\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Quality:] Normal\n[Perk:] Increases your skill level from 10 to 15 when you meet the conditions to do so.\n[Price:] 1.2 million rher coins\n...\n\"Holy shit,\" Stark let out, resulting in some eyes falling on him, \"Who decided to make these things so expensive...?\"\nThis would take around half of what he had gotten selling all the items from the secret rift.\n'Oh well... no other way,' he took the stone from the display, then had to go to a screen right at the entrance of the market to scan the item and then buy it using his card (he could of course go to a real receptionist to buy it but it was faster like that).\nHe stored the [Breakthrough Stone] inside of his [Spatial Inventory] and then left the trading association.\nThey didn't have any ingredients related to Alchemists in there as it was probably another building that held all of it, this building was the one for general purposes, but all classes (except for Domination) should have buildings of their own.\nIt really did seem like Alchemist and Domination were the classes with the least amount of items and equipment related to them because of how unknown the latter was, while the former is just about making potions, so not much beside armor and rings.\nYour level of alchemy is based on your level and skill level, so an equipment piece couldn't increase that (some were able to but they were rare and expensive).\nPassing through the crowded streets of classifiers excitedly talking about the bunny-masked man, Stark reached his other destination:\n\"Alchemist All-in-One Association\", it was another giant building, not quite as big as the trading association one, but still fairly big and enough to accommodate everything that is needed.\nInside the alchemist association building was located a place to sell your ingredients, as well as an auction house for alchemists to try and acquire rare items to create new potions/existing ones.\nBut what he was interested in was... the first section.\n[Beginner Alchemist Section]\nHe guessed that this was it since he had just acquired this class, and so he entered it without hesitation.\nA massive screen greeted him.\n[Welcome, new alchemist, please pick your starting ingredients, we recommend you to take enough for the beginning level potions as you need to get used to crafting!]\nAlmost seemed like a tutorial, but he ignored it and began looking for what he wanted.\nWhile walking toward the ingredients section, Stark realized that this wasn't all the beginner section had to offer.\nThere were also 'Potion Recipe Scrolls', which worked just like skill scrolls except it was to unlock a potion as an alchemist.\nOf course, as to not make it too overpowered, many requested a minimal alchemist level to use, much like items.\n...\n[Name:] Potion of Damage\n[Perk:] Will deal 5000 damage to an opponent when throwing it on them\n[Required level:] 5\n[Price:] 450,000\n...\n[Name:] Fly Potion\n[Perk:] Can fly with perfect control for one minute\n[Required level:] 8\n[Price:] 792,000\n...\nThis was only the beginner section, but there were some rather interesting potions, Stark could only imagine what would be inside the middle section or even high tier one.\nAnd what about potion recipe scrolls at the top section, they could probably deal hundreds of thousands of damage with one bottle (although the materials would be expensive and very hard to find).\nThis was a very interesting class.\nHe decided not to stare too much as the thought of buying a potion was already on his mind even though he hadn't even tried to check if it merged well with domination.\n[Beginner Ingredients]\nOn hundreds upon hundreds of displays stood many ingredients that beginners could use to begin their alchemist life, they were rather cheap compared to the rest, which was good.\nMany people around Stark were also busy inspecting ingredients and checking theur panels to see what they needed, and so he did the same.\n'Ogre Ear... Wolf Teeth... Flowers...'\nIt didn't take long for him to find everything he needed for his three potions, and every time he took an item from a display, another one would immediately reappear like some sort of generator.\nThe ingredients when bought individually weren't much of an issue, but it was when he bought many at once that it became visible his wallet was taking a hit.\n...\n[Ingredient:] Ogre Ear\n[Price:] 1200 rher coins\n...\n[Ingredient:] Wolf Teeth\n[Price:] 1360 rher coins\n...\n[Ingredient:] Strength Flower\n[Price:] 5700 rher coins\n...\nHe took enough ingredients to make 10 of each potions, just to test them out, then left the 'Alchemist Association'.\n'Very useful place, I'll need to come back,' Stark smiled as he left.\n\"Oh~ we got a newbie alchemist it seems!\" but as he left, he heard a voice behind him, coming from near the entrance of the building.\n\"Ah shit, here we go again,\" he shrugged, expecting another group of classifiers trying to cause problems.\nBut this time, he was wrong.",

The stranger's hood obscured their face, but their presence exuded an air of mystery and power.\n\"New to the world of alchemy, are you?\" the hooded figure spoke in a smooth, melodic voice that seemed to echo in the street, Stark was still cautious of whoever this was, but their voice somehow made him feel at ease.\n\"Yeah,\" Stark shrugged, raising his eyebrow.\nIt was clearly a woman, extremely noticeable from her voice, long purple hair, and also… well… her curves, there was no denying that\n\"Interesting,\" without wasting a single second, the hooded woman used her [Potion Crafting] skill to summon her table.\nAnd it was… well… impressive.\nInstead of his wooden table with a badly shaped cauldron and brewing stand, her's was on a whole other level.\nThe table was made out of blue platinum, it's shape glinting in the sunlight, and intricate runes were etched into its surface.\nOn her table was a set of ingredients that seemed to glow with an ethereal light, emitting a soft hum that reverberated in the air.\nThe cauldron she had was giant, and made of pure diamonds, while the brewing stand she had was so big and complicated that there were magic circles surrounding it.\nBut… Stark wasn't impressed, instead his face turned cold.\n\"Trying to flex on me?\" he asked, tilting his head as there was no such reason to show him any of that.\nThe hooded woman chuckled softly, her violet eyes gleaming with amusement. \"Not at all, dear newcomer. I simply appreciate the art of alchemy and like to work with the best tools available to me,\" she explained, her voice soft yet commanding.\n'A tool…?' did she just call him a tool? Or was she just referring to her brewing station.\n\"Well, see you later,\" she waved her hand before heading in the opposite direction.\n\"Weirdo…\" Stark groaned as he hailed for a taxi and went back to his hotel.\n\"Goodbye… CHOSEN,\" the woman lips grew into a giant smile as soon as Stark left inside that taxi, saying his code name.\nShe drank a potion and immediately vanished in a trail of blue smoke.\nStark didn't know it yet, but there were already people aware of who he was.\nAnd his recent conquest of the Secret Rift helped them out a lot with that.\n***\nStark went to the market and bought lots of pre-made food, as well as enough fast food and such to last him upwards to two-three weeks.\nThe reason was obvious: he planned to stay a very long time inside of the 'Memories Museum', grinding against the bosses he had already beaten in the hopes of improving his senses and movements.\nBeing able to take just two of the bosses he had fought and struggled against before simultaneously would prove that he had indeed improved a lot.\nAfter around an hour, he arrived back at his hotel room, having placed everything inside of his [Spatial Inventory] meant he didn't need to move anything, and that everything would be available once he was there.\n\"Phew…\" Stark sighed, lying on the bed and looking up to the ceiling, \"…\"\nHe wouldn't do anything other than just fight, fight, and fight, for the next two to three weeks, so he was getting mentally ready.\nIt would surely take him a while before deciding to enter-\n\"Ok, i'm ready,\" he shrugged almost instantly, not even five seconds after getting on the bed, and summoned the black door which led to the 'Memories Museum'.\nIt appeared before him, surrounded by a dark aura, and Stark opened it wide, passing through the threshold with determination in his eyes.\nThe familiar sensation of being pulled through dimensions washed over him, and as he emerged on the other side, he found himself back in the vast, endless hallways of the Memories Museum.\nFood inside of the [Spatial Inventory] doesn't rot, so he wouldn't pull out anything until he really needed it.\nAnd to add to the immersion, he even bought a 'small tent' from the market, which allowed him to sleep wherever he wanted.\nSuch tents were only used when classifiers knew they would be spending large periods of times inside a rift, but for Stark, he had decided that he wouldn't leave this space until either his food ran out, or he completed what he wanted to do: defeat all 6 bosses.\n[Quest: defeat all 6 bosses at the same time!]\n[Reward: +3 skill points!]\nIn addition to that, as a way to encourage him, even the museum allowed him to get a reward for his efforts.\nFrankly, there was a 99.99% chance that he would never be able to complete that challenge because of the sheer difficulty, plus his level wasn't that high compared to theirs, so almost anything would one-shot him.\nInfinite tries sounded powerful, but he couldn't forget that time still flew normally in this space.\nHe was too lazy to train his muscles (useless since he had domination), and attempting to beat yet another rift felt boring, so this 'Memories Museum' was the perfect opportunity to grow stronger all the while improving his techniques.\nThis would 100% help him in the future.\nBut before doing any of that…\n\"POTION CRAFTING!\"\nStark wasted no time in getting down to business.\nHe set up his makeshift alchemy station, a far cry from the extravagant setup of the hooded woman he had encountered earlier.\nDespite the humble appearance of his equipment, Stark's determination shone through as he meticulously organized his ingredients and prepared to craft his potions.\nHe took the required ingredients to craft one of each potion, and got to business.\n…\n[Potion of Strength]\n[Effect: Increases the user's strength stat by 10% for 5 minutes!]\n[Ingredients: x2 Wolf Teeth, x1 Ogre Ear, x1 Strength Flower…]\n…\nHe took out everything that was needed and placed it on the table, and immediately as he did so…\n[Wolf Teeth 2/2; Ogre Ear 1/1; Strength Flower 1/1!]\n[You can craft 'Potion of Strength'!]\nHe clicked on that panel without a single hint of hesitation, and suddenly, the equipment on his table began to move alone, mixing and brewing the ingredients with precision.\nThe cauldron bubbled and steamed, emitting a faint glow as the potion took form under Stark's watchful gaze.\nIt didn't take more than thirty seconds for the potion to be finished.\n['Potion of Strength' has been crafted, please touch this screen to make it appear on the table!]\nHe did as he was told, and just as explained, a red liquid inside of a glass appeared on the wooden table, which Stark took in his hands instantly.\n[Perception] showed him that it was indeed the potion he wanted, meaning that the alchemist station and all of the related things were working perfectly.\nIt was much easier than expected too, meaning that Stark could get to business and craft the remaining potions as he wanted to try them out while fighting the bosses.\nHe used up all his ingredients, but…\n…\n[Inventory:] 10x Potion of Strength, 10x Potion of Speed, 10x Potion of Regeneration.\n…\nAnd so with everything ready, Stark put all the potions inside of his inventory void and headed toward the displays with the memories on it, ready to select them all and start his training arc.",

He clicked on the panel, and almost instantly was surrounded by that black mist of memories, transporting him to another location.\nAnd when he opened his eyes back...\n\"Haha... this is still just as terrifying,\" he felt a drop of sweat on his forehead.\nBefore him were all the bosses he had previously defeated, and even though they wouldn't be an issue if alone, the fact the 6 of them were here together created a powerful aura even Stark could sense was bad.\nHis goal: beat them all and get used to fight powerful opponents at the same time.\nHe also noticed that the arena had changed.\nIt was... a mix of all of the boss's areas?\nWater that reached a little above his feet could be seen, to accommodate the 'Black Water Devourer', the circular walls of the arena were replaced by buildings, much like Malakar's city, there were dozens of marble pillars scattered across the giant space for Judicator, and there was a ceiling with mirrors all over it, for the Mirror Master and the other two.\nBasically, this arena was a mix of all the challenges of the previous bosses, which he would also need to take into account.\n[3...]\nThe monsters grabbed their weapons.\n[2...]\nJudicator let out his giant black wings and the devourer disappeared into the water.\n[1...]\nThe Creeping Shadow, which was just a perfect replica of Stark, smiled, ready to eliminate its owner.\n[FIGHT!]\nThe moment the fight began, Malakar sent his cane at him, while Judicator and the shadow dashed toward him.\n[The Purgatory Shadow took the hit for you]\nThey were fast, and their sheer number was enough to take him back.\nBut...\n~FWISH~\nThe devourer appeared below him and gobbled him up like he was a tasty meal.\n\"18371-\" even when activating his shield around his body, it wasn't enough to tank the attack.\nAnd so...\nHe was sent back to the museum.\n[Do you want to try again?]\n'Fucking hell...'

Stark drank two of his potions for the first time, wanting to test them out to see if they would increase his odds.\nAnd they did.\nHe reached the last point where he died rather smoothly, and even managed to avoid the Mirror Master's shard.\n\"CLONE FRENZY,\" he summoned his two clones, who were also affected by the potion effects as they were made of his aura.\nThe strength and speed potions increased his stats by 10%, and although it might not seem much on an average alchemist, giving that to Stark with his insane stats and aura was a recipe for disaster.\nHe now managed to easily avoid most of the attacks that came his way, and his movements felt smoother.\nHis clones were attacking the other monsters, one of them managing to take the witch's scepter from her hands and breaking it before sending two fists of aura toward her brother.\n[Enemy stunned]\nThe warrior was stunned, and so the two clones took advantage of this opportunity to gang up on him while the other bosses were focused on Stark.\n\"-18372! -19714! -17962!\"\nAnd so, just like that... Stark eliminated the first boss.\nBut...\n~FWISH~\nWith two simple flap of his wings, Judicator killed the two clones and rushed toward Stark, his body was already dyed in platinum since he activated his ultimate skills already.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" he jumped out of the way as he couldn't avoid that attack.\nBut...\n\"ALL-AREA STRIKE!\" at that very moment, the Mirror Master decided to use his unavoidable attack, summoning the dark flames on the ceiling which all began to descend on him.\n\"Ok,\" Stark could just shrug as he was engulfed and killed by the fire, it was in the name: this attack is unavoidable.\n[Do you want to try again?]\n'It's been hours...

wrong.\nBut there was a slight problem to that plan of his…\nHOW WAS HE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS ON THE OTHER SIDE?\nSending a clone was nice, and he would know if it died, but he actually needed a way to prepare for whatever awaited him on the other side.\nHe stood there for thirty seconds, rubbing his chin and wondering what he should do until…\n[Close your eyes.]\n'…?' a panel appeared before him, and Stark was confused, how could a panel unrelated to skills or anything suddenly appear?\nBut it was until looking at his clone that he noticed something: it was turning its head slightly toward him, its eyes locked on his figure, a small smile on its face.\nHe immediately understood that it was the clone itself that communicated with him as it wasn't able to talk with its mouth.\nStark followed its advice and closed his eyes.\nAnd the moment he did, another panel greeted him.\n[Now focus all of your aura, and think about being in my position as hard as you can!]\n'…' Stark's aura began to flow around his entire body, and soon enough reached his eyes.\nThen he focused on the clone ahead, sending the aura in his eyes toward it.\n[Now open them back up!]\nHe didn't understand what any of this could do, it seemed utterly useless in his opinion.\nAnd yet…\n\"HUH?\" When he opened his eyes, he was no longer looking through his own eyes, but through the eyes of the clone.\nNo… it's not that he was looking through his clone's eyes… HE WAS CONTROLLING IT!\nHe moved his left hand upward to make sure that all his sensations were correct, and as expected, his hand did the exact movement he wanted it to do.\nNo doubts anymore, he was controlling that clone.\nBut if he was controlling it, then what was his original body doing…?\nHe looked behind him, and saw that the original Stark was still standing, he was just looking at the ground, an emotionless and lifeless expression on his face, his crimson eyes void of any light.\n'Creepy…' he shrugged, but hopefully his body would just stay safe inside of the memories museum.\nThe clone Stark now controlled moved towards the black door, guided by the consciousness of the real Stark.\nThe moment he put his hand on the handle again though…\n[Imminent danger on the other side, be careful!]\n'That's why i'm using a clone… duh…' he closed the panel and opened the door, 'Here goes nothing…'\n***\n~FWISH~\nInside of the hotel room, the black door that led to the memories museum appeared back in the middle of the room, fading in like it was always here.\nAnd suddenly, that ominous door with its dark aura opened, revealing Stark coming out from it, a blank expression on his face.\n\"…\" Stark looked around while trying to seem as unsuspicious as possible, but there was nobody around.\nIf it wasn't for [Focus] actively warning him about the presence of intruders, he would have surely not known.\n'Are they waiting for me to sleep to finish me off?' he pondered, but it seemed unlikely.\nAfter all, Stark could sense the aura in the air, and he was confident that they were much stronger than he was, if he was stronger he would quite literally just come out in his real body and beat their asses.\nBut Stark didn't like to take risks when they were unneeded, and he was safe inside of the memories museum.\nSo he did something the intruders didn't expect him to do: call out for them.\nThere were 5 of them, and each of them hid somewhere close, yet too hard for Stark to notice under normal circumstances.\nIt was safe to say they knew exactly what they were doing.\nAnd Stark didn't think of it before, but their aura felt strangely familiar…\n'Domination…' he thought of this word as he walked toward his kitchen, there was no denying at least one of them was from the domination class… and maybe even more…?\nBut no, he didn't want to just sit there and wait.\n\"Please come out, if you wanted to kill me you would have already done it,\" he spoke out loud, grabbing a drink from his fridge.\nHe obviously couldn't drink or eat as he was only controlling a clone, but the goal of everything he was doing was to make it seem like he wasn't surprised or even scared of them.\nHis voice carried through the room, echoing off the walls and creating an eerie silence that seemed to stretch on forever.\nStark waited, his senses on high alert, waiting for any sign of movement or a response to his call.\nA few seconds passed, and the moment Stark wanted to call again…\n\"Shit… didn't know that kid was smart enough to notice us!\" a voice could be heard\n\"Should have expected it from a high potential individual!\" another answered.\nAnd then…\nFive figures emerged from different spots of his room: each of them cloaked in a dark, swirling aura that seemed to bend the very light around them.\nThey were wearing casual clothes, and their faces were visible, but their bodies appeared from the walls, the floor, and even the ceiling, it was as if they had merged with the texture of his room to hide.\n\"Told you it wouldn't work!\" a woman with long black hair laughed, slapping the guy on her left.\n\"Pss… anybody would of fallen for it,\" he was fairly tall, reaching 190cm, and had very defined mucles, his head was balding though, and the light on the ceiling was shining on his empty head.\n\"I mean… what even is that door, we thought he was out of the city or country, but what the hell is that?\" another man with grey hair, yellow eyes, and big circular glasses mumbled, rubbing his chin.\n\"Portable dimension maybe? Wouldn't be surprising knowing what he did or must have experienced…\" a second woman with a bob cut and purple hair sighed, she had a staff in her hands, and she was spinning it like it was a blade.\n\"…\" the guy on the middle though wasn't speaking, he had a well defined face although he looked older than the others, and had short white hair that went in all sort of directions, clearly not kept well (or maybe since he always fights?).\nBut what Stark noticed with him wasn't his clothes, or even the fact he had a katana in his left hand, but his eyes…\nJust like Stark's original body, which he left inside the memories museum, his eyes were devoid of any light, almost as if he was lifeless.\n\"Let's just get down to business,\" he sighed, his voice just as lifeless as his eyes.\nAnd then…\n~FWISH~\nThe purple-haired girl used her staff to send a magic arrow at Stark.\n'AH SHIT? THEY WANT TO FIGHT!'\nIf it wasn't yet again for [Focus] which allowed him to see the arrow come a few instants before it hit him, his clone would have probably just died.\nStark folded his body backward to avoid the arrow, which came crashing against the wall behind him and destroyed it.\n\"HEY, I'M GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT!\" he shouted at her while pointing at the damage she had caused.\n\"Calm down, Yui, we aren't here to fight…\" the leader gently smiled and sat on a chair around the main table, while the other four just stood behind him, staring down at Stark.",

plus he didn't like the aura around them all, as it seemed like they weren't as peaceful as they made themselves appear to be, otherwise they wouldn't all have their [Domination] skill activated.\n\"Oh…\" Juan grabbed his katana, an overwhelming aura that almost blinded Stark around him, then pointed his katana toward the boy, almost reaching his face, \"But of course it is, CHOSEN, after all… we know what you did.\"\n\"…\"\n\"But do not fret,\" he didn't retract his katana away, \"You are a precious pawn after all…\"\nAll others were glaring at Stark, a mix of cautiousness in their eyes even though they were much stronger than he was.\n\"After all…\" Juan's smile grew so wide that it was became creepy, \"You are the first and only person to ever complete the 'Domination Trial' on the death difficulty, aren't you?\"\nStark stared at Juan for a moment, then rolled his eyes, they somehow knew about his achievements, he didn't know how, but if they were part of some bigger organization, it meant they had both the power and money to take him out at any time.\nAnd yet… Stark wasn't scared.\nHe didn't know why, but he kept a very calm expression.\nSomehow… he wasn't scared of these people.\n\"As the domination user with the highest potential out of them all…\" Juan kept smiling, \"We would love if you could join us, you will be granted money, fame, women, anything you want!\"\nAnyone would of jumped in joy at such an opportunity, but Stark didn't even think of accepting for even a second.\nHe slapped the katana that was in front of him away, then looked at Juan dead in the eyes, \"Sorry, but I think I have too much potential to be stuck in such a lame organization,\" he smiled back.\nFor a fraction of a second, Juan's eyes twitched, surprise visible in them.\nAnd then…\n~FWISH, CLANG, WASH~\nThe four people that were behind him suddenly appeared around Stark, all their weapons pointed at him.\nYui, the purple-haired mage, stood on the table, her staff pointed at Stark, and visible particles of magic glowing at the edge of it, meaning she was ready to throw another arrow.\nThe buff bald man was behind Stark, his hands, as large as the boy's head, glowing with a crimson aura, indicating that he could crush him any second.\nThe black-haired woman pulled out two daggers from god knows where and stood to his side, one blade against his neck and the other pointed at his crotch.\nAnd as for the last grey-haired man with the glasses, his face turned dark, his glasses being the only visible feature in his face because of the white glow in their reflection, his left hand was also glowing with a golden color, and it was opened, facing Stark, it almost felt like he was about to lift him up using psychic powers.\n\"...\" Stark had seen them get closer, but he didn't for a single second show any surprise.\nKnowing that he was a clone somehow boosted his confidence to the max.\n\"Know your place,\" the woman with the daggers got her weapons closer to his vital areas.\n\"Should we teach this kid a lesson, boss?\" the tall man put his hands against Stark's head, ready to crush it.\nBut Juan wasn't convinced, even if Stark was a prodigy, he shouldn't be so calm against people who could actively kill him in one strike.\n\"Prodigie's Eyes!\" he activated his skill, and suddenly...\n[Stark Heartsouls HP: 1/1]\nThe clone was so well-made it didn't only copy appearance, but also even tricked skills, if it wasn't for the one HP, even Juan would have fallen for it.\nBut now he knew...\n\"There is no point,\" he smiled, talking to his friends, not Stark, \"That kid is smarter than you all.\"\nOf course, he wouldn't admit that he had fallen for this trick too.\n\"What do you mean, boss, how can he be smarter than us?\" the man with glasses spoke to Juan, confusion on his face.\n\"There is no point,\" he repeated, \"This is not the real Stark, it is a mere clone, if not an illusion, basically, this kid knows what he is doing.\"",

Why would they care about covering for his room after trying to recruit him and then attacking his clone?\n'Heh… I don't care, money is money!' he grabbed his phone and scanned the cheque using his bank application, now all he needed to do was wait for people to notice what happened and come ask him questions, 'They are probably gonna kick me out…'\nHe figured he should really start saving up to buy a house or even just an apartment as living in hotels wasn't that good.\nBut surprisingly, as soon as he finished scanning the cheque, putting the money in his account… his network came back.\nAnd so…\n~BEEP, BEEP, BEEP~\nDozens upon dozens of notifications flooded his phone's screen.\n'The fuck…?'\nHe opened it using his passcode and realized that the notifications came from one application only: messages.\nAnd even more surprising, it was only one person.\nStark could already guess who it was since he only had one person in his contact list…\nAnd he was right.\n…\n[Contact:] Lana Moonless\n[182 messages, 47 missed calls]\n…\n{Hey, did you see the news? You were on them!}\n{Everyone has been talking about the bunny-masked man haha!}\n{Wanna go somewhere later…? Of course, to talk!}\nSuch messages appeared over and over.\n{Why aren't you answering?}\n{Ignoring me now? What did I do?}\n{Are you mad?}\nThat's when she began to call him many times.\nBut in the end, Stark couldn't answer any of those messages or calls since he was inside the Memories Museum, and he had left his phone inside his inventory void since he was too focused on defeating the 6 bosses.\nHe would try to make up for it, but he didn't really know why she was so obsessed with talking to him.\nAnd the last message she sent, only a mere hour ago was…\n[Hey, if you see this… wanna meet up with my family? My father wants to talk to you!]\n'…'\nHe had just come back from his training, and from meeting with five people who clearly had no good intentions with him as they knew who he was.\nBut…\n'Heh… why not!'\nHe would also use this opportunity to make sure to explain why he didn't respond.\n…\n{Stark: Why not, when do you want me to come?}\nHe answered for the first time in a week, and the message was immediately read by Lana.\n'Damn, does she stay on her phone all day long?'\nThis was false, the reason why it was seen so quick was because Stark was the only person Lana allowed notifications to be activated on her phone, so she immediately knew it was him when she heard the BEEP.\n{Lana: YOU FINALLY ANSWER? WHERE WERE YOU!!!??}\nShe went on a five paragraph rant about how she was worried and thought that he had gone on some crazy adventure again and died, which Stark promptly ignored since 'I ain't reading allat'.\nBut soon enough…\n{I'll come get you two days from now, I'll inform my family!}\nShe seemed to be more excited than he was for that, but oh well, he guessed that spending all his time fighting and going to the market was bad for him, so normal social interactions couldn't be so bad now could they…?\n{Stark: Great, I'll be waiting for that :)}\nHe had a lot of things to think about, and it was possible he would need to attend another rift soon if it opened, plus he had seen after Lana's comment that the videos of his battles had all been posted on MeeTube and were reviewed by many classifiers and news stations, meaning that Stark was basically one of the most famous persons in the world right now.\nOr at least, the bunny-masked man was since videos showing his achievements reached tens of millions of views.\n'Well, time to get ready for that meeting… hopefully it goes well!'\nIt didn't.",

After all he came back to LIFE!!}\nPeople were giving their theories over what could be happening, and Stark even saw entire theory videos explaining all of his actions and the possible reason why he came back from the dead after being cut.\nNeedless to say, all these videos were nonsense, but Stark still laughed at some crazy theories people would come up with.\n{Lana Moonless: I'm coming to pick you up tomorrow at 12pm, so be ready!}\n{Stark Heartsouls: Okay, see you tomorrow =)}\nIt had only been one day since he had finished his training and met with those five domination users, and Stark spent the entirety of his small break lazing around in his room.\nThe hotel staff came to check up on him, and after he paid the 2 million needed for the repair, he was given three days to leave his room as he was \"banned\" from ever buying a new one in here.\nIt seemed like saying \"some guys intruded my room to kill me\" didn't work as an excuse.\nSoon enough, Stark fell asleep.\nHe wasn't nervous about what could happen tomorrow, after all he was just meeting with Lana's family since her father wanted to see him, nothing more, nothing less.\n{Lana Moonless: Goodnight, Stark.}\nHe didn't answer as he was already in the dream realm.\n***\nThe next day, Stark woke up feeling refreshed, then immediately got ready for the meeting by taking a shower and… dressing up in the most average clothes ever.\n'What am I supposed to do? I have nothing else,' he shrugged, and he didn't really feel the need to dress up for a mere meeting, even if it was with the 'Archer King' or whatever his name was.\n…\n{Lana Moonless: I'm waiting for you, please come down!}\nHe did as he was told, putting everything that he owned inside of his [Spatial Inventory] and leaving his room for good: he wouldn't come back to it ever again.\nStark made his way down to the lobby, and when he went outside… he was greeted by a luxurious white car straight out of a movie.\nPeople around stopped just to observe the car and its owner, it was obvious that they were dirt rich to be able to afford such a thing.\nAnd as Stark guessed… it was Lana that was currently driving.\nHe didn't say a word as he approached the car and opened the passenger door next to the driver seat, sitting down next to the blonde-haired girl.\nShe was currently wearing a beautiful dress, looking both elegant and a bit intimidating at the same time.\n\"Couldn't have worn better clothes?\" she raised her eyebrows while looking him from head to toe, analyzing his appearance.\n\"Nah, plus I don't really have the money!\" he wanted to save cash, and he was content with his four set of clothing as they helped him get through for now, no reason to buy more.\n\"Sigh…\" Lana smiled for a bit as she heard his words, then immediately went back to serious mode when noticing that Stark was looking at her, \"It's fine I guess, but please make sure to act well, you'll be meeting my mom, dad, and also my brother…\"\n\"Sureeee… by the way you're 16 and you can drive?\" he questioned, they had just graduated from middle school and were all sixteen years old, meaning they weren't real adults.\n\"I mean… you learn how to drive when you're around 14, it's normal,\" she responded, \"Didn't your parents teach you?\"\n\"…\" Stark knew how to drive thanks to his past life, but he was pretty sure the 'Heartsouls' family hadn't even bother to sign him up for driving classes, meaning that he had no driving license, \"I guess I do too…\"\n\"See!\"\nAnd just like that, the two kept going toward Lana's house.\n***\nLuxury District, Fellarburg\n\"Are we there yet?\"\n\"For the hundredth fucking time, Stark, NO WE AREN'T!\" Lana shouted before turning her face toward the window, \"Oh, we actually are there!\"\nThey were in the luxury district, where all the most important and powerful families of the entirety of Fellarburg resided.\nAround them were dozens of mansions, and soon enough… Lana parked in the garden of one of the mansions, ten other cars next to it.\n\"No space to park…\" Lana groaned, and Stark just looked at her with a disgusted look, \"W-what?\"\n\"Rich problems,\" he shrugged as he got off the car.\nThe mansion before them was nothing short of grandeur with its towering pillars and intricate designs.\nAt the front of it stood a massive moon that kept flickering, a weird aura around it.\n'They realllyyyy want to show people who they are…' but they weren't the only ones as Stark noticed that some other mansions nearby also had text or some sort of sign indicating who they were by the entrance.\n\"Just a neighbor competition to show who the greatest families are,\" Lana chuckled.\nFellarburg was one of the greatest countries in this world, not only because there were many powerful families in it, but also since there always seemed to be some sort of rift opening or problem that occurred there: a perfect heaven for all those that sought thrill.\nIts population was well over 50 million people, although the overall population of this world was only of 1.2 billion because of the constant chaos and death, as well as the fact the outside world was filled with monsters.\n\"Let's go, they are waiting in the dining room!\" Lana smiled, excited to present him to her family for some reason.\nBut to be honest, all Stark could think about currently was how familiar this situation was to when he met his family when he first arrived in this world.\nOf course, he hadn't known who they were for long, so he didn't care, but it was just weird.\nAnd soon enough… they reached the meeting room.\n\"Mother, father, Aoki, I'm here!\" she called out as she opened the giant wooden door.\nAnd that's when Stark saw them: the members of the 'Moonless' family.\n'Hopefully no problems this time…' he sighed as he advanced, revealing himself to the members, who all looked at him in the eyes, different expressions on their faces.",

      "content": "\"Hello!\" Lana's mother, Louise Moonless, gave Stark a warm smile as she fixed her gaze on him, she had long brown hair.\n\"…\" Aoki, the brother, didn't say anything, and instead just glared at Stark, he also had blond hair but didn't seem to like him at all.\nStark promptly ignored him and sat down on one of the available chairs, which were both coincidentally right next to one other.\n\"Nice to know my future son-in-law has come here!\" Arthur, the archer king, laughed.\n\"DAD?!\" but Lana didn't seem to like the teasing.\n\"…\" Stark didn't say anything, instead he just looked down at the table before him, it was made of pure glass, so he was able to see himself in it.\nHe saw his face in the reflection and… he noticed that he was sweating.\n'…?' he didn't know why, but he had a bad feeling about this meeting.\nThey seemed friendly, but beyond those smiles… he saw something else.\n\"Let's start eating then we can talk,\" Arthur laughed and clapped both his hands, which resulted in a dozen butlers and maids to bring many plates filled with food on the table, \"Enjoy your meal, Stark!\"\nSafe to say, Stark didn't touch his meal.\nAnd after half an hour since the meeting started… Arthur finally talked about the REAL reason why they invited him.\nOf course, it was visible Lana didn't know anything since she was happily smiling, not knowing why the atmosphere was so tense.\n\"Oh… and by the way, Stark,\" Arthur smiled, and the overwhelming blue aura around him suddenly grew ten times in size, from Stark's position, all he could see was his face turning dark, while his eyes and mouth were burning with blue aura.\nHe asked the question.\n\"Have you thought about which academy you would like to go to?\"\nStark, feeling the weight of everyone's gaze on him, hesitantly looked up from his now-empty plate. His gaze met Arthur's, who was waiting for his answer.\nFellarburg is home to four elite academies recognized as the pinnacle of education, even among others of this world: Rift Conqueror Academy, Crimson Class Academy, Imperial Academy and finally, All-Go-To Academy.\nOf course, as a domination class user, Stark truly had no better way to improve his skills than by risking his life inside of rifts… or joining that stupid domination association, but he had no plans to do that.\n\"My daughter is going to the Rift Conqueror Academy, it is ranked top 1 in the entirety of Fellarburg, and top 3 worldwide,\" Arthur boasted.\n\"…\"\nInside this world, the 'Class Showcase', which was the event where Stark conquered the [City Ruins], didn't only serve as a start for your classifier career, but also to show your potential to other parties.\nDepending on how well you did inside of it, you would receive invitations to academies, guilds and even associations.\nAnd Stark… well… even though he was the one to conquer the rift, he hadn't received any sort of invitations.\nHe couldn't deny there was a small appeal to it, but he was pretty content with how he was doing currently, and there was pretty much no way for him to attend…\nThe reason was simple:\nFirst, you need to be part of a big family, or prove your worth inside of rifts to be able to attend to one of them, which would be impossible for Stark since everyone knew that he was the black sheep of his family.\nAnd second… well… there is a tuition fee, obviously, needless to say Stark would rather spend his money buying items that would actually benefit him, or ingredients now that he was an alchemist.\nBut…\n\"Would you like to attend an academy, Stark Heartsouls?\" Arthur grinned, looking at the boy in the eyes, \"I think you deserve it…!\"\n\"…\" Stark had a perplexed expression on his face, \"Sorry, but I have no way to prove my strength, and the tuition is way too expensive.\"\n\"Oh yes, the tuition for these academies vary, but for the top, it is roughly around 20 to 25 million rher coins…\" he nodded, which almost made Stark choke, this would be enough to buy a decent house or even a legendary/mythical equipment.\nBy now, Stark and Arthur were the only ones that spoke, the rest just looked at them both engage in this conversation.\nThe All-Go-To Academy is the best diverse academy in Fellarburg, it accepts any and all classes, meaning that even those not specialized in close range could benefit in attending.\nThe Imperial Academy stood as the pinnacle of educational resources, it is for people who would rather stay in the back and use their brains rather than fight and risk their lives.\nThe Crimson Class Academy is a bit of a special case as it only accepts the top three classes in this world: Soul Wielder, Magus and Alchemist, they are considered the best as they hold the strongest individuals; any person from a different class that attempts to access it, no matter their potential and strength, wouldn't be accepted.\nThey only want the elite of the elite, basically.\nAnd as for the last and final academy that was considered the 'top' of Fellarburg…\nIt was the Rift Conqueror academy, and although this one accepted any and all classes as long as you were strong, it was still the one with the highest standards, and the most difficult to enter.\nRemoving the 25 million rher coin tuition fee, there were also the many other classifiers there, and showing any signs of weakness could result in you being taken over by them, or even getting kicked out if you make a mistake.\n\"We do not need failures\" is their slogan, and it results in hundreds if not thousands of people getting suspended/expulsed every year, they don't even refund the tuition, and it is even said there is a 95% failure rate as the majority of students quit (if they don't just die).\nGetting suspended from this academy or quitting also goes on your record, meaning that it would result in most good guilds/groups not wanting anything to do with you: you would have to start from scratch again.\nIt was a risk many were willing to take though… because if you ever survived the two years and graduated, you were not only guaranteed success, but also strength and connections to back it up.\n\"Stark… do you want to attend the Rift Conqueror Academy?\" Arthur gave a chilling smile to Stark as he suddenly asked the question he had invited him over for.",

      "content": "\"Stark… do you want to attend the Rift Conqueror Academy?\" Arthur suddenly smiled while speaking to the boy.\nHe had already expected something like that the moment he began to talk about academies, but 'Rift Conqueror' was the top 1 in Fellarburg, and considered the top 3 in the world.\n\"…\" Stark looked at the blond-haired archer for a few seconds before sighing, \"I don't have the money or talent to attend.\"\nOf course, the latter was a lie since he was confident in his abilities to dominate others using the domination class, but the money part was true.\n\"Ohoh~ but I have seen you fight inside that rift, Stark, and I can promise you that you have everything you need to attend,\" he nodded, reminding Stark that Arthur was the leader of the crimson moon squad (although he never participates, he had just formed the team), and so that meant he knew Stark participated.\nHe knew that the person before him was the bunny-masked man everyone was talking about, and he would make sure to take advantage of that.\n\"Dad, you want him to attend with me, don't you?\" Lana pouted, suddenly speaking for the first time, \"I don't need protection!\"\n\"Princess~ it's not about you or anything, I just feel like granting such a strong person access to a way to get stronger is a good thing, your relationship with him can go the way you want it to go…\"\nShe blushed at the last few words, but stayed silent.\n\"I still don't have money,\" Stark shrugged, confident that this would be enough to let him off the hook.\n'To be honest… it can't be that bad…' he thought, plus attending such a big school would mean the possibility to get not only stronger, but also access better rifts.\nThe 95% failure rate didn't scare him at all.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, there was another domination user hiding among the crowd? After all he knew that some others existed thanks to the domination association.\nBut of course, the 25 million fee was still too much, so he obviously didn't plan to go.\nOr at least, that's what he thought.\n\"Oh, but it's fine, Stark, we can pay your tuition fee for you,\" Arthur smiled, his tone indicating that he had ulterior motives.\n\"DAD?!\" Lana slammed her fists against the table, lucky she didn't have much strength as an archer or else it would have been destroyed, \"You're going to pay for his tuition?!\"\nLouise and Aoki seemed to already know about this, so the two of them just stared at the conversation with blank expressions.\n\"Princess…\" the aura around Arthur became nauseating all of a sudden, it was one of the perks of [Focus]: the ability to sense the intentions of someone, and this meant that whatever the archer king wanted from him was no good, \"Of course it won't be free…\"\nStark raised an eyebrow, suspicious of Arthur's sudden generosity, \"And what do you want in return for paying my tuition fee?\" he asked cautiously.\nArthur chuckled, his blue eyes glinting with amusement, \"Actually nothing… but there is one small problem…\"\n'Here we go,' Stark sighed, he knew there was a twist.\nArthur placed a weird device that resembled a watch in the middle of the table, and after pressing on a button, several holographic pictures appeared.\n\"Rift Conqueror has no admission test, the only way to attend is to prove your worth,\" he began explaining, showing the image of a rift portal, \"And well… if you want to attend and for me to pay the tuition, you need to do one simple thing…\"\n\"And that is…?\"\nArthur grabbed one of the holographic pictures and increased its size, it was the picture of a cave in the middle of nowhere, and at the end of it… a closed rift could be seen.\n\"This rift was found recently…\" his tone became serious, almost as if he wanted to sell something to Stark.\n\"I can already see where this is going, you don't even need to tell me…\" Stark groaned and interrupted the archer king while he was still explaining.\n\"HEY ASSHOLE, DON'T INTERRUPT FATHER,\" Aoki suddenly took out his bow and pointed it at Stark.\nBut Stark wasn't impressed.\nThey had revealed their true intentions the moment the word academy and rift was spoken.\n\"…?\" Lana looked around, confused as to why the atmosphere had become like that.\n'They are using her relationship with me to trick her…' Stark internally laughed, they seemed like good parents, but oh well, he was wrong.\n\"So you want me to go to this rift and conquer it, that's what you want, don't you?\" Stark smirked as he slammed his fist against the table, but just using a bit of his aura was enough to crack the glass.\nArthur raised an eyebrow at the damage Stark had caused, but continued his explanation. \"Yes, that's correct. If you can conquer this rift, not only will you gain entry to the Rift Conqueror Academy, but you will also receive a generous sum of money for your trouble.\"\n\"So basically…\" the aura around Stark became overwhelming, he wasn't joking anymore, \"You want me to do YOUR dirty work =)?\"\n\"Dad, what is happening?\" Lana titled her head while asking her family, \"Why would you need Stark to do that…?\"\n\"Princess~ we just need to see if he is worthy of entering the academy, that is all!\"\nArthur without even waiting for Stark to say anything else pulled out the third holographic image, and on it he could see an arrow with a white heart at the edge of it, as well as a powerful aura surrounding it.\n\"We need you to bring the 'Arrows of Serria', that is all we ask,\" Arthur looked at Stark, \"And if you do that…\"\nHe clicked on a watch that was on his wrist, and a suitcase suddenly appeared on the cracked table, it was full of money, \"We will not only pay your tuition but also give you 5 million rher coins, meaning this is a 30 million rher coins mission.\"\n\"Go fuck yourself,\" Stark flipped him off with not a single moment of hesitation, he wouldn't be sold like that by money.\nIf he wanted, he could go to another rift by himself and get all the items he wanted to become rich, he didn't need all that bullshit.\nLana still seemed quite shocked of whatever just happened, \"Father! What the fuck is happening?\" she actually started to be mad, \"You ask MY friend to do your work?\"\nAnd although Stark was grateful to her for getting mad for him… he still decided to leave.\n\"It was nice to know you, Arthur,\" Stark got up from his chair and began heading toward the exit.\n\"Are you sure, kid? This rift may be more difficult than the one you previously went through, but it also means a greater chance to get experience.\"\n\"If I want experience i'll just go somewhere else, just hire somebody else to do the work, shouldn't be difficult with all the cash.\"\n\"Well… that is true, but the 'Arrows of Serria' are guarded by one of the 'Godless Demon's' apostles…\" Arthur scratched his chin, seemingly undisturbed by Stark's behavior.\n\"Quit it dad, Stark won't accept such a request!\" Lana crossed her arm.\nBut no… Stark stopped in his tracks as he had heard something that made him excited.\nThe reason was simple: that old man just mentioned a godless demon apostle.\nAnd that meant…\n'I need to complete the ApostleDex,' it was his chance to clear one of the remaining 13 squares.",

      "content": "Suddenly, Stark turned around and went to sit back on his chair again, \"I may be interested,\" he said, which brought a smile to Arthur, and a shocked expression to Lana's face.\nStark didn't want to be used for money or to get items, but oh boy he wouldn't let go of a chance to fight a godless demon apostle.\nAfter all he still had 13 more to defeat before completing his ApostleDex.\nAnd honestly, he REALLY wanted to complete it.\n'I can kill an apostle, get experience, money, and prove myself, this is a deluxe combo!'\nHis ego had been too big to accept it previously as it was straight up disrespectful, but now adding something that TRULY benefited him because it was unique meant he could go in without issues.\n\"Tell me all the information, old man,\" he sighed.\n\"I knew you wouldn't let me down, kid,\" Arthur smirked, seemingly thinking that money truly could buy anyone.\nMeanwhile, Lana just sighed, \"I really can't understand how you guys think...\"\nShe hadn't expected Stark to change his opinion after acting so offended, but maybe something interested him in her dad's speech.\nIn the end, she just stayed quiet and looked at Stark and her dad.\nThe latter clicked on the watch again, and another row of holographic images and text appeared.\n\"This watch has everything you need to know about your mission, bring us the arrows as proof that you completed it and we will respect our promises,\" Arthur slid the watch on the table, and Stark grabbed it with a swift motion.\n\"...\" he looked at the object for a few seconds.\nMaybe this was a trap, maybe he was making a mistake, but honestly, it was up to him to judge whether he wanted to go or not, so he accepted it.\n\"I guess that is all for now, the next time we meet is when you bring us those arrows,\" Arthur smiled and he pointed at the exit door.\n'Or never...' Stark thought as he smiled back, it was visible in the family's expression that there was a huge chance Stark wouldn't come back, yet they didn't seem to care.\n\"See ya...\" Stark waved from behind as he opened the diner room's door and left.\n\"O-oh, let me accompany him,\" Lana wanted to follow after him to talk, she honestly didn't like whatever was happening.\nBut...\n\"Sit down, dear,\" Louise, her mother, stopped her, \"It's rare we eat with the entire family present, let's take advantage of such a situation shall we not?\"\nIt was now clear that they didn't want her to approach him for now, so she just complied, and instead just hoped Stark would come out on top, like he always did until now.\n***\nStark found himself outside the mansion with the giant flickering moon at the entrance.\n'Of course they didn't even bother to hire someone to bring me back home, but oh well, i'm banned from the hotel so it's fine...'\nHe would need to find an apartment or somewhere else to stay, but he just wanted to read about the information he had gotten from Arthur for now.\nPublic places were out of the question since the watch's images and texts were displayed for anyone to see.\nAnd so he just decided to go in an empty alley in an empty street, then summoned one of his clones to watch the nearby surroundings, as there was only one way people could come in from.\nLuckily, there was nobody, and he was able to place the watch on the ground and activate it using a button on the side.\nAnd suddenly... all the information he needed appeared.\n…\n[Mission Rift:] Sierra's Death Path\n[Type:] One-Classifier Run\n[Difficulty:] Level 50-75 Nightmare-Level Rift\n[Note:] There is no information for this rift other than that it is a 'One-Classifier Run' type, meaning that only one classifier at a time can enter to attempt and beat it, seven people have been sent already, but none have come back since.\nWe have also been sent small messages by those inside before their demise, and they all usually said two sentences: \"Avoid the traps\" and \"Don't get hit by the arrows\".\n…\nThis was pretty much all, and the only other image Stark could see was the one with the cave, where the closed rift was in.\nBut he understood that it wasn't because it was closed that people couldn't enter, but because there was already someone inside (though they had died since obviously).\n\"One-Classifier Run\" are one of the most hated types of rifts ever, and most people don't even attempt to go through them if they didn't already know they had the level to beat them (and even that couldn't guarantee success).\nThis was harsh for Stark, but when he thought about it… it didn't change much.\nSince the beginning, even inside the Domination Trial, there were always people beside him, but when he tried to conquer the [City Ruins] and [Shadow Valley], he had done it completely alone.\nMeaning that such a rift wouldn't change his strategy much.\nOf course, the fact that the recommended level was 60-75, as well as the fact that it was Nightmare-Level meant it would be harder than anything else Stark attempted.\nBut somehow… he was still excited.\nHis training had helped him improve his movements, as well as unlock new perks for his abilities, but strangely enough, he felt confident.\nPlus he had gotten the 'Alchemist' class, meaning that he could use his potions to gain small advantages.\n'I need to stock up on ingredients…' he believed, already setting up his strategy.\nBut as soon as he did that…\nAnother giant panel came from the watch.\n[To the person reading this, this rift is set up in the mid-point to Olympia, which is the country next to Fellarburg, we have already reserved your train ticket, so you have until tomorrow to prepare!]\n'That means that… I'll be entering this rift by tomorrow night…' Stark let out a quick laugh, they had just told him and expected him to go do it so quickly?\nBut that also meant that by tomorrow night… he would enter his hardest rift yet.\n…\n(Back at the dining room of the Moonless Mansion)\n\"Father,\" Aoki spoke while grabbing a piece of meat, \"Do you believe that the boy will be able to bring the arrows and defeat the boss?\"\nThey had given him this mission since they believed he had a chance to complete it, but it was the same for the seven others, yet they had all failed.\nArthur didn't speak for a few seconds, then looked at his son with a smile on his face, \"It depends on the boy's skills…\"\n\"But if you were to gauge his chances, what survival rate would you give him,\" Aoki smiled back, seemingly just as sadistic as his father.\n\"Hm~\" Arthur scratched his chin, \"Although I do believe there is no such thing as luck in rifts… I think…\"\nHe kept thinking every few seconds, actively trying to analyze Stark's chance of survival.\nAnd once the entire family was looking at the head with their eyebrows raised.\nHe finally said it.\n\"I would give him a 6% chance of completing that rift…\" Arthur smiled before looking back at the plates before him.\n\"…?!\" hearing that, Lana was astonished, doesn't that mean they sent Stark to his death?\nAfter all… a 6% chance of survival was nothing!\n\"But oh well… you never know, he might surprise us…\" the Archer King shrugged before continuing to eat, his expression showing that he truly believed Stark would not come back, \"The ClassiTop event of Fellarburg is also happening in 3 weeks, so we might as well just forget about him if he doesn't come back in a week…\"\nAnd so just like that, the Moonless Family kept enjoying their meal (except for Lana).",

And why did the Moonless (a family of archer) want them so badly?\nOf course, it was always good to have different types of arrows as an archer, and even better to have unique ones with special perks.\nBut… what could they be…\nThe train ride seemed endless as Stark's mind raced with thoughts and questions about the mission ahead.\n[Time left before arrival: 2 hours 18 minutes]\nThe time passed smoothly, and Stark had nothing better to do than use his phone (wifi was included) or just check out his weapons and equipment.\n[Time left before arrival: 54 minutes]\nHe could hear the joyful talks and laughs of the people inside their cabins, or just on the train's public seats.\n'Lucky them…'\nAnd after a while…\nHe arrived at his destination.\n[You have arrived, leave the train…]\n'…' the closer he got to the rift, the bigger that feeling inside his stomach became, yet Stark, with a blank expression, still got up from his sit.\nBut that's when he realized… that the train was still going, and that there was still well over an hour of travel before arriving at the terminus station.\n'…' Stark's eyes widened as he realized what this meant, and his pupils slowly shifted back toward the watch as the screen changed.\n[Jump off the train, you have arrived.]\n'Sigh… this better be worth it,' he got out of his cabin, then headed toward the emergency exit, which was a door that you were only supposed to open if the train stops and there is an issue.\n\"Hello sir, what are you doing-\" an attendant smiled as she saw Stark, but that smile immediately vanished as Stark used his aura to forcefully kick the door, opening it abruptly.\n\"SIR, STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING?\" there was no danger for the passengers on board to open this door, the only real problem now was that he would need to jump from a speeding train that was going at 400KM per hour.\nOther passengers from rich and powerful families heard the commotion and came to see what was happening.\nBut Stark, not wanting to show his face more than he already had… suddenly jumped.\n\"SIR?????!!!\"\n\"WHAT THE FUCK?\" he heard them shout from behind, but the moment he jumped out, the train was already going so fast that he couldn't hear or see them anymore.\n~FWIP, THUD~\n\"-1837!\" he rolled on the ground as he took damage, but thankfully enough he was still relatively okay.\n[Good job on jumping! Now please follow the arrow!]\nAnd suddenly, another panel appeared in front of Stark, it was a 3D red arrow that was meant to show him where he was supposed to go.\n[Distance to Rift: 3.5KM]\nHe wiped the dust from his pants and shirt, then began walking toward the direction the arrow was pointing.\n'Let's get this over with…'",

Stark remembered something.\n[Distance to Rift: 100M]\n'Why would the watch ask me to advance cautiously when there is nothing-' he remembered the words he had seen on the watch.\nAnd suddenly...\n~BOOM~\nA crimson panel appeared in front of him as he heard the explosion ahead.\nCrimson meant that it was his own status window, not the watch's.\n[You have left the safe zone!]\nAnd at the same time...\n\"GREEAAAOORRR~~~\" he heard a giant roar, and a lizard-like creature at least 10 meters in size got out of the ground.\n[You are currently in a semi-danger zone (meaning only a few amounts of monsters will come out!)]\nThe lizard was big, with dark green shells and patterns all over its body, it had sharp teeth that already had saliva drooping from them after noticing the human.\n'...' Stark got ready to fight, the cave wasn't that far anymore, so as long as he could gain space slowly, he would reach his destination without any issues.\n[Name: Sneaky Lizard]\n[Level: 40]\n[HP: 54000]\n[Strength: 1127]\n[Stamina: 349]\n[Speed: 544]\n[Defense: 906]\n[Skills: Bite, Scale Armor, Lizard Call, Roar, Sonic Beam, Hide...]\n'...' it was alone, and its level was so low that it wasn't even a threat to Stark, even though he was only level 25.\n\"AURA SMASH,\" he sent his two fists toward the lizard, who obviously wasn't able to avoid thanks to its very low speed.\n~BOOM, BOOM~\n\"-32823! -34761!\"\nNeedless to say it didn't survive this attack.\n[You have slain one \"Sneaky Lizard lv40\", gained 36619EXP!]\n[Distance to Rift: 60M]\nHe was getting extremely close to the portal now, and he could already sense the crackling aura in the air that surrounded it, as well as that feeling that wanted him to head inside.\n[Distance to Rift: 40M]\nBut...\n~BOOM, BOOM, BOOM~\nA succession of explosions could be heard around him and...\n\"BITE!\" a lizard that was using the [Hide] skill to camouflage in the ground suddenly jumped toward Stark.\n\"Focus...\" but the boy calmly stepped to the left as he had seen that attack coming from a kilometer away.\n~PUNCH, PUNCH~\n\"-29837! -28904!\"\nTwo quick punches to the face ended the lizard's life before it could do anything else.\nBut by now, he was already surrounded by at least seven of them.\n'Sigh... let's get this over with...' he advanced toward the portal, now only 30 meters ahead of him, ready to get rid of those who had the balls to try and attack him.\n...\n[You have slain one \"Sneaky Lizard lv40\", gained 35829EXP!]\n[You have slain one \"Sneaky Lizard lv40\", gained 34914EXP!]\n[You have slain one \"Sneaky Lizard lv40\", gained 35976EXP!]\nOnly three of the lizards attempted to attack Stark, but they were all killed quite easily, resulting in the rest of them to not even approach the boy anymore.\n'It was not worth it' was what they thought, and so they all left.\n'...'

Nightmare-Level Rift]\n'Sure…' he sighed as he shook his head and began walking.\nIn comparison to the other rifts where there was somewhat of a safe zone at the beginning where he could gather with others.\nThis one was different, first of all since there was nobody else, but also because he was already placed inside of an area.\n[Level 65 Area: 'The Beginning of Death']\nThe silence was eerie, broken only by the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind.\nIn comparison to the forst inside of the 'Shadow Valley' though, it wasn't completely filled with trees, instead the stone path Stark was on didn't have any obstacles on it, meaning that he could advance safely, while the forest was on the edges.\nBut of course, it was a nightmare-level, it couldn't be this easy.\nAfter only taking 10 steps in the direction of the exit of the first area…\n~FWISH~\nBehind one of the dark trees near the stone path… appeared a white figure with black eyes.\n\"M…Moooveeee~\" it spoke in a spooky and distant voice, even though it was so close to Stark.\nThe figure's body was completely white, except for a pair of black wings, and its black eyes that seemed to absorb the light around them.\n'…' Stark stared at the figure for a few seconds, expecting it to be a monster he would have to fight.\nBut it didn't move.\n\"Perception…\" he activated his skill as he wanted to know what that was, its gaze on him making him feel uneasy for some reason.\n…\n[Name: Victim of Sierra]\n[Level: 65]\n[HP: 10000]\n[Strength: 1]\n[Stamina: 1]\n[Speed: 1]\n[Defense: 1]\n[Skills: Soul's Suckle, Despair…]\n…\nWithout delay, Stark assessed the situation.\nThe appearance of the 'Victim of Sierra' was perplexing, as its stats suggested it was a creature with no offensive capabilities, or any capabilities at all to be honest.\nHowever, Stark's instincts warned him that there was more to this encounter than it seemed.\n\"AURA SMASH,\" he sent one fist toward the monster, expecting it to die instantly thanks to his high damage against its low defense.\nBut…\nThe fist passed right through the ghostly creature, not even fazing it as it kept looking at Stark, the dark vortex of despair in its eyes not stopping.\n'Huh…' Stark decided to keep walking, if he can't hit it and it's not attacking there was no reason to try and fight it.\nBut… after taking three steps.\n~FWISH~\nAnother 'Victim of Sierra' appeared, peeking from yet another dark tree.\n'…?'\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWISH~\nIn a matter of seconds, dozens… no… HUNDREDS of 'Victims of Sierra' appeared from behind a tree one after the other.\nBy the end of their sudden appearance, every single tree around Stark had one of these monsters behind it, peeking at him.\nThe forest was now filled with an eerie atmosphere as the 'Victims of Sierra' surrounded Stark from all sides, their black eyes fixed on him.\nDespite their seemingly harmless appearance, a feeling of unease crept up Stark's spine as he realized the sheer number of these creatures that had materialized out of thin air.\nPlus he was in a nightmare-level rift, who could say they wouldn't suddenly be able to attack him?\nWhich was why Stark increased his cautiousness by a mile while he kept advancing through the stone path, just wanting to get out of this area as soon as possible.\nA few minutes passed… but nothing happened.\nMore 'victims' would keep appearing, yet none of them would do anything.\n[Don't get hit by the arrows]\nThis panel suddenly appered before him again, it was the phrase that all the previous classifiers who attempted to conquer this rift said.\nAnd the moment Stark turned his eyes toward the 'Victims of Sierra' again, making sure none of them had any weapons in hand…\n~SHHH… FWISH~\nIn the distance, the faint sound of an arrow cutting through the air reached Stark's ears thanks to [Focus] and its new ability to detect ambushes.\n[Avoid it]\nHe turned his gaze in the direction he felt the aura coming from, and right before his eyes was a white arrow with a white heart on its edge, a string of aura surrounding it.\n'It's… an 'Arrow of Sierra'!?' his eyes widened as he saw it so close to his face.\n[AVOID IT!]\nTime seemed to slow down as another panel suddenly appeared, doubling down on its warning.\nBut what scared Stark the most… was that it was not the end of it.\n[AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT AVOID IT]\nHundreds of crimson panels surrounded his view as the arrow got closer.\nHe had understood with the first one that he needed to make sure not to be touched, but after all of this… even being close wasn't an option.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" he rolled to the side, avoiding the arrow which passed right through him.\n'What the fuck…' he looked back at the ground where the arrow fell, and some sort of white mist was in its place as the arrow had exploded shortly after hitting the ground.\n[Do not inhale the mist, do not be touched by the arrow, or else…]\n'…?'\n[Game over]\nAnd suddenly, the panel disappeared as an arrow came shooting through it, appearing before Stark at an incredible speed.\n~DUCK~\nStark crouched to avoid the 'Arrow of Sierra' again.\n\"Perception!\" he tried to analyze the arrow before it fell to the ground, but it was too fast for him to discover anything.\nMeaning…\n'If I want to find out what these things are… I need to grab one while its in the air,' this was so risky that most people wouldn't do it.\nAnd this time, even Stark hesitated, he had done soem crazy stuff during his stay in this world, and risking his life to do something stupid wasn't that rare of an occurence for him now, and yet… this time for some reason he had a bad feeling.\nBut if he wanted to survive this rift, he would need to know everything about it and its traps.\nAnd so he took a deep breath, closing his eyes and waiting for the next arrow to come at him, wanting to sense its aura and thus sharpening his senses as it was too fast to even see it come.\n~FWISH~\nHe heard the subtle noise of the arrow being attached to the string, and then being fired in his direction by an unknown entity.\nThis time, it was either success ot failure, and he didn't even wanna think about kind of fate awaited him if he got hit or inhaled that white mist.\n'Come at me,' he opened his eyes suddenly as the arrow was centimeters away from his face, they were glowing with a crimson aura that indicated Stark was now more serious than ever.\nHe would get it, it's do or die now!",

Stark with lightning speed moved his right hand to grab the shaft.\nThis essentially stopped the arrow's momentum while it was now only millimeters away from piercing Stark between his two eyes.\n'Phew...' luckily, grabbing the arrow before it hit the ground or somebody didn't activate its perk, meaning that Stark was safe for now...\nWithout wasting a single second, he activated [Perception] and read the arrow's status panel to learn more.\n...\n[Item:] Arrow of Sierra\n[Type:] Arrow\n[Quality:] Perfect\n[Special Perk:] If this arrow hits you, you will be infected by the 'white mist' and slowly turn into a 'Servant of Sierra', basically... you'll become a monster, the mist infects your brain and breaks your mind to transform you.\n[Note:] There is no known cure or way to resist the 'Arrow of Sierra' once it hits you, so avoid it at all cost.\n...\n'Servant of Sierra...?' this was a different name than the 'Victims of Sierra', meaning that the latter must truly be monsters from this rift, while the servants would be humans that were hit.\n~FWISH~\nHe didn't have too much time to think about it though as not just one, BUT THREE arrows came rushing at him.\n'This little shit is really trying to get me...' Stark sighed as he avoided all three arrows by taking a few steps.\nIt seemed hard in the beginning, but now that he knew someone was trying to attack him, even when the arrows came from directions, he could still somehow sense and avoid them.\nPlus...\n[Avoid it]\nFocus on maximum level alert, so it would tell him every time an arrow was coming.\nStark stored the [Arrow of Sierra] inside of his [Spatial Inventory] to keep it safe, then began running through the first area.\nHe needed to get out of here quick since there was no saying these monsters behind the trees wouldn't attack, and adding that to the constant firing of arrows would be terrible.\nStark ran through the stone path as fast as he could, dodging arrows that came from the sky, the distance, from behind the trees and even sometimes from below.\nHe understood now that Hell-Level rifts and Nightmare-Level ones are different worlds apart, the latter being at least 5 to 10 times harder.\n[Keep going.]\nSometimes, the entity would fire up to 5 arrows at the same, in the hopes of tricking Stark, but he would comfortably avoid them all, or use [Invincible Dodge] when it was just too close.\nAnd after a few minutes of running through the path and forest that seemed stretch forever, with no end to it...\nStark encountered his first monster.\n\"...\" it didn't roar or do anything for it's entrance, instead it just jumped out of the right side of the forest with the 'Victims of Sierra', and blocked Stark's way.\nIt was a large beast, and in comparison to everything he had seen yet, its skin was completely dark/grey, with only its eyes being white, void of pupils.\n\"GRRAOOUUU~\" the wolf-like beast stepped forward.\n'Is it also under the influence of Sierra or just a normal monster...?'\n...\n[Name: White Moon's Werewolf]\n[Level: 65]\n[HP: 90000]\n[Strength: 1362]\n[Stamina: 1827]\n[Speed: 2174]\n[Defense: 891]\n[Skills: White Moon Transformation, White Claws, Beam Blast, Red Fury...]\n...\nAfter reading its name and status window, Stark instinctively looked up.\nThe sky was pitch black, its darkness looming over this entire rift.\nYet somehow... there was still light, and it was coming from...\nA giant white moon.\nIts edges were moving like waves, and it was so big that it must have been extremely close to the ground, the moon taking well over half of the space in the sky while still being up.\n'Werewolf of the white moon huh...' Stark mumbled, after all it was indeed a full moon currently.\nThe white moon was the complete opposite of the black sun it seemed, as it didn't try to corrupt you.\nInstead...\n~FWISH~\n\"WHITE CLAWS!\" the werewolf suddenly dashed toward Stark while he was observing the location of the next arrow.\nStark spotted the arrow coming at him, and at the same time, with the calmest of expressions, summoned his crimson spears and sent them toward the monster, not even looking at it.\n~DASH, DASH~\nThe werewolf avoided the first two spears by dashing to the sides, but Stark predicted that and placed the final one right in front of the werewolf while it was still avoiding the first two.\n\"-25727!\" it hit it in the face, exploding one of its eyes and leaving a visible hole on its head.\n\"...\" meanwhile Stark used this momentum to spin and catch a second 'Arrow of Sierra' in mid-air, 'The moment I catch who's sending these... they're dead...' he groaned.\n\"RED FURY!\" the wolf had been humiliated, and so it used another skill, making its last remaining eye burn with a crimson aura, there were no pupils so it looked like it was just set on fire.\nAnd then...\n\"BEAM BLAST!\" it opened its mouth, charging up a white attack that was on the verge of exploding.\nIt grew more and more after each second, and it was almost as if the monster... was sucking up the power of the 'Victims of Sierra' since the trail of aura that powered up the beam came from them.\n~FWIIISHHHSHHH.... BOOOOOOM!!!~\nThe werewolf its attack, its whole body visibly suffering from using it.\nThis was an extremely powerful attack, yes, but in exchange, the werewolf would have to feel a lot of pain too.\n'...' Stark sighed as he avoided yet another arrow, 'CLONE FRENZY!'\nHe wanted to end this quickly, as frankly, these arrows were beginning to seriously annoy him.\n\"Let's go, me\" Stark pointed at the werewolf and its beam while summoning one of his clones, which immediately understood the situation.\nAnd so the two dashed toward the wolf, planning on facing the beam that could one-shot them both head on.",

      "content": "The beam of the werewolf was way more deadly than anything a mere level 65 mob could ever hope to achieve, meaning that there was some other power at hand, something much more powerful that aided it to become much stronger than it should be.\nOr maybe it was just since he was in a Nightmare-Level rift?\n~CRASH, BOOM~\nThe trees, the path, anything that came in contact with the beam, which seemed to never stop, would be destroyed.\nEven the 'Victims Of Sierra' seemed to disappear when hit by the attack, although Stark believed that was only because the trees they were behind were cut.\nBut even through that…\n~FWISH~\nA multitude of arrows would still be coming at him and his clone, forcing them not only to avoid the beam at a hair length each time, but also put themselves at risk to not get hit by the arrows which could transform them into monsters.\nYet, Stark noticed something: after every 10 second, the beam would diminish and flicker, meaning that the werewolf was gathering energy back.\nAnd Stark would use that opportunity.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" his clone sent two fists at the werewolf, who easily avoided them.\n[Red Fury] seemed to greatly enhance its speed, allowing it quite easily avoid both fists and spears the two Stark sent at him.\n'Why is this fodder monster actually putting a challenge…?' of course, without the [White Beam], it would of died in less than ten seconds, but now it was actually getting annoying.\nPlus, the fact the wolf was moving its head randomly, not even caring about aiming for Stark or the clone, meant that they were at higher risk of being hit.\n~BOOM, FWISH~\nThe werewolf swung its head, resulting in the beam rushing at Stark.\n'…' he was forced to crouch down as the beam passed above it.\nBut at that very moment…\nAn arrow was fired, one he hadn't heard or been able to see early since he was too occupied with the wolf.\n'SHIT SHIT SHIT,' he shouted as he saw it right in front of him.\nBut…\n[Wings perk, activated!]\n'DASH!' he flapped [Judicator's Black Wings] in the opposite direction, granting him a boost and allowing him to move from the arrow's path.\n'Ok, now this is annoying,' he gritted his teeth and looked at the werewolf with his eyes full of aura, 'I'm ending this shit.'\nHe opened his [Spatial Inventory] and pulled out a [Potion of Speed] from it, then gulped it down, giving him a 10% speed boost.\nAnd so without even caring about the beam… he dashed toward the wolf.\nThe werewolf, surprised by Stark's bold move, tried to redirect its beam towards him but failed as Stark swiftly evaded it.\nThe clone followed close behind, providing a distraction for the monster.\nAnd before the werewolf could even realize what was happening, Stark was already behind it.\n\"Goodbye,\" the boy smiled before grabbing the wolf's jaw and closing its mouth while the beam was still being used.\n~BOOOOOMM~\n\"-93872!\" the wolf's head exploded instantly after being hit by its own attack.\n'At least I know how to get rid of them easily now…' he had found their weaknesses, now they wouldn't be an issue in the future.\n[You have slain \"White Moon's Werewolf lv65\", gained 71982EXP!]\n[Experience: 223711/500000]\nHe still had a long way before leveling up, but for now, his goal was to reach level 30 by the end of this rift, it shouldn't be that hard after all if each monster would give him around 70K experience, although he couldn't promise that the amount of experience needed wouldn't increase way too much for him to reach.\n[Speed (+10%) effect: 3:48 remaining]\nHe summoned back his clone, avoided another 'Arrow of Sierra' more easily than before, then began dashing forward, really wanting to get out of this first path, since it had already been a nightmare (heh) for him even though he had only fought one enemy.\n'I SEE IT,' after running for a few more minutes, he finally saw the end of the path in the distance as the forest suddenly stopped, there was still around a kilometer of running, but he was close.\nAnd yet, as if to mock his hopes and dreams… the rift summoned more problems to fuck him over.\n\"GAROUUU~\" not one, not two, hell not even 5, but 8 'White Moon Werewolves suddenly appeared from behind the trees and blocked Stark's path.\nSome also appeared from behind, and the rest stared at him from the darkness of the forest, ready to strike the moment they saw an opportunity that could end the human's life in one blow.\nBut they weren't the only enemy… as another type of monster appeared: the 'Shadow Stalkers'.\nThey were creatures that lurked in the darkness, with glowing red eyes and razor-sharp teeth, they had human figures, but no head, instead… their entire torso was replaced by a giant mouth and a pair of eyeballs were located inside of that same mouth.\n'Disgusting…' Stark stepped back while activating [Perception].\n…\n[Name: Shadow Stalkers]\n[Level: 64]\n[HP: 40000]\n[Strength: 1371]\n[Stamina: 1927]\n[Speed: 1473]\n[Defense: 1780]\n[Skills: Devouring Darkness, Shadow Meld, Morph, Assemble (STRONG TRANSFORMATION), Shadow Limbs…]\n…\nCounting them all, Stark noticed there was 5 of them, each hiding in the darkness of the forest as well, it was in their names after all, and they seemed to be more of the 'ambush' type.\n'Final battle before I can get away of this shithole…' Stark sighed while summoning one of his clones and also avoiding another arrow.\nIt had actually become muscle memory for him to avoid these arrows, and he didn't even bother to act annoyed anymore with them being sent relentlesly.\n~FWISH~\nHis clone also avoided the arrows quite easily, only moving its head to the right when one came rushing at it.\nBut now… he needed to face against the 14 monsters surrounding him.\n'…' the clone got in position before he did, and he followed right after.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" he sent two fists at two 'Shadow Stalkers' that were hiding in the distance, maybe believing that he couldn't see them, but too bad, Stark could see auras.\n~BOOM, BOOM~\n\"-33847! -34982!\"\nBoth were hit from the attack, taken aback as they didn't expect the human to be able to detect them.\nBut this wasn't enough to kill them, even with their low HP compared to all other monsters their level.\n'At least I know two of them only need one more attack…' he smiled.\nAnd now that he had attacked… all the other monsters rushed at him.\n\"WHITE CLAWS, RED FURY, WHITE BEAM!\"\nThree of the wolves used [White Claws] and rushed at Stark and his clone, also activating [Red Fury] to increase their speed, while the rest all immediately activated [White Beam].\nAnd this meant… that 6 of the werewolves had opened their mouth, charging up their deadly attacks.\nEven Stark knew that this was bad, he wouldn't be able to avoid 6 beam coming at him from all directions, all of their powers being charged by the hundreds of 'Victims of Sierra' in the forest.\nAnd so that meant… he needed to find a solution in the following ten seconds, or it would be over.",

Stark smiled, after all these monsters had deliberately moved close to each other in hopes of taking Stark aback with the sheer amount of beams.\n[Heaven's Wrath] was truly an incredible attack, being able to kill all these things in three seconds was a feat many classifiers can't achieve after all.\nAnd the best thing of all... IT WAS STARK'S CLONE THAT USED IT! Meaning that the original body still had his saved up.\nBut of course, this didn't mean he could relax.\n\"WHITE CLAWS!\" the three werewolves that were rushing at him didn't stop, instead jumping in the air as their claws began to glow with an otherworldly white aura, it was probably the moon that powered them up so much.\n~FWISH~\nHe avoided the attack of one of the wolves, its speed thanks to [Red Fury] almost allowing it to hit him.\nAnd as for the clone... well...\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" it was a 'lesser' version of Stark, so it was forced to roll away after the first attack.\nBut... the second werewolf also attacked it, maybe it was bad luck, or maybe they sensed that its HP was low?\nIn the end...\n~SLASH~\n\"-19371!\"\nThe werewolf's claws slashed the clone's body into three pieces, and it seeped back into the original Stark.\n'...'\nNot wasting any time, Stark summoned his three spears, and sent them toward the wall farthest from him.\n\"WHITE CLAW!\" another one obviously tried to attack Stark, but he saw it coming and...\n~BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM~\nHe avoided the attack then kicked it in the stomach before finishing it with three quick attacks to the face, leaving it with no time to breath or do anything.\n\"-29837! -32914! -31098! -33110!\"\nIt obviously killed it, and as for the spears...\n~FWISH, PIERCE, PIERCE~\nIt avoided the first one, but unfortunately slipped and received the other two straight on, the first piercing its stomach and the second its neck.\n\"-18272! -37927!\" the one in the neck obviously did more damage.\nBut at the same time... the one wolf that had been spared from [Heaven's Wrath] finally charged up its beam and...\n~BOOM~\nIt shot it intensely at Stark, who was busy defending himself against the other wolves and also avoiding another arrow.\n~FLAP~\nUnder normal circumstance, he should have been hit, but [Judicator's Wings] automatically used [Dash] to get him out of the beam's way, saving his life.\n~PUNCH~\n\"-32751!\" he ended the life of the werewolf that had been hit by his spears in a single blow, sending it flying against one of the trees, scaring one of the white figures behind it.\nAnd so that reduced the amount of monsters to 2 [White Moon Werewolves] and 5 [Shadow Stalkers], there were still many of them in view (not counting the 'Victims of Sierra' as they did nothing), but Stark was still confident.\nThe latter were doing absolutely nothing , instead their giant mouths were just contorting into a creepy smile as their dark bodies shook, they seemed to be... celebrating?\n'Shit...' he ducked to avoid the beam.\nBut surprisingly...\n~BOOOOM~\nThe other werewolf, which had been running around Stark, was hit by the beam as it tried to jump at its prey, and its entire body exploded.\n\"-99999!\" it obviously immediately died.\nThe other monster didn't seem to care about killing its companion as it continued to randomly aim its head in different directions.\n\"AURA SMASH!' at the same time, Stark shot two crimson fists at the 'Shadow Stalkers', he didn't like the fact they were smiling and celebrating so vividly.\nBut...\n\"DEVOURING DARKNESS!\" the two monsters that had been aimed by the attack suddenly activated a skill and morphed their body, placing their giant mouths in front of the giant fists.\n'...?'\n~GULP, GULP~\nAnd they actually ate them.\n'??????' Stark was confused.\nThen only a few moments later, the Shadow Stalkers that ate his attack began to lick their mouths with their pitch-black tongues.\nIt was frankly disgusting.\nStark really wanted to sit down and think deeply about what he had just witnessed, but no time for that since the werewolf was still firing the beam.\nAnd as for how the 'Shadow Stalkers' survived the deadly beam while it was hitting them constantly... well... they also just ate it, their big mouths absorbing the white ray as if it was the most delicious thing in the universe.\nStark did notice by their expressions that they prefered his crimson attacks though.\nHe decided not to send any more attacks at them as it was a waste of time, he would deal with them later.\n\"Now, werewolf, it's time to die,\" Stark cracked his neck and smiled at the werewolf as it kept shooting the beam.\nThe 'Shadow Stalkers' and 'Victims of Sierra' were pretty much just spectator to the fight for now, and so Stark planned to give them a good show.\n~FWISH~\nWith incredible speed, he dashed toward the werewolf, using his wings and flapping them once to give him a boost in the air, allowing him to momentarily float.\nAnd just like that… Stark was now behind of the werewolf.\nIt tried to turn its head, but… Stark grabbed its neck and locked it in place using his amazing strength.\nNow it was done for.\n\"Bye bye,\" the boy manically smiled as he slowly began to close the werewolf's mouth, enjoying its panic as it knew what the human was doing.\nThen… he closed it.\n~BOOM~\nThe head obviously exploded, and its remains were splattered all over the floor, and some blood even ended up on Stark's shirt and face.\n'Blergh…' he was disgusted.\nBut at this very moment ,as if they had been waiting for Stark to finish off the werewolves…\nThe [Shadow Stalkers] stepped out of the darkness, revealing their grotesque bodies and mouths, but this time, they weren't celebrating anymore, instead they looked amused, and ready to fight.\n'Phew… I knew this couldn't be easy,' Stark now knew why so many classifiers had died in this place before.",

Stark's eyes widened and he took a step backward the moment that panel appeared before him, he hadn't used [Perception] at all, but it just automatically appeared, just like it did when he met a boss/mini-boss/elite, meaning that it was the real deal.\nHe instinctively activated his [Domination] aura in case a battle would break, but he was sure nothing major would happen since he wasn't at the boss area.\n'Sierra', the boss of the rift, was a woman (or at least it had a woman's body), long white hair, and a blue/white long dress, as well as 'snowflake' earrings and crystal blue eyes.\nShe was very beautiful, and her overall aura could be described with one word: chilly.\nIn her hand was a white bow, an arrow attached to it, and she was holding it with her two hands, smiling at Stark.\nAnd then…\n~FWISH, PAW~\nAt lightning speed, she pointed the bow at Stark then shot the arrow at him.\n\"Invincible Dodge!\" he rolled to the site since at this distance, it was hard to avoid it, even with the wings.\n\"Hahahahaha~\" Sierra laughed, \"Looks like you're really good at avoiding things~ better than the 7 others at least,\" she mocked.\nSuddenly, she stopped grabbing the bow with one of her hands and…\n\"Sierra Arrows!\" she used one of her skills to create an [Arrow of Sierra] in the hand that was now free, a cold aura enveloping her and seeping into her hand to form into the shape of the arrow with the white heart at the edge of it.\n'She can create as many of them as she wants,' Stark understood now, and it was terrifying to think about.\nAnd so just like that, Stark was in front of the final boss while still being only at the mid-part of the rift.\n\"Haha kid~ show me what you've got, alright?\" Sierra laughed as she pointed her bow at Stark again.",

was too arrogant.\"\n\"…\"\nStark tried to use [Perception] on Sierra to check out her skills and overall stats, but…\n[You are not allowed to check this monster's stats yet!]\nA crimson panel came to stop him.\n'Fuck you…' he didn't abandon, and instead pushed through, opening his eyes wider, they were filled with determination.\nIf he was to fight this monster right now, he was sure that he would die without knowing of her stats, HP, or skills, after all they were things that always helped him predict what they would do.\nPlus it also cleared the fear of not knowing whether a monster has more skills or not, since he could already check all their names beforehand.\nAnd so… as Stark pushed through that warning, he was granted two pieces of information.\n…\n[Name: Sierra, the Crystal Archer (BOSS)]\n[Level: 80]\n[HP: 315000]\n[Strength: ???]\n[Stamina: ???]\n[Speed: ???]\n[Defense: ???]\n[Skills: ???]\n…\nHe was allowed to see her level and HP, which was more than any other monster he had encountered yet, but all other info was hidden from him.\n\"Quit glaring at me like that~\" Sierra maniacally smiled and took a step forward.\nImmediately, Stark answered that simple move by two skills of his.\n\"AURA SMASH, CRIMSON SPEARS,\" he sent all 5 attacks at the archer, who just smiled.\n\"Crystal Shield,\" she grabbed the arrow that was in her hand and with lightning speed poured out a different aura inside of it, changing the shape from a heart to a circle.\nThen… she pointed her bow down, toward the ground next to her feet and shot the arrow.\n~BOOM~\nInstantly, the moment the arrow hit the ground, a crystal wall appeared in front of Sierra, blocking all 5 of the attacks.\n~BOOM, BOOM, BOOM~\n~CRACK~\nOf course, the wall cracked and crumbled, but it had still protected her.\n\"Attacking me while I'm only approaching you~\" she tried to act cute, \"That's really mean!\"\n\"Quit the act, you're too old to do that sort of shit,\" Stark answered, not breaking his fighting position, but still finding a way to shoot something at her, although it wasn't physical.\n\"O-Old?!\" Sierra looked surprised for the first time, \"I don't look old at all!\"\nAnd before Stark could even say anything else…\n~FWISH, PAW, PAW, PAW!~\n\"Arrow Barrage!\" Sierra pointed her bow at Stark and began to shoot dozens of arrows toward him, each time she shot one, another would instantly materialize, and her movements were too fast for the naked eye to discern.\n'FAST!'\nStark couldn't dodge them all, but his upgraded [Focus] allowed him to anticipate the incoming arrows and adjust his movements accordingly.\nHe grabbed three arrows that were heading toward his face with simple movements of his hands, while he avoided the rest using his speed.\nThen he began to run in circles around Sierra, it was the only way to constantly avoid the arrows as being too close meant less time to dodge.\n\"No point in trying, boy~ just give up~~\" Sierra seemed to mock him, not stopping her barrage of arrows at the boy.\n\"…\"\n\"You know~ I really enjoyed seeing the faces of the seven others as they were transformed into beasts~\" she mocked.\n\"…?\" Stark didn't stop running, but his pupils' aura grew stronger.\n\"They will never see their families again, forced to be stuck in this place with me for all eternity, until I am able to escape that is of course, and I will some day, just like all the other apostles who are still alive!\" Sierra laughed, still shooting arrows at Stark.\n\"…\"\n[Do not be angry.]\nEach arrow that was sent at him, and each word Sierra uttered, only served as fuel to his aura, and it was increasing more and more.\nStark knew that even with all the power he had, he was still weak compared to many other people and monsters, but he still needed to keep going.\nIf one arrow could transform him into a monster, and if there was no way for him to leave… then he just needed to win.\n\"Aura Smash!\" he sent two fists at the archer.\nBut…\n~FWISH~\nIn response, Sierra shot two arrows at the crimson fists, and the moments these arrow hit, the two fists turned white and vanished.\n\"None of your attacks will work,\" Sierra continued in her speech, just like the villain she was.\n\"Crimson Spears!\" he sent three spears, they were shorter than the fists so he thought they would be able to hit.\nBut…\n~PAM, PAM, PAM~\nWith expert precision, Sierra shot down the three spears, not missing a single one of them.\n\"They don't call me the 'Expert Archer' for no reason!\" she boasted, puffing out her chest.\n'You're too prideful…' Stark's aura was growing more and more, and he was becoming annoyed.\n\"Those 7 adventurers that came here were all transformed into monsters… how sad…\" Sierra giggled, \"Five of them instantly got hit at the start since they didn't expect it…\"\n'…'\n\"…And the two others traversed the forest, but once they reached me… THEY ALL TURNED INTO BEASTS!\" she maniacally laughed.\n'…'\n\"And do you want to know the best thing about all of it?\" she stopped shooting Stark for a few seconds, pointing her slender hand at him while he was still running in circles.\nBy this point, Stark was at his limit, and the aura that surrounded his body was so overwhelming that even he had a difficult time containing it: he hated when monsters talked so arrogantly.\nWhat Sierra said next… was the final straw.\n\"One of the adventurers was a woman… and after she began to transform into a beast, her body beginning to crystallize and turn white, do you know what she did?\" Sierra's smile grew so wide it was scary.\n'Kill…'\n\"She PLEADED, not for herself, but for her UNBORN CHILD, HAHAHAHA~\" Sierra laughed and laughed, thinking that she was on top of the world.\n'Ok,' Stark understood everything, he wasn't even mad about the woman actually, but just tired of Sierra's attitude, and so…\n~BAM, FWISH~\nIn a fraction of a second, he was right in front of Sierra, his fist centimeters away from her face.\n\"As I thought, you need to die quick,\" he sighed, his face hidden by his aura, and making him look as terrifying as ever before.",

Sierra couldn't avoid this attack, it was too fast.\n~BOOOOOOOMM!!!~\nThe explosion of Stark's fist on Sierra's face was deafening, and the entire rift shook by it.\n\"-69382!\" the damage output was also beyond anything a mere level 26 could achieve.\n[Sierra HP: 245618/315000]\nShe wouldn't die from this, but she was sent very far away, and the impact was so strong that she even traversed three of the giants trees inside the clearing, breaking their trunks and making them fall.\nHer face was a bloody mess, a few teeth were broken, her mouth was bleeding, and her nose was probably broken.\nThe only thing that was fairly intact were her eyes, and that was only since they were more resistant than the rest.\nHer bow still in hand, Sierra immediately got up, she still retained her consciousness, and all she needed to get rid of the human was one simple arrow touching him.\n\"You... you monster...\" she whispered, her voice barely audible as she looked ahead, seeing Stark slowly approach.\n\"You won't do it again,\" was all that Stark said, his aura pulsating around him.\n'I- I can't shoot any arrow, it won't hit…' she had pointed her bow at him, but she didn't even have the confidence to shoot anything anymore.\nNo… it wasn't that she lost her confidence… it's just that she saw she couldn't win against Stark in his current state.\n'I'm out of here,' she gritted her teeth, running away was humiliating, but it was better to run and survive than be arrogant and die.\n\"ARROW ESCAPE!\"\nSierra grabbed an arrow, then transformed its edge using her aura, going from a heart to a triangle.\nThen she shot it down and disappeared in a blur of motion.\n\"See you at the end, human,\" she wasn't smiling anymore, her face cold: it was an invitation, and she awaited Stark at the boss area.\nAnd just like that, she was teleported to the place she was supposed to be in since the beginning.\n'…' Stark didn't care that she ran away as they would meet up again soon enough, he couldn't leave this rift until killing her and getting that stack of arrows after all.\nThe aura around his body was slowly beginning to dissipate, but he still walked toward the cave, as calm as ever.\nThat anger he had just felt was completely different from his normal self, but he didn't really dislike it since it allowed him to become stronger.\nBut as soon as Sierra disappeared and he began walking toward the cave… he heard rustling in the leaves of the giant trees, their shadows casting a sickly green glow over the clearing's floor.\nHe stopped in his tracks, his senses tingling as he knew that something was off, then he looked up.\nAnd suddenly…\n~SCREECH, CRASH~\nA bunch of monsters jumped from all the nearby trees, attempting to stop Stark in his tracks.\nThey had been hiding inside since the beginning, just waiting for the human to pass to possibly trap him.\nThere were three types of monsters: the first were green-skinned, scaly beasts with sharp claws and a venomous bite, they looked like chameleons but more aggressive.\nThe second were brown monkeys with branches coming out from many parts of their bodies, they were rather tall, standing at around 3 meters.\nAnd the third were vicious squirrels, of course much bigger than normal ones, they had red eyes and their skin was completely dark, they looked like demons and they were thirsty for bloods.\n'Perception…' Stark, knowing that he would have to fight lots of them before reaching the cave, activated his skill to check out all their panels.\n…\n[Name: Aggre-Meleon (get it?)]\n[Level: 68]\n[HP: 82000]\n[Strength: 1479]\n[Stamina: 1734]\n[Speed: 1327]\n[Defense: 1231]\n[Skills: Poisonous Bite, Claw Attack, Camouflage, Tongue Launch, Hypno-Eyes…]\n…\n[Name: Branch Monkey]\n[Level: 66]\n[HP: 76000]\n[Strength: 1827]\n[Stamina:1373]\n[Speed: 789]\n[Defense: 1501]\n[Skills: Monkey Charge, Parkour, Jungle Roar, Grapple, Spiky Body…]\n…\n[Name: Demonic Squirrel]\n[Level: 69]\n[HP: 91000]\n[Strength: 1298]\n[Stamina: 1883]\n[Speed: 1903]\n[Defense: 874]\n[Skills: Small Bite, Pounce, Demon Tail, Blood Eyes, Shadow Dodge…]\n…\nStark sighed, seeing that he would have to face this entire array of monsters.\nWithout hesitation, he readied himself for the fight, since even though the aura from his anger was slowly dissipating, some of it was still there, and he had lots of frustration he wanted to take out on those things.\nIt was pretty convenient so many monsters had come as they would become his punching bags.\nLooking around him, he noticed at least 18 monsters, 6 from each kind.\n'Clone Frenzy,' he summoned his clone next to him, and it immediately got into position.\nHe was surrounded and outnumbered, but it didn't really matter.\n'Aura Smash!' both Stark sent four crimson fists toward a group of four 'Branch Monkeys' since they were the slowest monsters and also regrouped.\n~BOOM, BOOM!~\n\"-31824! -34827! -21380! -23019!\"\nTurns out this was the right choice since two of them immediately them from the impact, and the other ones inside the group also received a bit of damage since [Aura Smash] was an attack that hit its surroundings too.\n[Enemies Stunned]\nBoth 'Branch Monkeys' had been stunned, and so Stark and his clone immediately rushed to finish the job before the other monsters could attack.\nStark's anger was still there, deep inside of him, but his expression was neutral and cold: all he wanted was to enter that cave, traverse the final area, and meet with Sierra again.\nBut this time… he would make sure to annihilate her for good.\n~PUNCH, PUNCH~\n\"-38371! -34827!\" after two quick punches from each Stark, the two stunned 'Branch Monkeys' died.\nThen they turned toward the remaining 14 monsters, who all began to rush at them.\n'Let's get this over with,' they positioned themselves again.",

-39482! -40301!\" all three pierced its head, and it did immense damage not only because its defense was low, but also since its head seemed to be its weakness, a single spear hitting its brain would be enough.\n\"Monkey Charge,\" seeing that their roar did nothing, the two remaining 'Branch Monkeys' used their boost in attack to rush at Stark.\nBut he didn't even bother to avoid it.\n~CRASH~\nHe took in the two monsters by himself, stopping them with one hand each, and even though he was pushed back for a bit, he still retrieved the advantage.\n\"AURA SMASH,\" the clone, while still avoiding the squirrels, sent two fists at the two monkeys to aid its owner.\n~BOOM, BOOM~\n\"-32762! -37265!\" each of them received damage, in addition to the after-shock from both attacks damaging the other one too.\n[Enemy stunned]\nNow that one of them was gone, Stark easily overpowered the second.\n\"SPIKY BODY,\" but the monkey didn't want to get beaten by a human, after all it was supposed to be strong!\nA wooden spike came out of its chest and headed toward Stark, it was a surprise attack and the speed was so great that it would have been difficult for many to avoid it from this clone.\n~FWISH~\n'Holy, that was close,' but Stark managed to move his head at the last second, 'Almost got me…'\n'Gulp…' the monkey looked at Stark, it had failed to kill the human with its final strategy.\n~PUNCH, PUNCH~\n\"-31731! -32730!\"\nHe punched its head two times successfully, resulting in it immediately falling to the ground.\nThen without wasting anytime, he jumped in the air using the momentum of the first monkey falling, span around, and kicked the second who was stunned before finishing it with crushing its head.\n\"-34632!

five notifications…\n[You have upgraded 'Domination' to level 15 (Bronze-Tier Max)!]\nBut of course, reached a new milestone also meant… a new perk!\n…\n[Skill: Domination lv15]\n[New Perk: Dominated Status]\n[Description:] This new perk doesn't serve much purpose under normal circumstances, but if during a battle, the user somehow manages to turn the tides against an enemy stronger than they are, and their aura increases by that, there is a chance that the enemy will receive the 'Dominated' status.\nThe 'Dominated' status reduces defense and movements, and gives the user a 10% stat boost against the dominated enemy.\n[Note:] When entering a battle against an enemy weaker than you are, or if the enemy in itself fears your aura, there is also a chance they receive the 'Dominated' status, further reducing their chances of victory against the person they feared =)\n…\n'Holy…' Stark scratched his chin, his eyes burning with excitement.\nIf he had gotten this perk before, then he was confident his anger against Sierra would have guaranteed for her to get the 'Dominated' status.\nIn the end, the basis of this perk worked if, and only if the enemy before Stark suddenly became more wary/scared of him, otherwise it was useless.\nWith that in mind, Stark moved on to the three other skill points he had.\n[You have upgraded 'Double Assault' to level 5!]\n[You have upgraded 'Aura Smash' to level 8!]\nWith this… he had everything he needed, but the fact 'Double Assault' reached level 5 also meant a new perk on it as well…\n…\n[Skill: Double Assault lv5]\n[New Perk: Double Impact]\n[Description: When using 'Double Assault', there is a very small chance that each attack will count as two hits (deadly), causing double the damage, but also double the status effect or knock back on your opponent.]\n[Note: a crimson replica of yourself (much like the clones) will temporarily appear to deal the second attack, then will disappear right afterward]\n…\n'I don't know the chance, but it must be very low,' Stark mumbled as he closed all the panels and began heading toward the cave.\nHe heard rustling in the leaves while passing the dozens of giant trees scattered throughout the clearing, but none of the monsters jumped out for some reason.\nHe would have seriously enjoyed checking out that 'Dominated' status on the monsters, but oh well, he will see later.\n[Alchemy Inventory: x20 Potion of Strength, x19 Potion of Speed, x38 Potion of Regeneration]\nHe hadn't used his potions much since it was difficult in the heat of such situations, but maybe he should begin to drink them before the battle?\nThinking of that, and while still heading toward the cave, Stark pulled out four potions: 2 of strength, and 2 of speed, holding them with his hands.\nHe was confident no monster would attempt to attack him, so he didn't even bother to free his hands.\nAnd so just like that, he managed to reach the entrance of the rock/crystal cave.\nThe walls were made out of gray solid rock, but all around these very same walls were hundreds upon hundreds of white crystals, glinting in the darkness.\nThey were [Crystals of Sierra], and they were used to make those arrows, Stark guessed that's why Sierra was called the 'Crystal Archer' in her boss name.\nThe cave seemed to go down into a very long and dark tunnel, and so before heading inside of the final area of this rift…\nStark opened up all four bottles in his hands, then began gulping down all their contents.\nHe had wondered if drinking two potions of the same type at the same time would mean an increase in stat boosts.\nBut…\n[+10% strength for 10 minutes]\n[+10% speed for 10 minutes]\nIt would be too op, so instead stacking up potions meant that the effect time you had would go up.\nHe had drunk 2 potions of strength, and each was supposed to give him 5 minutes of strength boost, so drinking two meant 10 minutes, if he drank 5 it would have been 25 minutes, etc…\n'Interesting… but I need to find new recipes or buy them…' he mumbled as he finally entered the cave.\n[Level 75 Area: 'The Crystal Cave']\nThe darkness within the cave was almost suffocating, but the faint, silvery-white light that came from the crystals illuminated his path slightly.\nHe went down, and now before him was a giant tunnel that seemed to endlessly stretch forward.\nNo monsters in sight, nothing.\nStark carefully moved along the tunnel, his senses heightened and his eyes scanning the darkness for any signs of movement.\nBut of course, it wouldn't be this easy, it couldn't be.\nNo matter what…\n~FWISH~\nIn the distance, Stark saw a flash of light rush at him at intense speed, like a bolt of lightning.\n'…' Without hesitation, he prepared to defend himself.\nAnd so using [Focus] and his boost in speed, Stark grabbed the [Arrow of Sierra] that had been sent to him as it was centimeters away from his face.\n'She doesn't give up, does she…' he sighed, and noticed that the many more flashes of lightning were coming, 'Is she struggling because she knows she is about to die? Or does she really believe she can hit me and win?'\nWith a swift movement, Stark dodged an arrow, then another, and a third one.\n\"ARROW BARRAGE!\" from the safety of her boss chamber, Sierra used her archer eyes to keep sending dozens upon dozens of arrows at him.\nIn such a case, the human was totally overwhelmed, and even though there seemed to be no monsters, the sole fact that the boss was targeting was already enough.\nA Nightmare-Level rift wasn't only described as such because of its high difficulty, or because there were strong monsters there, but many other factors played a huge part in it: its size, its category, the unfairness and how likely someone was to clear it were also factors.\nAnd in this case… it was because a single arrow could send you to your death that it was this hard, and why so many people failed before.\nBasically… it was really unfair.\nBut…\n'How is it gonna work on me if i'm faster,' Stark's eyes glew with a blue aura as the speed potion took effect, increasing Stark's speed, and allowing him to easily avoid all the attacks that were sent at him.\n\"Just you wait Sierra…\" he grinned as he ran through the tunnel.",

      "content": "Sierra's eyes widened as she saw Stark narrowly avoiding her arrows that were being scattered in all possible directions in the tunnel, hoping for just one of them to hit his shoulders or any part of his body at all.\nShe clenched her fists and whispered, \"Not today, human…\"\n~FWISH, FWISH~\n'I just need one…'\n~FWISH~\n'Just one arrow is enough to end this…'\n~FWISH~\n'PLEASE!'\nMuch like Judicator, Sierra was a 'Godless Demon' apostle, but also a boss, meaning that she wasn't supposed to be scared, instead supposed to be boasting of confidence and power, this was why she showed herself early in the rift to challenge all humans and kill them.\nBut she had been forced to run away from Stark as deep inside of her mind, his aura at that time was truly overwhelming, and her face still hurts a bit from the punch he had sent.\nAt that time, even she, for a quick second, thought: 'what if he wins?', which was why she didn't take the risk to continue the fight and instead went back to her boss area.\n'…' Stark had the blankest of expressions on his face, no trace of anger or any emotions at all as he kept rushing through the tunnel, avoiding all the arrows, and even having the guts to catch some of them to store inside his [Spatial Inventory]\n'FUCK YOU!' Sierra's body began to be surrounded by her aura, and it was growing more and more, 'Let's see how you like this!\"\nAnd then… she snapped her fingers, sending a blue shockwave throughout the entire tunnel.\n\"…\" Stark's eyes narrowed as the shockwave hit him, but it barely fazed him, he felt no pain and he was still able to move with the same agility.\nThe reason he hadn't avoided it was because [Focus] didn't alert him of any danger, meaning that it wasn't an attack meant for damage.\nHe wondered what Sierra was planning now, knowing she was up to something.\nAfter all… she wasn't shooting any arrows anymore….\nAnd suddenly, just as he thought of that…\n~BIIIIIM, FWISH~\nEvery white crystal scattered throughout the walls of the cave tunnel began to glow with a white aura that almost blinded Stark because of the sheer amount of it.\n~FWISH~\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" Stark heard the sound of an arrow coming, and focus alerted him of danger, but he couldn't see anything, so he was forced to use invincible dodge to guarantee he wouldn't be hit.\nAnd it looks like it was the right decision…\n'Huh…? The arrows passed right through him…?' Sierra was making sure that whatever she saw was right, 'I didn't shoot all this time to charge up fifteen arrows but he just avoided them all like this while being blinded…?'\nDeep inside, Sierra knew that the human before her was weird.\nBut this explosion wasn't everything that the 'The Crystal Cave' reserved.\nAnd suddenly… right as the light faded and Stark was able to see…\nHe noticed that coming out of each crystal was a figure, one he had already seen before.\nThey were [Victims of Sierra], and there were hundreds of them scattered throughout the walls and ceiling of the tunnel.\nTheir pitch-black lifeless eyes stared at him, and their black wings were idle.\nFrom all directions now, he had this sense of discomfort he couldn't really describe.\n'Great… now he's going to get blocked by them…' Sierra smiled as she began pointing her bow at Stark again.\nThe [Victims of Sierra] were all the people Sierra previously infected with her arrows ignoring the 7 classifiers as they became another type of monster, and they were in a constant state of agony, forced to followed everything their 'queen' ordered them to do.\nThis was why the 'Crystal Archer' was so confident, their sheer number all over that cave would distract Stark and hopefully she would hit him.\nBut… something strange happened this time.\nWhen Sierra ordered something, every [Victim of Sierra] was forced to follow it as if they didn't, they would just suffer more, she wouldn't give them death, it would be a reward.\nAll they wanted was for her to die.\n'STOP HIM, MY MINIONS,' she internally laughed as she ordered them all to make as much movement and noise as possible.\n[Victims of Sierra] cannot be killed with attacks, but they also can't harm, so the best thing they could do was obstruct Stark's vision.\nAnd yet… they didn't move.\nInstead, they just kept staring at Stark, before all pointing at the end of the tunnel, where Sierra was located.\n'I SAID STOP HIM, YOU FUCKING-' the archer shouted again, inflicting pain on all of them.\nBut they didn't budge.\nThe reason such a phenomenon was happening is because even the [Victims of Sierra], with their puppet minds, could see Stark's aura, and it was the most powerful one they had seen yet.\nHim being an enemy of Sierra almost meant that he was their allies.\nTheir sole goal was for the apostle to die, so that they can also vanish and go rest, which was why they didn't budge.\nThey saw potential in Stark, and so they believed in him.\n\"Go… human…\" through the entire tunnel, Stark heard such a whisper, and it sent a chill down his spine.\nSierra, finally realizing the gravity of the situation, knew she had to make her move: the [Victims of Sierra] didn't budge no matter how much pain she inflicted on them, she had never seen them so determined.\nAnd the worst thing of all… was that the human was still running toward her, his crimson aura burning brighter than before.\nSierra's eyes narrowed as she tried to understand the situation.\nShe had never been so utterly ignored by her minions, and it made her uneasy. But she could not afford to be distracted; she had to end this so-called \"human\" once and for all.\n\"ARROW BARRAGE!\" she only needed one arrow…\n'JUST ONE ARROW DAMN IT!' and so she kept shooting them like a machine-gun, not even a fraction of a second between each reload.\n~FWISH, FWISH~\nBut Stark would avoid them all, his speed potion massively helping him.\nAnd the [Victims of Sierra] were still looking down at him, pointing their hollow arms toward the boss area.\n\"You… are… close…\" they whispered after two minutes.\nAnd so just like that… the final clash was about to happen as Stark looked up and noticed that he could see the silver fog from his current distance: meaning that the boss area was right in front of him.\n'I GOT YOU, SIERRA!' he shouted as he increased his pace.",

Stark pondered, but decided not to think too much about it.\nAnd that's when the panel finally appeared.\n[Sierra, The Crystal Archer (BOSS)]\nStark decided to immediately use 'Perception' as he hadn't been able to see her entire panel before.\n…\n[Name: Sierra, the Crystal Archer (BOSS)]\n[Level: 80]\n[HP: 245618/315000]\n[Strength: 1492]\n[Stamina: 2783]\n[Speed: 3401]\n[Defense: 2245]\n[Skills: Shoot, Arrow Creation, Arrow Ray, Arrow Barrage, Archer's Focus, Crystal Burst, Teleportation, Crystal Shield, Puppet Control, Sierra's Final Stand, Crystal Transformation…]\n…\n\"It's just you and me now!\" Sierra span her bow around, throwing it from hand to hand in a very stylish way, maybe trying to prove that she is a master archer, and that she has complete control over her bow movements.\n\"ARROW CREATION! SHOOT!\"\nShe tried to shoot an arrow at Stark after creating an arrow out of crystals and aura, but he obviously just avoided it.\n'Spatial Inventory,' in return, Stark opened his inventory void and pulled out 2 potions of Strength and 2 potions of Speed, then he drank them all quickly.\nHe wanted to guarantee he would have the effect during the entire fight since his potions from before had already stopped working.\n\"AURA SMASH, CRIMSON SPEARS!\" Stark retaliated by punching the air twice in Sierra's direction, sending two fists of aura and all his spears to her.\n\"Crystal Shield,\" but just like she did before, the archer transformed one of her arrows and shot it down to create a crystal wall that blocked everything.\n\"-0! -0! -0!\"\n~DASH~\nNot wasting time, Stark dashed toward Sierra while she was defending herself using the crystal wall as a shield, and the moment it got destroyed…\n\"Hey there…\" he appeared from behind the debris, taking the archer by surprise.\nBut it didn't mean that she couldn't get out of such a situation, after all… Sierra may be in an archer, but she is just as competent as most 'Warrior' classes in hand-to-hand combat.\n~FWISH, KICK~\nShe used her bow to block the punch again, and as soon as Stark tried to use that opportunity to launch his second hand at her… she spanned and kicked him out really hard in the stomach, sending him flying in the opposite direction.\n[The Purgatory Shadow took the hit in your place]\n\"-0!\"\nHe was still launched away, but received no damage whatsoever.\n'What the hell was that thing…' Sierra wondered as she saw a shadow come out of one of Stark's rings to protect him, 'This boy is weird…'\n'But…' she suddenly grinned as she saw Stark retrieve his balance using his hands, 'This is exciting!'\nAnd so just like that… for the first time in a very long time, Sierra was beginning to enjoy the thrill of a battle.\nBut that meant that it would become much more difficult for Stark.\n\"ARROW RAY, CRYSTAL BURST!\" she activated two skills at the same time all of a sudden, and the aura around her grew even more.\nHer bow was beginning to be surrounded by an electrifying blue aura, and five giant crystal shards appeared behind Sierra, spinning around her in circles as well.\n\"It's time to end this, human,\" she shrugged as her grin grew even wider.\n'CLONE FRENZY!' but Stark wouldn't let this go, and so he summoned only one of his clones as the other one was still on cooldown for 5 minutes.\n'I'm gonna send you to hell, lady,' he smiled as well, his eyes burning with a deep aura, \"You're gonna join the mayor and the angel soon,\" he laughed, and her eyes slightly twitched upon hearing that.\nAnd so just like that, Stark got ready to fight the opponent that could transform him into a monster with one single arrow.",

      "content": "Stark's clone nodded as it saw the rift boss use all her powerful attacks, her bow and body surrounded by an electrifying blue aura, and also five crystal shards turning around her in rotation.\n\"DIE!\" she pointed her bow at him, and a giant arrow, at least ten times the size of the others, began charging up inside as she pulled the string.\nStark wasn't dumb, and so instead of letting her charge an attack that could potentially kill him, he immediately dashed toward her.\n\"AURA SMASH,\" his clone also sent two fists at her to give Stark a chance to attack.\nBut…\nTwo of the crystal shards rotating around Sierra intercepted the fists, then immediately crumbled, meaning only three were left.\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS,\" but it wouldn't back off, so the clone also sent three spears again, in hopes of eliminating all the shards.\nBut…\n~BAM~\nLike a baseball bat, one of the shards conveniently placed itself horizontally in front of the spears, and as if it was controlled by an invisible creature, it swung to make all three spears disappear, in exchange the shard obviously disappeared.\n[Crystal Burst] was an incredibly powerful attack, not only since it granted the user the ability to summon 5 shards that could pretty much block any attack, but also because when it is set on [Attack] mode, Sierra can send all the shards toward a target, and if they ever hit him (or an area close to him), then it would cause massive damage as they would explode.\n~PUNCH~\nStark tried to take advantage of Sierra's attack charging up to punch her and cancel it, but yet another shard came to interrupt him, and it shattered as well as it blocked his strike.\nStark knew this would happen as he had seen his clone's attacks being blocked, but…\nThe thing he didn't expect though is for the shard to suddenly move while he was in midair, unable to dodge, and then…\n~BAM, CRACK~\nThe shard slammed into Stark's chest, sending him flying backward and crashing into the ground.\n\"-7837!\"\nHe felt a sharp pain as some crystal debris teared the fabric of his clothes and cause manor injuries.\nLuckily, Stark had activated his [Domination] shield, which successfully blocked 5K points of damage, meaning that he had overall 'only' received 2837 points of damage.\n[Stark HP: 8363/11200]\nThanks to his level increase, his HPs had already gone well over 10000.\nAfter all, the more a classifier levels up, the higher the amount of HP they would get to accommodate for the bigger challenges they would face later.\nStark's clone helped him get up instantly, like the true companion it was, but… it was already too late.\n\"GOODBYE, HUMAN!\" Sierra laughed maniacally as her giant arrow attack charged.\nAnd suddenly…\n[AVOID, AVOID, AVOID, AVOID]\nThe crimson messages appeared all over, but they quickly subdued as another one appeared, and it was extremely unusual.\n[CANNOT AVOID, ELIMINATE BOSS QUICK!]\n'Huh?'\nNot understanding, Stark immediately used [Perception] on Sierra's status panel, and specifically on the [Arrow Ray] skill.\n…\n[Skill: Arrow Ray]\n[Description:] A powerful ranged attack that needs 30 seconds to charge up, but if the user ever succeeds in doing that, then a giant crystal arrow will appear and transform into an unstoppable beam.\n[Note:] This skill cannot be stopped unless it hits someone (it will still go if hitting an object), so it would be advised to watch out as the arrow beam works just as the normal ones.\n…\nAnd suddenly, as soon as he read that…\n~FIOUUU, BOOOOOM!~\nSierra fired the giant arrow at Stark, which created a trail of white aura so overwhelming it could make many classifiers faint upon sensing it.\n\"DASH!\" it was fast, but Stark immediately moved out of the way by flapping Judicator's wings.\nBut of course… it wasn't like the other arrows.\nSince as soon as the arrow met the wall on the other end of the cave boss area, it didn't explode or disappear like the others, instead, it turned around and flew back toward Stark.\n'It's going to follow me until it hits something…' Stark's eyes widened as he crouched to avoid the arrow again.\nAnd in the meantime, Sierra didn't sit down and watch him struggle.\n\"ARROW BARRAGE,\" she began to create more arrows and launch them at Stark and his clone while they were busy avoiding the giant arrow.\n'This can't keep going,' Stark mumbled as he kept moving in all directions, many arrows almost hitting him, 'But if the arrows need to hit something then…'\nHe looked at his clone, and suddenly, something came to mind.\nBack at the Domination Trial, something like this happened before, where either he or Orasio needed to sacrifice themselves to pass to the final area, and at that the time…\nHe had used one of his clones so that they both pass.\nSo maybe… just maybe… his clone could be considered as a person?\nAnd so… he took the risk.\n\"Hey,\" he shouted to his clone, and it immediately understood as it suddenly began to run in the opposite direction, toward Stark.\n\"FOOLISH, DIE, HUMAN!\" Sierra didn't stop shooting her arrows, confident in her imminent victory now.\nBut right as the [Arrow Ray] was centimeters away from hitting the original Stark… the clone pushed him out of the way and took the hit.\n\"-837!\" these [Arrows of Sierra] didn't do that much damage as their perk was already overpowered.\n'Dumbass, he wasted a clone,' Sierra maniacally laughed, even stopping her onslaught of arrows to enjoy the show.\nBut what she didn't expect… was for Stark's clone to be so close to the original, and made from his aura, so it would be considered as if hitting someone.\nAnd so the giant arrow exploded upon contact with the clone's body.\nBut before it disappeared… it received the effects of the [Arrow of Sierra] perk.\n'Oh… I can see what it does now,' Stark smiled.\nThe white mist engulfed the clone, and its body suddenly began to turn completely white, crystal shards growing on its skin too, its aura also began to flow around the area, as if trying to escape and becoming aggressive.\n'WHAT THE?' Stark was taken aback.\nAnd so after a few seconds… the clone's body began to crystallize, the shards spreading and covering its entire form.\nAnd the moment the crystals merged with its figure, the clone's eyes became completely black, and a pair of wings grew from its back.\nIt had become a [Servant of Sierra], and although Stark couldn't know about the pain, the aura of the clone moving so much during the transformation meant that it was extremely painful.\n'I'm sorry,' he sighed, speaking to his clone before calling it back, resulting in its aura seeping back into his body, and for the white mist/crystals to drop to the ground as the bearer of the 'perk' had disappeared.\nBut… now Stark was mad, and the aura from the clone that merged with his increased his anger as it sought for revenge: it wanted Sierra dead, it wasn't even about the mission anymore.\n\"Nice try, but now I'm truly gonna end this,\" Stark dashed toward Sierra, taking her aback as she hadn't expected for the clone to be able to affected by her arrows.\n\"DOUBLE ASSAULT!\" he shouted, activating his legendary skill.",

[Crystal Transformation], one of her ultimate skills, took effect as it needed to charge.\nThe other one also needed to charge up, but it would take a much bigger amount of time.\nAnd so...\n\"CRYSTAL TRANSFORMATION!\" Sierra shouted, and her aura became much overwhelming, then...\nMany crystals around the walls of the boss area began to shake.\n~BRRRRRR~\nIt created a very annoying sound, but it ended after only five seconds since all the crystal immediately removed themselves from their spots in the wall, meaning that all around Stark and Sierra were hundreds upon hundreds of them.\n'...going to attack me with them?' Stark thought, after all there was a chance coming in contact with those crystals was deadly as they were what made the arrows.\nBut no... it couldn't be it, otherwise she could have done that since the beginning.\nInstead, hundreds upon hundreds of crystal shook again, then all began to fly toward Sierra.\nIt was a beautiful sight as each of them left a trail of white mist behind.\nAnd so after all the crystals of the cave reached the boss... they began to merge with her skin.\n'No...' Stark was wrong, 'They're not merging... they're... creating an upper layer of protection...?'\nEvery crystal that reached Sierra's skin added something to that mystical layer, and it was like some sort of crystal armor was forming itself around Sierra.\nAnd that was exactly what was happening, since when Stark finally decided to use [Perception]...\n...\n[Skill: Crystal Transformation]\n[Description:] This exclusive skill allows Sierra to combine many crystal shards around her to create an armor that gives her protection against any attacks, note that hitting the armor doesn't infect you with the 'crystal mist'.\n[Note:] The armor has 100K HP, and it is impossible to hit Sierra until it is destroyed.\n...\n'Yeah... Basically she gave herself an additional 100K HP,' it wasn't that annoying since two good hits meant that the armor would be destroyed, but it also meant there was a chance Sierra could come back from this.\nAnd by the time the crystal armor was finished... it was already shining, an ethereal aura around it.\nIt was completely white, and covered up Sierra completely, except for her head as her ocean eyes were still visible, although there was a crystal helmet on it.\n\"Feels better,\" Sierra smiled lightly, bold of her after getting beat up by the very human she underestimated.\nBut by the sheer aura around her... Stark knew that something was wrong.\n\"I'm impressed,\" Sierra clapped her hands, \"Very impressed, human, you'll make a fine slave, my OWN premium slave!\" she laughed.\n\"...\" Stark looked at her with a blank expression, and he took a step forward.\n\"Don't even think of taking another step in this direction if you don't want to have a bad time.\"\n~STEP~\nStark didn't care and took two more, his expression not changing.\n\"You know,\" Sierra shrugged, \"I realized that you only got angry when I talked about those transformed humans, and especially that pregnant woman, were they your companions?\"\n~STEP, STEP~\n\"Maybe if you accept to become one of my slaves, I'll let them go, you know?\" she smiled, pointing her bow at Stark.\n'Liar...' he had clearly read in the arrows' description that people who are transformed cannot go back, and either way he wasn't playing to do that for some strangers.\n~STEP, STEP, STEP~\nEvery step Stark took now left a burning mark on the cave ground.\n~FWISH~\nSierra shot an arrow at Stark, but he just avoided it before returning to his original position.\n\"You just won't give up...\" Sierra smiled, a malicious glint in her eyes indicating she was preparing something, \"Well, let's see how well you do against 'THEM'!\"\nAnd suddenly...\n\"PUPPET CONTROL!\" the bow in her hand flew behind her and began to float while spinning, and on the other hand, Sierra lifted both of her arms up, a white electric aura coming out of each of her fingers.\n~STEP, STEP~\nStark didn't stop though.\nAnd so… as he kept walking, the electric aura coming out of Sierra hit the ground seven times in front of her, and…\n~BOOM, BOOM, BOOM~\nFrom the ground emerged seven figures, they were completely white, but in comparison to the [Victims of Sierra], it was still possible to distinguish that they were human.\nThey were the so-called [Servants of Sierra], basically, the seven classifiers that had attempted to beat this rift but all failed.\n\"As I said before…\" Sierra clapped her hands, and the seven figures began to walk toward Stark like zombies, \"It is possible to save them, they are still alive, we wouldn't want to kill them, would we?\"\nDid she really think this bluff would work against Stark?\nSome of the [Servants of Sierra] were now right in front of Stark, and they stopped, looking at him with their black eyes, they were much scarier than the [Victims] since they still had human features.\n…\n[Name: Servant of Sierra]\n[Level: 80]\n[HP: 30000]\n[Strength: 1]\n[Stamina: 1]\n[Speed: 1]\n[Defense: 1]\n[Skills: Memories, Puppet, Despair…]\n…\nOther than their improved HP and two additional skills, they were just like the [Victims of Sierra], mere puppets controlled by the boss.\nThey couldn't do any damage, and any hit would kill them.\nAnd so as all of them stopped before Stark, all he could see in their eyes was the infinite despair of being helpless against this entity.\n'Look at him… stopping once he sees them… just as I knew, humans are so easy to manipulate…' Sierra giggled, the malicious grin on her face growing.\nBut…\n\"K-Kill… us…\" an echo escaped the servants' mouths as they all looked at Stark, their eyes on the verge of tears yet unable to do so.\n\"Ok,\" Stark nodded, this was the only mercy he could give them.\nThe [Servant of Sierra] before Stark was the pregnant woman Sierra had mentioned beforehand, and so…\n~PUNCH~\nStark punched her face as lightly as he could.\n\"-49472!\" it still did incredible damage because of her 1 defense stat, and she immediately vanished.\n\"Huh?\" Sierra was shocked that Stark actually had the guts to kill another human, no matter how transformed it was.\nShe had used this strategy several times against other people, using their loved ones as bait to transform them too.\n\"Let's get this over with,\" Stark advanced, he was tired of her dirty tricks, and if killing her was the sole solution to free all the creatures she transformed, then he wanted to do it fast.",

WARNING! WARNING!]\nIt seemed like [Focus] detected it as well as dozens of panels appeared around him.\nAnd when he looked up… he saw a small smile on Sierra's face as she lifted both of her arms up, her bow floating between them like she had just acquired it inside a chest.\n\"SIERRA'S FINAL STAND,\" her final skill had finally charged up, and so the bow between her hands began to spin at the speed of light, creating a vortex of blue aura, sending shockwaves throughout the cave.\n~BIM, BIM, BIM~\nHe began to hear noise around him.\n~BIM, BIM, BIM~\nTrails of white aura escaped the bow, and placed themselves all over the cave.\n~BIM, BIM, BIM~\nUpon further inspection, Stark noticed that… those trails of auras were actually [Arrows of Sierra].\nAnd every 'BIM' he heard was basically the warning that an additional was added.\nThis honestly wouldn't be scary under normal circumstances, but the problem was… that he heard hundreds upon hundreds of BIM's.\nAnd just as expected, now, all over the walls of the cave, surrounding Stark and Sierra, were hundreds, if not thousands of arrows.\n'Huh…?'

There are indeed SOME skills for alchemists, although very rare, and they are all extremely powerful, so most alchemists just rely on their basic ones!]\n'Fair…' But this did mean that Stark would actually have to start focusing on how to upgrade his alchemy skills and his station from now on.\nSighing and rubbing his face, Stark took a moment to collect his thoughts.\nThen he closed his eyes and picked a card at random.\nIt was a [Domination] class card, obviously, and once he turned it around, he saw the drawing of… an arrow pointing in several directions.\n'The fuck?' this was the most confusing drawing out of them all.\n…\n[Skill: Target Manipulation]\n[Type: Epic]\n[Level: 1]\n[Description: By focusing your aura on an opponent, you can force them to move in the direction you choose: up, left, right, down… The push completely depends on the amount of aura you put into it]\n[Note: using too much aura can deplete your stamina and tire you out, and you can only select one target at a time…]\n…\nIt was a rather interesting skill, and Stark could see some ways to make it work, but it wasn't phenomenal either.\nHe would need to try it out and see how good it truly was, after all you can't just judge a skill by its description.\nAfter doing that, Stark immediately decided to use some of the [Skill Points] he had gotten from the level ups.\n[You have upgraded 'Aura Smash' to level 9!]\n[You have upgraded 'Aura Smash' to level 10!]\n'I'll keep the other ones in case I need them for later, or just to stack…' he thought, he only wanted to bring [Aura Smash] to level 10 to get another perk after all.\nAnd he got it.\n…\n[Skill: Aura Smash lv10]\n[New Perks: Three Crimson Fist + Merging]\n[Description: Not only can you now summon three crimson fists instead of two to aid you in battle, but that would be too lame, so you also have the new ability to merge all three fists into one giant and powerful one that combines the power of all three, creating an explosion that will damage all enemies hit by the attack or are near it.]\n…\n'Huh…' the first perk was something he totally expected, but the second one was a nice bonus, 'Wonder when i'll get a cooldown decrease though.'\n30 seconds between each use didn't seem much, but in the middle of battle it could be decisive.\nHis eyes then immediately turned to Sierra's body, it didn't disappear like Judicator, maybe even the world wanted to preserve her beauty? Although by human standards, Judicator could also be considered handsome.\nIn the end it didn't matter, since what interested Stark wasn't her body or face, but… the three glints that could be seen on top of her: it was the call of new items to get!\nAnd frankly, Stark expected a lot from this fight, especially after almost dying (yes, for the third time).\nHe reached out for the three items, and they suddenly appeared before him.\nThe first was a bow, the exact one Sierra had been using, the bow is made of shimmering crystal, each curve and detail crafted with precision and beauty. The string is taut and ready for use, gleaming in the light.\n…\n[Item:] Sierra's Crystal Bow\n[Type:] Bow\n[Class:] Archer\n[Tier:] Legendary\n[Required Level:] 60\n[Quality:] Perfect\n[Attributes:] +700 Stamina; +500 Speed\n[Special Perks:] Ability to use the [Archer's Focus] skill, a powerful skill that allows the user to predict the movements of an opponent and also increases your precision while firing an arrow by 50%.\n…\nHe didn't even need to be an archer to know that this item would sell for an incredible amount of rher coins, and this brought a big smile to Stark's face.\nThe second item was a… QUIVER!?\nStark immediately grabbed it and checked the inside, and he almost jumped in joy after seeing that it was full of [Arrows of Sierra]!\nHe had forgotten about the mission since he was too busy focusing on his own survival, so it was great that he received the arrows regardless.\n…\n[Item:] Arrow Quiver\n[Type:] Bag\n[Quality:] Exquisite\n[Description:] Contains exactly 100 [Arrows of Sierra].\n…\nAnd so that left him with one item as it was the only one still on the floor, its glint inviting Stark to pick it up.\nOnce he crouched to take it in hand, he noticed something strange: it was a paper.\nNo… it was a scroll!\nAnd not a skill scroll, but a potion one, meaning that it was for the [Alchemist] class!\n…\n[Potion Scroll:] Crystal Stun Potion\n[Perk:] Will know once learned!\n[Ingredients:] Will know once learned!\n…\n[Do you want to learn this potion?]\n[Y/N?]\n'My first potion other than the basic ones,' Stark smiled, he was happy.\nAnd so without hesitation he clicked on Y.\nWith that, his level as an alchemist was slightly better.",

guarantee him a hit on an enemy?\nPlus, under normal circumstances, most alchemists would struggle or be forced to buy a [Storage Watch] to store all these ingredients in the limited space they had.\nYet… Stark had [Spatial Inventory], meaning that as soon as he read the text stating that the crystal shards were there, he immediately ran up to one, grabbed it, and put it inside his void.\nThe exit portal had already opened on top of the platform with Sierra's throne, but he wasn't interested in that for now.\n[Crystal Shard acquired!]\nIn addition to that, the [Alchemist] skill would inform him every time he got an ingredient.\nMeaning that each time he picked up a [Crystal Shard], he would hear a DING followed by a panel.\nThis kept going for two hours as once Stark grabbed all the shards inside the cave, he immediately moved to the tunnel as it was also filled with them.\nAnd by the end of his ingredient search…\n[x1673 Crystal Shards]\nIt took him a while, but now, he was confident that he had enough shards to give him as many potions as he wanted for a lifetime.\nAnd who knows, maybe they will be useful for some stronger potions later!\nHe hadn't really thought about it, but the idea of finding new potions and recipes was exciting, plus they would aid him in battle, so merging both the [Domination] and [Alchemist] class could reveal itself to be much more interesting than he thought.\n'Also…' he grinned, 'I have the 'Memories Museum' to try everything I want!'\nAfter doing everything that he needed to do, including grabbing all equipments and checking out all his panels, Stark finally decided to leave.\nAnd so he jumped inside the ocean-colored portal that appeared in front of the throne.\n~FWISH, FIOUU~\n'Never going to get used to this sensation…' he sighed as he had the same feeling of being transported through dimensions.\nAnd after only twenty seconds, he emerged on the other side, feeling the rays of the sun on his face.\n'Phew… I haven't been inside the rift for long so it's good that it's still day…' Stark sighed.\nThe [Electronic Watch] he had gotten that guided him here was still broken, so it was useless, but it also meant that Stark was forced to go back to civilization by himself.\nIt mustn't have been more than six hours since he entered the rift, meaning that he could finish his mission quickly and thus prove that he had the strength to access that 'Rift Conqueror Academy'.\n\"Spatial Inventory!\" instinctively, he opened up his inventory void and grabbed his phone from it, he kept it in there since it would probably break if he kept it in his pocket during battle.\nAnd once he turned on the screen…\nHis eyes widened, and his face became pale.\n'…' he looked at his phone screen for a good minute.\nAnd a panel even came to confirm what he feared.\n[You have been inside 'Sierra's Death Path' for 2 weeks 5 days]\nThis didn't make sense, but even the date on his phone confirmed that fact.\n['One-Classifier Run' rifts work differently than others, because as you are alone, time inside of it can move differently than inside of the real world!]\n'Basically… time moves much slower when inside of the rift,' Stark grabbed his forehead and began to laugh, 'And that bastard didn't tell me…'\nBut Stark shook his head.\n'No, there is a chance he didn't know.'\nSince most classifiers that entered the rift usually died 5–10 minutes after entering it, it would be around a few hours in the real world, meaning that he possibly believed that they had gone far but still died…\n'That's a good logic,' Stark nodded, 'BUT I DON'T CARE!'\nAfter all he was still responsible for sending him to this shithole, he had indeed completed his mission though, so he better get back before they all believe he died.\nIf this didn't already happen, that is.\n'The fact he didn't give me a watch or a way to get back to Fellarburg means that he had low expectations for me to survive…' Stark was assembling the pieces of the puzzle, and he was frankly beginning to hate that Moonless family more and more.\nIn the end, he decided to just get back using his legs.\nHe still had some food and water saved inside of his [Spatial Inventory], so now he just needed to get back to Fellarburg.\nThe next VIP express train won't arrive until at least a day, since it had already passed, so there was no point in sitting around and waiting here.\n'DOMINATION!' he activated his skill, focusing the entirety of his aura around his legs, then began to run in the opposite direction which he came from.\nHe didn't have any panel or arrow to aid him this time, but he just followed his instinct.\n'Just you wait…' he groaned as he began to run extremely fast, around half the speed of the actual train.\nThe more determination and anger Stark had inside of him, the more powerful his aura would become, and so that meant that his speed right now was enough to possibly get back to Fellarburg in 10 hours.\nUntil then, he just had to keep running…",

      "content": "(10 hours later)\n\"Ahh~ Ah~~\" Needless to say that even Stark with his class and high stamina was exhausted after running this marathon, of course he had taken a break or two to replenish his stamina and to drink water, but it was still tiresome.\nIn the end, though, he could see Fellarburg in the distance, its modern buildings and size so big they could be recognized from anywhere close.\nIt was strange to think that around this safe country was a landscape of blood lusted monsters.\nDuring his marathon to get back here, he obviously had to face them as he was in a semi-dangerous area, meaning that enemies still spawned.\nAnd so, just during that time, his level went up once, meaning that he had reached level 32; although he tried hard not to fight to save his stamina, only eliminating the ones that were in his way.\nSurprisingly enough, there was no big wall surrounding the country at all, instead it was left in the open, with no guards to check if monsters were attacking.\nBut of course, people weren't this reckless, instead the reason that this giant country (and honestly most others) was in the open was because… a giant dome-like barrier was set up around the entirety of Fellarburg, protecting it from all monsters as this barrier was created from many 'Magic Crystals', enough to withstand thousands of attacks.\nOf course though… if the barrier went out for even a few minutes… the amount of monsters who would attempt to attack would be disastrous, but luckily there has been no such kind of incidents before.\n~PHEW, FWISH~\nOnce he got closer, Stark was able to spot the blue barrier, and he carefully approached it, passing through like it was nothing.\n[Humans are allowed, monsters aren't], this was how this barrier was set.\nAnd so that meant that he was finally back in Fellarburg after his mission.\n\"Mom, look, that man in the damaged clothes came back from the evil world!\" a child spoke, the evil world seemed to refer to the outside.\n\"Shh~ let's just go!\" the mother began to walk faster.\nIt seemed that going outside was some sort of taboo around here, maybe since people were scared from the monsters and were only used to classifiers fighting inside of rifts, so someone coming from the dangerous outside world seemed weird and reckless.\nIn the end it didn't matter much as Stark continued to walk.\nHe wanted to go back to his hotel, but then he remembered that he was kicked out for damaging the wall, although that wasn't him, meaning he would need to find a new place to stay in.\n'Is it time to buy an apartment…?' he pondered, but for now he would just need to find another hotel close to his previous one.\nBut while Stark was thinking about all of that… the air suddenly became heavier out of nowhere.\n'???'\nStark didn't stop, he looked down and kept going, he had a bad feeling, and for some strange reason it felt as if his blood was boiling.\nHe didn't know why he was getting angry, there was no reason for that, after all he had completed his mission and was now back, meaning that he could get the 30 million rher coins, as well as access to the 'Rift Conquerors' academy.\nBut suddenly… as if to validate his feelings… a panel appeared.\n[Hey, what about our revenge?]\n'Huh?' Stark stopped in his tracks, his face full of confusion, why was there a panel before him, it had never happened before except for when his clone spoke to him inside of the memories museum, so why…?\nRher cannot talk to him through panels, he stopped doing that after Stark assimilated his class, and his [Status Window] wasn't sentient, otherwise he would know it.\nThe sole option was… his aura, or maybe the doppelgänger?\n'Revenge?'\n[Those 'Moonless' fools sent us to our death, we cannot allow them to get away with that!]\n'I mean… I'll have to get to them somehow to give them the arrows and complete the mission, so why-' he tried to argue.\nBut…\n[WRONG! THEY DO NOT BELIEVE YOU WILL COME BACK!]\n[LOOK!]\nAnd suddenly, below the text appeared a single image, it was the image of a purple poster card with the words 'ClassiTop Meeting 2024' written in white.\n[Do you think these people care about us? Do you think they even remember US?]\nAnd suddenly… a pair of crimson eyes appeared inside of another panel, much like the ones he had seen inside of the [ApostleDex], they were staring at Stark, an intense gaze that could mark his soul.\nThese eyes were oddly familiar though, almost as if… they were his?\n[They are out here organizing private events, leaving us to die!]\nAnd so before Stark could say or do anything…\n[You know the location, do what you want with that information.]\nThen no more panels appeared, it had said what it needed to, then disappeared just as quick as it appeared, it was a weird feeling.\nThe only thing it left in view was the image of the poster card.\nNot wasting time, Stark zoomed it on that poster card to read everything.\n…\n[Fellarburg ClassiTop Meeting 2024]\n[To the 100 TOP classifiers of Fellarburg, you are hereby invited to the 2024 edition of this special event since the 'academies entrances' begin in a month!]\n[Want to show off your skills, levels, or children, then it is the perfect opportunity!]\n[Come join, thus we can prove to Fellarburg… no… to the WHOLE world that we are the strongest!]\n[Address and Time: 'Campbell Institute' at 2PM!]\n…\nStark was confused, he had never heard of such a thing, but it was only two days from now.\nAnd why… WHY did he feel so angry all of a sudden.\nUpon turning around one of the streets, he met a giant screen, but this time it didn't display a fight with a classifier or an ad, it was…\n\"Did you hear about the ClassiTop meeting happening in two days, John?\"\n\"Oh yeah, Maria, it is indeed surprising, but also exciting, knowing that our protectors and most powerful classifiers can meet and discuss together!\"\n\"I do wish we knew what their discussions were about, but all information about this event is left private…\"\n\"That's fine, i'm sure what they do is incredible!\"\nSome news reporters were speaking, all excited about the very same event that mysterious panel informed Stark about.\nThe only thing he knew… was that the 'Archer King' would surely participate.\nArthur, the Archer King, had moved on so quick, already planning his next moves as a classifier after believing that Stark was dead.\nIt was almost funny.\n'Campbell Institute…' he mumbled as he began to laugh, 'They want to host a private event for top classifiers? I hope they don't mind me joining it then =)'\nHe had no information about that thing yet, but he would surely come in with a bang, and make sure they remember him well.\n[2 days left before event]\nThe entirety of Fellarburg was excited about this supposed event, so it must be somewhat important.\n'Need to find a way,' he continued to smile as he resumed walking.\nStark was a stubborn person, and he hated when people played him, maybe they didn't know that time moved slower inside of the rift, but not even waiting a month for him was insanity.\nFrankly… he didn't like any of them, except for Lana maybe, so for now… he would just need to wait.",

      "content": "\"Holy shit!\"\n\"What's wrong with this guy?\"\nStark hadn't realized it, but although he was smiling, his anger made it so that just like inside of the rift against Sierra, his aura surrounded his body like some kind of armor, and his eyes replaced by pure white aura, a trail of power coming out of them, warning anybody close that he was a dangerous person.\nHe could see normally, but to all those around, all they saw was a human with an overwhelming crimson aura on his figure.\nThus, everyone avoided him, and when they did talk and point at him, he would just stare back, and they would immediately shiver and go away as they didn't want to deal with him.\nHe was only level 31, but his aura made it seem as though he was over level 200, maybe because [Domination] was just too powerful of a class?\nIt didn't take long for him to calm down and reach a hotel near the 'Classifier Trading District' though, calming down and ordering a room for the next few weeks, he had the money for that after all.\nSoon enough, he reached his room, and collapsed onto the bed, exhausted from the day's events.\nIt had only been 24 hours for him, but around 3 weeks in the real world, so the reality of this situation took some time to hit him.\nWhile looking at the ceiling of his room though, he opened the panel with the purple poster card.\n\"Fellarburg ClassiTop Meeting…\" he mumbled the words of this event.\nHe knew the name, date, hour, and location, plus the Archer King would be there, so why not just go? What did he have to lose?\nOf course, entering a private property with the 100 most powerful classifiers in Fellarbug alongside their young lings would seem dumb, but for some strange reason… Stark felt that everything would be fine.\n'Can't really stay idle and do nothing though…'\nAfter all, he still had two days to prepare for whatever was coming, and he had little to no information.\nAnd so what was the best solution he thought of?\nWELL! Of course it was to head inside the 'Memories Museum' and train with new skills/potions, what else could it be?\nThe first thing he did was open up the fridge inside of his hotel room's kitchen and grab the 10 sparkling water bottles that were there, they were given to him for free by the reception, and it was amazing timing.\n\"Potion Crafting!\"\n[Do you want to summon your brewing station?]\n[Brewing station level: 1]\n[Y/N]\nHe clicked on 'yes', and the wooden table he had seen before appeared in front of him out of nowhere.\nThen he pulled out 10 [Crystal Shards] and put them on the table alongside the [Sparkling Water].\n…\n[Crystal Stun Potion]\n[Perk:] Throwable potion, if you manage to hit your opponent with it, the liquid will temporarily stun them!\n[Ingredients:] 1x Crystal Shard, 1x Sparkling Water\n…\nAnd immediately as he opened this potion's panel.\n[Crystal Shard 10/1; Sparkling Water 10/1]\n[Do you want to craft 10 'Crystal Stun Potions'?]\n'Yes…' Stark nodded to himself as he confirmed the crafting of the Crystal Stun Potions.\nThe wooden table before him began to emit a soft glow as the Crystal Shards and Sparkling Water combined, transforming into the shimmering white potions one by one.\nAnd after a few minutes… ten glasses appeared in front of him.\n[ x10 'Crystal Stun Potions' have been crafted]\nNot wasting time, he put everything inside his [Spatial Inventory] and summoned the 'Memories Museum' door, which appeared before him with a soft shimmer.\n'Alright… just two days…' he sighed, 'Need to get familiar with those potions and the new skill…'\nAnd so as he stepped through the threshold and entered the memories museum, he noticed that another display had appeared, and it was obviously Sierra's.\n'Let's do this,' he gently slapped both his cheeks and began to select multiple bosses to fight at once.\n[2 days before incident]\n***\n(2 days later)\n'Phew~' Stark emerged from the black door of the 'Memories Museum', a big smile on his face.\nHe had played with the [Crystal Stun Potions], even going outside to a market and buying 100 sparkling water bottles, and he also experimented with [Target Manipulation].\nAnd Stark couldn't lie… both of these were extremely good.\n[Target Manipulation] was what surprised him the most though, as although it looked like a skill used only to move a target in one direction, if he manages to do some things right, then it could end a battle really quickly.\nBut this wasn't all the news for now.\nSince around a day ago, when he attempted to craft yet another potion…\nTHIS panel appeared:\n[You have proven your basic skills as an 'Alchemist']\n[You can now upgrade your 'brewing station' to level 2!]\n[Y/N]\n'Level 2…' Stark muttered to himself as he read the panel before him in the Memories Museum.\nHe obviously clicked on Y and…\n[Good job, Alchemist! Your brewing station is now level 2, you can now craft 2 potions at once!]\nThe appearance of the 'Brewing Station' didn't change much except for the fact the table, cauldron, and brewing stand looked less damaged than before.\nBut that new perk to craft 2 potions at once massively reduced his crafting time as he would have usually been able to craft only one potion at a time, taking up precious time.\n'This is good…'\nAnd to add to that…\n[You have upgraded 'Alchemist' to level 3!]\n[You have upgraded 'Potion Crafting' to level 3!]\nHe used up his skill points to give these skills a boost in level as they had been stuck at level 1 for a while.\nBut now… today was the day the 'ClassiTop Meeting' was happening.\nHe put on his normal clothing, as well as his [Crimson Moon Bunny Mask].\nThe reason wasn't to hide his identity, but to guarantee him safety, after all not even those all powerful classifiers would attempt to defeat someone with as much potential as him.\nThis was his logic, and it was well… interesting, but also flawed, since if someone just wanted to get rid of him, then they could do it.\nAnyway, it was better than showing his face and being targeted later.\nHe checked the time, it was 13:45, and it would take him around 30 minutes to arrive to his location as the 'Campbell Institute' was a giant dome-like building where only the elite are allowed, so it was situated in the middle of the city with many guards surrounding it.\n'Got this… and that…' he checked everything before smiling and leaving his hotel room.\nHe hailed for a taxi and ordered the driver to bring him close to the location of the institute.\nWhile looking outside the windows, he saw many screens displaying the faces of the classifiers that would participate in this 'elite' meeting, as well as many videos showcasing their abilities.\nStark grinned, looking at his aura-filled hands, then peering inside of his [Spatial Inventory], looking at the objects floating inside of the space.\nHe would surely fight against many people, but it was fine, he was confident that he wouldn't die after all, so as long as he managed to do 'THAT', then surely… it would be fine.\n[30 minutes before incident!]",

      "content": "The 'ClassiTop Meeting Event' is something organized by almost every country in this world, and it is an event where the most powerful and popular classifiers of that very same country gather in a huge meeting/gathering to discuss with one another about their whereabouts.\nSome use this opportunity to flex on their peers, others to get new connections, some for help with specific rifts or problems, and a few others just to put their children together as they believe that the 'elite' can only be with the 'elite'.\nAll information about this event is completely confidential, and the only thing the outside world knows is that the top 100 classifiers of their country are gathering to discuss on how to protect the world better.\nOf course, this was a massive lie, but it was also incredible publicity for them all.\nSo now, all over Fellarburg, all those that were invited had received an invitation to that event, and they sure as hell wouldn't miss it, some of them even bringing their children with them.\nStark stepped out of the taxi, his eyes scanning the surroundings of the Campbell Institute.\nThe prestigious building loomed before him, its towering structure exuding an air of power and secrecy.\nIt was mostly dark with a dome-like structure, it was standing out from the other surrounding buildings, and there was a park around it, one where people could roam freely.\nStark's eyes burned with determination as he entered the park and began to head toward the entrance.\n'Yawn~' he was already mentally and physically ready to get inside, after all it had been around thirty minutes since the event started.\nAt the entrance stood two guards, the two talking with one another.\nThey were the only protection this place had as why would they bother having more guards when some of the most powerful people in the country were there?\nBut this didn't mean they were weak.\n[Guard A, level 129]\n[Guard B, level 131]\nHe didn't even feel the need to check their names or skills to be honest since he didn't have a single intention to face them fairly.\n'Spatial Inventory,' he mumbled before taking out three [Crystal Stun Potions] from it.\nBut that wasn't all…\n'Clone Frenzy,' Stark went to sit on a nearby bench, then summoned his clone.\nHis aura began to pulse as it created a perfect replica of himself, much like it did every time.\nThe clone looked back at Stark, a wide smile on its face, it seemed to enjoy what they were doing.\n'Focus…'\nStark closed his eyes, then focused the aura around his body before sending it to his eyes.\nHe had already done it once before, but it was still a weird feeling overall as it wasn't a perk he used often.\nHe sent that same aura from his eyes to the clone's, and then… once he opened them back, he found himself in the clone's position, able to control it.\nThe only other time he had done that (and when he unlocked that ability basically) was when those 'Domination Association' people were trying to ambush him inside his hotel room, but it was a fairly useful skill in other situations as well.\nBut before doing any of that, he looked behind toward the bench to check out his real body and…\n'Holy…' if someone passed by they would surely believe he was dead, there was no light in his eyes and no life force at all around him, 'Let's be quick then…'\n~STEP, STEP, STEP~\nThe clone took the three [Crystal Stun Potions] from the real Stark's hands and began to walk toward the entrance of the giant dome-like structure with the two guards at the entrance.\nOf course, as said before, Stark had absolutely no plan to fight them head on as he would probably lose, but it didn't mean he couldn't use cheap tricks.\nToo busy talking and laughing with one another, they didn't notice the other Stark approaching before he was extremely close.\n'Pretty reckless for guards…' he thought.\nBut the moment he entered a 10 meters radius from them… they suddenly turned their eyes at him, ones that were filled with caution and aura.\nThey weren't as weak as Stark thought, and looked like they had the power to stop him if it came to it.\n\"Hello?\" the fake Stark spoke.\n\"Get out of here kid, this is private property!\" both of them suddenly pulled out their weapons, which were two swords, so Stark guessed they were from the [Warrior] class.\nNonetheless he kept walking toward them, trying to seem as friendly as possible, only stopping a few meters away from them.\n\"HEY, WE SAID DON'T APPROACH!\" they took a step toward him and activated their auras, seemingly ready to slash if he came any closer.\n\"Hey, what is this place,\" but he just pointed at the giant black dome behind them.\nBut seems like they weren't having any of it as they both approached Stark, their bodies only a meter away from his now.\n\"We're seriously gonna kick your ass, get out of here!\"\n\"You didn't answer my question,\" but Stark, who was still wearing the bunny-mask, smiled, \"I just want to know then I'll leave.\"\nThe two guards (which Stark didn't even bother to check the names of) looked at one another for a few seconds before slightly turning toward the dome and pointing at it with their thumb from behind.\n\"It's a secret, kiddo, so don't bother us-\" but turning their backs to Stark, even if it was only slightly for a single second, was their mistake.\n~THROW~\nHe aimed at the floor in the middle of the radius between him and the guards, and threw all three [Crystal Stun Potions].\n…\n[Guard A stunned!]\n[Guard B stunned!]\n[YOU are stunned!]\n…\nOf course, it meant that the clone would also receive the effects of the potion since it wasn't immune to it, but it was fine since it was all part of Stark's plan.\n\"THE FUCK?!\"\n\"THAT FUCKER!\"\nThe two guards were cursing, able to move their mouths but their bodies standing idle.\nAnd then…\n\"Come back to me…\" Stark deactivated the clone's perk, transferring back his vision to himself, and able to move his original body again.\nBut the first thing he did at the very moment was…\n\"AURA SMASH… MERGE!\" he used the new perk of [Aura Smash] and merged all three crimson fists into a single one, which radiated an intense aura, powerful enough to overwhelm even these classic warriors standing right in front of him.\nEven Stark had a hard time controlling this power yet though as he was forced to hold his right hand's wrist with his left one to be able to focus on the attack, otherwise it would explode in his face (yes, it happened inside the memories museum).\nThe aura around his right hand grew more and more though, and after less than three seconds…\n~FWISH, BOOM~\nHe managed to launch the giant crimson fist at intense speed toward the guards.\n'Come back to me…' he repeated, but this time it was to make his clone's figure seep back into his body as he had left it in front of the guards.\nAnd the moment the clone disappeared… the guards were finally able to see the giant fist, as big as them in terms of height, rushing in their direction.\n\"Ah shit…\" they both said, accepting their fate.\n~BOOOOOM~\nThe fist exploded between the two guards, and they were each sent far away in opposite directions.\n\"-73523! -78472!\" the fist's strength was incredible, although both the guards were wearing highly protective armor and had a large pool of HP.\n[Guard A is knocked out]\n[Guard B is knocked out]\nThis didn't kill them as they had equipment and armor to withstand the attack, but they still received it in the face, meaning they couldn't stay conscious after that.\nIt was fine for Stark though as he began to walk toward the entrance door and opened it.\n'First part of the plan completed…'",

      "content": "Of course, creating such a commotion in a public park would obviously attract the eyes of many people; and so all those that were present nearby stopped to look at whatever was happening.\nMany were terrified to see a giant fist attack two people, but unable to do anything as they just used their phones to film the event.\nStark was wearing the bunny mask, so people couldn't recognize him as he entered the dome and closed the door behind.\nAnd so just like that, people began to speculate more and more on the fact this was possibly the real 'bunny-masked man', and what he was doing here.\nThese simple videos from the people who witnessed what Stark had done would result in the popularity of the 'bunny-masked man' to grow even more than it already was.\n…\n'Hm…' after Stark closed the door, he turned around and found himself… in a completely black space?\nI mean, literally, it was completely dark, with no way to identify the walls, floor or even ceiling, he couldn't see anything, and so navigating inside of this building seemed somewhat impossible.\nMaybe this was made on purpose to stop any intruders.\nBut…\n[Welcome, participant, to the Fellarburg ClassiTop Meeting of 2024!]\nSuddenly, as soon as he took a step forward, making sure not to hit a wall, a blue panel appeared before him.\n[Please follow the arrows to reach the 'Meeting Place'!]\nAnd suddenly, white arrows began to flicker on the ground, leading him through the darkness.\nIt felt weird, why would they have such an elaborate setting for such an event, couldn't they just make a normal building and ask people to head toward a specific room?\n'No… this feels weird…' Stark shook his head.\nHe still decided to follow the arrows as they were his only way to navigate this place without hitting a dozen walls.\nAnd as he walked deeper into the darkness… he found himself in front of a circular elevator.\n[Please select the lowest floor, and enjoy your stay!]\nThe elevator was illuminated, meaning that he could see it from afar, entering it without much issues.\n'No ambush…' he mumbled, otherwise [Focus] would have warned him.\nAnd so he did as he was told and clicked on the lowest floor, which was named 'Omega'.\n~VROOUUUU~\nThe giant circular elevator closed and began to descend.\nBut te closer Stark got to these people and their meeting place, the more some sort of feeling inside of his heart grew.\nWas he scared?\nNo, he wasn't.\nThen was it stress? Anxiousness? Doubt?\n'No… none of those either,' he smiled.\nFrankly, he didn't know why he was doing any of this, he could just go out to the 'Moonless' mansion and meet the 'Archer King' there.\nIt was needless risks that he was taking.\nMaybe it was his pride…?\n[You are reaching your destination in 30 seconds!]\nAnother blue panel appeared while Stark was thinking.\nBut it was once Stark looked down and thought really deeply about why he was doing this, his eyes yet again transforming into a vortex of aura, that he figured it out…\n[THEY ARE MAKING FUN OF US!]\n[DO YOU THINK THEY CARE?!]\n[They probably LAUGHED about our death!]\nThese were such panels that appeared in his dreams, and they were what pushed him to do that.\n'Alright… I get it now…' his face turned cold as the elevator suddenly stopped, and the sound of machinery ended.\n[You have arrived!]\nThe elevator doors slid open, revealing a massive wooden door adorned with intricate carvings. It exuded luxury, complete with two golden ring handles for anyone who wanted to enter.\n'…'\nEven from his stand point, Stark could feel the immense amount of aura coming out from behind this door, there were waves of all sorts of colors escaping from the gaps or the sides.\n~STEP~\nThe tension was at all-time high for him, but strangely, Stark kept a pretty calm and cold face, the ground beneath his feet leaving a crimson mark.\nAfter evry step of his, an image or video of his previous battles appeared all over his surroundings in dozens upon dozens of panels.\nWas it his own body's way to dissuade him of doing what he was about to do?\nIt didn't matter.\nBecause even with all these images… another panel would appear on top of them to keep him going, it was his determination responding.\n[Keep going] were the words that replaced these panels.\nThe battle against Malakar?\n[Keep going]\nThe fight against Judicator?\n[Keep going!]\nHis last encounter with Sierra?\n[KEEP GOING!]\nAll these things were replaced, and so Stark smiled as he reached the door.\nMeeting up with the 100 most powerful people in this country and making them know of your presence would make anyone happy under normal circumstances, but in this very context, it was overwhelming.\nWhatever would happen beyond this door, it would surely change Stark's life, maybe for the better? Maabe for the worse?\n'It doesn't matter…'\nHe placed both of his hands on the ring handles, then got ready to pressure into it.\nBut as he tried to do that…\n[Stop.]\nA crimson panel appeared before him and interupted him again.\n~FWISH, VIOUUU~\nHe heard sounds behind him, and as he turned… he saw himself.\nWell… not really himself, but a replica of himself created from aura.\n[Are you really ready?]\nIt asked, looks like it couldn't speak either, so it used panels.\nNot removing his hands from the handles, Stark looked back and spoke, \"Were you the one who informed of this event?\"\n[…], the other Stark nodded.\n\"Then I can guess you aren't here to stop me, right?\" Stark finally removed his hands from the rings and faced the other him.\n[…], this time, it nodded its head and smiled, [No, I am quite happy about what we're about to do.]\n\"Then why stop?\"\n[I just wanted to say… well… that you should be more confident…]\n\"…\" Stark looked at his hands, traces of aura still visible on them.\n[Confidence is key, do not go in there thinking that it will be easy, you are me, and I am you, so just…], the other Stark momentarilly stopped before pointing at the door and smiling, [Prove to the world that we shouldn't be messed with…]\nAnd just like that, it vanished, no… it didn't vanish, instead it went back into Stark.\nThe moment it did, he felt a surge of energy, and his aura became much stronger than before.\n'…'\nStark then turned back toward the door.\nHe could hear the sounds of laughter, talking, and even some music, coming out from there.\n[They are LAUGHING about our death!]\nHe remembered that panel, and closed his eyes while smirking, and once he opened them back up, they were shining with an aura so powerful it almost seemed like it was burning his pupils.\nAnd so instead of opening the door the easy way like he wanted to do before…\n~FWISH… BAM~\nHe focused his aura into his legs and absolutely smashed the door, destroying it in the process and revealing the interior of that meeting room to him.\nImmediately… all eyes fell on Stark, and the music stopped.",

so dark in fact that you couldn't see the face of a person three meters away from you, meaning that in this dark space, all they could do to see others was to check out their auras, each of their eyes burning with anticipation.\nAmong them were adults, obviously, but also children, teenagers, and even elderly people, after all age didn't matter with such a meeting as it was the top 100 classifiers that were invited.\nAnd so after only another five minutes of silence, five minutes where all of them stared at one another, five minutes where nobody could say or do anything as they had been ordered not to…\n\"HE\" appeared.\n~FWISH, FIOUUUU~\nHis entry was spectacular, appearing out of thin air in the middle of the giant table in a flash of blue light all the while riding a giant blue dragon.\nThe man slid down the tail of the dragon, and with a simple snap of his finger, the creature vanished in a trail of smoke.\n'…'\n'…'\n'…'\nMost people would be speechless at such a scene happening, but all those present were already used to this.\nAnd the person that suddenly appeared in the middle of the table was… the strongest classifier in Fellarburg.\nEven among the crowd, their levels were majorly different, some were level 200, others 500, and some even level 900, but that man on the other hand… was rumored to be over level 1000.\nHis hair was a shade of gold that could rival the sun, styled in a short ponytail, and his emerald eyes held a piercing gaze that seemed to see through everything.\nHis name was… Drakon Greyrat, and he was in his late 50s.\n\"Hello, everybody!\" he warmly smiled, as although he was the strongest, he wasn't as evil and cunning as many of the others.\n'…' nobody answered.\n\"No answer huh, haha~\" he scratched his cheek, \"Well, that's fine, i'm sure you all want me to start the event already as this is only the starting phase…\"\n'…'\n\"I see that our Fellarburg top has grown stronger since last year, this is good,\" he nodded…\nHe was the one that organized such an event in the first place, and was also one of the most respected people in the entirety of the country, his influence even able to affect other countries as well.\nBeing strong was everything in this world after all.\n\"Well, if everyone is present, and there is nothing to say… then no reason not to start the event and make sure all of you can talk with one another!\" he clapped both his hands and suddenly…\n~VIOUUU~\nThe giant table began to descend slowly into the ground, and all the participants were forced to exit their chairs as they began to disappear as well.\nThis was a short introduction, but there was no need to keep it going for long as most of them only wanted what happened next.\nAnd what happened next was… the FREE-TIME…\n~BIM, BIM, BIM~\nSuddenly, all the lights around them turned on, finally allowing them to see their surroundings, and it was… special.\nThey were in a giant party room, with many tables filled with foods and beverages, all of it was luxurious, and it was big enough to hold at least two thousand people, meaning they had more than enough space to talk.\n\"Have fun!\" Drakon lifted both his arms in each side and vividly smiled before disappearing.\nHe didn't participate in such events after all, he only hosted them and explained to people the rules.\nAnd so just like that, all 100 (182 counting the children) were finally allowed to roam around.\nInstantly, they all regrouped around other people they wanted to talk to.\nAnd so the event could finally begin.\n***\n\"What about that rift you discovered, the one with the godless demon apostle?\" a woman asked Arthur, he was surrounded by fifteen other people, and his kids were also just as popular as he was since many others tried to talk with them.\n\"Well… I sent 7 people and they all died after a few hours, and the last person I sent hasn't given any signs of life for 3 weeks, so I'm confident he just died…\" Arthur shrugged as he smiled, not giving a single care about the lives that had been lost.\nLana hearing this felt a pinch in her heart, but no…\n'Stark isn't dead,' she told herself.\n\"I mean, why would they even accept such a mission? Seriously trying to fight Sierra, the apostle that can transform people into monsters with a single arrow… it's a suicide mission!\" a man said, holding his forehead while shaking his head.\n\"You never know…\" Arthur span his wine glass lightly, his gaze indicating he knew that already.\nThe 6% chance of survival he had told Lana was a giant lie, because if he had to guess it… it would be 0.02% at best, he just didn't want his daughter to interrupt Stark from going.\nEven classifiers in this very room could die after being hit by one or two of these arrows, and that is why almost no one took up this mission, at least anyone that didn't know of the true challenge that lay there…\nBut one thing was for sure now… he knew that he had sent Stark to his death, not expecting him to come back ever, no matter how strong you are or how talented, there was no way he could win at his current level.\nTwenty minutes passed like that, and as the party was finally getting started, with people making connections and revealing their achievements…\n~BAM, VIOUM~\nThey heard a loud noise coming from the entrance, and suddenly… the wooden door they used to come inside this room came out of its spot, destroyed by a powerful blow.\nImmediately, all the classifiers stopped what they were doing and looked at the door, and even the music that had been playing until now stopped as well.\nArthur was no different, but his keen archer eyes already warned him of the possibility of who this individual could be.\nBut no… his aura was too powerful for a mere level 25 or 30, and he was gone for 3 weeks, it couldn't be…?\nAnd yet…\nBeyond the destroyed door appeared Stark, a wide grin on his face.\n\"I hope you don't mind me joining the party, Arthur?\" he laughed as he entered the room like he hadn't just destroyed the door.\nAnd suddenly… the atmosphere around them became at least a hundred times more tense and overwhelming.\nDeep inside, many felt that this wasn't good.",

Lana wanted to shout, but she knew that he wanted to keep his identity secret if he was wearing the mask, so she just sobbed silently, happy that he was actually alive.\n\"So… why are you here?\" Arthur lifted his eyebrows, \"It's been 3 weeks with no news from you…\"\n\"…\" Stark didn't answer.\nOf course, all classifiers present here knew that Arthur had acquired the rights to conquer the 'Sierra's Death Path' rift, but hadn't been able to for two months because of the sheer difficulty of the task.\n\"Let me guess… took you 3 weeks to escape that nightmare rift, heh~?\" Arthur smiled, seemingly amused that Stark did all of this for no reason.\n\"Seriously?\"\n\"I mean… no matter how you look at it, there is no way you don't get hit by those arrows…\"\n\"Yeah, he probably ran away, but at least he is alive?\"\nStark remained silent as he heard the murmurs of the crowd, they were mere spectators, but thoroughly enjoyed the drama.\nStark took a few seconds to look at the decoration around the party room, it was lavishly decorated, with paintings and furniture all over, as well as a giant chandelier in the ceiling.\nBut what was most interesting was…\nThe giant screen panel placed in the middle of the room for everyone to see.\nIt didn't take long for Stark to figure out what it was.\n…\n[Top Classifiers of Fellarburg!]\n[Top 100: Naegi, The Electric Blade]\n[Top 99: Ursi, The Torch Woman]\n.\n.\n.\n[Top 8: Arthur, The Archer King]\n[Top 7: Junko, The Despair Queen]\n[Top 6: Ludvik, The Doom Slayer]\n[Top 5: Kirigiri, The White Jade]\n[Top 4: Sonic, The Lightspeed Warrior]\n[Top 3: Olya and Olye, Dream Team Twins]\n[Top 2: Kevin, The Potion Freak]\n[Top 1: Drakon, The Dragon Tamer]\n…\nThe giant screen would occasionally scroll down and up to showcase the names of all the people present, and obviously, the higher the rank, the stronger they were.\nArthur seemed to be the top 8 strongest person in Fellarburg, and as for the others, he had never heard of them, but they were people Stark shouldn't mess with yet.\nThey each had a name, of course, but next to that name was their 'classifier name', something used to identify them, much like Arthur with his 'Archer King' title.\nStark looked around, and he could see on the gazes of all these people that they were mocking him for trying such a reckless thing as defeating that rift which had a 'Godless Demon' apostle inside.\nAnd yet…\n'Spatial Inventory,' the void appeared beside Stark, and he put his hand inside without even looking, pulling out the [Arrow Quiver] that had been rewarded to him for killing Sierra.\n~FWISH, CATCH~\nWith a simple movement, he threw the quiver toward Arthur, who caught it then immediately looked inside.\n'…!' his eyes widened for the first time as he noticed that there was indeed a stack (64) of [Arrows of Sierra] inside, and immediately he lifted his gaze to see Stark smiling.\nPeople were confused, what was that even supposed to mean?\n\"So you did in fact complete that rift,\" Arthur clapped his hands together slowly, \"Didn't expect that.\"\n\"So you expected me to die?\" Stark smiled harder.\n\"…\" Arthur didn't speak for a few seconds, cornered, \"It's just that it's been three weeks, so I thought that you had died,\" he recovered himself.\nThe tension in the air was now becoming palpable, and every classifier looked at one another.\nTHAT rift, which even some of them refused to enter, had been completed by that kid?\nAnd that could only mean one thing…\n\"You didn't get hit by a single arrow?\" it wasn't Arthur who spoke, but another red-haired classifier, he was buff and there seemed to be sharp spikes coming out of his arms, stomach, back, and also at the top of his head.\nEveryone that knew about Sierra and her rift already had the knowledge about her arrows and their special perks, which were something even level 200 classifiers feared.\n\"…\" Stark looked at him for only a single second before turning his gaze back to Arthur, not even bothering to answer.\nHe wasn't interested in the others.\nBut…\n~CRASH, BOOM~\nFrom the same direction the red-haired classifier spoke could be heard a giant boom, and when Stark looked at it, he noticed that another person smashed the ground.\n\"Teach him a lesson, son,\" the classifier that spoke to Stark smiled as his son's eyes began to burn with aura.\nA mini-version of that classifier appeared, he was a bit smaller in size, but his muscles and hair were the exact same.\n[Class: Warrior]\nHe didn't seem to use a weapon either, but just like his father, his entire body was surrounded by sharp spikes, although his control of them seemed to be lacking.\n\"Holy… are Derek and his son Karl getting involved…?\"\n\"I heard Karl is getting into 'Rift Conqueror' too… that boy is dead no matter what he tries now…\"\nThe entrance ceremonies for academies were only in a month, and it looked like Karl wanted to show off in front of the other classifiers, his father also wanting to show that their family was strong.\n\"…\" Stark sighed, he knew that losers like these would appear.\nBut… he just needed to get rid of them.\nAll the attention was now on Stark and Karl, who was approaching the bunny-masked boy, the spikes in his body shaking and moving like waves, and his silver aura growing more after each step.\nBut Stark wasn't impressed.\n'Time to show off my new skills…' he smiled as he began to breath in and out and focus.\nSince the beginning, Stark knew that the top classifiers wouldn't fight with him, he wasn't an 'interesting' opponent after all, which was why they would send off their children at him.\n[FIGHT!]\nA crimson panel appeared before him, and only visible to him, an indicator that he needed to be ready now.",

Maybe he used too much aura into it?\n~FWISH, BIM~\nBut Stark, while still pointing at Karl, turned his hand to the left with a swift movement.\n[Target going left!]\n'Huh…?'\nKarl's figure was surrounded by a faint outline of Stark's crimson aura, and so his [Target Manipulation] activated.\nAs if an unknown force was pushing him, Karl was forced to go in the direction Stark pointed.\nBut that also meant…\n\"SHIT, SHIT, SHIT!!!\"\nThat he was heading straight onto the crimson fist.\n~BOOOOMM~\nHe was hit in full force by the merged fists.\n\"-83723!\" the damage output was phenomenal, almost high enough to kill Stark, and that was only since his [Spike Armor] and equipment protected him.\nKarl was sent flying backwards, his body crashing onto the ground with a loud thud, and the spikes of his [Spike Armor] had been shattered, scattering onto the ground like needles.\n[Karl Spikeford is knocked out!]\nA giant panel appeared above his body for everyone to read.\n'As I said, I would only take one hit to beat him,' Stark smiled as he turned his gaze toward Arthur again.\nSurprisingly enough, no one else from the 'children' group attempted to fight Stark, maybe they got scared, the risk of losing to him too great after he knocked out Karl, who was considered a prodigy, in one attack.\n'Stark!' Lana smiled warmly, happy that he had won.\nBut Aoki and Arthur didn't seem to have the same opinion, as the former took the [Arrow Quiver] with the [Arrows of Sierra] inside and took a step forward.\n\"I hope you don't mind us both having a duel?\" Aoki smiled.\nHe already had his bow ready at any moment, and now that he had the [Arrows of Sierra], he got the complete advantage, as just a few hits from them could incapacitate even the strongest of classifiers, depending on who shot them.\nSo there is no way anybody would accept such an unfair duel-\n\"Sure thing…\" Stark smiled back, but he didn't forget to add a few words to anger Aoki even more, \"Brother-in-law!\"\n\"…\" Aoki's smile disappeared, Stark had noticed it, but every time he got closer to Lana, her brother would always grimace and be mad, he was extremely over-protective.\nAnd so that last sentence got him mad, mad enough to want to get rid of Stark, and he would use the very same arrows he brought here to do that.",

have done that,\" Aoki rolled his eyes, \"Now I'll show you that you need to know your place…!\"\nAnd suddenly… everyone saw it.\n[Duel Request: Aoki Moonless]\n[Type: Deathless]\n[Y/N]\nThese three panels appeared in front of Stark, big enough for everyone to see them.\n\"Aoki-\" Lana tried to reason with her brother, but a single glance from her father shot down her attempt.\n'Frankly… I seriously hate people who do this type of duels…' choosing [Deathless] was a pussy move for Stark as it meant that even though you were ready to fight, you weren't ready to receive the consequences if you somehow lost.\nBasically… Aoki wasn't as confident as he made it seem.\nBut… Stark was so confident he would win that he didn't want to risk angering Arthur or the others by knocking Aoki out, so he pressed \"Y\".\nAoki's smirk widened as the duel began, the tension thick in the air as they faced each other.\nThe giant dome-like arena appeared, it was around 50 meters in size, allowing the two to fight however they liked, and ejecting all of those outside to guarantee a fair fight.\n[3…]\nThe countdown began, and Aoki immediately started to summon his bow.\n[2…]\nStark could feel the weight of the onlookers' eyes, their anticipation palpable, yet his expression stayed as neutral as ever.\n[1…]\n~FWISH, VIOUM~\nAoki's bow appeared in his hands in a flash of sparks, it was very beautiful, and the bow looked extremely powerful, maybe even stronger than Sierra's?\n[FIGHT!]\nStark couldn't forget that inside of this room were the strongest people in all of Fellarburg, and that meant that their gazes being on him right now meant that they were witnessing him in battle.\nMaybe some would hate him, others would like him, and the remainder would have a neutral opinion, it didn't matter.\nBecause all he needed to do now… was win.\nDerek Spikeford didn't even bother looking after his knocked out son either, and it wasn't that he didn't care, but observing Stark in action was much more important for now.\n\"TIME TO END THIS,\" Aoki laughed as he pulled the [Arrow Quiver] filled with [Arrows of Sierra] and took out one of the arrows, pointing at Stark.\nThe boy just blinked though, he didn't see any reasons to attempt anything: his victory was guaranteed since the moment Aoki started the fight with these arrows.\n'Perception…' he decided to still check out his opponent's status window.\n…\n[Name: Aoki Moonless]\n[Level: 187]\n[Class: Archer]\n[HP: 102500]\n[Strength: 2182]\n[Speed: 5973]\n[Stamina: 4024]\n[Defense: 3271]\n[Skills: Shoot, Target Lock, Element Merge, Instant Arrow, Archer's Eyes, Sky Barrage, Hunter, Arrow Inventory, Aoki's Ultimate Arrow…]\n…\nYet again, the skill showed him the overall stats of Aoki, and it was obvious he was much stronger than Karl, plus he would probably soon enough reach the top 100 of Fellarburg if he continued like that.\nHis stat points were also extremely high, and Stark knew that he had no chance to ever hope of winning against him under normal circumstances.\nBut not this time…\n\"SHOOT, TARGET LOCK!\" Aoki grabbed three [Arrows of Sierra] and aimed at Stark's weak points, focusing all his energy into the shots.\nThe [Arrows of Sierra] when shot by a normal human didn't have the same effect as when the apostle did it, instead, it worked like this:\n-The first time you get hit, you are stunned for a few seconds.\n-The second time, you are not only stunned, but your movements are decreased as the white mist infects your legs.\n-And the third time you are hit is game over as the mist infects you completely and paralyzes you, your body becoming white by the crystals.\nOf course you wouldn't transform into a monster, but that pretty much guaranteed victory for the enemy as he could eliminate you easily.\nStark didn't move or show any sign of fear though.\nHe closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and got ready for impact.\nAoki's aura was overwhelming, and it completely surrounded the three arrows as he shot them, making them all leave a beautiful trail of aura.\nIn addition to that, Aoki added the [Target Lock] buff to his arrows, it was one of his most powerful skills, and also a big reason as to why he was recognized, it was a rare skill to have.\n…\n[Skill: Target Lock]\n[Description: You can set a 'lock' on a target, and once that lock is set, any arrow will directly fly toward it, no matter what direction you shoot at.]\n…\nAnd that's exactly what he did as…\n[A 'lock' has been placed on you]\nAbove his head appeared a crimson marksman symbol.\n\"Oh… he is using that…\"\n\"All he needs is three arrows to end this fight!\"\n\"More like one, that kid won't survive a single hit…\"\nBut Stark just sighed, a wide smile on his face.\nHe wasn't scared of these arrows after all as he had already avoided and even got his by dozens of them.\nAnd this meant that since the beginning, it was an impossible battle for Aoki as…\n[You are immune to the mist]\nThese [Arrows Of Sierra] couldn't affect him, his body creating some sort of antivirus towards them after being hit inside of the rift.\nHe would have surely won if he took other arrows as a single one could kill him, but in this very situation… Stark was confident.\nAnd so without a single care in the world… he dashed toward Aoki, which also meant taking the arrows straight on.\nThe overall reaction of the crowd was… IS HE CRAZY?!",

      "content": "The three arrows flew toward Stark with incredible speed, their beautiful trails of aura adorning the air around them.\nTheir tips were as sharp as swords and glowed with a malevolent energy.\nStark, however, didn't seem to be fazed at all, his eyes were locked onto his target, his expression determined and unwavering.\n~FWISH~\nHe avoided the first arrow quite easily, then the second, and finally the third.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" then this time, without merging his fists, he sent all three toward Aoki.\nBut it was no use…\n~DODGE, DODGE, DODGE~\nAoki's speed was still way higher than Stark's, and there was no chance a projectile would hit him.\n~DASH~\nKnowing that, Stark closed the distance between the two, allowing him to fight with Aoki on close-range, something an archer should never do.\nBut the moment he reached him…\n~VIOU, BAM~\nHe was hit by an arrow from behind.\n'Ah shit… the arrows come back to the target…' he had thought of this possibility, but was too focused on closing the distance to avoid.\n'Crimson Spears…' he decided to make use of his spears and hit the arrows with them though.\nThe moment that happened, the mark above his head disappeared, which meant that these arrows only stopped following him if they hit something, or were destroyed.\nWas this why this skill was considered so powerful among archers?\n[Hit once!]\n~BAM~\nWhile he was thinking of that, Aoki took advantage of this opportunity to spin around and slam Stark's head using his bow.\n\"-12817!\"\nHe was sent flying in the opposite direction, and that simple attack (which didn't even do that much damage to be honest), but…\n[Stark HP: 4933/12750]\nOne more attack and Stark would lose, the sole reason why he hadn't died because of the 'Domination Armor' which blocked 5000 HP.\n'Why does he hit so hard while not even shooting…' Stark didn't know it, but the bow Aoki had was from the 'Mythical' class, just as good in precision as it is in close-range because of its hard materials.\nThis did indeed put Stark on one HP, but his confidence didn't falter either.\n\"INSTANT ARROW,\" Aoki grabbed another arrow, and at a speed so fast pretty much half the people in the room couldn't see it, he shot it toward Stark.\nThe arrow also received the [Instant Arrow] buff, which increased its speed so much it reached Stark in less than a second.\n~BIM~\n[Hit Twice!]\nThese arrows are extremely strong, and so to make up for it, they do not do any sort of damage to the target.\n\"Ouch~ one more…\"\n\"Its over…\"\nPeople were still interested in the fight, but by this point it was already over.\nAnd yet… many of them wondered… why was Stark still smiling.\n'Alright… should have done that since the beginning…'\nHe didn't like to overwhelm opponents at the start of a fight since he wanted to see their abilities and also… make them understand that they can't win against him.\n\"CLONE FRENZY!\" he summoned his two clones beside him, and they nodded as they understood what Stark wanted them to do.\nThey traced a circle in the palm of their hands and envisioned where there wanted it to go, then…\n\"HEAVEN'S WRATH!\" they both activated the skill.\nUnder normal circumstances, an archer as fast as Aoki would have enough space to run away from the beam, but in this case, he was locked in an arena.\n\"=)\"\nStark's clones positioned [Heaven's Wrath] perfectly as to not allow Aoki to go to the sides, otherwise he would just be disintegrated.\nAnd so, as the giant crimson sparkles in the ceiling charged up…\n\"Hey, what are they doing-\"\nHis eyes widened as he felt the intense aura, and he looked up to see that at incredible attack was coming.\n'SHIT!' due to the lack of time, he couldn't run to the sides, and so he was forced to dash forward.\nBut this was a mistake…\n\"DOUBLE ASSAULT!\"\n~BOOOMM, BIIEMMM~\nThe two giant beams erupted at the same time, coming from the sky and converging right on top of Aoki.\nThe force of the attack was so immense that it created shockwaves throughout the entire arena, shaking the ground beneath everyone's feet.\n\"Wow…\"\n\"This is insane…\"\nAs if coming from the heaven's, the crimson beam fascinated everyone.\n\"YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD GET ME WITH THAT-?\" Aoki almost got hit, but he smiled again as he turned his gaze back toward Stark, \"Huh?\"\nBecause of [Double Assault] and his low HP, Stark's domination made him so fast that he was already right in front of Aoki.\n\"=)\"\n~BOOM~\nStark punched his face as hard as he could.\n\"-84827!\" the damage output was something even Stark had never been able to do before, he was also soon reaching the 100,000 damage mark!\nAoki was sent flying in the opposite direction, and he could thank the heaven's that [Heaven's Wrath] stopped working right as he was about to enter it again.\n'The duration was cut in half… is it because the two clones were using it at the same time?'\nAs Aoki landed, his entire body was shaking through the pain.\nBut he still wasn't down.\n\"TARGET LOCK!\" he grabbed not 3, not 5, but 10 [Arrows of Sierra] and began to pull the stringer with all of them in his hands.\nThis was a difficult feat to achieve for most archers, but thanks to [Target Lock], all the arrows would indeed fly toward their target.\n~VRIM, VRIM, VRIM~\nThe 10 arrows flew towards Stark with incredible precision and speed, their beautiful trails of aura adorning the air around them.\nBut this time… Stark didn't even bother to avoid them.\nHe TRULY wanted to show Aoki that he didn't have any chance to begin with, well to be honest, he would have had a higher chance of winning by simply using his bow as a weapon.\nEven though the arrows were flying at him, Stark's face never changed expression. He stood firm and waiting for the arrows to strike.\nAnd when the first one hit…\n[Hit Thrice!]\n[Effects of 'Arrow of Sierra' activating…]\n\"GOTCHA!\" Aoki laughed, and to add to the fuel, the other 9 arrows also hit Stark, which meant that he would potentially be paralyzed for a few days if he kept him like that.\nNot losing a single second, Aoki dashed forward, wanting to step on Stark's face and proving to everyone present that the Moonless family, and himself, shouldn't be messed with.\nBut… while his confidence was at his max… the unthinkable happened.\n\"Do you know how I managed to defeat this rift,\" Stark opened one of his eyes, a burning crimson fire visible in them, a wide smile on his face.\n'…?!' the fact that he could talk was weird, after all, all his muscles were supposed to be paralyzed by the mist.\nAoki stopped in his momentum at that moment, \"No… no way…\" but he resumed heading toward Stark, this time walking.\nAnd right as he got close to Stark… a panel that made everyone's eyes widen appeared above the boy.\n[Determination is too strong!]\n[Not affected by 'Arrows of Sierra'!]\nAoki's jaw was wide open as he read the message, and the moment he gazed down at the smiling Stark, he could see that his aura was almost five times as overwhelming as before.\nAnd so during that brief instant of doubt…\n[Aoki Moonless has received the DOMINATED status!]\nHe knew this guy was bad news.",

Aoki's pressure increased as he saw that Stark was still slowly walking toward him, not even caring about the attack, 'WELL, THAT'S GOOD FOR ME!'\n~FWISSHHHH~\nThe structure of his ultimate aura was nearing completion, the air around it distorting...\n\"I WON!\" Aoki got ready to shoot as his attack was charged up.\nBut...\n'Huh?' he felt an intense pressure from behind, something was holding his arms, not allowing him to fire.\nAnd as he looked behind him... he saw the two clones, both shaking their heads as if they were disappointed.\nAoki had been too focused on Stark, completely ignoring the two clones that he had summoned, and that was his biggest mistake.\n~BAM, BAM~\nThe two punched him at the same time, each strike sounding like a bullet being fired.\n\"-32617! -34818!\"\nHe was sent toward Stark, and of course the boy didn't miss a chance to finish him in a stylish way.\n~KICK~\nHe kicked Aoki's stomach when he got closer, making his entire figure distort as it removed the air from his lungs.\nAnd so he was sent flying toward the ceiling.\n\"-58271!\"\nHe was already dead from the clones' punches, so the arena barrier disappeared and he effectively crashed into the ceiling, before falling to the ground and being caught by Arthur.\n[Winner: REDACTED (Bunny-Masked Man)!]\nA golden panel appeared in the middle of the room for everyone to see.\nAnd instantly...\n\"NICE!\"\n\"That was cool!\"\n\"That damage is crazy...!\"\nSurprisingly, many people around him complimented him, while the remainder of them remained calm.\n'…' Aoki laid there defeated, his body unconscious since you would always go down to recover after dying inside of a duel.\n\"Amazing…\" Arthur smiled, even he was impressed, and he had also hoped that Stark would win (he would of course never say that to Aoki).\nBut of course, winning in a duel meant one other thing too…\n[You have beaten 'Aoki Moonless' in duel, gaining reward: 582437EXP!]\nAnd so that… Stark was surrounded by the golden golem in front of everybody's eyes.\n[Your level has increased to level 33, granting you two skill points and boost in stats]\n[Experience: 14737/712000]\nHe had almost forgotten about the fact that winning a duel against another classifier meant that he would steal some EXP, in that case it was enough to allow him to level up.\n'He probably went down one or two levels to give me this…' Stark smiled.\n'Spatial Inventory…' he mumbled before taking out three [Potions of Regeneration] and drinking them all, after all he didn't know when any of these people would attack.\nBut… Stark's intuition made him feel like he wouldn't fight anymore.\n\"Hey, Archer King…\" Stark spoke, and all the chatter in the room suddenly stopped, all classifiers, even the most powerful of them, wanting to hear what Stark was about to say.\nThey were in front of an up-and-coming prodigy, many realized it.\n\"Yes, Mr. Bunny?\" Arthur smiled, he knew of Stark's identity but kept it a secret as saying his name would be too easy.\nHow many guild and organization leaders would love to have him as a member? He couldn't allow that…\nHe quickly glanced at his daughter, then smiled: Stark was the perfect protection to her if something ever happened as he couldn't always be around.\n\"You know what I asked for, right?\" Stark mimicked the sign of money with his fingers, he didn't say what it was about though as asking to join the 'Rift Conqueror' academy would make him so much easier to find.\n\"Oh~ but of course, I'll be sending all the information to you soon,\" Arthur smiled, \"Thank you for the arrows.\"\n\"No problem…\" Stark nodded and turned around, \"Oh! See you soon, Lana,\" he waved at the girl, he hadn't paid attention to her since he was too focused on actually surviving.\n\"B-Bye!\"\n\"Goodbye… FATHER-IN-LAW!\" Stark added as well as he turned his slightly toward Arthur, a wide smile on his face.\n\"Bye, son-in-law,\" Arthur went along with it, smiling just as hard, a small amount of aura pouring out from his body.\nAnd yet… this small amount was enough to make Stark squint his eyes: he was way too strong, and it would take a while to win.\nOnce Stark left the room, one of the [Magus] class used his staff to place the wooden doors back in their place, effectively repairing them completely, and stopping anybody from seeing Stark.\nBut the boy didn't turn back, instead he just went inside the elevator and clicked on the main floor, meaning the entrance.\n[Good job…]\nA crimson panel appeared before Stark, but he was already lost in thought, holding his head: this was a terrifying experience.\nAnd surely… now all the strongest classifiers in the country, as well as all their children present, knew about him.\n'I need to be careful… need to get stronger…' he mumbled over and over as the elevator kept going up.",

Excitement? Ecstasy?\nHe didn't know… but at least he balanced it all out.\nAnd so by the time the elevator stopped on the first floor and he got out, his face was back to normal, and he managed to take complete control over his aura.\n'Need to get stronger…' he mumbled, his eyes burning yet again, and a vortex forming inside of them, 'Stronger… stronger… stronger…'\nHe kept repeating this word over and over until he reached the entrance door again, and left.\nOnce outside, Stark took a deep breath and started walking home. The events of the day had left him shaken, but also energized.\nHis plan of showing himself to the others, while also forcing Arthur to respond positively to his return was a complete success.\n['Rift Conqueror' academy entrance in one month…]\nHe still had one month before finally beginning his REAL entrance into the world of classifiers.\nHe was frankly interested to see what this school was about as he knew that it had a 95% if not more failure rate, meaning that out of 1000 people allowed, only around 50 would pass the first year, and even less the second.\nBut until then… he needed to become stronger, way stronger…\nKarl was simply beaten since he had underestimated Stark, and Aoki didn't have his real arrows.\nIt wasn't complete luck, of course, but it was just that Stark took advantage of the circumstances to come out on top.\n'…'\nStark reached his hotel room quite easily after hailing for a taxi and he jumped on his bed, exhausted, it was around 5pm, but he was still tired nonetheless since fighting decreased his stamina.\n'Ways to get stronger…' but he kept thinking of that.\n[Memories Museum] was his most obvious option, but it didn't increase his level, and training his movements would have a limit at some point\nThe second option was the [Devil's Abyss Key] which he had gotten from killing Judicator, but he currently had no idea where it was located, and how he could open it…\nHe still remembered that its description stated that three 'Godless Demon' apostles were inside, and it would surely be his hardest rift yet… but for now he was safe.\nHe played with the key for a little while, inspecting it to see if it had any secrets, it was completely crimson, with traces of rust all over it, and its edge had two devil horns as well as holes which resembled a skull.\nAnd when he taped it with his finger three times… something happened.\n~GROOOWALLl~\nA large sound could be heard all over Stark's room, which surprised him, and then…\nA crimson panel, one that had a fire aura around it, as well as a two black horns on top, and a moving tail on its back, appeared.\n[The 'Devil's Abyss' rift has not been opened yet, but it will be available very soon.]\n[Whoever owns this key, watch out, many will try to take it from you, and trying to go inside by yourself is guaranteed death.]\n[Good luck… the devils are waiting for you…]\n'Huh…' he had never seen that before since he immediately put the key into his [Spatial Inventory], but it seemed like that thing was much important than he expected.\nWas it another secret rift that would cause uproar? It sure looked like it if even the key warned him that people would want to steal it from him.\nIn the end, he decided to put it back into the inventory and he would keep it there until he found the entrance of that rift.\n'Last options to get stronger… find a common rift people go to and level up there, or go outside to the dangerous zone…' this was all he could think off as finding unique rifts like he did before wasn't easy, and he couldn't ask Arthur for another one after such an event today, 'Welp, I think I'll just find out tomorrow…'\nHe spent the rest of the day lazing around in his room, and watching videos of people analyzing his fights (narcissistic much?), he frankly enjoyed being in the spotlight.\nAnd so just like that… it was time for Stark to sleep, the sun had sipped below the horizon and the moon rose up to watch over him in the night.\nAlthough… the moon wasn't the only thing watching him… but he didn't know that yet.",

Stark couldn't deny he was interested to see what it would look like with 10 of them in here, it would probably be chaos though.\n\"Love me or hate me, I'm still here,\" The Alchemist rubbed his two vials, beneath his feet the ground was completely white with a weird marble texture, resembling the ground of a laboratory.\nAnd after only a few minutes of talking... the two Stark suddenly stopped whatever they were doing and turned toward the original.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nTheir eyes looked almost sad, although they had no pupils at all and their entire body was made of aura so it was hard to see.\n\"...?\" Stark was confused, but... a panel suddenly appeared before him.\nIt was crimson in color, but its edges had vials, a merge of both [Domination] and [Alchemist] speaking to him.\nAnd its content was... rather shocking.\n[The Second Domination Trial is arriving soon.]\nThis was all that was written, and it was enough to make Stark's eyes widen.\nIf the first Domination trial was already hard enough to kill off 4 of the most promising classifiers from this class... then what could the second one possibly be about.\n[It is harder than the first, and it will start the moment you and the 'others' reach level 50!]\n'The others...' Stark mumbled, it clearly meant that this Domination trial would yet again have him fight alongside others, with the possibility of only one person being allowed to survive again.\nPlus, it being at level 50 would mean the difficulty would skyrocket.\n\"Ah shit... but I need to get stronger so can't really escape that,\" he sighed, and the two other Stark smiled.\n[That's all... for now...]\nAnd so the two bowed before seeping back into the ground, and the entire realm began shaking like crazy.\n'Waking up...' he thought as he looked up, a blinding light growing more and more in the void's sky.\n~FWISH~\n~BWIING~\nStark woke up shortly after.\n***\n'Shit...' was Stark's first thought as he got up from his bed, holding his forehead.\nAnother Domination Trial so soon was harsh, but if he didn't get stronger, there was little to no chance he survived inside the 'Rift Conqueror Academy', basically... he was fucked either way.\n'I might as well try my luck with the Domination trial...' he sighed as he opened his phone, he felt extremely hungry for some reason.\nAnd when he checked the date...\n\"OH COME ON...!\" three days had passed, three days he had spent completely asleep, three days, while felt like mere minutes inside his mind.\nAnd of course, dozens upon dozens of messages from Lana appeared as soon as he was connected to his phone.\n'Here goes the tsundere…' he didn't bother to read any text beside the last one.\n{Lana Moonless: I need to leave for a rift soon as the academy requires to get stronger, please send a message!!!!}\n'…'\n{Stark Heartsouls: Have fun :)}\nObviously, he didn't get an answer or even a read like he usually did since she was probably fighting monsters by this point.\n'Well… I also need to find a way to get stronger…' he still had his own problems to solve, so he paced around the hotel room, thinking of his possibilities.\nLooking for another secret rift was out of the question since they were extremely rare to begin with.\nHe could also try and conquer a random rift too, but most were owned by classifiers.\nHow do you somehow manage to claim a rift like Arthur did with [Sierra's Death Path] you might ask?\nWell, what else than money and power!\nThere are actually 'Rift Auctions' held in private places for the rich, and he effectively bought it from there, which seemed kinda weird as… you know… anybody can enter the rift if they find it…?\n'Heh~ I don't know,' Stark shrugged, not that interested in that as it wouldn't help either, \"But what about going outside?\"\nIt was indeed risky, but if he spent long enough outside the barrier of Fellarburg, inside the semi-danger zone, then he could definitely gather experience quickly.\n'But… it's not that convenient to do that, is it not…?' Stark kept walking around, but his stomach quickly reminded him that he hadn't eaten for three days straight, and that he should get to it before he died.\n~CLANG~\nHe grabbed a plate and put it on the table before pulling out five different meals from his [Spatial Inventory]\nBut the moment he sat down… he noticed that there were things placed on his table.\n'Huh…?' he was sure that they weren't there before… 'What the fuck?'\nThere were two envelopes on the table, each with the 'Moonless' family crest in the middle of it.\nStark immediately tried to reach for them, but this time, it was another crimson panel that stopped him.\n[WARNING! You should eat quickly!]\n[You have received the 'FAMISHED' status!]\n[-10 HP…! -10 HP…! -10 HP…!]\n'HUH?' his HP was reducing every second that passed.\n[When you are extremely hungry, you do not die instantly, your HP just get reduced little by little, but if they do reach 0, you will die!]\n\"Huh, so it's like in minecra-\"\n~ZAP~\n\"-100!\"\n'Fuck…' he quickly began to ate though and soon enough, the \"FAMISHED\" status disappeared, and his HP slowly began to go back up.\nAnd once he was finished with all his food… he immediately grabbed both the envelopes and placed them in front of him.\nIf they were from the 'Moonless' family, then it obviously meant that it was Arthur who sent them, although that would indeed mean that he ordered people to infiltrate his room while he was asleep to deliver them…\n'…' it was a rather disturbing thought, but he was confident [Focus] would have immediately woken him up if there was any sort of killing intent.\nAnd so just like that, Stark opened the first envelope and began reading its content…",

Stark was confused\nThe first envelope contained a luxurious letter, as well as… A CHEQUE!?\n\"YES!\" Stark didn't even need to check the amount, he was already happy, he sure did love money.\n…\n[Cheque:] 5 million rher coins\n…\n'Nice…' he nodded happily before picking up the letter that was with the cheque.\nThe message was written by Arthur, which would already be a miracle for anyone to receive since the 'Archer King' was always busy and didn't have time for anyone, but Stark didn't seem to mind.\n…\n[Hello, Stark\nAs promised, here are the 5 million rher coins for the mission, and as for the rest, your tuition has already been paid, and your spot for the 'Rift Conqueror Academy' was secured.\nYou will be able to go there from next month onward, hope you succeed in graduating…\nArthur.]\n…\n\"…\" and so with that, Stark could finally feel that going through all the trouble of fighting his way through [Sierra's Death Path] was worth it, other than just to complete his [ApostleDex] of course.\nUsing his phone, he scanned the cheque and claimed the money inside his account.\nAnd so with that, his overall assets ranged around 7.76 million rher coins.\nThinking that he went from 0 to this insane number brought a smile to Stark's face, but of course he couldn't forget that he would need to spend lots to buy ingredients in the future, as well as interesting items if he saw them: it meant that money was always needed, no matter how much he had of it.\nAfter finishing with the first envelope, Stark moved on to the second one, curious about what else Arthur might have left for him as everything had already been said.\nAs he tore open the envelope, only a small letter fell, one much shorter than even the previous one.\nAnd when he picked it up…\n~DING~\nHe heard a notification from a panel, but he decided to read it after the letter.\n…\n[Want to get stronger? Head to the 'Fighting District' and search for the 'Rift Storer Association'!]\n…\nThis was all that was written, but… somehow, it interested Stark much more than anything else.\nWasn't it too convenient of a timing? He was looking for a way to get stronger and then all of a sudden the 'Archer King' himself helps him out?\n[Talent: Chosen One, Activated!]\n'Of course…' he sighed as he noticed that the panel that had made a sound earlier was exactly what he thought it would be.\nPlus, there was also the fact Arthur saw Stark fight before, and thought that it would be better to have him level up before reaching the academy…\nIn the end, he truly couldn't understand how any of those 'Moonless' folks thought… but they were useful for now.\n[27 days before 'Rift Conqueror Academy' entrance ceremony!]\nAround a month was left for him to get stronger, but should he try to reach level 50 before that or… wait?\nThe domination trial would happen no matter what he tried or thought, so there was no point in trying to escape it.\nIn the end, Stark left his hotel room with more questions than answers, and hailed for a taxi, asking the driver to send him to the 'Fighting District', which was just as big as the 'Trading District' if not more as it was where everyone who actively fought in rifts was.\nBasically…\n\"Holy…\"\nIt was a place for strong people.\nAfter 40 minutes, Stark reached the 'Fighting District', it was separated from the heart of the city by quite a distance, although not enough to consider it very far.\nIt was around 1pm, yet there were hundreds, if not thousands of classifiers roaming around, their weapons in hands.\nThe atmosphere was charged with energy, each passerby exuding a sense of power.\n\"…\" but in comparison to what he saw and experienced before, all of this seemed pretty dull, but maybe it was just a feeling.\nStark took his first step into the district, making sure not to bump into anybody as people in this area were much more aggressive than those in the trading one.\nAll of them seemed ready to battle whoever even dared to do anything, although it wouldn't matter much since Stark could beat them…\nAs he navigated the district, he spotted many shops also selling goods related to rift exploration, as well as some luxurious displays with legendary/mythical items that cost a fortune on them.\n\"Level 100 training dummies, use them however you like, they don't break!\" some guy was promoting an object to train.\n\"So you want to create a party, we're going to be 4…\" while others were busy trying to find teammates.\nBut in the end, this wasn't where most of the activity was located… not at all…\n'Rift Storer Association,' he mumbled, and once he looked up… he found himself in front of a giant building, at least five times the size of the biggest one in the 'Trading District', hundreds of people coming in and out of it.\nAbove the entrance was a holographic screen that displayed the name: \"Rift Storer Association\".\n'Well… that's the place, so might as well go for it…' he had heard several people talk about it while he was heading there, as well as some other place called the [Classifier Colosseum], but he would maybe check it out later.\nThe interior of the 'Rift Storer Association' was bustling with activity, people from all over the city filling the spacious lobby, which somehow still had enough space to navigate easily even with all these people, it truly was enormous.\nThe appearance of it was quite luxurious, with marble floors and grand chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, illuminating the room in a soft golden light, although the 'theme' was more neon than anything else as colored lights were everywhere.\nDozens of screens greeted him wherever he looked, and there were many halls to go through, basically, the possibilities were endless, and he could easily guess this was the most popular building in the district.\nAnd when he felt lost…\n\"Hello, sir, how may I help you?\" one of the agents placed in this place to help out new classifiers appeared.\nShe was beautiful, but her appearance didn't interest Stark enough for him to take note of it.\n\"I would like to go to the area to get stronger, if that is possible…?\" he asked, unsure if those words were right.\n\"Oh, then I get you are looking for high risk high reward~ you should immediately head toward the 'Rifts' section then, and you should find everything!\" she pointed at a specific hallway, with the section name illuminated above with a neon, then quickly went to help the next customer.\n'…' Stark sighed, he truly didn't know what to expect, all of this was TOO new for him, and he felt like the more he stayed in this world, the more things he discovered about it.\nHe immediately headed toward the 'Rifts' section, which also seemed to be the one with the highest amount of people.\nAnd when he emerged on the other side of the hall… he found himself in yet another giant room, maybe even bigger than the lobby?\nThe first thing that appeared in front of him as he entered a room filled with other classifiers were two blue panels.\n[Please choose the rift you want to enter!]\n[Warning! Those below recommended level won't be admitted inside of a rift!]\nIt truly was a weird place… but if it could help Stark level up… then why not?",

      "content": "Inside of the [Rift] section's giant room were many other halls, each leading to another place further inside the 'Rift Storer Association'.\n'Huh…' Stark was confused, but this time he just decided to figure it out by himself.\n[Please choose the rift you want to enter!]\n[Warning! Those below recommended level won't be admitted inside of a rift!]\nThose were the words the panel had told him.\nAnd so that meant…\n'I think I got it…' he lifted his gaze, and as guessed, above each of the hallways was a neon title that differed in colors.\nThe hall all the way to the right had the title [Level 10-20 Rift] above, the one next to it was [Level 20-30 Rift] and it continued like this until reaching [Level 240-250 Rift].\nBasically… there was a chance that each hall led to a rift where people could train by fighting and killing monsters, as well as level up.\nHe could see many people, from all classes and levels, head toward a specific hall without any issues.\nSome others were even trying to form teams on a whim inside the room, which seemed kind of dumb, but who knows.\n[You are level… 33!]\n[Please choose the rift you want to go to, note that the barrier will block you from going to a rift higher than your level as to stop needless deaths and reduce risks!]\n'Hell nah…' Stark refused to go to the [Level 30-40 Rift] area as the enemies there would all get one-shotted by him, plus it would take him way too much time.\nAnyone that heard him think like that would probably think he was crazy, but to him, it made complete sense.\nAnd so he immediately headed toward the [Level 80-90 Rift] area as it was the maximum he could achieve at this very moment with his abilities, any higher and it would be extremely risky, although Stark couldn't say he hadn't risked his life every time.\n\"Let's go there!\"\n\"Hunt those monsters and come back!\"\n\"Let's go together I said, let's goooo!\"\nPeople around were chatting, and it kind of annoyed Stark as the sound was overwhelming.\nAround each of the hall's entrances was some sort of energy barrier that shone brightly.\nWhen someone of the required level tried to pass, it would obviously let them pass without any issues.\n[Access Allowed!]\nAnd on the other hand… if you ever tried to slip through…\n~BZIP, ZAPPP~\nThey were pushed back by a high amount of electric energy.\n[Access Denied, level not high enough to attempt this rift, please do not try again!]\n\"You fucking liar, you told you were level-\" and with that many problems would occur, but as it said before, it was to reduce the risks.\nFrankly, Stark didn't really care much about that warning, for him it was either a high level rift or just going to the danger-zone outside of Fellarburg, basically he was too lazy to grind against hundreds of monsters for one level.\nAs Stark approached the entrance to the [Level 80-90 Rift], he felt a surge of anticipation mixed with a hint of caution.\nThe purple energy barrier was right in front of him, and people beside him were passing by.\nHe noticed that the more he went toward the high level rifts, the fewer people there were around.\nHe got a few weird looks from others though: Stark hadn't activated his aura yet, so for the others, he just looked like some new classifiers trying to explore.\nBut…\n'Let's get this over with…' he took a step toward the purple barrier, the faint glow emitting on his face.\nAnd when he tried to pass…\n~BZIP, ZAPPP~\n[Access Denied, level not high enough to attempt this rift, please do not try again!]\n'…'\nOf course, such an occurrence always resulted in people mocking you for trying to fight inside a rift higher than your level.\nBut Stark didn't care at all, instead his eyes burned brighter with determination and… he tried again.\n~BZIP, ZAPPP~\n[Access Denied, stop trying!]\nThis time the shock was more powerful, but Stark didn't stop, he kept going.\n~BZIP, ZAPPP~\n[Access Denied, we already told you to stop!]\nAgain.\n[STOP. TRYING.]\nAnd again.\n[WHY DO YOU KEEP TRYING!?]\nThe shock was becoming more and more powerful, and by now it would be enough to make even a classifier at level 80 faint, yet Stark's aura and determination kept him going.\n'DOMINATION!' he activated his power as he dashed at the purple barrier again.\nBy now, all the attention was on the boy that kept trying to access an area far higher than his level, and the mockery and laughter turned into worry.\n\"Why does he keep trying?\"\n\"Is he crazy?\"\n\"Death wish maybe? These newbies really need to give up…\"\nBut it wasn't only the barrier that was powering up after each attempt: Stark's aura also grew more and more.\nIt was either he passes that shitty barrier, or he faints while trying.\n\"This is crazy…\" one of the bystanders muttered under his breath, genuinely concerned about Stark's actions.\nHowever, as Stark made another assault on the energy barrier, it began to emit a deafening noise, and a sudden flash of purple light engulfed Stark.\n[AcCEsS… DEnI…Ed…]\nStark's aura completely shielded him from the shock, and so his body slowly pushed through the barrier, first it was his feet, then his hands, and then his entire torso…\nFor a moment, time seemed to stand still as the barrier pulsed with energy, and then silence fell.\nThe people around exchanged astonished glances, waiting to see what would happen next.\nAnd after a few seconds… the energy barrier flickered slightly, allowing Stark to pass.\n[Access Allowed…]\nOf course, it wasn't solely because Stark pushed its limits that it allowed him to pass but because… the barrier itself could sense his aura.\nA barrier isn't sentient at all, but its sole job is to check the level and power of a classifier to decide if he is allowed to pass or not, and in this case… although Stark's level was extremely low compared to the recommended one, his aura told it that he would easily be able to survive.\nAnd so it allowed him to pass.\nStark came out on the other side of the barrier, now allowed to reach the rift, and so he looked back at the other classifiers, a giant grin on his face.\nAll of them were flabbergasted at the scene that occurred before them, yet unable to do anything as… well… what could they do, and why would they even interfere to begin with?\nAnd so just like that, Stark began to walk through the hallway alongside the other people that were level 80-90, he didn't know what awaited him, but it better be worth it.\nAll he wanted was to level up after all…",

      "content": "Stark went deeper into the hall, many other classifiers talking, and some rare ones even pointing at him for being an anomaly: the barrier clearly stated his level was way too low, yet he still managed to pass somehow thanks to his sheer determination and aura that even it (the barrier) could detect.\nAnd so when he reached the end of the hallway… he finally saw it, a massive purple portal crackling with energy.\nIt was just there, the area near it corrupted by the remnants of aura that came out of it, and dozens of classifiers were coming in and out like it was nothing.\n'Hm…' Stark scratched his chin…\nIt was the entrance to the [Level 80-90 Rift], and frankly, Stark did NOT know how they managed to bring a rift portal all the way here, but it was indeed useful.\nAnd so Stark with no hesitation whatsoever passed the threshold and yet again had that sensation of being transported somewhere else, it was all too familiar to him, and it meant that he was indeed going inside of a rift.\n[Welcome to the 'Strands of Corruption' rift…!]\nAnd so after a few seconds, Stark was finally able to emerge on the other side.\nHis vision was blurry, but it quickly adjusted as he looked up.\nHe was standing on gray ground, and beside him were dozens of other classifiers, some already fighting monsters.\n\"KEN IS DOWN, FUCK!\"\n\"Take that!\"\n\"Haha got him~\"\nPeople were doing their own things… and so Stark decided to just go somewhere else.\nThis rift worked like all the normal others, meaning that the further he went, the harder it would become, and it also meant that there was a chance that the boss was still there if it wasn't already defeated or if it spawned again.\nThe 'Strands of Corruption' rift was weird, there was only a single area before reaching the boss, which wasn't even that far, maybe that was why it was selected as a rift for training?\nThe ground was gray, with occasional dark and purple trees that emitted aura, as well as dozens upon dozens of monsters that swarmed the land, other than that, the sky was also just as gray as the land, with no moon/sun or any clouds at all.\nIt felt… empty, almost as if the once blooming view was now reduced to… nothing.\n'The strands of corruption…' Stark thought, for some reason he had a bad feeling, he shouldn't be thinking so much about a simple name, yet here he was.\nHe had a feeling… that it would be important later.\nThe 'Corruption' was something he noted in his mind for later.\nBut as he thought of that…\n\"GROAOORAAAAA~\"\nA deafening roar echoed through the rift, causing Stark and the other classifiers to pause in their tracks.\nThe ground trembled beneath their feet as a massive shadow came out of the ground a bit further from the portal, blotting out what little light there was in the desolate landscape.\n'…'\nIt was a colossal, grotesque beast with scales as black as obsidian and eyes that glowed a sinister shade of purple, as well as giant wings that looked like they could strangle you.\nIts mouth dripped with purple venom, and its sharp claws scraped against the ground, leaving deep gouges in its wake, it was standing on its legs, but also its two long arms.\n'What the fuck is that thing…' even Stark was taken aback, it truly was incomprehensible.\n['The Corrupted Ghoul lv85', an ELITE event mini-boss, has appeared, step forward if you want to fight it!]\n'Huh… looks like an event is happening,' Stark nodded, and he was the first to take a step toward the monster, a wide smile on his face as he was ready to fight it.\nBut in comparison to what he believed… well… something else happened, something completely unexpected.\n~THUD~\nSomeone grabbed his shoulder, it was a robust-looking man with a sword in his belt, his face looked horrified and extremely stressed.\n\"GET OUT OF HERE FAST, WE NEED TO GO AND WAIT FOR THE EXTERMINATION TEAM!\"\nStark didn't pay much attention to the man, and instead just swiftly removed his hand from his shoulder, \"And why is that?\"\nThe man was taken aback by Stark's nonchalant response, \"Are you dense? That beast is an event elite mini-boss that only appears every so often, we can't take that thing by ourselves!\"\n\"…\"\nSeeing Stark's lack of answer, the man just clicked his tongue and ran away, leaving the boy behind as he traversed the portal alongside… EVERYONE ELSE?!\nLiterally every single one of the classifiers that was present to fight monsters suddenly ran away as soon as they saw that thing, and even though Stark couldn't deny it was terrifying, there was no reason to run…\nAfter all… if he wanted to get stronger, he needed to take bigger risks, and all those cowards who ran away could never hope to ever achieve great things if they kept it like that…\nJust as the man informed Stark, such ELITE monsters don't appear often at all, and it would be at best once every month that they appeared.\nWhen it did happen though, a team of professional classifiers would be dispatched to eliminate the beast so that the rest of the classifiers could return to slaying monsters and gaining levels.\nBasically… that thing was super strong, and nobody was willing to risk their lives to eliminate it, even if it was a group of 50 people all uniting their powers.\n'This is too convenient…' Stark shook his head, there was absolutely no chance that the moment he entered the rift, some sudden rare event happened.\nAnd of course it wasn't.\nSince the moment he turned his gaze back to the beast after witnessing all the classifiers leaving…\n[Talent: Chosen One, Activated!]\n'Seriously… just how does that thing work, can it bend fucking time and space to cause me trouble?!'\nHe saw the crimson panel that told him everything he needed to know, and so he just sighed, the beast that was summoned from who knows where already looking around, then its purple eyes falling on the only human left in the land.\nIts only available prey was now on sight… and so it took a step toward Stark, its tongue licking its mouth all over, and its sharp teeth already sensing the flesh of the human on them.\n'Oh come on…' Stark sighed again, activating [Domination] and positioning himself to fight off the giant ghoul.\nHe still had absolutely not a single intention to leave this rift today until he was at least level 35, so he might as well get to it now since this monster could probably give him a level or two.\n\"GRROOOOAAAHHHHH~\" the giant ghoul roared, the waves of sound almost visible because of their sheer intensity.\nAnd so… it started running toward Stark, each time its two arms and legs hitting the ground with a force that created shockwaves in the air.\nStark stood his ground, his eyes locked onto the approaching monster, calculating his next move.\nThat thing was thirty meters tall, and it would be hard to reach its weakness if it had one, so Stark needed to think…\n[3…]\n[2…]\n[1…]\n'Hm…' his determination grew stronger the closer the ghoul got.\n[FIGHT!]",

After all, it was a rare event elite that only appeared once in a while…!\n\"SHADOW STRIKE!\" the giant ghoul raised one of its rugged arms, with sharp skin and claws, and then slammed it down towards Stark.\nWith quick reflexes, Stark dodged to the side, narrowly avoiding the deadly strike.\nNo matter how strong that thing was, it was extremely slow compared to even normal enemies since its body was big and easily spottable.\n\"SHADOW STRIKE!\" it tried yet again to hit Stark, but this time his wings just activated [Dash], propulsing him away from the radius of the attack.\nEach [Shadow Strike] left a semi-deep crater on the ground it struck, and shimmers of purple aura were even left there, corrupting it.\nIt hit again, and again, and again… until eventually…\n\"Hah~ Hah~~ GROOARR~\" the monster roared again, its tongue dangling from its mouth.\n\"AURA SMASH… MERGE!\" while the monster was busy recovering some of its stamina after trying to hit Stark dozens of times, he on the other hand crouched down slightly and held his right arm's wrist while summoning his three crimson fists and merging them into one.\nAnd after only a few seconds of controlling this overwhelming power…\n\"SMASHHH!\" he launched the giant fist toward the beast.\nObviously, it couldn't avoid it.\n\"-53524!\" its defense was high, but the damage was still incredible.\nAnd in addition to that…\n[Enemy Stunned!]\nThe Corrupted Ghoul suddenly staggered back from the impact, its enormous body trembling under the force of Stark's attack, and then… it stopped moving altogether, its body stunned.\nA single crimson fist has a 30% chance to stun an enemy, that is true, but when you merge them all together… that chance climbs all the way to 60%.\nTaking advantage of the opening, Stark lunged forward.\nThe two arms of the ghoul fell to the ground in a giant thud, their owner unable to do anything other than move its pupils and watch the human run at full speed toward it.\n'Thanks for the stairs,' Stark smiled as he jumped on the black hands and began running up the arms toward the face of the ghoul.\n'Clone FRENZY!' he also summoned his clones beside him, and they also began following after him.\nThe reason he didn't just instantly use [Heaven's Wrath] on the monster was because he wanted to try something.\nAfter a few seconds at full speed, he reached the face of the ghoul, its giant eyes, which were half his size, looking at him, and its purple pupils trembling slightly: it was scared.\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS,\" all three Stark summoned 9 spears, then sent them all toward one of the specific eyes.\n~PIERCE, PIERCE, PIERCE~\n\"GROOOOARRRHH~\" the ghoul cried, now able to move its body slightly as the stun effect was slowly going away.\n\"-79736!\" was the damage the spears caused, but that's not all…\n~POP~\nIts right eyes completely exploded when the spears hit it, meaning it could only see with one eye now.\n\"GROOOOARRRHAH~\" the ghoul kept crying, then began agitating its head.\n\"Guess I'm out…\" Stark grinned as he jumped out of the way and fell back on the ground with a thud.\n\"-1726!\" of course he received some damage for that, but his domination armor took it all, meaning he hadn't suffered any injuries.\nAnd as for the clones that remained on the ghoul's face… they held on for a bit, and there was simple reason for that: Stark had an idea he wanted to try.\n\"AURA SMASH… MERGE!\" both clones began charging up the giant crimson fist while taking their stand, making sure not to fall.\nStark called this new possible attack the 'Clone Suicide'.\nAnd as the clones charged up the merged crimson fist on the ghoul's face, Stark braced himself for the impact.\nOf course, even Stark had a hard time controlling his merged crimson fist the first time he had used it, even though he had a lot of aura.\nBut what about clones? They don't have as much aura as Stark, and their mastery is also very bad.\nWhich means…\n~BOOM, BOOM~\nWhen they would try to use that super strong attack, they would just explode, and send out all the aura in a radius close to them.\n\"GROOATHZHHAHZ~\" the monster almost looked like it was having a seizure as it began to shake frantically and move in all sorts of direction, its face was blasted by two super powerful explosions after all.\n\"-79372! -80401!\"\nIt held its face and roared, the blast almost exploding half of the face it had left.\nThe Corrupted Ghoul, its remaining eye wild with fury and pain, turned its attention back to him.\n[Corrupted Ghoul HP: 6967/300000]\n'…' it was almost dead, 'Let's end this…'\nStark raised his right arm and traced a circle around the ghoul, then…\n\"HEAVEN'S WRATH!\" he summoned his skill, and the crimson spark in the sky appeared above the beast, its speed wouldn't allow it to escape too since it was still too damaged from all these attacks.\nBasically… it was Stark's win.\nOr so that's what he thought.\nSince… the beast stopped moving altogether, closed its remaining eye… and the purple aura around it suddenly became 10 times as overwhelming.\n\"CORRUPTED REGENERATION, DEATH FORM,\" it immediately activated its most powerful skills as Stark didn't even let it use the other ones.\nAnd so… the battle wouldn't end so easily.",

      "content": "\"CORRUPTED REGENERATION, DEATH FORM,\" as the sparkle in the sky of the [Heaven's Wrath] reached its speak, announcing that the beam would be coming down soon to end the ghoul, it suddenly activated two skills.\nDark energy enveloped the Corrupted Ghoul, swirling around it like a malevolent storm.\nStark's eyes widened with realization as he saw the monster's wounds begin to close before his very eyes.\n'Huh…?'\n\"+250000!\" the ghoul's face regenerated, and it got back its destroyed eye, plus a major part of its HP.\n\"HEAVEN'S WRATH!\"\n~BOOOMM~\nBut as the beam descended… the purple and dark energy storm that envelop the ghoul completely, creating some sort of thick liquid-like armor around its figure, its edges moving like waves.\n'…' and so the ghoul just stood there, taking the hit of the [Heaven's Wrath] beam.\n\"-0! -0! 0! -0!\" it received no damage.\nThat was the ghoul's ultimate skill: \"Death Form\".\n'Huh…' Stark's eyes widened as he saw the ghoul which was supposed to die suddenly regenerate most of its life and also survived his most powerful attack without taking a single point of damage.\nAnd once the beam and its effects faded, the Corrupted Ghoul stood before Stark, its purple aura pulsating with renewed vigor.\nIt let out a low, menacing growl, its eyes fixated on Stark with a newfound intensity. The ground beneath them cracked from the sheer pressure emanating from the ghoul's darkened form.\nAnd so for the first time since his appearance in this world… Stark took a step back against a monster.\nOf course, he absolutely refused to leave before he either eliminated that beast, or the extermination team came, but… that thing was horrifying.\nIts skin and figure darkened, the purple/black surrounding it completely, much like when Stark got angry and his crimson aura enveloped him too.\nIt was flapping its wings, its deep purple pupils staring at his souls, and its mouth opened wide, not saliva coming out, but a purple liquid that looked like poison.\n…\n[Skill: Death Form]\n[Description: allows the ghoul to use insane protection but also boost all its abilities to their maximum potential.]\n[Note: It is trying to avenge all its companions from the corruption and wrath of the 'Godless Demon'…]\n…\nBut [Death Form] wasn't all that it changed… since when Stark checked the ghoul again…\n[The Corrupted Ghoul, Level 100]\nIts level went up by 15, meaning that such a thing didn't have its place in this rift at all.\nMaybe… even the extermination team that would be sent here didn't stand a chance either, as people probably believed this monster could only be level 80-90 at best…\nStark could feel the oppressive aura emanating from the ghoul, making his breaths come out in short, tense gasps.\nHe had no clones, he already drank potions for strength and speed, so they're useless, he already used up [Heaven's Wrath] too…\nAnd so that meant… all he had left were the 10 seconds of [Double Assault], they were his last chance.\n\"VENOMOUS SPIT,\" the ghoul spat out a stream of purple venom that flew towards Stark with deadly accuracy.\nStark barely managed to dodge it, feeling the intense heat as the venom landed on the ground beside him, sizzling on impact.\nThe Corrupted Ghoul's movements were unnaturally quick and precise, the Death Form enhancing its speed and agility to levels far beyond Stark's expectations.\n'That thing could probably take on Sierra by himself, and her arrows…!' upon saying the word arrow, he suddenly remembered about his [Crystal Stun Potions].\nHe didn't think they would work against such a giant opponent, but who knows…\n~THUD, THUD~\nHe didn't really have the time to think about it that giant ghoul, now more terrifying than before because of its aura, advanced toward Stark.\n\"NIGHTMARE GAZE,\" its eyes glinted with purple aura, some sort of vortex appearing in them.\nAnd the moment Stark looked at them… he knew he was fucked.\n[You have been stunned!]\nHe couldn't move his body anymore, his limbs frozen in place as the ghoul's dark magic took hold of him.\nIt was just like Judicator's [Divine Blindness], although this one was much more deadly as blindness could still mean you can do things, but being stunned was bad, REALLY BAD.\nThe world around him seemed to warp and distort, shadows dancing menacingly at the edges of his vision.\n\"SHADOW WINGS,\" the ghoul took advantage of that to suddenly flap its wings.\nThe shadowy wings seemed to drain the light from the air, casting a pitch-black veil around him, and just as expected, the ghoul began to fly little by little, its figure growing smaller in the distance as it ascended higher into the air.\nStark tried to shake off the effects of the stun, his mind racing for a way to counteract the ghoul's newfound abilities.\nBut… after only a few seconds… he heard IT…\n\"GROOOAORRR~\" the ghoul roared, then began to dive toward Stark with incredible speed, its shadow wings trailing behind it like a cloak of darkness.\n\"FUCK…\" Stark tried as hard as he could to move away.\nThe Ghoul was spinning in the air as well was rushing at the boy, and so it almost made it seem like a sharp spiral of purple aura was heading toward him.\n\"MOVEEEEEE!!!!\" he shouted to his body.\nBut it was too late.\n~BOOM, SCRATCCCHH~\nThe land received immense damage because of the sheer power of the attack.\nAnd once the ghoul got up and looked back, smiling as it knew that the human was dead now… it still saw Stark standing, his face full of blood.\nHe had survived somehow.\n[The 'Purgatory Shadow' took the hit in your place]\nThat ring had saved him from being killed, otherwise he would have gotten 100000 points of damage.\n\"…\" Stark looked down at the ground, he didn't even look at the ghoul as it took more steps toward him, the sound getting closer as he just stood there.\nBut from another perspective… if you ever looked at Stark's face from below… you could see that he was mad.\nReally mad.\nMuch like the Corrupted Ghoul, his face was slowly being enveloped by his crimson aura, while his eyes and mouth were replaced a white one.\n\"AURA SMASH… MERGE…\" he slowly breathed in and out as he activated this skill and began focusing his attack.\nHe closed his eyes to focus, only able to hear and sense the ghoul to pinpoint where it was: he wouldn't have another chance now.\n~THUD~\nStark wasn't stressed, his entire mind was calm and serene.\n~THUD~\nThe crimson aura around his right hand was growing more and more, and this time… he didn't even hold his wrist with his left one: he was that confident.\n~THUD~\nHe was somehow able to perfectly control the flow of his aura now, not needing time to focus more or to hold his wrist to not make it explode, which made the aura of the fist even more powerful.\n~THUD~\nAnd so right as the [Corrupted Ghoul] reached Stark and raised its arm…\n\"SHADOW STRIKE!\" it struck down at the boy, its poisonous and sharp claws glowing dark purple.\nBut as the ghoul's attack began to descend, Stark opened his eyes, both shining beautifully.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" he passed right through the attack, and with a spin… \"AURA SMASH…!\"\nHe sent the magnificent crimson fist, the fruit of all his efforts until now, toward the giant ghoul.\nThis was the final showdown against his first level 100 monster.",

-3725! -3827! -3691!\"\nAnd slowly…\n~CRACK, DISPERSE…~\nThe 'Death Form' aura armor that had formed around the ghoul was slowly cracking and dissipating after each of Stark's punches.\nIt was almost… as if HIS aura, which was much more powerful than the monster's, was completely annihilating it, showing it who truly was stronger.\n\"SONIC ROAR!\" the ghoul didn't want to stand there doing anything as it could sense that this human, no matter how low his level was, was bad news.\nSeeing the cracks forming in its Death Form, the Corrupted Ghoul let out a deafening Sonic Roar, causing the very air to tremble and Stark to feel pressure building up in his ears.\nBut he was not deterred, with determination blazing in his eyes, he continued his assault on the ghoul's arm, each punch landing with precision and power.\n'Sonic Roar' is an attack used to confuse and scare enemies, as well as causing a bit of damage if it perfectly.\nAnd yet… Stark endured it easily, he didn't even look bothered by it, making the ghoul's roar grew louder, but it didn't help.\nAs the Death Form began to weaken further under the relentless barrage of Stark's aura-enhanced punches, the ghoul's desperation became palpable.\n[20 seconds before 'Extermination Team' arrives!]\nIt was too late… Stark had already reached its head.\n\"DOUBLE ASSAULT!\" and so at that very moment, he activated his legendary skill, doubling each of his stats for 10 seconds.\nAnd in less than a fraction of a second afterward… the only thing the ghoul's pupils could see was Stark's powerful crimson fist aimed at its eye.\n~POP, BOOM~\n\"-33738!\"\n\"GROOOAORHZ~\" it looked to be in pain, and frantically roared, moving its head to launch the human away.\nBut this time, Stark held on.\nAnd he immediately aimed for the second eye.\n~POP, BOOM~\n\"-35902!\"\nThe ghoul's head was still the part where the 'Death Form' was mostly activated, which was why the damage was so low.\nAnd yet… the ghoul had lost its vision, unable to see anything, unable to know when the human will hit next.\n[Corrupted Ghoul HP: 50871/300000]\n[15 seconds before 'Extermination Team' arrives!]\nStark focused all of his aura into this final punch, and after 4 seconds, which was the remaining time for his [Double Assault]…\nHe punched the ghoul's face right in the middle, making it stumble back as it began falling backward.\n\"-49372!\" but this wasn't enough to kill it.\nAnd so now that it was allowed to move its body again, the first thing it did was smile and lick its mouth while activating [Corrupted Regeneration].\nIf it could regenerate its life, then it could retrieve its vision, and end the human as he didn't have any more tricks up his sleeves.\nThe Corrupted Ghoul was also on the verge of retrieving its balance, as stumbling wasn't enough to make it fall completely.\nBut as if divine intervention occurred…\n['Double Impact' activated!]\nIt seemed the ghoul's plan was foiled, as a crimson shadow of Stark appeared and punched it again in the same spot with the same intensity.\n\"89372!\" it had lost its [Death Form] by now, so the damage was much higher.\nAnd that final push was also enough to make it fall and completely ruin its plan to balance itself back.\n~THUD, FWISH, BOOOM~\nThe ghoul's head cracked open like an egg when hitting the ground, oozing black goo and bones splintering.\nAnd on the other hand, Stark triumphantly stood above its lifeless corpse, panting from the adrenaline rush as he had managed to defeat that enemy.\n['Extermination Team' has arrived!]\nComing out of the purple portal appeared four classifiers, each a neutral expression on their faces and armed with their weapons, ready to eliminate the threat.\nAnd yet… when they looked around… they saw that the beast was already dead, and on top of it was… another human.\n'…?' all of them were confused, they were sure everyone should have evacuated, so why…\nNo… this wasn't the true question they needed to ask… HOW did this kid defeat that event mini-boss?!\nWhy was he just standing there, looking at the monster?

inside his [Spatial Inventory] before resuming walking toward the 'Extermination Team'.\n\"Hey, there,\" a buff man with short brown heard and a well-trimmed beard, spoke, he had a sword in his belt.\n\"…\" Stark didn't answer, he didn't want to explain anything or associate with such people, and so he just tried to pass through the four of them.\nThe purple exit portal was only a few meters away from him.\nBut of course…\n\"Hey, we're talking,\" a brown-haired woman with hazel eyes and a longbow on her back, said as she jumped in front of him to block his path.\n\"…\"\nStark moved to the side and passed the woman, who just looked at him and her companions back and forth, her expression stating, 'what the hell is wrong with this guy.'\n\"RESTRAIN!\" a woman with short white hair in a bob cut raised her magic staff and pointed it at Stark.\n~FWISH, CLANG~\nPowerful chains came out of the ground, grabbing Stark's legs, arms, and torso.\nThey didn't plan to kill him, obviously, but they just wanted to talk as there weren't many people who could take down an event mini-boss by themselves, and even more so one as terrifying as the 'Corrupted Ghoul'…\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" but Stark just activated his skill and his invincibility frames allowed him to pass right through the chains.\n\"WHAT?\" the mage was flabbergasted.\nOf course, this 'Extermination Team' wasn't weak at all, and it was apparent by their auras.\nEach of them were over level 200 as they needed to make sure that they would be able to destroy the monster without any casualties.\nAnd yet… why was that boy so nonchalant about them?\nIt's almost like he didn't even acknowledge them as strong enough for him to talk to.\n\"Alright…\" the leader, a man with short purple hair and magenta eyes, sighed as he pulled out his sword from his belt and then…\n\"LIGHT FLASH!\" purple lightning surrounded his body as he dashed toward Stark with intense speed, so fast it couldn't be visible to the naked eye, and his body turned into a legitimate flash of light as he closed the distance.\n\"Naegi?!\" the team was confused as to why their leader, who was always so calm and composed, suddenly lost his temper.\nThis 'Extermination Team' was very well known among classifiers, and they were respected as well for always coming in to save others with the brightest of intentions.\nTheir slogan was: \"The people come first, and we'll be there to save them!\"\nAnd yet… here he was, suddenly dashing toward Stark with the clear intent to harm him.\nThe reason was simple: Stark's aura.\nNaegi, the leader of the 'Yasugi' extermination team, a level 273 classifier, could sense auras and their nature.\nAnd Stark's was… very clearly evil.\nOf course, the real Stark wasn't that bad of a person (heh), but it was simply because [Domination] and its crimson nature would seem overwhelming and bad to anyone that looked at it from afar.\nThis was why it was so easy to intimidate people with that class.\n'This is familiar…' Naegi thought the moment he saw Stark standing on the monster.\nStark remembered seeing that the top 100 classifier was named [Naegi, The Electric Blade], so he participated in the 'ClassiTop Event' from before, and this was how he got that weird feeling of having seen that kid before.\n\"That kid… he is going to cause chaos in the future,\" Naegi's eyes flashed, almost as if a divine vision was granted to him before using his [Light Flash] skill.\nFor the first time in a very long time… he believed that eliminating a human was a better solution than to protect them.\n~FLASH, FWISH~\n[Focus: Behind You]\nThe [Focus] skill warned Stark of the ambush from behind, and even allowed him to see Naegi even though he was extremely fast.\n'…' Stark moved to the side at the last moment, and swiftly avoided the leader's attack.\n~FWASH~\nThe spot he was in before literally exploded from the power of the slash, and small glitters of purple aura were left there.\n\"…?\" Naegi was surprised that the boy avoided his attack, after all, it was supposed to be almost instantaneous, and some other level 100 monsters didn't even have the time to realize what was happening that they were dead.\nAnd just like that, Stark reached the purple, then looked back to see the four classifiers looking straight at him, each with their weapons out.\nTo them, this random kid had just eliminated a level 100 threat by himself, and nonchalantly acted as if they were mere insects when they tried to talk to him.\nIt was weird, extremely weird…\n\"You can tell people you were the ones to eliminate that thing, I frankly don't care,\" Stark shrugged, \"But next time…\" and suddenly his aura became overwhelming even for these level 200 classifiers, \"Don't try that shit on me again.\"\nAnd so he left by passing through the portal, leaving them all bewildered at the balls he had to threaten them.\n\"LET'S GET THAT SHIT,\" the brown-haired man shouted as he cracked his fingers and began marching toward the portal too, wanting to teach that kid a lesson.\n\"Forget it,\" but Naegi raised his arms, \"Let's just get all the needed things from that beast before announcing that it's eliminated…\"\nFrankly, none of them wanted that, not even Naegi, but they couldn't do anything.\nDeep inside… Stark's expression and aura at that time might have scared them… just a little.",

They are coming out to make a statement…!]\nAll TVs showcased this message, with the voice of a woman over it.\nAnd then, the screen switched to a view of the four classifiers that tried to stop Stark leaving the purple portal, all cameras pointed at them.\nSafe to say, whatever they would say here would end up in broadcasts all over the country.\n'What could they possibly say, though,' Stark smiled slightly as he exited the building… just to face the same screen outside.\nSeems like news of that thing already spread all over.\n\"What happened inside?\" a reporter pointed his microphone at the leader, Naegi.\nMost of them looked quite uncomfortable, avoiding the gazes of the others, almost as if they felt… ashamed.\nExcept for Naegi that is, as he simply took the microphone and shouted: \"We are not the ones who eliminated that beast, when we entered, some black-haired kid was already there on top of the monster.\"\nNaegi was a righteous man, and he didn't want to claim what wasn't his.\nBut that also meant… that Stark's identity was at risk.\n\"Taxi!\" he hailed for a driver as he left the 'fighting district', then ordered him to go to his hotel.\nInside the car, Stark thought about his bad fortune and everything that had happened.\nHe had expected something like this, but not so soon.\nHe never thought his identity would be revealed so quickly.\nAfter all, they had seen his face, right? And he left the rift with hundreds of people watching him…\n'Well… it's fine…' he sighed, and after a while reached his hotel street, paid the driver, then went up to his room, sitting on his bed while drinking water (you should do that too).\nThere was no need to expect anything now, and soon these people would come for him.\nMaybe even the 'Domination Association' would show their face again to try and recruit him?\nIn the end… it didn't matter.\n'Show me the panels,' he swiftly moved his finger upward, and all the panels that he had minimized before appeared around him.\nThere were only two of them though.\nThe first was…\n[Level 35 Reached: please pick a card].\n'Of course,' he smiled, it was always a good thing to reach this milestone as it was always a sign that he was going to get stronger.\nThree crimson cards appeared out of thin air in front of him.\n'And of course… no way to know what is what-' Stark joked, but his eyes widened as he looked at the back of the cards.\nFor the first time ever… there was something on their backs.\nThe first had a smiley face :), the second had a neutral one :I, and the last had a sad one :(.\n'The fuck is that…?' each of the faces emanated a strange power, as if each one was prompting him to pick it as it had the best ability, 'Oh well…'\nFor the first time Stark didn't just close his eyes and pick a random card, but actually thought of the implications of each one.\nThe smiley would be the optimal choice under normal circumstances, but doesn't it seem too obvious?\n'Ahhh, fuck, I don't know… the sad one could also be good…'\nIn the end, he picked the neutral one because 'balance is everything I need' apparently, and also since he had a neutral expression on his face at that moment.\nAnd so once he turned the card, he saw the picture of a figure swiftly dodging what looked like an energy ball, some lines and after images showing that the figure moved at intense speed.\nThe skill he got was…\n[Skill: Dodge Control]\n[Type: Legendary]\n'Yeah!' he was happy he had made the right choice, although he didn't know if the other two didn't have better skills as the other cards immediately disappeared when he picked the first one.\nBut somehow… he felt like this skill was powerful, and that it would become extremely useful in the future, maybe even more so than [Double Assault]?",

      "content": "Stark decided to immediately check out the new legendary skill he had gotten before doing anything else, after all… it was yet another skill that would allow him to get stronger.\n…\n[Skill: Dodge Control]\n[Type: Legendary]\n[Level: 1]\n[Description:] For exactly 15 seconds, your aura takes over your body and allows you to bend it in any way it needs to, making you able to dodge any and every attack that comes your way, no matter how fast or unavoidable it is.\n[Note: Basically, you can dodge anything for 15 seconds, like any attack, even from a level 999 classifier]\n…\n'…'\nThis was insane, absolutely insane.\n15 seconds of perfect invincibility is too overpowered, no matter how much you think of it.\nOf course, the time frame was low, but it was still 5 seconds higher than even [Double Assault], which had saved him many times before.\nPlus, if he could dodge and somehow counter-attack his enemy, it would surely benefit him…\nBut before checking out the second panel that appeared… Stark decided it would be better to see his status window as it had been awhile and also assign the 8 skill points he had to something.\n'Status Window…' he mumbled, and the giant panel appeared before him.\n…\n[Level:] 35\n[Health:] 14500\n[Bloodline:] Human\n[Classes:] Domination; Alchemist\n[Talent:] Chosen one\n[Attributes:] Strength 1821; Speed 2012; Mind/Soul 2148; Stamina 1490; Defense 1564\n[Skills:] Spatial Inventory; Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv15; Focus lv10; Aura Smash lv10; Clone Frenzy lv5; Invincible Dodge lv2; Double Assault lv5; Crimson Spears lv1; Heaven's Wrath lv1; Alchemist lv3; Potion Crafting lv3; Target Manipulation lv1; Dodge Control lv1\n…\nHis skills number was getting strangely high, and he did wonder if it wouldn't take up an entire page by the time he reached level 100…\n[Skill Points: 8 Available]\nBut for now… Stark sat back down on his bed and scratched his chin: he needed to think how to place his skill points perfectly.\nAfter all it was something that would determine his entire future, so of course this time Stark was serious and actually took time to decide-\n'Yep, I'm taking those,' he nodded after a few seconds and clicked on the skills he wanted to upgrade.\n[You have upgraded 'Invincible Dodge' to level 5!]\n[You have upgraded 'Clone Frenzy' to level 10!]\nHe had had the choice to upgrade either [Double Assault] or [Clone Frenzy], but when thinking about all his previous fights, the former wasn't really used much except for urgent cases, while the latter was almost always used, making it an essential skill to upgrade.\nAnd those upgrades could only mean one thing… NEW PERKS!\nA crimson light enveloped Stark as not two, but three panels surrounded him for his skills' new perks.\n…\n[Skill: Invincible Dodge lv5]\n[New Perk: Perfect Dodge]\n[Description:] What you did up until now were normal dodges, but if you somehow manage to activate this skill at the microsecond before an attack collides with you… then you will activate the 'perfect dodge' perk: the world will turn gray and time will slow down for everyone but you, allowing you not only to check your surroundings for a few seconds, but also have more chances to counter.\n[Note:] You won't be able to move your body during the 'perfect dodge' effect, it will still be slowed down, it is your mind on the other hand that will be normal.\n…\n'Oh~' Stark grinned, this was extremely interesting.\nOf course, there was a big risk in doing that as waiting right before an attack hit to activate it gave Stark less leeway and also increased his odds of just being hit and dying with a single bad timing.\n'All I need is to upgrade [Focus] to make it better, though…' but he already had a solution to such a problem, and he was already confident that he could do it without much problems.\nEven more so after an intensive training inside the 'Memories Museum'.\nIn the end, he would just need to test it out…\nThen he moved to the right, which were the panels for the [Clone Frenzy] skill as it seemingly got two perks instead of only one.\n…\n[Skill: Clone Frenzy lv10]\n[New Perk: Three Clones]\n[Description:] I mean… it's in the name, but basically you can summon three clones instead of two.\n[Flaw:] The more clones you summon, the less power they will have as you need to share your aura with them, and it's not unlimited.\n…\n'…' Stark had expected this, so he just moved to the second perk.\n…\n[Skill: Clone Frenzy lv10]\n[New Perk: HP Transfer]\n[Description:] You can sacrifice your own HP to gift it to one of your clones (and only one), thus granting them the ability to possibly survive another hit and not instantly die by any attack.\n[Flaw:] Doing that will make you lose your own HP while gifting it to your clone, making it extremely risky.\n…\n'This means that the clones are not limited to 1HP anymore if I gift them my own…' Stark laughed, this was interesting.\nWhat if he gave them the entirety of his HP and just kept himself at one…?\nNah, it would be dumb to do that as in most of his recent battles he always received some kind of damage… and he always gets one-shotted by any powerful attack anyway, making this skill pretty worthless in most situations.\n'Well… it depends, it's always a plus anyway…'\nAnd thus, Stark could finally move to the final panel, the one that was beside the card one.\nAnd when he looked at it, his face turned cold.\n[15 levels left until the needed level for second 'Domination Trial' is reached, have fun!]\n[7/10 classifiers have reached the needed level, be quick or else when everybody but you reaches level 50, you will still be teleported!]\n[Basically… once the ninth classifier reaches level 50, the last one will be teleported no matter what their level is]\n'HUH?' the doppelgängers in his mind hadn't told him that rule?!\n'Shit, SHIT, SHITTT…' Stark was thinking deeply, his eyes burning with aura as a vortex was forming in them.\nThis was bad, really bad.\nAs proven before, Domination Trials take into account the fact that the [Domination] class deals much more damage, and so it gives more powerful bosses than normal classifiers can deal with.\nMeaning that a 15 level difference would be the end of him if he tried to enter it.\nThe moment the ninth classifier reaches level 50, then he would be teleported to the domination trial, no matter how far he was from it.\nMaybe this was a punishment to the classifier that was slacking off while thinking that they would be fine?\nBut in the end… it only meant one thing…\n'You can't escape the Domination Trial,' he slightly laughed, 'I was going to enter it no matter what I tried…'",

Stark immediately got up from the bed, his eyes wide.\nThere was no way after all, right…\nAnd after only a few seconds, the screen switched to showcase the entirety of the battle between him and the ghoul.\n'SHIT, I'M REALLY DONE FOR NOW…' there was no chance people wouldn't know who he was the moment his face was shown.\nBut surprisingly…\n'Huh?' when the screen showed his face, it was completely hidden by his crimson aura, 'Was it like that since the beginning…? I didn't even notice…'\nHis aura being in front of his face hid any features that could make him recognizable, and it was safe to say it was better than even the bunny mask.\n10 minutes of battle followed, and then the footage also showed how he managed to dodge all the 'Extermination Team' attacks and tell them to take the merit for themselves as he didn't care.\n\"We can't see his face, but he did exit the rift was what many people told us!\"\n\"Then it means we know his face, right?\"\n\"Not at all… look…\" the reporter clicked on a button, and several videos taken from different angles when he left the rift appeared.\nAnd in all of them… his aura was still in front of his face.\nThe reason people were giving him weird looks was because they wondered what he was doing having such a thing in front of his face, as if trying to hide it.\nOf course, Stark had no idea why this was happening.\nBut deep inside…\n[Talent: Chosen One]\nHe knew that it helped him.\nAnd so just like that, Stark fell asleep.\n***\nThe dream came as a blur, but Stark knew it was another one of his 'warnings'.\nHe was in a dimly-lit room, sitting face to face with his other doppelgängers, each enjoying a cup of tea.\n'What the fuck…' he opened his eyes and took his surroundings into account, even though it was weird.\nHe had always been in an empty black void before, and now he was in some kind of middle-class room…\n~SIP~\nThe Alchemist drank while smiling, \"Seems like we're close…\"\nDomination on the other hand shook his hand, \"Wrong, we're further from anyone else.\"\nDomination then lifted his arm, and two panels appeared in front of Stark.\n[Classifiers at level 50: 7/10]\n\"We have no information about their names or weapons, but…\" he lifted his other arm.\nAnd suddenly…\n[Classifier A: Level 48]\n[Classifier B: Level 46]\n\"Ohoh~ Seems like we have two days at best before reaching it… any solutions?\" Alchemist was surprised.\n\"None other than going inside a powerful rift and grinding the life out of you for two whole days…\"\n'Ah shit…-'\n\"Yes, that means that you will have to face the second domination trial before entering the 'Rift Conqueror' Academy, so just try to survive…\" Domination shrugged.\n'Huh… but wait a minute… doesn't this void space move slower than time in the real world…?' Stark thought.\n\"It does!\" Domination smiled.\n\"Humu~\" Alchemist poured some of his liquid into the cup and drank it.\n\"But doesn't that also mean that right now… the time I have to level up is decreasing?\" Stark's expression stiffened.\n\"Huh, yeah.\"\n[Classifier A: Level 49]\n[Classifier B: Level 47]\n'THEIR LEVELS WENT UP… FUCK…' Stark's jaw dropped, \"IF YOU GUYS ARE ME, THEN YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP…!\"\n\"Calm down, friend, there is no need to be angry,\" Alchemist smiled.\n\"Alright, alright, we said what was needed to be said, so just understand that we can't interfere, it all depends on you, we are simply your classes after all,\" Domination smiled before snapping his fingers, and the room suddenly disappeared, replaced by the all-too-familiar void.\n[Have fun]\nA panel appeared, and suddenly, Stark consciousness faded again.\nMaybe… just maybe, he was fucked.\n***\n'…' Stark opened his eyes as calmly as possible, this time he wasn't stressed or anything of the sorts, he just grabbed his phone, noticed that he had been asleep for an entire day, and sat down on a chair to eat.\n'…' the video of him battling the corrupted ghoul was all over the country.\nIt was safe to say he had a gathered a large amount of fans, although none even knew who he was.\n'…' but it didn't matter if he died during the [Domination Trial], so he didn't care much, all he wanted was to get stronger.\nHe got up from his seat after only fifteen minutes, took a quick shower, and put on his normal clothes before leaving the hotel room, directly heading toward the 'Fighting District'.\nIt was still full because of the events of yesterday, and there was a risk in people figuring who he was, but it didn't matter for now.\n'Need…' he hailed for a taxi and got transported to the fighting district with a neutral expression on his face.\n'To…' he left the car and walked toward the giant building of the 'Rift Storer Association', the videos of him fighting still all over the many screens that were displayed there, he observed all of it with a neutral expression on his face\n'Get…' he entered the building and made his way to the [Rift] section, and the [Level 80-90 Rift] seemed to be full as hundreds of people gathered around, their number didn't change the neutral expression on his face.\n'Stronger…' he headed toward the [Level 90-100 Rift] hallway instead, a neutral expression still on his face.\n'Need to get stronger…' he mumbled.\nHis time was counted, and he needed to make use of it the best way he could.\nIf this kept going, it would only be two… no… only one day until the two others reached level 50, and they were all transported to their doom.\nStark refused that.",

      "content": "'…' Stark stood in front of the portal of the [Level 90-100 Rift] hallway, it was orange in color, different from the ones next to it as the one before was purple.\nHe took a step forward, his aura extremely powerful before he even entered the rift.\nThere was a sense of urgency in this aura, though, and it was normal as Stark's time was counted.\nHe couldn't catch up to the others, meaning that he just needed to get as many levels as he could.\nHis goal was reaching level 40 to get a new skill at least, but it would be hard if the other two classifiers kept going now that they were so close.\n[Classifier A: 49/50]\n[Classifier B: 48/50]\nClassifier B's level went up by one again…\nAnd so, with all his determination focused around him, Stark dashed toward the orange barrier.\n[Access Deni-] it tried to deny him access because his level was way too low to pass.\nBut…\n[Huh…] it was almost like the barrier was hesitating.\nStark got pushed back after his first attempt, then just stood there as he saw the barrier have white text appear on it.\n[It's weird… your level is low but… hm… I guess…]\n'…'\n[Access Allowed]\nAnd so Stark passed through the barrier easily, he didn't know how these things worked, but maybe it was a human that controlled them…?\nIn the end it didn't matter much as he passed the portal like anyone else and walked through the hallway, reaching the giant orange portal at the end of it.\nThe sight of classifiers happily leaving the rift after a good increase in experience, and the one of nervous classifiers ready to enter and risk their lives was everywhere.\nStark was pretty much the only one that was as cold and neutral as he was.\n'Stronger,' he walked through the portal without hesitation, then got transported to the rift after traversing the threshold and undergoing the weird feeling.\nBut for the first time ever, Stark's expression didn't change, and he wasn't dizzy when the sight of the giant vortex sucking him to the rift appeared.\nStark's only thoughts were focused on one thing: the need to get stronger before the others…\n~FWISH, VIOUM~\nHe came out on the other side of the portal and opened his eyes to take his surroundings into account.\nHe found himself in a vast, desolate landscape with a dark, ominous sky above him, a crimson moon was there too.\nAs he looked around, he noticed that the terrain was completely dark, barren and inhospitable, with only a few twisted trees and plants to break the monotony.\nThe air was thick, and the air felt heavy with a sense of dread, plus there was also some sort of mist that stopped people from looking too far ahead of them.\n[Level 90-100 Rift: The River of Souls]\nHe hadn't seen it because of the mist, but there was indeed some kind of river right next to him as he entered the rift, it was pretty big in size, and seemed to go deeper inside the rift, probably even reaching the boss area.\nThe 'water', if you could even call it that, was completely black, much like the ground, and there were many frightening and scary faces in the reflection of the water.\n'The souls…?' Stark thought as he looked for a few seconds, it was in the name after all.\n[Follow the river.]\n\"Watch out, don't go too far…\"\n\"I know, I heard anybody who goes beyond into the mist has never come back before…\"\n\"Haha~ must be some kind of legend the association spread to stop people from risking their lives, but anyway I just don't want to risk encountering a scary beast, so let's stay here like everybody else!\"\nPeople were fighting the monsters that appeared around them, remaining close to the exit of the rift to be able to leave at any time, and also since this spot was the one where the mist affected them the least.\nBut safety wasn't something Stark could seek or afford: he needed to go deeper.\nDeep enough for him to see monsters that would allow him to push through further than ever before.\n~STEP, STEP~\nIgnoring the warning of the people around, and what the association asked for, he went deeper inside the mist, most people too occupied with their fights to realize someone was disappearing.\nAfter only a few seconds, his figure became invisible to those at the entrance, and so he could advance without any worries, staying close to the river as it was his only guidance in this place.\nThe mist was thick, and the air grew colder as Stark made his way deeper into the rift.\nBut after a few minutes…\n~CLING, FWISH, BANG~\nA white glint shone in the mist behind Stark, and then… it jumped toward the boy, trying to slash him in half.\n\"…\" Stark didn't even look back, [Focus] had already warned him.\nBut he was waiting for a simple thing: the perfect timing to counter.\nAnd he found it, since before the claws of the unknown beast could reach him…\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" he had calculated it at the microsecond, and anything more than this would have caused his death.\n[Perfect Dodge!]\nThis panel suddenly appeared as the world around him turned gray, at least more than it currently was, and time seemed to slow down.\nBut before that could happen, he slightly turned his head to be able to see whatever had attacked him.\nAnd it was… a gigantic bear, twice Stark's size, its body completely black, and its figure was weird as its edges flowed likes waves.\nThe only visible parts were its mouth, eyes, ears and claws as they were completely white.\n[Level 93: Shadow Bear]\n'…'\nPerfect Dodge allowed Stark to think for himself as he analyzed the situation around him and thought of the best plan possible.\n'Got it…' he sighed.\nAnd when time resumed back to normal, he fazed right through the bear's attack and kicked it in the face before sending two spears at its head.\n\"-84982! -47261! -48019!\" and so it instantly died as its HP reached zero, its black body falling to the ground before it could even realize what had happened.\n'…' Stark didn't even acknowledge the bear, looking at it as if it was an insect, then moving on as he kept walking deeper.\n[You have slain \"Shadow Bear lv93\", gained 112928 EXP!]\n[Experience: 600499/769000]\n'Need more… much more…' he mumbled.\nBut then…\n~CLING, CLING, CLING~\nDozens of pairs of eyes appeared around him in the mist, all looking at Stark.\n'More of those bears…' he sighed as he positioned himself to fight.\nUnder normal circumstances, Stark would have had no problem showing his emotions and surprise because of all these powerful enemies, but he didn't even feel like it now, his thoughts clouded by the goal of reaching level 40.\nMaybe it was a good thing that he temporarily didn't care much about anything other than fighting, and the reason was simple: his aura was extremely powerful.\nBeing able to control his emotions, and being as calm as he ever was before, made it so that his domination aura flowed around him better, granting him a way better control, which also meant more damage.\nTrading your emotions for power was something many classifiers did after all.\nMaybe Stark would be one of them…?",

Stark didn't even budge when he noticed the dozens of pair of white eyes looking at him from beyond the mist, it was a rather strange feeling, but it didn't scare Stark in the slightest, quite the opposite actually.\nWhat would be the point of acting surprised anyway, he had already killed one of them quite easily, so there was no need to fear anything.\nIn the end, Stark knew he was going to win, the real question was: how much time would it take him?\n'Perception...' he mumbled while looking at the bears.\n...\n[Name: Shadow Bear]\n[Level: 93]\n[HP: 127000]\n[Strength: 2918]\n[Stamina: 2201]\n[Speed: 1794]\n[Defense: 2822]\n[Skills: Shadow Claws, Group Attack, Shadow Body, River Puppet, Hearing Prediction, Slash Momentum...]\n...\n'...Weak,' Stark couldn't deny that their stats, level, and HP were beyond any enemy (besides ELITE and BOSS) he had fought before, but... it wasn't enough.\n\"SHADOW CLAWS,\" two [Shadow Bears] jumped out of the mist to reveal themselves, although it didn't change much since Stark could see their auras from the beginning, then they dashed at him.\nThey were pretty fast for monsters of their types.\nBut of course...\n~SLASH~\nStark yet again waited for the perfect moment, and when it arrived, he activated [Invincible Dodge].\n[Perfect Dodge!]\nThe world slowed down as Stark fazed through both attacks again, and he could see the claws of the bear slowly go through him, it was a weird feeling even though he didn't feel anything.\n\"Clone Frenzy,\" Stark backed away using one of the bear's body as a springboard, then called two of his clones to aid him.\n\"Aura Smash,\" then all three Stark sent 9 crimson fists toward the bears.\n\"Slash Momentum...\" the bears tried to cut the attack in half using their momentum skill and shadow aura, but... it wasn't enough.\n~BOOM, BOOM, BOOM~\nThe spot they were in exploded when all the crimson fists reached it, it was a giant crimson explosion that even cleared some of the mist by its sheer intensity.\nSafe to say the two bears that stood there didn't survive.\n\"-37371! -39143! -40196! -39447!\" and much more.\nIn the end, their HP reached 0, and they collapsed, well, half of their body was destroyed from the explosion so they would have died even if it didn't reach 0 anyway.\n'...' Stark's expression didn't change, and the clones, which were made out of aura from him, also had a neutral expression on their face in comparison to their usual cheerful selves.\n\"Crimson Spears,\" the clones summoned their six spears and threw them in the direction of the eyes of one of the [Shadow Bears] that was still hiding in the mist.\n\"Hearing Prediction,\" but the bear, using his advanced ears and speed, somehow managed to avoid them all by running around.\n'...Annoying.'\nRealizing that hiding wouldn't do them any good when their opponent could attack from afar, all the bears came out of their hiding spots.\nAnd after Stark counted... he saw that there were 13 of them.\n'Nice... more experience,' he didn't even bother to act surprised, the only thing bringing a smile to his face being the fact he would surely level up by at least one level if he killed all of them.\nBut as if sensing that the human was too confident...\n\"ROOOAAARRR~\" all the bear suddenly roared, creating a shockwave that shook the air, and even people back at the entrance heard it, some of them leaving as they thought it was another event mini-boss.\nAnd only a few seconds after...\n[The River is calling for help...]\nA pitch-black panel appeared before him, and the river right next to him began to shake, the faces of the souls distorting even more than they already were.\n~BOOM, BOOM, BOOM~\nAnd so, as if acting like some sort of monster generator, six bird-like monsters came out of the abyss of the water.\nThey were giant birds, twice as big as Stark, completely dark and with edges flowing like waves, basically just like the [Shadow Bears], but their wings, beak, legs, and stomach were white.\nThey turned around Stark, a few meters above him, visible from above as their flapping wings emitted a white aura visible from beyond the mist.\n[Shadow Bird, Level 95]\n'...' Stark's expression didn't change, 'More experience...'\nStark's eyes glinted with determination as he surveyed the new adversaries that had appeared before him.\nThe Shadow Birds circled above him with menacing grace, their white features standing out against their dark, undulating bodies, while on the other hand, the Shadow Bears were slowly approaching him, their mouth and eyes full of rage.\n'…' Stark and his clones positioned themselves.\n…\n[Name: Shadow Bird]\n[Level: 95]\n[HP: 135000]\n[Strength: 1738]\n[Stamina: 3502]\n[Speed: 3981]\n[Defense: 2955]\n[Skills: Crest of Shadows, Gale Strike, Shadow Dive, Piercing Screech, River Puppet, Call of the Birds, Shadow Flight…]\n…\n\"SHADOW DIVE!\" all six birds suddenly dived toward Stark, leaving a trail of aura as they descended upon him, blocking his exit from all directions.\n\"GROUP ATTACK!\" and to make it worse, all thirteen bears swarmed in from the sides, aiming to corner Stark in a pincer attack, some of them even jumping in the air to catch him.\nThis meant that [Invincible Dodge] wouldn't work as the moment he tried to do that, he would be met with another one of the monsters that would surely slash him.\n'…' Stark was unmoved, he just unsummoned his clones and waited for impact, 'Oh well… I might as well…'\nStark sighed as he remembered that he had 'THAT' skill he had unlocked less than two days ago with his most recent level up.\nAnd so he activated it.\n\"DODGE CONTROL…!\"\n[Description:] For exactly 15 seconds, your aura takes over your body and allows you to bend it in any way it needs to, making you able to dodge any and every attack that comes your way, no matter how fast or unavoidable it is.\nThe moment the first Shadow Bird and Shadow Bear reached where Stark stood, he vanished in a blur of crimson light. His body contorted and twisted in an impossible manner, evading the attacks with grace that defied logic.\nStark couldn't control his body anymore.\n'Huh…?' he could obviously think, but he wasn't the one moving it, rather, it was his own aura.\nStark reappeared behind one of the Shadow Birds, his crimson eyes burning with determination. With unparalleled speed, he unleashed a barrage of punches, each strike infused with his dominating aura.\nThe force of his blows sent shockwaves rippling through the mist-covered battlefield.\n\"-58382! -61291! -59033!\" the first bird died before it could even understand what happened.\nThe remaining monsters on the other hand just looked around, confused as to how the human had avoided their impossible to dodge attack: they had one it against several people before, and it always worked.\n[11 seconds of 'Dodge Control' remaining]\nHe couldn't understand how this skill worked since after avoiding, he immediately took control over his body again, and was the one that killed the bird.\n'Does it mean my aura only takes control when an attack is coming…?' it was basically some sort of autopilot, very useful.\nAnd so just like that, Stark got ready to fight the rest of them, quickly but surely getting rid of them all before they could do anything else.",

      "content": "\"GALE STRIKE!\" all the [Shadow Birds] began to repeatedly flap their wings in Stark's dimension, their shadow aura intensifying with each beat.\nA whirlwind of shadows and piercing wind blades surrounded Stark, threatening to overwhelm him in a cacophony of darkness.\n'…'\n\"Shadow Body…!\" the bears' bodies also began to grow in size, their auras increasing as if the shadow waves were taking over, making them much more powerful, ready to attack the human.\n[9 seconds of 'Dodge Control' remaining]\nNot even bothering to acknowledge the attacks, Stark just pointed at the sky above all the monsters and himself, then drew a circle before gently tapping his palm.\n\"HEAVEN'S WRATH!\" the crimson spark appeared in the sky above all of them, and especially above Stark as he actually aimed mainly for himself.\n~FWISH, FWISH~ it was charging up.\nBut the [Shadow Bears] and [Shadow Birds] believed this to be a bluff: after all, why would the human aim such a powerful attack at itself if it didn't want to die?\nAnd so they came up with one simple solution: the human was tricking them, and getting close to him was the sole way to survive as even they could sense that [Heaven's Wrath]'s aura was deadly.\n~DASH, DASH~\nStark avoided all of the shadow blades of wind quite easily thanks to [Dodge Control], there were dozens of them in all directions, but his body almost teleported at times just to not be hit.\nBasically… it was truly impossible for anyone to hit him when he had that skill.\nMaybe he would have even teleported or fazed right through the Mirror Master's [All-Area Strike] without even using [Invincible Dodge].\n'…' in the end, it didn't matter.\n\"SHADOW CLAWS!\"\n\"CREST OF SHADOWS!\"\nHe avoided attacks from all directions for a few seconds, the claws of the bears hitting him by a hair's length every time, and the wings of the birds becoming extremely sharp thanks to [Crest of Shadows], but his aura somehow always finding a way to avoid it.\n[4 seconds of 'Dodge Control' remaining]\n~FWISH~\nBy this point, the monsters were becoming desperate, and they truly gave up when they saw the massive beam start descending upon them.\n[3 seconds of 'Dodge Control' remaining]\nStark looked up as well, the beam now only a few centimeters above his head, truly wondering how 'Dodge Control' could get him out of there now that it was so close, even almost touching his hair.\nIt was a risk he had taken, and maybe it was wrong… maybe he would die?\n'…' Stark's expression didn't change in the face of death.\n~BOOOOOM~\nThe crimson beam descended from the heaven's and finally hit the ground, disintegrating every living thing that was in its radius as it reduced them to ashes in less than two seconds.\n\"CRAWKKKE!!!\" the birds cried.\n\"ROAWWR!!!!\" and the bears roared in pain.\nYes… everything… was reduced to nothing…\nEven Stark?\n[0 seconds of 'Dodge Control' remaining]\n['Dodge Control' disabled]\nStark opened his eyes again, and saw that he was right in front of the beam, the intense aura before him leaving a weird feeling on his skin.\nOne step ahead, and his foot, if not entire body, would be disintegrated by the laser.\nBut this little experiment did confirm it: he could avoid anything, no matter how big or fast it is, well the skill description did say it, but he still tried.\nHe had literally teleported once the laser was centimeters above his head, so fast that even a level 500 classifier couldn't see how fast his aura controlled him to get out of the way.\n'…' Stark remained calm and waited for the beam to disappear, and it did after a few seconds, the dissipating smoke revealing the small body parts of the shadow monsters had somehow survived.\nBut they were all dead, this was a fact now that he observed it.\nAnd so with that… came the rewards.\n[You have slain \"Shadow Bear lv93\", gained 113432EXP!]\n[You have slain \"Shadow Bear lv93\", gained 109381EXP!]\n[You have slain \"Shadow Bear lv93\", gained 114403EXP!]\n.\n.\n.\nThis went on for the fifteen [Shadow Bears] he had killed, then the panels moved to the other monster.\n[You have slain \"Shadow Bird

experience.\nBecause with all of this…\n[+2,435,279 Experience Points!]\nThis was beyond anything he had ever earned, even against the Corrupted Ghoul or Sierra.\nBut…\n'Not enough…' for the first time, Stark squinted his eyes and his expression was filled with worry, 'Not even close…' his eyes were burning with aura as he was surrounded not once, not twice, BUT THRICE, by the golden glow.\n[Your level has increased to level 36, granting you two skill points and boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 37, granting you two skill points and boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 38, granting you two skill points and boost in stats]\n[Experience: 683778/834000]\n'…' Stark truly wanted to feel happy at this very moment, after all, it was the sigh that he was closer to his goal than he believed.\nMaybe five or six more encounters like this one, and he could reach even level 45?!\nBut… something else came to break that hope.\n[Classifier A has reached level 50, conditions for 'Domination Trial' have been met!]\n[8/10 classifiers have reached the needed level, be quick or else when everybody but you reaches level 50, you will still be teleported!]\n[Only one classifier remains before teleportation!]\nSo basically… it was a battle between Stark and Classifier B.\n[Classifier B: 48/50]\nThat guy must be currently laughing while slaying monsters, knowing that whatever he did, he would always reach level 50 before Stark.\nAt the end of the day, it was a battle of determination, and Stark was clearly losing it.\n'I can't win…' a vortex yet again formed in Stark's eyes as he thought deeply, 'The only thing I can do is cut my losses as much as possible…'\nBeing the person with the lowest level inside the 'Domination Trial' was always a death wish as you would be outclassed by both monsters and others, meaning that they could betray you.\nAnd in comparison to the first trial, which awaited for all of them to reach level 15, this one seemed… more cruel…?\nIt was basically forcing someone to be the scapegoat of the group: and currently that person was Stark.\n'FUCK, GET YOURSELF TOGETHER,' he slapped both his cheeks as he greeted his teeth, 'JUST KEEP TRYING…!'\nAnd so he began reading through the mist as fast as he could, this was a matter of life and death now, and all the other classifiers that had reached level 50 were probably all sitting back and waiting for the last one to reach the needed level.\nHe could feel their laughter, he could feel their mockery…\n'…' and Stark hated that, he refused to be the weakest one.\nHE REFUSED TO LET THOSE FUCKERS TAKE HIM OVER!\nNot today, not in this rift, not even during the domination trial, he would NEVER back down, and he would NEVER let himself get trampled on.\nBecause at the end of the day… he was still the [Domination] user with the highest potential of them all, wasn't he?",

Stark could see that the dozens of mouths and eyes on the bandages were moving.\nAround its neck hung a giant jar containing three green spheres that spun around.\nBut what caught Stark's attention the most was the boss's weapon.\nIt wasn't fancy magic at first glance, but… a sword?\nIt was a black two-handed great sword, almost as large as the boss itself and emitting an ominous aura that could rival even Stark's own power.\nIts design was unusual, being more than three inches thick in the middle and not tapering off at the end for sharpness.\nIt was clear that this sword was meant for powerful strikes rather than stabbing.\nAnd the boss wielded it with ease, twirling it around as if it weighed nothing.\nThe boss's eyes burned with crimson aura, leaving a visible trail beyond the small opening of the shadow helmet, and the bandages around it also began to shake as its eyes fell on the human.\n'…' Stark's expression faltered for the first time, he couldn't keep calm in front of this thing, which seemed to not even acknowledge him as a worthy opponent.\nThe shine of the moon hit both Stark and the boss, creating a beautiful scenery around them as their bodies reflected on the water.\nIf it wasn't for the fact they would fight to the death, then there would surely have been a great moment to enjoy.\n'…'\n'…'\nSoulayer and Stark looked at one another, before the former raised his massive sword, then pointing it at Stark, announcing the start of the fight.\n[Classifier B is roughly 120,000EXP away from leveling up!]\nA crimson panel came to bring Stark back to reality, it was a reminder of the harsh things that awaited him if he didn't get rid of Soulayer before the other person leveled up.\nAnd so Stark's expression went back to its unusual cold self, his eyes empty and almost lifeless as his thoughts were now clouded with the idea of getting rid of this boss as fast as possible.\n'Perception…' Stark decided to immediately analyze the boss, that thing was truly out of this world, well he probably was since the process of getting to this place was basically to jump into an unknown pit and getting dragged by hands, but oh well.\n…\n[Name: Soulayer, The Bearer of Souls (BOSS)]\n[Level: 100]\n[HP: 420000]\n[Strength: 5128]\n[Stamina: 4732]\n[Speed: 3901]\n[Defense: 4436]\n[Skills: Soul Strike, Reap Spirit, Soul Wall, Abyssal Roar, Shadow Step, Death's Embrace, Eternal Darkness, The Three Ultimate Souls, Sword Counter…]\n…\n'Why me…' Stark sulked after reading its status window, it was even stronger than the [Corrupted Ghoul], and it seemed to have absolutely no intention to let Stark kill it easily.\nIn a battle against time, how could Stark even hope of killing that monster, with HP and strength beyond anything he had fought before.\nBut lamenting your misfortune wasn't the solution.\nFor now… Stark just needed to try.\nTo hell with that 'Domination Trial', he'll clear it even at level 10 (or maybe not, heh).\n\"ABYSSAL ROAR~\" Soulayer suddenly shouted with his face toward the sky, creating some supersonic shockwaves, that shook the entirety of the arena, making the water tremble.\n…\n[Skill: Abyssal Roar]\n[Description: Doesn't do much except to announce that 'Soulayer' will be fighting with his full abilities, he only uses this skill at the start of battles with opponents he believes are worthy.]\n[Note: Soulayer has only used this skill seven times up until now, so it is both an honor, but also terrifying to hear his scream.]\n…\n[3…]\nSoulayer finished his weird shouting then stared back at Stark, his greatsword held behind his back.\n[2…]\n'Domination…!'

Soulayer didn't back down, though, he always liked to overwhelm his enemies before they could even do anything.\n\"AURA SMASH,\" wanting to takes2 advantage of that momentum, Stark sent two crimson fists at the dashing boss.\nBut...\n\"SOUL WALL!\" Soulayer placed the tip of the sword on the water, then swung it upward.\n~VRAM~\nA wall of black water, filled with many souls again, appeared before him.\n~BOOM, BOOM~\n\"-0! -0!\"\nThe water, as well as the souls, received the damage and completely blocked the two crimson fists from reaching the boss.\n\"SHADOW STEP!\" suddenly, Soulayer used this skill while still behind the wall.\nBut that was something Stark didn't know, so he just waited for the wall to go down to spot the boss.\n~FWISH, VIOUM~\nBut once the wall of black water went down... Soulayer was nowhere to be seen?\n'Huh?' Stark was confused, how could he possibly disappear out of nowhere…?\n[Behind you...]\nSoulayer was so precise and fast that even [Focus] took a few moments to notice where he was, and the moment it did, it warned Stark.\n\"...?!\"\nStark turned his head, and saw that Soulayer was already there, his greatsword centimeters away from Stark's neck, the aura of the souls so close he himself could feel it.\nStark's pupils shook violently as time slowed down around him: that boss was too fast.\n~BAMMM~\nThe boss was able to hit because he took Stark by surprise, and it shook its head, disappointed in Stark for dying so fast.\nBut...\n[The Purgatory Shadow took the hit in your place]\nThe shadow version of Stark came out of the ring and took the hit of the greatsword.\nBut the real one was still sent away by the knock back of the attack as it was too strong.\n~SLAM~\nHe was sent very far, crashing against the water repeatedly.\n[Behind you...]\n[Focus] warned him again, and Stark almost shit himself thinking that Soulayer was behind again.\nBut this time, [Focus] had warned him because of something else: the mist.\nHe was getting dangerously close to the mist while still being knocked back.\n'SHIT...' he knew touching it was game over, so Stark gripped the ground beneath the water to stop his momentum.\n~SLIDE, FWISHH~\nAnd when it finally stopped... he saw that he had been only a meter away from entering the grey mist.\n'FUCK...' he dashed in Soulayer's direction.\nHe didn't panic, but his time was getting really short.\n[Classifier B is 50,000 EXP away from reaching level 50]\n[Critical warning, I would really advise you to kill the boss before he reaches level 50]\n'FUCK YOU...' Stark's face began to be covered by his crimson aura again, his eyes burning too, 'FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU...'\nIn less than a fraction of a second, he closed the distance between him and Soulayer.\n\"...!\" even the boss seemed surprised as its eyes behind the mask clearly squinted, and its aura faltered for a bit.\nBut...\n\"Shadow STEP...\" it slowly moved one of its legs, and beneath it formed some black aura that resembled a moving shadow.\n~FWISH~\nIt was so quick that it almost teleported behind Stark, already swinging its sword at him again.\n\"SOUL STRIKE!\" the power of the souls was stronger, and this time Stark couldn't be saved by a piece of equipment.\nYet Stark's expression didn't change, and his pupils were already perfectly following Soulayer as it shadow-stepped behind him.\n~SWING~\nAnd so when the edges of the greatsword were mere millimeters away from cutting Stark in half...\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" he had decided to actually take the risk as it was his only way to gain the advantage.\nAnd it seemed to be the right call, as...\n[Perfect Dodge!]\nThe world around Stark turned gray, and time slowed down so much that Stark could see Soulayer's sword faze through him thanks to the invincibility frames.\n'...'\nRight in front of him, only a few centimeters ahead, was Soulayer's determined and soulless gaze, watching the human, and even the trail of crimson aura coming out of the small hole of his helmet was slowed down.\n'…!' and when he saw that, he figured a way that could make him do lots of damage.\nHitting Soulayer, even in this slow mode world, wouldn't do any type of relevant damage because of his sheer defense and HP pool, meaning that Stark would need to cause huge amounts of damage at once, enough to cause the [Dominated] status to the boss, or to at least cripple him.\nBut it didn't mean Stark couldn't do at least some damage…\n~SPIN, KICK~\nUsing Soulayer's body as a platform, he used his knees to spin around and kick the boss in the chin while focusing his aura onto his legs.\n\"-42919!\" surprisingly, the damage was still very high, or maybe it was because the chin was one of Soulayer's weaknesses?\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS,\" and while the boss was beginning to get sent upward because of the powerful kick, Stark summoned his three spears and sent them all toward it.\nRespectively toward: its leg, torso, and… neck!\nThe first two spears hit the boss without any issues, and it didn't even try to defend them.\n\"-24726! -25012!\"\nBut for the last…\n\"CRAKKARR~\" it suddenly roared again, then placed one of its shadow armored arms in front of the jar holding the three green spheres.\n\"-12931!\" it did less damage because of the armor which blocked most of the damage.\nThe spear, although it was headed toward the neck, was still going to have to destroy the jar to pass through.\nBut that meant…\n'Is that jar important…?' Stark's eyes widened and he mischievously smiled.\nStark wanted to make use of everything to win… and this was jackpot.\n~SPLASH~\nSoulayer dropped stylishly onto the ground, then immediately checked the jar and the three spears, his expression, although it wasn't visible, softening when he made sure they were safe.\nBut that calm was only but temporary, as the moment he checked, his turned his head back to Stark, and the aura around him became ten times as strong.\nIt was both crimson, but it also had the faces of souls repeatedly going upward on it.\nHe truly deserved his name: The Bearer of Souls.\nAnd now that he was mad… it wasn't fun time anymore.\n\"REAP SPIRIT, ETERNAL DARKNESS,\" these weren't his ultimate skills, yet they were just as terrifying.\nStark just smiled as he positioned himself again, ready to take it all, plus, he already had a plan in mind to take care of that boss.",

-34019! -33124!\" over 100K points of damage in one go, and this made Stark smiled: he still had one more clone, and it meant one more opportunity to deal damage.\nFrom the short amount of information he got from his clones though, it seemed like Soulayer had actually dropped his greatsword, or just unsummoned it, as he didn't have it equipped, instead he was just using his hands to catch his preys in the dark, almost like some horror movie villain.\nIt was a game of cat and mouse in the dark, where the mouse could only fight back using the little information it had available to it.\n[Death's Embrace] combined to [Reap Spirit] massively increased Soulayer's speed, stealth, intelligence, and the aura around his hands was extremely overwhelming, small souls floating around it.\nAnd now… it was looking for Stark, the real one that is.\n'Hahahahahah…' Stark's grin widened as he knew exactly what to do.\nHe immediately dashed in the opposite direction to where the Soulayer and his clone were, making to stop right before the gray mist that could kill him.\nAnd then…\n'TRANSFER,' he focused his aura into his body, then his eyes, and sent all of it toward the eyes of the clone that was still in the mist.\nAnd when he opened his eyes again… he found himself in the body of the clone.\n'Nice…'\nHe knew that leaving his real body alone, with no way to know what would happen to it, but he put all the chances to his side when he knew that Soulayer was mostly in the area of the third clone, meaning it would be very unlikely for it to go toward Stark.\nBut just as Stark was about to start looking for Soulayer… he felt an intense aura right behind him.\n[He is behind you…]\n'=)' but this didn't scare Stark in the slightest, instead it actually was exactly what he wanted.\n~FWISH~\nSoulayer raised his soul-filled arms and tried to grab Stark's clone body to kill it from behind.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" but he just backed away, pinpointing the location of Soulayer as to not lose track of where he was.\nAnd then…\n\"AURA SMASH… MERGE!\" Stark began to charge up his crimson fists, forced to hold his right hand's wrist as to not immediately explode since the clones didn't have enough power or aura to actually send the attack.\nBut it didn't matter to begin with, since… Stark planned to do a [Clone Suicide]… this was his plan to deal massive damage.\n\"…\" even through the darkness of it all, Stark could somehow sense Soulayer getting closer and closer, attempting to take the boy from behind again.\nHe was like a true assassin, and so it did make Stark wonder just what the hell happened inside the [Soul Graveyard] rift for a monster (or possibly human?) to turn into a rift boss…?\n'…'\n~FWISH~\nSoulayer was already behind Stark once he charged up his [Aura Smash] attack to its maximum, any more and it would explode.\n'GOTCHA!' was what Soulayer must have probably thought as it reached to grab Stark's torso and began to tear it apart.\nBut…\n\"IDIOT~\" Stark turned his head toward Soulayer, a grin so malicious and wicked on it that even the boss trembled slightly when seeing it, sending a shiver down its spine.\nAnd then… what had to happen happened.\n~FWISHHHH~\nEven though the clone's body was being thorn to shreds by the soul hands of the boss, its body suddenly became to bloom with an unimaginable aura, an aura that could blow anyone away who was unlucky enough to be caught in the radius.\nThis was [Clone Suicide].\n~BOOOOOMM~\nThe boss was sent very far away, and some of the bandages around its body parts were burned by the sheer power of the attack.\nIn addition to that, it couldn't defend itself much since it prioritized putting its arms in front of the jar to protect it.\n\"-192713!\" the damage was out of this world, and even Soulayer was affected by such an attack, forcing it to deactivate both [Eternal Darkness] and [Reap Spirit].\nSuddenly, the arena went back to normal, and the Stark that was hiding in the corner woke up again as the consciousness of the real one took over again.\n[Soulayer HP: 64663/420000]\nIt truly was the final showdown now, and Stark felt confident as he still had a bit of time on his hand.\nOr did he now…\n~DING~\n[Classifier B has reached level 50!]\n'…!'",

      "content": "~DING~\n[Classifier B has reached level 50!]\n'SHIT…!'\nIt was all over now, and Stark even stopped everything he was doing, ending his assault on Soulayer as there was no point anymore.\n[9/10 classifiers have reached the required level for the start of the 'Domination Trial']\nSoulayer summoned back his sword in hand, then began to slowly walk toward Stark, he seemed extremely mad, and the bandages hit by the explosion were still burnt: it definitely looked like Soulayer was more fearful and uncertain than before though as he hesitated to approach Stark.\nBut Stark wasn't paying attention to him.\n[But that wouldn't be fun to just teleport you, now, would it?]\nIt wasn't his crimson panels that were talking to him when it was related to the domination trial, but crimson/black panels that had deep eyes staring in the background beyond the text.\nWas it the eyes of the entity that was responsible for those trials?\nThe creator of the [Domination] class?\nIn the end, it didn't matter much, as the finality of it all was that everyone but Stark had already reached level 50, the latter only being at level 39, a far cry from all the others.\n[The person that hasn't reached the required level is going to receive a punishment!]\nStark lifted his gaze toward the panel, then raised his eyebrows, 'Punishment…?'\nThis was already bad to begin with, how could this even get worse?!\n~DING~\nAnd so… while Soulayer was still walking toward Stark…\n[You will be teleported to the 'Domination Trial' after completing this battle]\n'…!' Stark's eyes widened, this was incredible news for him.\nBut of course, life wouldn't be this easy.\n[But in exchange, you will receive two punishments!]\n[The first: all participants of the trial will be watching your fight from now on]\n[Have fun!]\n[The second punishment for being the last shall come once the trial start =)]\nAll 9 participants that were dispersed not only in Fellarburg, but throughout the entire world of Rheria, each in their respective rooms/baths/luxury suits, reading the panels as they appeared.\nAnd then before them… appeared a screen that showed live footage of Stark against Soulayer.\n\"Oh~\" some of them smiled as they increased the size of the screen to enjoy the view, interested in Stark's abilities.\n\"Hah! Let's hope that loser doesn't die before the trial starts,\" another sipped his wine before grinning.\n\"Useless… he is weak…\" another one, confined in the darkness of his room, sighed, not interested one bit in the weakest person of them all.\nAfter all, only the weakest would still be at level 39 after a while, wouldn't he be, or at least that's what each of them believed.\nThey MOCKED Stark as they stared at their screens, almost hoping that he survived this battle so that they could torture him even harder inside the trial.\nBack to Stark, the implications of this punishment were clear: it wasn't humiliation to show to all the others around that he was the last.\nNo… the real goal of showing his fight against Soulayer was to…\nShow his skills to them all.\nEven during the first 'Domination Trial', information was key, and so hiding your skills was just as important as the fights themselves, after all… just one simple skill could be enough to turn the tides of a battle if they betrayed him (which they probably will).\n[Do not, under any circumstances, use any of your strong skills.]\nIt was himself that summoned this panel, as if to let the thoughts sink onto his consciousness.\nAnd so Stark needed to make a list of the only skills he couldn't use against the weakened boss to not reveal too much info.\n'Double Assault, Heaven's Wrath, Clone Frenzy, Aura Smash and Dodge Control…' he thought to himself, these were the skills he would never reveal to them right now, although using them at this very moment would probably end the battle easily.\n[Crimson Spears] could be revealed to them as he didn't use it much anyway, and [Invincible Dodge] was pretty much a passive, so they wouldn't understand how it worked anyway.\nBut that also left one thing he could use to win his battle: the potions, after all, they would just think that he bought them!\n\"I hope all of you losers are watching,\" he looked to his right, his determined expression right in front of the camera as he grinned, all 9 other participants looking at his semi-handsome face, \"I'll teach you all what real strength is.\"\nBeyond the screens, some were laughing, others intrigued, while the rest kept their neutral expressions.\nAll of them, for some reason, felt like this very moment would play a huge part in the trial later.\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS!\" he summoned his three spears right behind him, then aimed them at Soulayer, who simply kept walking, his expression even more lifeless than before, one of his arms holding the jar with the green spheres, while the other had the greatsword equipped, its aura much more powerful than before.\nBut when he sent all three spears toward the monster…\n\"SWORD COUNTER!\" with movement so fast it wasn't visible to the naked eye, it removed its arm from the jar and placed it on the handle of the sword, placing it sideways right below its eyes, which were still burning with crimson aura.\nSoulayer waited for the perfect opportunity, and when the spears were right in front of him, he held the handle of his sword tighter and swung it thrice in a motion so smooth it always looked slow from afar.\nThen…\n~FWING, FWING, FWING~\nAs the skill said, Soulayer countered Stark's attack by sending it back to him.\n'Shit…!'\n~FWISH, FWISH~\nHe avoided the first two quite easily, but the third almost hit him, which forced him to…\n'Invincible Dodge,' use his skill at the last second.\n[Perfect Dodge!]\n'Huh…?' the world around turned gray, and Stark was actually able to see it all go very slowly.\nDidn't this mean that even if it was his own attacks, as long as it was the enemy itself that attempted to attack him, then [Perfect Dodge] would work…?\nThis could be useful later, so Stark made sure to remember that.\n'Ok… no other option it seems,' he sighed, [Invincible Dodge]'s perfect dodge gave him around fifteen seconds of free time to think, and that was enough for Stark to reach his conclusion.\n'Crimson Spears' wouldn't work, and he couldn't use any of his skills as to not reveal them except if it was really needed.\nSo now… all he could use were his fist and… potions!\n'SPATIAL INVENTORY,' he put his arm inside of the inventory void, then pulled out five [Crystal Stun] potions, as well as one [Potion of Strength]and one [Potion of Speed].\nHe drank the two latter as to allow him to get a boost, then breathe in and out as he was about to put the plan he thought of since the beginning of the battle into action.\nAnd worst: in front of 9 of the people he would be fighting with/against inside the second 'Domination Trial'.\nSuch a trivial thing didn't increase Stark's pressure or change his expression one bit though, after all… all that mattered was for him to win, the rest would be all up to him and the others.\nAnd so, it wasn't only Stark that was getting ready, but also the boss…\n\"THE THREE ULTIMATE SOULS!\" he activated his true ultimate skill.\n[They are

      "content": "\"THE THREE ULTIMATE SOULS!\" Soulayer used his final and ultimate skill, wanting to end this battle as he already had suffered too much damage by the hands of this kid.\nHe dropped his greatsword, making it splash against the water, then pulled up the string that was holding the jar around his neck.\nThat jar was as big as his hands, and he held in both of his, his expression yet again softening.\nSoulayer immediately shook his head and quickly glanced at Stark, then he shut his eyes and began to turn the lid of the jar, his expression darkening after each twist.\nAs the jar twisted, Soulayer's eyes began to glow with an intense crimson aura, and the water in the giant pond began to ripple at the sight of this powerful display.\n\"Die!\" Soulayer roared, his muffled voice echoing through the area as he flung the opened jar forward, sending a wave of crimson energy surging around him.\nBut right as that happened…\nNine screens appeared around Stark.\n[They are watching.]\nEach of these screens showed the figure of one of the 9 participants of the trial, every single one of them observing the fight with great interest.\nStark couldn't see their faces as their figures with pitch-black, obviously, but their eyes, all burning with different colored auras, could be seen from beyond the crimson screens.\nTheir judgmental stares indicated that they knew Stark could now see them, and it seemed to make them enjoy that situation even more: after all, HE was the weak one, not them.\n\"Feeling hopeless yet~?\" he saw one of the figures move its mouth, but couldn't hear the words it said.\n\"Hurry up and die, I want to start the trial,\" another sighed.\n\"SHOW MEEEE WHATTT YOUU'VEEE GOOTTT!\" some kind of motivator shouted while doing signs.\n'I hope you all keep that same attitude when I'm there,' Stark maniacally smiled before turning his attention back to Soulayer, who had seemingly freed the three green spheres that he had been protecting inside the jar all this time.\nIt was his ultimate skill, so he needed to be careful.\n\"ABYSSAL ROAR~\" Soulayer roared again (for no reason), and this second one was… way stronger than the first.\nThis could only mean one thing: Soulayer acknowledged Stark as the strongest opponent he had fought yet.\n'Appreciate it,' Stark kept smiling as he positioned his fists in front of his face, 'But I'm still killing you…!'\nThe three spheres inside the jar left it once opened and began to swirl around Soulayer, creating a dark and ominous aura that seemed to engulf him completely.\nThe crimson glow suddenly turned green again, almost as if Soulayer was absorbing the power of those spheres…\nAnd he was.\n…\n[Skill: The Three Ultimate Souls]\n[Description: The souls of Soulayer's friends who died inside the 'Soul Graveyard' rift, they are his strongest souls and most precious ones, if the battle goes bad for him, he will activate this skill and release those souls to aid him.]\n[I do not wish for anyone to experience this.]\n…\nAnd just as it said… three green ghost-like figures appeared around Soulayer, spinning around him.\nOne was a woman, and two were men, their faces were devoid of any feature, and they had no hair either, it was impossible to identify them.\nYet… Soulayer's determination when his friends were around him almost tripled, and he grabbed his sword again.\n~FWISH~\nOne of the male souls surrounded the entire greatsword and a powerful green outline appeared.\n~FWISH~\nThe second male headed toward Soulayer's second arm and created another sword, identical to the first one, yet its texture completely green.\nAnd finally…\n~FWISH~\nThe soul of the woman gently held onto Soulayer's neck and peeked at Stark from behind his shoulders.\n'…' Stark wasn't deterred, and such an emotional or powerful skill wouldn't stop him for murdering that boss.\nSoulayer was now stronger, faster, and also had two swords, but it didn't matter.\n'Two or three hits and he's done…' Stark only thought of the positive in this situation.\n\"Holy… that thing is strong!\"\n\"Looks like that guy is going to die before even reaching the trial, what went through his mind to attempt this at his level?!\"\n\"Probably too desperate to level up, heh~\"\nThe other participants, who's screens were still around Stark, spoke, even they could sense that boss was abnormally strong.\nThe soulless Soulayer, and his soul friends, advanced toward Stark, one step at a time.\n'Okay, Stark…' the boy slapped his cheeks, 'You can only use your fists, nothing else, you can do it…'\nHe was getting ready, not using his skills was something he had never done before, but maybe it was time to actively train to not rely on them?\n~FWISH, DASH~\nSurprisingly, Stark was the one who began dashing toward the boss.\nHe was holding on to his five [Crystal Stun] potions with his hands, ready to use them at any time: they were his grace, his solution, and his only true plan to win.\nYeah, okay, maybe that wasn't ONLY using your fists and aura, but who cares, he could use as many of these potions as he wanted in battle, right?\n~FWISH~\nStark jumped when he was around three meters away from the walking Soulayer, his face full of determination.\n'TAKE THIS,' he threw one of his potions toward Soulayer, who didn't even bother avoiding it.\n~CRACK~\nIt hit him straight on, and the mist began to surround its body, and yet…\n[Soulayer is unaffected by the mist]\n'FUCK…!' here goes his plan.\n~FWISH~\nWanting to make sure, Stark threw another one while still beginning to fall down, this time aiming it at his shoulder.\nStark expected him to yet again do nothing as he took a stance, ready to battle the human.\nBut…\n\"SWORD COUNTER,\" almost as if panicked by the potion, Soulayer used his skill to throw the potion back at Stark.\n~CRACK~\nIt exploded on him, but of course, Stark was unaffected by the mist too.\n'…!' many people would identify such an action as the boss wanting to not get hit again.\nBut to Stark… it meant something big, and it could definitely help him win.\nHe had figured it out, and a light bulb shone in his head as he remembered the actions of Soulayer.\nWhy would he suddenly defend himself when the potion was headed toward his shoulder…?\nWhat was around his shoulder that he needed to defend?\nAnd so with that logic, the answer came fast: it was the soul of the woman that was hiding behind.\nMeaning… Soulayer was defending them.\nStark would make sure to take advantage of that.\n\"SOUL STRIKE!\" Soulayer roared again as he dashed at Stark, ready to cut the human alongside his soul friends.",

      "content": "\"…\"\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nAll future participants of the Domination Trial looked at Soulayer as he dashed toward Stark, his expression more mad than ever after the boy seemingly attempted to harm his friend.\n~SLASH, SLASH~\n[Soul Strike] was used twice since one of the green spheres had turned into a greatsword too, making it increasingly difficult to avoid the precise blows of Soulayer.\nAnd yet…\n'A boss having emotions is weird… but It's what is going to send you to your death…' Stark avoided the slashes of the two swords quite easily, moving by a single step each time thanks to [Focus]'s warnings as it almost felt like Soulayer was recklessly attacking in all directions, in the hopes of one strike hitting Stark.\nThrough all that, the human boy kept a very composed face, and he almost… looked bored?\n~FWISH~\nAnd so when he saw an opportunity present itself…\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\"\n[Perfect Dodge!]\nHaving two swords did indeed make it harder to dodge, but it wasn't impossible.\nActually… it might even be easier for one simple reason…\nThe world slowed down around Stark, and right above him, he could see the green greatsword that was formed from one of the 'ULTIMATE' souls slowly descend upon him.\n'GOT YOU…!' Stark saw the line that showed an opportunity, and he immediately took it as he dashed forward, and grabbed the boss's legs.\n'…?!' Soulayer was surprised as it almost looked like Stark teleported, but then quickly aimed the other greatsword at him.\nSoulayer's weapons and figure were extremely big, that is true, but…\n~SLAM~\nStark moved to the left the moment Soulayer struck the spot the boy was in, resulting in his sword splashing against the water.\nStark's goal wasn't to make the boss lose his balance, no…\nInstead…\n\"GOT YOU…!\" it was to make it impossible for him to counter what he was to do.\n~THROW~\nHe grabbed one of his [Crystal Stun] potions and threw it toward the green greatsword.\nThe potion exploded upon impact and then…\n[Soul A has been stunned]\n[A soul cannot be stunned, Soul A is vanishing!]\nAnd just as the panels said, the greatsword began to flicker before vanishing entirely.\nOne of Soulayer's friends was gone, and he couldn't do anything about it as attacking Stark made it impossible to react fast enough to break the potion.\n'IT'S MY WIN,' Stark used this momentum to get to throw another potion, this time toward Soulayer's shoulders.\nBut…\n\"GROEIEREREAHAH!!!\" he suddenly roared so loudly that the shockwave sent Stark flying in the opposite direction, and it even broke the two potions he was holding.\nThe loss of one of his friends had pushed Soulayer to the edge, and now he would make sure to kill the human.\nBut how could he do that when he was this weak, and clearly overwhelmed?\nWell…\n[Soulayer has acquired a new skill!]\n'Huh…?' Stark's eyes widened, and his pupils were shaking.\nA skill? Soulayer gained a new skill? How could that be possible? Can bosses do that?!\n[Soulayer has acquired the 'MYTHICAL' skill: Soul Vortex!]\n…\n[Skill: Soul Vortex]\n[Description: The bearer of souls, the one who has slain countless foes, can tap the black water with his sword and force the thousands of souls that rest there, in eternal torture, to surround both him and his enemy, forcing them to fight in an arena that is controlled by the slayer's desires.]\n[Note: Touching the souls drains your life energy.]\n…\n\"SOUL VORTEX!\" Soulayer roared again before slamming the water with his sword vertically, almost as if he was trying to stab it.\nAnd so the soul vortex appeared: thousands upon thousands of souls came out of the water and began to circle Stark and Soulayer like a vortex, spinning around them very fast.\nOf course, the latter wasn't bothered as he was the one controlling the souls, but Stark on the other hand actually began to slightly panic.\n'What… the… fuck…' he looked back at Soulayer, and saw that another hole opened in his shadow helmet: the place where his mouth was in is now visible, and Stark saw that he was massively grinning.\nSoulayer wanted to avenge his now gone friend while keeping the other two with him.\nBut of course, this couldn't be possible, as it was either Stark or him.\n\"I'm sending you to hell with them,\" Stark gritted his teeth, and his face began to be surrounded by crimson aura too, he wasn't smiling anymore.\nIf [Soul Vortex] was a skill beyond even ULTIMATE or LEGENDARY, then all he needed to do was find a way to end this quickly.\nThe vortex of souls grew more intense, and Stark could feel the power seeping into him. The souls were not just spinning around them, but also drawing him and Soulayer closer with each passing moment as the circle was slowly closing in on them.\nIf Stark touched those souls, his life force would be absorbed, so slowly and surely…\n~STEP, STEP~\nHe was approaching Soulayer.\n~STEP, STEP~\nIt was almost as if Soulayer was creating an arena that is convenient to him as it meant Stark couldn't run away.\nAnd to add fuel to this impossible fire Stark couldn't escape…\n\"ETERNAL DARKNESS!\" he yet again spread his bandaged arms wide, and plunged the entire arena in darkness.\nBut the darkness this time was much more eerie, as although Stark couldn't physically see anything… the faces of the souls were still roaming in the dark, and he could see them all staring back at him.\n[Focus…]\nStark closed his eyes.\nUsing his eyes in this space where he could see nothing was useless, so enhancing his other senses was much better.\nNow, what could Stark do, he had no clones (and didn't want to use them to begin with) to distract Soulayer…\nOut of pure habit, he began to draw a circle in his hand, and a crimson line was drawn where he aimed before pointing at the sky.\nHe wanted to use [Heaven's Wrath], as in such a closed arena, it would 100 percent hit Soulayer and kill him before he could do anything.\nBut there was a problem with this plan: the other participants were still watching, and so it would not only force him to use one of his legendary skills, but also another one as he would be forced to also use [Dodge Control] to get out of this situation without being harmed.\n'FUCK…' he wanted to shout, but stopped as it would reveal his location, 'Ah…'\nStark grabbed his forehead, his head hurting from thinking too much, but after only three seconds, he lowered his arm, cancelling [Heaven's Wrath].\nThis wasn't the solution.\nIf even one of the other folks knew of his skills, they would predict what he could do in the trial and betray him more easily than anyone else.\nAnd so his only other choice was to…\n[Predict Soulayer's movement, he isn't invincible…]\nHe couldn't pinpoint where the boss went because [Eternal Darkness] blocked any kind of skill to show where the others were, and it also affected Soulayer as he was also forced to search through the darkness as well…\nBut maybe…\n'Maybe instead of trying to focus on where Soulayer is… I should focus on what he could do in this situation…' Stark's eyes widened as he figured something out, 'Yes! This could work…'\nAnd so he looked ahead of himself, in the position Soulayer was in only a few seconds ago.\n'Figure out where he could be…' Stark repeated.\nThis time, it truly was the final showdown.",

Stark was surprised as even though he had his eyes closed now, he could actually see Soulayer right in front of his body, although that was just a copy from his imagination he wanted to use.\n[Now… think of all the possibilities…]\nAnd suddenly, almost as if he was using Judicator's eyes which allowed him to check out what an opponent could do, the figure of Soulayer suddenly turned into hundreds of after images: they showed Stark the many possibilities the enemy could follow up with.\nThis was only Stark's imagination and not concrete at all, obviously, but this was the best thing he could do in this very situation without risking getting slashed from behind.\n\"Wait a minute... behind...?\"\nAnd so… thanks to the visions of Soulayer's possible actions, Stark reached one simple conclusion…\n'Spatial Inventory,' he grabbed another [Crystal Potion] from it.\nAnd then, without a single second of hesitation, he swiftly and very smoothly threw the potion behind him, not even looking if there was anything there as he was this confident in his conclusion.\n~CRACK, BOOM~\nThrough all his visions, Stark reached the simple conclusion that Soulayer would most likely already be behind him by now.\nAnd it revealed itself to be true as the potion hit Soulayer's greatsword right as he was about to swing at the boy.\n[Soul B has been stunned]\n[A soul cannot be stunned, Soul B is vanishing!]\nThe ghastly green aura around the original greatsword of Soulayer vanished, much like his first friend, and he could do nothing but watch as the human yet again eliminated another one of his friends.\nAnd now… the only soul that remained was the girl, still hiding behind his shoulder, her figure trembling as she knew what would happen if Stark hit her with one of his potions.\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS!\" Stark used that opportunity to also send three spears at the boss.\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWISH~\n\"-25382!\" only one of them hit, but that was more than enough for Stark.\n\"GOROAOROOFHAH~\" Soulayer yet again screamed, this time at least twice as loud as before.\nHis voice seemed to be in pain, but not from all the attacks…\n\"SOUL STRIKE!\" he dashed at Stark from beyond the darkness and swung at him.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\"\n[Perfect Dodge!]\nStark side-stepped to the side as Soulayer's greatsword missed him, then he immediately used his speed to run behind Soulayer and reach for his shoulder.\n\"GROOARRHHH~\" Soulayer tried to hit Stark while he was behind his shoulder, but…\n~SLASH~\n\"-27261!\" all he did was cut his own flesh as he yet again missed the boy.\n'He is weakening…' Stark thought, and it wasn't because he was losing the souls that powered him, more like… he was losing the will to continue fighting.\nSomehow… this boss felt more human than the others.\n[Eliminate him =)]\nAnd yet…\n'SPATIAL INVENTORY!'\nStark didn't seem to care much, solely guided by his aura, and it was absolutely ruthless.\n~FWISH, THROW~\nHe could hear Soulayer's roars and chaotic movements as he slashed in all directions, hoping to get Stark.\nBut this only helped the boy perfectly aim his [Crystal Stun] potion and throw it in the direction of the noise.\n~CRACK, BOOM~\nHe had obviously aimed for the shoulders of the boss… and…\nHe had hit his target.\n[Soul C has been stunned]\n[A soul cannot be stunned, Soul C is vanishing!]\nBut as the soul was slowly vanishing away from existence after being hit by the potion, it suddenly moved from its spot behind the boss's shoulders and placed itself in front of Soulayer, holding his head with its gentle hands.\n\"It is not… your… fault…\" it used its last bit of energy to speak and smile at the boss.\nBeyond his shadow helmet, crimson tears were already there, and Soulayer couldn't do anything but watch as his final friend disappeared.\n~FWISH~\nThe ghastly body went up toward the sky, and when Soulayer looked up, he could see the green spheres of his friends spinning around, saying goodbye to him.\n'…' Soulayer just stood there, falling on his knees.\nHis eyes became more lifeless than they were before, and he dropped his greatsword in the ground, not moving an inch.\nStark couldn't see anything, all he knew was that the noise had disappeared, so he readied himself for Soulayer to attempt everything in his power to kill him.\nAnd after only a few seconds… [Eternal Darkness] as well as [Soul Vortex] were deactivated, meaning that the area was back to normal.\nAnd once Stark opened his eyes back… all he saw was Soulayer's figure facing him, the boss was on his knees, his head looking down at the water, and red drops pouring from his helmet.\n'…?' Stark was confused, maybe that was another trick?\nBut once he moved his eyes slightly, he noticed that not only did Soulayer deactivate his aura, but he also dropped his greatsword on the ground, with no visible intent to pick it back up.\nIt was almost like… he gave up?\n'…' Stark stood there with a neutral expression, he didn't know what to think.\nSoulayer looked… pathetic.\n[Kill him =)]\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Finally, we can see!\"\n\"What happened though?!\"\nThe other participants of the trial, also spectators of Stark's fight, couldn't see inside the [Eternal Darkness] skill's perk, so all they could do was hear the sound of battle from within.\nAnd yet, when the mist disappeared… they saw Soulayer kneeling down, and Stark facing him with a confused expression.\n[Soulayer has received the DOMINATED and HOPELESS status]\n'Well… doesn't seem like he is going to do anything…' Stark sighed before smiling, Soulayer had completely given up, and he enjoyed this victory.\nHe observed Soulayer for a good minute, and the boss didn't move an inch, not even looking at the boy, almost as if he was just waiting for him to finish the job.\n[End. Him.]\nAnd so before Stark could do anything…\nHis body suddenly began to move by itself.\n'Huh?!' of course, he planned to kill Soulayer soon, but he wasn't the one currently controlling his body.\nIt was almost as if… his aura was getting impatient…\n[Don't give him the time to think… =)]\n[Send that little SHIT to his friends, that's what he wants, doesn't he?]\nThe fact he wasn't in control frankly scared Stark, but… deep down, he knew that HE was his aura, meaning that the thing that was controlling him was just another more twisted part of himself.\nAnd so just like that, he reached the boss, only one meter away from him.\n[GOODBYE]\nStark didn't realize it, but he was actually smiling as he focused his aura in his hands and smashed the boss's head with absolutely no hesitation.\n\"-79482!\"\n[Soulayer HP: 0/420000]\n[You have defeated 'Soulayer, The Bearer of Souls'!]",

Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv15; Focus lv10; Aura Smash lv10; Clone Frenzy lv10; Invincible Dodge lv5; Double Assault lv5; Crimson Spears lv1; Heaven's Wrath lv1; Alchemist lv3; Potion Crafting lv3; Target Manipulation lv1; Dodge Control lv1; Crimson Ball Transmission lv1\n…\n'Okay, I know now.'\n[You have upgraded 'Focus' to level 15 (Bronze-Tier Max)!]\n[You have upgraded 'Heaven's Wrath' to level 5!]\n[You have upgraded 'Clone Frenzy' to level 15 (Bronze-Tier Max)!]\nAnd so he was only left with one skill point that he kept in case he needed it later.\nThe reason of his choices was as followed: [Focus] is possibly the best skill he had yet, and although it didn't seem strong in the grand view of things, it was the skill that allowed him to see attacks come and to dodge them, upgrading it to its MAX is just as important as [Domination] itself.\n[Heaven's Wrath] is an extremely powerful skill, and in addition to that the other participants didn't know of it, so having it in a better version of itself could always be good to take huge amounts of enemies, or a giant one, in one beam.\nAs for the last, he hesitated between upgrading it or [Aura Smash] to the max, but then he remembered that the latter, although only being an [Uncommon] skill, was still one of his strongest skills, and so that meant that upgrading it could result in the chance of him not being able to fully utilize the perk as it would be like with the level 10 one, which he couldn't control well until getting used to it.\n'I do wonder if [Aura Smash] is going to rank-up in type as it does seem weird it is only uncommon…' Stark mumbled.\nAs for the other skills he didn't upgrade, he just had a gut feeling that he didn't really need to do that for now, or more like, that the ones he upgraded would save his life in due time.\nBut of course, reaching a threshold for these skills also meant… NEW PERKS!\nAnd powerful ones at that since the skills in themselves were really strong.\n[1:00 minute remains before 'Domination Trial']\n'Oh shit… need to be quick,' Stark hurriedly opened the new panels that appeared before him, and began reading what the new perks he got were.",

Stark knew that he couldn't do anything about it since he would have had to upgrade Heaven's Wrath at one point or another, but in this very situation, it was pretty average, 'Let's hope the last one is better to balance it out.'\nHe turned his gaze toward the third and final panel, then began reading quickly as he only had 25 seconds left before being teleported.\n…\n[Skill: Clone Frenzy lv15]\n[New Perk: The Superior Clone]\n[Description: You can choose to summon your three clones and merge them all together (much like with Aura Smash), thus creating a superior crimson copy that is ALMOST as good as the original]\n[Note: This perk will NOT work if one of the clones is out, you precisely need all three, plus the merging time takes around thirty seconds, and if it is interrupted you won't be able to do it again for thirty minutes…]\n…\n'Huh…' Stark would have loved to test this out before entering the trial, but there was nothing he could do.\n[5 seconds left before 'Domination Trial']\nBut right at that moment…\n[You have beaten 'Soulayer, Bearer of Souls,' alone and without taking damage, granting the SOLO and NO HIT achievements, increasing the rarity and power of the equipment!]\nAnd the moment Stark turned his head toward Soulayer's body… he saw two sparkles around him: meaning that two extremely powerful equipment pieces dropped beside the boss.\n'SHIT…!'\n[2 seconds left before 'Domination Trial']\nStark immediately rushed toward Soulayer's body, not only were such equipment pieces could help him, but there was also the chance that he would be teleported back to the real world once the trial ends, meaning the loss of his precious items if someone else took them…\n'GOT IT-' he jumped, only a few centimeters away from reaching the sparkles.\nBut…\n[Teleporting all participants to the 'Second Domination Trial'!]\n[Good luck!]\n'Sl-Sleepy…' his momentum suddenly stopped while his hand was millimeters away from one of the items.\nAnd then…\n'ZZZzzz…' he fell asleep, the start of the trial forcing him to go to sleep just like the first time.\nBut while he was collapsing, his eyes drowning with dizziness… all Stark could think about was…\n'Let's hope I don't die…'\nSoon enough, he would discover what the trial was about, and also the 9 other people that had watched him fight.\nIt would be big, and possibly the hardest thing he ever did until now, even more terrifying than infiltrating an event with the top 100 strongest classifiers in the country.\n'Well… it all depends on my strength anyway…' he let a quick smile before the back of his head fell onto the water, and so, Stark officially fell asleep.\n[Good luck, participant!]\nStark's consciousness faded.\n***\n'…!' less than a second after falling asleep, Stark opened his eyes again.\nBut much like the first time he had done this for the trial, he was yet again in a giant black void.\n\"Do you think we will win?\"\n\"Heh~ just use my potions and we'll be good!\"\nSuddenly, he heard the familiar voices of his… classes?\n[Domination] and [Alchemist] appeared before him, materializing in front of him like it was nothing, wide smiles on their faces.\n'Am I… in the dream world?' Stark wanted to ask, but his voice didn't come out.\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nThe two Stark stopped smiling, their expressions turning almost sad as they shook their heads.\n\"I guess…\" Domination shrugged.\n\"Let's just go along with it…\" Alchemist sighed.\nAnd so right as the two spoke… another panel appeared in front of Stark.\n[Stark Heartsouls; Code Name: \"The Chosen\"]\n'Oh… then that means I'm in the space between reality and the trial…' Stark sighed as well.\nThere was a strange feeling deep inside of him, one he couldn't shake off, and it seemed the two other him could also feel it.\nWas it stress? Fear of death?\nIt didn't matter for now, as all that would happen later would completely depend on him.\n'But then… why are they here, they weren't here the first time,' he looked at the figures resembling his own, they were around ten minutes away from him.\n\"Good luck…\"\n\"Don't die on us!\"\nAnd so just like that, they faded away, leaving Stark alone in the darkness, alone to face whatever would happen.\nHe didn't admit it, but their presence appeased him.\nA few seconds later… another panel appeared.\n[Domination Trial: The Lucullus Prison]\n[Difficulty: DEATH]\n'Huh…?' Stark's eyes widened, and his pupils began to shake, 'D-Death…?'\nHe couldn't comprehend the words before him, yet they were as real as could be.\nThe first trial he participated in was from the [Death] difficulty, which was the hardest of the five.\nNobody had ever completed a trial with the [Death] difficulty before, he had been the first since the appearance of this class.\nAnd now… he would need to do the same thing with his second one too? Alongside nine other people who he could not trust?\nHe needed to fight in a trial much harder than the first, with the [Death] difficulty…?\nThis was… the worst possible outcome.\n'Is this world fucking with me,' he gritted his teeth, his eyes burning with crimson aura.\nAnd so just like that, his consciousness faded away again as he received the information all the others did as well.\n[Good luck, Chosen]",

Death difficulty, this has to be a joke, I heard no one has ever completed one of those…\"\nHe heard the footsteps of people leaving their cells while talking.\nThe white-haired woman directly in front of him just stayed in the corner though, putting her foot against the wall, not leaving.\n'Quit trying to look cool…' Stark rolled his eyes as he also left his cell.\nPeople would come looking for him during the ten minutes of free time as he currently was the center of the attention, meaning the most popular one of them all as they had effectively witnessed him fighting less than half an hour ago.\n'…' Stark left his cell, and found himself in a semi-large hallway, all it contained was the 10 cells that participants were held in, and at the end of it was a giant metal door, a timer was displayed above it.\n[9:28… 9:27…]\nIn the hallway were already six of the other participants, excluding Stark, meaning that only three had decided not to interact with the rest.\nIt was either they were confident in their abilities to survive, or just didn't trust any of the others.\nTo Stark, they were the smartest, and those with the highest chance of survival.\n\"You have a problem, my guy?\"\n\"I think you don't realize who you're talking too…\"\nBut there already seemed to be some kind of beef as two men were currently facing each other, one of them had an enraged expression, under the watchful and interested gazes of the other four.\n'It's been thirty seconds… literally how…?' Stark was confused, these people were much more aggressive than his allies back at the first trial.\n\"HAH~ WELL, WE DON'T NEED YOU ANY MORE IT SEEMS!\" one of the men, the one that seemed angry, a buff-looking one with silver ring piercings activated his [Domination] aura, summoning claws that came out of his hands.\n\"CLAW ANNIHILATION!\" he jumped toward the first guy.\nBut…\n\"Futile…\" the other guy also activated his [Domination] skill, and a silver blade appeared in his hands, \"See you in hell…\"\n\"MOON CUT!\" he deflected the claws of the first man easily and then…\n~SLASH~\n\"-78531!\" he cut the man in half.\n'…' Stark observed all of this with a neutral reaction, it happened so fast, and it hadn't even been two minutes since the cells opened.\n[One participant has died, 9 remain!]\nThis trial was already getting bad, maybe there would be no survivors by the end of it if this continued…\n'…' Stark kept smiling for some reason.",

I'M 32!\" the kid… no… the lady replied, she didn't budge when seeing someone die, but THIS was what embarrassed her.\n[7:32… 7:31…], meanwhile, the timer above the giant metal door was still going down.\nThey seemed to get along… well… partially, for now they were just building meaningless connections that would crumble the moment any kind of danger came in.\n\"I hope you all understood the rules, it means that no matter what, we can all get out if we somehow manage to get all the keys and reach level 0!\" a blue-haired man with a gun in both his hands pointed at the metal door, he was wearing a police officer uniform.\nThese were the five (alive) people that were in the hallway, chatting with each other while waiting for the door to open.\n\"Maybe we should introduce ourselves to make it easier for later, shall we not…\" the man with the green robe proposed, his expression staying still, his clothes and long back hair made him look like a sect leader, and he even did the iconic pose with joining the sleeves of his robe together to hide his hands.\n\"Sure thing…\" the man that had murdered someone less than two minutes ago smiled, \"But let's not forget our friend there,\" he pointed at Stark, \"Why don't you join us?\"\nFrankly, Stark had a really bad feeling about all of this, and he didn't trust these people one bit, neither did any of them trust one another to be honest, but they were just acting… acting as if they would fight together.\nBeyond those faces, Stark could see their true intentions, and all he could as he noticed that was smile.\nWhen the rest of the crowd turned their heads toward the location the white haired man pointed, all of their eyes widened.\n\"Oh… that's him…\" the police officer tightened the grip around his guns.\n\"Huh…\" the tanned man scratched his head.\n\"Haha~ I knew he would be there, but seeing the real thing is better!\" the loli laughed.\n'…' Stark didn't walk toward them, \"We can speak, but I would rather keep a fair distance from you bunch until the door opens, who knows what crazy bastard would attempt to kill again…\" he spoke while precisely looking at the man holding the silver blade.\n\"Oi~ I wouldn't do that, I just had to get rid of the bad weed from the bunch, that is all!\"\n\"The name's Chosen…\" Stark just spoke before looking down at the ground, after all, introducing yourself only meant telling your name.\n\"Akira,\" the murderer smiled, Stark had no idea if it was his real name or his code one, but it didn't matter.\n\"Lolia,\" the small girl spoke right after.\n\"Then my name is Bang,\" the tanned man shrugged.\n\"And mine is Leader…\" the one with long hair added.\n\"Officer is the name, I guess it does make sense though haha…\" the police officer scratched his cheek.\nThis was all with introductions, and Stark quickly glanced at the folks he would be fighting with.\nA calm murderer in a suit, a loli in a school uniform, a police officer with guns, a sect leader, and a tanned guy with seemingly no morals.\nThis was a weird group, and he didn't even know of the other three that were still in their cells.\n[4:56… 4:55…]\n\"Soooo… how does it feel to fight a boss, then immediately get transferred to this shithole…\" Akira smiled, his eyes analyzing all of Stark's movements.\nBy a simple glance, Stark could tell he was the most dangerous one of the bunch, alongside the sect leader that didn't change his expression even once.\n\"Nothing much, just trying to live,\" Stark replied with a neutral expression, not even looking at the man.\n\"It is surprising… a [Death] level second domination trial is insane, and I have heard no one has ever completed one of these…\" Bang spoke.\n\"My first trial was from the [Godless] difficulty, so not that far behind,\" Akira informed them, godless was the fourth of the five categories.\n\"Heh~ mine was from the [Doom] category!\" Lolia smiled, almost proud of herself for surviving.\n\"Me too,\" Officer nodded.\nThe sect leader didn't speak, not wanting to give info, he had only spoken twice so far, and only to redirect the conversation to something else.\nThey couldn't do much but wait for the doors to open, so all they did was engage in meaningless discussions, although all keeping their distance and also making sure to not reveal anything.\nStark was already at a disadvantage since they had seen how he fought, but it was fine for now.\n[1:02… 1:01… 1:00]\nBut when the one minute mark was reached…\nA panel appeared before all the participants.\nA panel that would crush any hope they had in fighting alongside one another safely to reach the surface.\nA panel that rendered everything they did so far meaningless.\n[Introducing the 'Kill Bonus' perk… =)]\nIt appeared before all of them, and so all they could so was read as information was everything in this place, almost as important as strength.\n'What the hell is that thing…' Stark's eyes widened as he read about that perk, it was beyond anything he could think of.\nIt was truly… twisted and cruel…\nAnd it basically… as stated in the name… forced them to kill one another to receive advantages.\n'Haha~ knew I couldn't trust anybody…' Stark's smile grew wider as he noticed the atmosphere of the hallway suddenly go from joyful to depressing in a single second.\nWell… it was a [Death] difficulty trial after all, so what did they expect?\nOnly Stark knew how bad this could get.",

His aura was burning even brighter, as if fueled by the fear of the enemy.\n['Sublevel 4 Guard B' has received the 'Dominated' status!]\nAnd that small amount of hesitation…\n~FWISH~\nIt allowed Stark to spin in midair and avoid the fist by going above it, he placed his foot on the arm, it wasn't big enough to accommodate him, but he just used it as a platform.\nAnd then…\n~KICK, BOOM~\nStark jumped toward the guard's head and drop-kicked it in the face.\n\"-93271!\"\nThe impact was so strong that the guard's face became even uglier, and it was sent flying toward one of the obsidian walls, crashing against it and falling back on the ground.\nMeanwhile…\n\"AURA SMASH!\" Stark's clone summoned six crimson fists, as well as 6 spears, and threw them all at the guard they were fighting.\nNeedless to say that it didn't survive, as even when using its cleaver as a shield, upon reaching the fifth fist, its stamina was already depleted and it was unable to continue holding on against the crimson power.\nAnd so that meant that one fist and 6 spears reached its body as it couldn't defend itself anymore (in addition to the damage from the fist that was also significant).\n\"-35039! -26361! -27381!\" and much more, so it immediately fell to the floor.\nAnd so they were left with two guards to deal with.\nThe two were taken aback, and even took a few step backs once the third monster died.\nBut… it was in their instincts as monster and prison guards to keep going.\nWould you call it foolishness? Or was it just that they needed to do their job at all costs?\nWell… it didn't really matter.\n'Hey, clone,' Stark thought, and the two clones looked at him, 'One of you end this quickly,' he smiled.\nAnd immediately…\n\"DOUBLE ASSAULT,\" Stark didn't even bother to use the skill himself, instead he summoned back the clone that wasn't doing anything, and sat on the ground as he enjoyed the view of his clone doing the work.\nTo be honest, these clones actually seemed to enjoy fighting more than staying inside of him, so it was good.\n~DASH, DASH~\n\"CLEAVER SLASH!\" one of the guards swung at the clone.\nBut…\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" it dodged at the final moment.\nBut wait, if it that, then doesn't that mean…\n[Perfect Dodge!]\n'HOLY SHIT,' the world around Stark and his clone turned gray as everything moved slowly.\nThe interesting thing though was that the original Stark wasn't affected by the slow mode, meaning that if his clone avoided an attack perfectly, then he would also get additional seconds to think even without doing a [Perfect Dodge].\nThis was precious information he would make sure to remember.\n~BAM, FWISH~\nUsing the additional seconds to think, the clone dodged the cleaver and… smashed the guard's hand using his crimson aura.\n\"KRAKRKKEA~\" it screamed in pain as its arm reduced to pulp, at least more than it already was, forcing it to drop its cleaver.\n\"MAD RUSH!\" its eyes glew in a crimson light as its speed increased and it began to attack the clone with both its hands (even the destroyed one), as well as its legs by trying to kick it.\nBut none of the attacks hit, and in less than a second, as the clone didn't waste time since 'Double Assault' only lasted 10 seconds, it was already behind the guard.\n~SPIN, CRACK~\nIt cracked the monster's neck, killing it instantly.\n\"-158372!\"\n'Wait a damn minute, did a clone just make more damage than I ever did?' Stark mumbled with a neutral expression, it was a hit for his pride, 'Oh well, but he just shrugged in the end.'\n\"KRAAKRK!!!\" the final guard was panicking after seeing its fourth companion die, and so it swung its cleaver in all directions in hopes of grazing and killing the clone.\nBut of course, it was mere useless hope that would never amount to anything.\n~CRACK~\nThe clone appeared behind the guard again, and although it was anti-climatic, it just cracked its neck again.\n\"-156245!\"\nIt wasn't as cool as defeating it with a punch, but it was much easier and also more efficient.\n'Good job,' Stark got up from the cold destroyed ground and summoned his clone back after congratulating it for its victory.\nAnd so with that, he got rid of five enemies, meaning he could keep going through this giant maze, hopefully not meeting the other participants as he didn't feel like fighting if they were aggressive.\nMaybe some had already teamed up? He didn't know, but the fact no one had died after twenty minutes was a good sign.\nOr that is what he hoped…\nStark didn't know the massacre had only started.",

Once someone does open the door then it will be announced, although nothing will be said if someone does find the key, making it possible to hide it for as long as you want =)]\n[Oh, and I feel pretty bad for you, so here is a… MEGA DEAL!]\n'The fuck…?'\n[If you kill one of the participants, then… not only will you get your map back, but you'll be allowed to spin the reward wheel TWICE, just to make up for the punishment!]\nAnd immediately, the panel disappeared, and no new one appeared.\nIt almost felt like the thing that was talking REALLY wanted to make them kill each other.\n'Getting my map back and two rewards doesn't sound so bad though…' even Stark actually had the thought of killing as it could definitely increase his odds of survival.\nBut no… he suddenly realized something: it wouldn't be possible he was the only one that got such a juicy deal, it was possible all the others got such a panel as well…\nIt was a killing game after all, but who knows.\n'Oh well… doesn't really matter if I can't meet anybody,' Stark shrugged, he quickly put the thought aside as killing wasn't in his plans for now.\nThen he began to walk through the halls of the sublevel 4 again, all of them mostly looked the same except for some different furniture and rooms: there were other cells beside the ones they had been in, as well as some rooms with chairs and tables in them.\nHe even found a cafeteria at some point, but he didn't feel the need to visit it.\nBut after only another ten minutes of walking around…\n[A participant has been slain by a player!]\n'…' Stark looked at the panel for two seconds before closing it, he didn't care much.\nThe fact that all the people that had died until now were all killed by other humans said a lot about this trial: not a single monster kill yet, although this was supposed to be the easiest level.\nAnd the fact the murderer was anonymous was even more sadistic as they could definitely get away with it, hiding their reward to use it whenever the situation became bad for them.\nBasically… Stark would need to suspect everyone, trying to fight as a team like in the last trial was not an option before, but now it was truly confirmed.\n'…'\nAnother fifteen minutes passed, fifteen minutes where nothing much happened, everyone else seemed to be exploring and killing monsters, looking for the key.\nNone of them had known it at the time, but the [Key Location Map] and [Instant Use Key] were much more powerful rewards than they seemed after realizing just how big each level was.\nBut at this very moment… where Stark really believed there was no way he would find his way…\nIT activated.\n[Talent: Chosen One, activated!]\n'…?'\nAnd when he turned another corner… he found himself in front of the door of a room, although this one was different from the others as the door looked much more damaged and was made out of wood instead of usual metal or other strong materials.\nHe was in a dead end, and this room was the only thing at the end of the hallway.\n'Yeahhh okay…' there was no way this room wasn't important, especially after [Chosen One] activated, and so he immediately began to head toward it.\nStark kept walking toward the wooden door, sensing an ominous aura coming out of it.\nHis talent had definitely activated for a reason, but did it really twist reality again to make this door appear in front of him, or was it always there, and it was [Chosen One] that somehow guided him to it...?\nIn the end it didn't matter, because if his talent was on the 'helping' side this time, then it meant... there was a chance this could be the location of the key, if somebody hadn't already taken it that is.\n'Here goes nothing...' he sighed as he reached for the wooden handle of the closed door.\nBut right as that happened, and he began to pull it down...\n~BOOM, SLAM, CRASH~\nThe wall behind the door exploded, sending debris all over the hall and Stark.\n'WHAT?' Stark was too close to the door and wall, so the force of the impact sent him flying in the opposite direction, crashing onto the wall in front of the door.\n\"-3471!\" he had activated his [Domination Shield] to take the damage, so he received nothing, but it was still weird.\nWas it a trap?\nNo... his talent wouldn't do this for no reason.\n\"KRAAKRR~\" beyond the smoke screen that had formed because of the destroyed all, and all the falling debris, Stark heard a familiar noise.\nIt was the same sound those [Sublevel 4 Guards] were making.\n'More of those... then maybe the talent wanted me to level up, heh~'\nBut he was wrong.\n~THUMP, THUMP~\nThe steps that thing was making were much more powerful than the other guards, and its aura was more overwhelming too, exuding an invisible force that even Stark was cautious of.\n'...'\n~THUMP, THUMP~\nAnd once it got out of the dust screen... Stark was finally able to identify what it was.\n'Holy shit...!' his eyes widened, this was definitely not a simple guard.\n[Sublevel 4 ELITE Guard]\n[The most powerful monster of this floor!]\n'I get it now...' of course, this wasn't confirmed, but most of the time, doesn't the strongest monster mean the best drops?\nAnd what better drop was there than... THE KEY TO THE NEXT FLOOR!\nThe guard, much more powerful, stronger, and even 1.5x times the size of a normal guard, took another step toward Stark, its eyes full of fury as a prisoner had escaped.\n'Alright, if it's here it means that nobody was able to reach this spot even with their maps, looks like that talent of mine can both be useful and annoying…' Stark smiled as he positioned himself, the giant ELITE slowly approaching him.\n[FIGHT!]",

Stark avoided by crouching.\n\"SWORD CUT, SWORD CUT, SWORD CUT!!!\" instead of being like the average guard or monster and attacking randomly in the hopes of hitting, the elite guard actually looked like it knew what it was doing, precisely aiming for Stark while keeping its balance enough to be able to strike again.\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWISH~\nStark was forced to keep dodging as a single strike would be game over.\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS!\" he summoned his three spears and sent them at the guard.\nBut…\n~KING, KING, KING~\nThe guard just blocked all three with his sword, taking 0 damage as it was way sturdier than the cleaver the others had.\n\"SPATIAL INVENTORY,\" while he was blocking Stark's attacks, the boy opened his inventory void and took out four [Crystal Stun] potions.\n~THROW, THROW…~\nHe threw them all toward the elite's body while it was occupied, and all potions hit it, exploding upon impact and releasing the white mist.\nBut…\n['Status Immunity' makes 'Elite Guard' immune to status effects!]\nMeaning that the [Stun] wouldn't work on it, even from his crimson fists.\nAnd so right at that moment, when Stark was thinking of what he should be doing…\n~THUMP, THUMP~\nStark lifted his gaze and saw the giant rush at him.\n\"BODY SLAM!\" then it jumped in the air, preparing to land on top of him with its full weight.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" he couldn't avoid this attack to begin with since the monster was almost as big as the hallway, and even damaged the ceiling in the process of jumping, plus the impact would surely send him flying, so this was his only option.\n[Perfect Dodge]\nStark looked at the corner of the hallway, his gaze shaking as he wondered when the hell would 'THAT' finish, he really needed it.\n\"MAD RUSH,\" not letting him get a single second of rest, the elite guard got up unharmed and rushed toward Stark, placing its shoulder in front of its body like a rugby player wanting to tackle down somebody.\n~FWISH~\nStark slid down and somehow managed to avoid the attack by passing between the guard's legs.\n~BOOOOM~\nIt crashed against the obsidian wall in front of it as it couldn't stop in its rush.\n~SHATTER~\nThe wall was completely destroyed as the guard passed right through it, revealing another hallway behind.\n\"-12813!\" it received some damage, but quickly got up and grabbed its morning star back.\nThis fight was getting really bad, and Stark had no idea how to beat this thing for now…\n'Think, Stark, think…!' Stark faced the giant monster as it removed the debris from its armor and got up again.\n\"KRAKKR~\" and the guard was also getting angrier for no apparent reason, I mean, it was the one that decided to crash onto the wall?!\nSoon enough… they would be able to use 'THAT' perk for the first time…",

      "content": "It seems like the goal of the [Mad Rush] attack just now was simply to retrieve its weapon, so killing Stark was just a bonus to it.\nIts silver armor was unscathed, and Stark could see that a giant hole had formed on the wall the guard hit, meaning that he could see another hallway from there.\n'Need to do this quickly... if someone sees or hear the noises they could steal the key...'\nBut wait... wouldn't that mean a chance to kill and retrieve his map, as well as two rewards...?\n'Hm...' Stark actually hesitated, but in the end it didn't matter as long as nobody showed up.\n~THUMP~\nThe guard took another massive step, making Stark's body jump slightly because of the sheer force.\nAnd then... it turned its pupils toward the spot the clones were supposed to be at.\n\"Krakr...?\" for the first time it sounded confused, and its pupils widened, the aura around them faltering slightly.\n\"AURA SMASH... MERGE!\" taking advantage of that small opportunity and time frame, Stark focused his aura on his right hand and began to summon the giant crimson fist.\nThe [Elite Guard] kept looking at 'THAT' thing for a few more seconds, almost if shocked.\n\"Krakkark?,\" which roughly translated to, \"What that is?\" was what it said at that moment.\nAnd then, if sensing something was wrong, it immediately began rushing toward it, knowing that it couldn't allow such a thing to transform.\n\"Not today, asshole, only five more seconds after all...!\" Stark wouldn't let all his efforts go to waste, so he quickly finished charging up the [Aura Smash] and sent it toward the guard when it was only a few meters from reaching the clones.\n~BOOOOM~\nIt could obviously dodge or at least deflect it under normal circumstances using its massive weapons or the [Chrono Dodge] skill, which Stark hadn't seen yet.\nBut... it's panicked state and rush in stopping the clones made it ignore its surroundings, resulting in the giant fist, much bigger than its head, hitting it straight on the chest sideways.\n~FWISH, CRASH~\nIt was sent flying toward the wall right beside it, crashing into it and almost destroying it because of the sheer impact of the crimson aura.\n\"-58171!\" the damage was still relatively low as to how much it would have dealt normally, but it was fine as it had stopped the guard from interrupting the clones' transformation.\nAnd then, at that moment...\n~FWISHHHHH, BWING!~\nA giant light emerged from the corner of the hall from Stark's perspective, while the guard was just watching it with widened eyes.\nAnd...\n['The Superior Clone' was successfully summoned!]\n[Description: You can choose to summon your three clones and merge them all together (much like with Aura Smash), thus creating a superior crimson copy that is ALMOST as good as the original]\nThis was the perk he had been wanting to use, although it took around thirty seconds for them to merge, which wouldn't seem like a lot normally, but just in this battle, it almost felt like minutes because of the speed of the attacks.\n'Come...' Stark called out for his clone, and with speed to fast it was invisible to the naked eye, it placed itself in front of the boy so that he can observe it.\nEven the [Elite Guard] was confused because of the speed, taking a few seconds to turn its head to the spot it was on and immediately getting up, knowing it needed to get rid of them both fast.\n'...'\nThe [Superior Clone] resembled the usual clones, except the aura that made its body was much darker in color, and it flowed faster and stronger than before.\nJust by viewing it, Stark knew that thing was the real deal as its entire body was surrounded by powerful crimson aura.\n'...' it just stood there, a big smile on its face as it awaited Stark's orders.\n\"Can I control you?\" this was Stark's first question.\nHe had usually been able to control a clone by concentrating his aura in his eyes and sending it to the clones, but maybe that was because they are pretty much.\nBut what about the [Superior Clone]? Would he be able to control it? If so, how well?\nThis could definitely be big, as taking control of such a thing while staying back would be overpowered.\n'...' the clone put its crimson hand against its chin and acted as if it was thinking, then... it just shrugged.\n[Maybe yes, maybe no]\nThis was its answer, meaning Stark would need to try it himself.\nBut for now...\n\"KRAAKKAKRKAKAK~\" the elite guard roared so hard that the ceiling was shaking, and small debris kept falling all over.\nThen... it dashed toward Stark and his clone, carrying both it's bloodied sword and the morning star.\n\"MORNING STAR'S DARKNESS!\" it used one of its [Advanced] skills while rushing at them both, and suddenly...\n~FWISH~\nAs if it was sucking up the darkness of the elite's eyes, the morning star grew in size, at least thrice as big as originally, now it was even bigger than the arm of the elite and five times as big as Stark' body.\nIts silver spikes were also replaced by completely dark ones, emitting a very dark aura.\n\"K...KRKAKRA~!\" even the guard seemed to struggle carrying it, so it just launched its sword at the two Stark.\n~BOOOM~\nThe impact of the weapon exploded the floor, but the two easily avoided it as this attack was mostly just to get rid of the weapon.\n\"KRAAKKRKS~\" the guard tried to carry the morning star, but actually grazed its own arm in the process.\n\"27291!\" that weapon's damage was way too high, and now that it was bigger, faster and stronger, it would be more difficult to avoid it.\n\"Aura Smash... MERGE!\"\n\"...?\" Stark was confused as he wasn't the one that used this skill but... his clone?\nHe hadn't ordered it to, it was doing it on its own for some reason, and the smile on its face showed that it was confident in its abilities.\nFrankly, Stark would expect that thing to explode in its face, but who knows, maybe it got strong to be able to master it...?\nAfter managing to put the giant handle of the dark morning star between both its hands, the elite guard smirked behind its helmet.\nIt was carrying it like a baseball bat, but oh well...\nAnd then...\n\"CRITICAL HIT SPIN!\" it used another one of its [Advanced Skills], this one not stronger than [Morning Star's Darkness], yet when paired together... they became deadly.\nAnd so, Stark and his [Superior Clone] got ready to deal with that guard.",

Defense? None of this matters when your very body was getting disintegrated by a giant beam that could take out anything within it.\nAnd so after a few seconds… the beam stopped.\nThe ceiling and floor within the circle radius of the beam completely disappeared.\nAnd as for the [Sublevel 4 ELITE Guard]… it was nowhere to be seen.\nLike literally, in its place were only a massive pile of ashes, and the morning star had also completely disappeared.\n'…'\n[You have slain 'Sublevel 4 ELITE Guard lv100', gained 2,183,449EXP!]\nIt truly was dead… just like that.\nIt almost felt weird for Stark, he was so used to enemies always managing to use up every last one of their skills before being defeated, yet the guard didn't even get to use some of its skills like [Chrono Dodge], [Guard Sacrifice] or even its ultimate skill [The Fourth Elite].\n'Well… I guess it's better this way,' he shrugged.\nBut this also instinctively made Stark turn his head toward the [Superior Clone], its expression was cold and malicious, the grin on its face growing more as it saw the ashes of the guard.\n'…' Stark didn't know what to think of this, but the clone had pretty much taken out the elite by itself.\nShould he be concerned or happy that such a perk had been gifted to him? He didn't know…\n'Okay, what now…'\nAnd right at that moment… many panels appeared around him as he was surrounded by the golden glow thrice.\n[Your level has increased to level 44, granting you two skill points and boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 45, granting you two skill points and boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 46, granting you two skill points and boost in stats]\n[Experience: 20599/1000000], he had finally reached the stage where he needed 1M experience every time to level up.\nBut in the end, even if his clone did the damage, he still got all the experience as it also meant the clone grew stronger alongside him.\nAnd so at that moment, Stark began to read the panels as they should be able to help him…\nBut of course, the first he observed was…\n[Level 45 Reached: please pick a card]",

Stark immediately understood, and if it worked, then it was insane.\nThe cards didn't turn once the clone went behind them, but did it truly mean he could read them…?\nCards can only be read by the very person who they are given to, which is why asking other people to read your cards isn't an option to begin with: there was no way to cheat the system.\nBut… what about a semi-sentient clone made out of the user's aura, then could it maybe… just maybe…?\nSuddenly, the [Superior Clone]'s smile grew bigger.\nAnd then… it pointed to the card to the right.\n\"Can you see the read about the skills?\"\n'…' the clone shook its head, seemingly it couldn't know the name or the description of the skills, which was a bummer.\nBut then, why would it pick this card in particular.\n'…Oh!' Stark's eyes widened, \"Is it because of the images?\"\n\"…\" the clone nodded.\nOf course, he had no current way to know the skill he would pick, but the cards always had some sort of drawing related to them at the front, so this was the only thing that could help outside of the panels.\nBasically… the clone picked the drawing that looked to be related to the most powerful skill out of the bunch.\nOf course, such a logic was flawed, as there was the possibility of a boring drawing being related to the most powerful skill, but this was already a good enough indicator.\n\"Can you tell me the drawings?\" he asked, this could also help as he would be judging too.\nBut…\n\"…\" the clone shook its head.\n'Sigh…' Stark reached for the card the clone pointed at and picked it up, making the other two disappear.\nAnd when he turned it to see what the drawing was…\nHe saw the picture of two crimson chains intertwining one another.\n\"…\"\nHe looked back to his clone, and it was giving him two thumbs up.\n…\n[Skill: Domi-Chains Restrain]\n[Type: Legendary]\n[Description: A skill that allows the user to create a powerful, crimson chain that can bind enemies in a restrictive grip, making it impossible for them to move or use their abilities freely. The longer they remain bound, the stronger the chains become. With enough restraint, the enemy will lose consciousness, allowing the user to freely engage in battle with other foes in the area.]\n[Note: The chain has 10000HP, but as long as it is not broken, it will continue to slowly bind itself around the enemy like a moving snake, oh, and you also get one chain for now, plus twenty minutes between each use]\n…\n'…!' Another legendary skill was granted to him, and this one also seemed interesting.\nOf course, descriptions give an overall idea to how the skill works, but it was always better to try it out for yourself before attempting to use it in battle, which was why Stark loved the [Memories Museum] so much.\nAfter reading the description a few times over, Stark closed down his new skill's panel and looked at the one next to it.\n[You will be able to spin the 'Class Wheel' in 4 levels!]\nOf course, this was logical, although Stark did wonder what other class could he possibly get, and how would he align its usage with [Domination] and [Alchemist].\nOf course, getting a new class was always good, but… what if it was totally useless?\nFor example, getting [Warrior] seemed utterly useless in his case since he only used his fists with his domination aura, so other than some skills that could help, then he probably had absolutely no use to it?\n'…I'll think about it later,' he mumbled as he moved to the third and final panel.\nAnd…\n[You have eliminated 'sublevel 4 ELITE Guard', and…]\n'And…!?'\n[He had the key to the next floor! Good job!]\nSuddenly, the key materialized out of the thin air into his right hand.\n'NICE… VERY NICE…!!!' Stark's widened as he opened his palm and saw a bronze-key with a very small 'sublevel 3' note attached to it.\n'Spatial Inventory,' he wasn't going to play any risky games and instantly put the key inside of his inventory void, no way in hell he would allow anyone to steal it as it would be a battle to the death.\nAnd now… everyone was stuck on this floor until Stark eventually finds the exit =).\nPlus, if he ever died, the key would stay inside the inventory, not leaving it, meaning that the others would be stuck inside and die of starvation.\nWell, if they don't just straight up kill one another that is, and even then it wasn't sure they would get the perks related to keys.\nBasically… he had the perfect excuse to stay alive in front of the others as long as he got a key.\n'Very good…'\n\"…\" the [Superior Clone]'s smile grew very wide, stretching from one corner of his face to the other, and it was becoming uncanny at this point, it seemed to like Stark's idea: if he dies, everyone else is fucked.\nStark realized it somewhat, but [Superior Clone] seemed… how to say… evil?\nHe was more malicious and ill intentioned than Stark himself, was it because of his domination aura or something?\n'Doesn't matter as long as it listens…' he jumped the destroyed obsidian wall the elite guard had made and ended up in another hallway, then the clone followed closely.\nHe tried to summon back the clone to himself, obviously, but…\n[If you bring the 'Superior Clone' back to you, then the transformation will be cancelled, and you will have to wait for all three clones to regenerate, meaning 1h30!]\n'Yeahhh I'm not waiting that long for something that isn't even sure to happen since the transformation does take a while to take place…' in the end, he just decided to keep it close to him.\nAnd so like that, now that they had the key to the next floor in hand, the two Stark continued walking through the maze of the prison's fourth sublevel floor.\nOf course, all the others weren't doing nothing either, as they were all slowly leveling up and looking for the key as well: the map showed the exit, so all they needed was the key for it.\n'None of you are escaping until I get out… =)' Stark smiled as he turned around another corner.\n\"=)\" the clone smiled too, nothing but bad intentions on its expression: nothing mattered to it except for the safety of the original Stark.",

If it's not Chosen…!\" Officer laughed, his guns still in hand.\nThe people present were: Officer, the white-haired lady Stark saw as she was in front of his cell, and… the two others he hadn't seen.\nStark stopped in his tracks, wanting to speak to them over some distance to make sure this wasn't a trap, and his clone obviously stopped behind, not revealing itself to the public as it was at the corner of the hallway.\n\"Oh!\" Officer nodded, \"I guess you didn't get to know them since they stayed in their cells then immediately ran through the metal door…\"\n\"I guess…\" Stark shrugged, he didn't care much.\n\"HEY!\" a man with dark gray eyes that had a white star-shaped detail in the irises, and scraggly hair with a mixture of two colors: pale reddish pink and apple green, suddenly got up and shouted, taking Stark aback, \"NAME'S YURI!\"\nHe was wearing a dark teal blazer with gold buttons over a long-sleeved white dress shirt and a gold and black striped tie.\n\"…?\" Stark had frankly expected those to have stayed inside their cells to be of the mysterious type or at least be super cautious of everything, yet… this guy seemed extremely extroverted.\nStark's gaze then moved on to the person next to him, it was a woman with yellow eyes and short, unkempt taupe brown hair with two long ear-like hair locks that stick up on both sides of her head.\nShe was wearing a pair of round, metal-rimmed red eyeglasses, and a had a device resembling a tablet between her hands.\nShe was wearing a maroon sweater and a long pair of black jeans.\nAfter realizing it was her turn to introduce herself, she taped a few letters on the tablet and…\n\"Kokoro!\" a blue panel emanated from the tablet like a hologram, showing whatever she wrote.\n\"Oh yeah, Kokoro doesn't talk much she told us, so don't even bother, I tried haha…\" Officer nervously joked.\n\"And her?\" the white-haired girl didn't even give him a single glance.\n\"Oh, she didn't tell us her name either, so yeah…\" Officer shrugged.\nShe was sitting against the wall, wearing an elegant long black dress with a semi-long skirt that reached her tights.\nThese were all the people present here.\n[7 participants remain!]\nAkira, the guy who killed two people, probably was still alive, and he couldn't see the sect leader dying so fast after being so calm all this time, meaning that the person that had died was probably… Lolia.\n\"What are you doing here?\" he asked the group.\n\"Just taking a break as we've been searching for that key for a very long time!\" Yuri shouted again in response.\n\"Hm~\" Stark finally felt comfortable taking a step forward as he wanted to open the next floor already.\nBut the moment he did that, the clone followed closely after him.\nAnd so when the clone showed itself to the others, its powerful and overwhelming aura could be sensed by all the people in the hall: they saw it as clear killing intent.\n~FWISH, BOOOM~\nAll of them activated their auras, even the white-haired woman, and although she didn't move from her spot, she finally looked in Stark's direction, which could be seen as her acknowledging the threat.\n'…' the clone's smile grew wider as it saw the participants activate their auras and summon their weapons the moment they saw it.\n'What the hell is happening…' Stark sighed, would he really have to fight these people because his clone was just… twisted?",

      "content": "The stairway was dimly lit, the only source of light being the faint glow of their auras as they ascended higher and higher.\nStark was the first who went, so he was technically leading the group, with the rest of them following closely behind.\nStark's clone was climbing the stairs backward, keeping its aura eyes on the group and making sure that a fair distance was kept, and if something ever happened, it wouldn't hesitate to all its arsenal of skills to at least take down two of them with it.\nAs they climbed, the atmosphere grew heavier with each step, the weight of their experiences in the trial pressing down on them.\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity of climbing, they reached yet another bronze door that looked very similar to the one he had opened before.\nStark approached the door cautiously, there was no handle or key slot this time, so he just pressed his palm on it, and then…\n~FWISH, DING~\n[Chosen has reached the third sublevel first, granting reward…]\n'…' all the others peeked and saw the panel appear above the door, their eyes widening.\n'Seems like that trial really wants us to kill each other, haha…' if the first person to touch the door would be rewarded, then it meant people would fight to the death to reach it first.\nThis time though, no one did anything, they all just stared at Stark as the panel closed, and the door began to slowly open, revealing the third sublevel.\n[Sublevel 3: The Dungeon of Fear]\nThe room beyond the bronze door was vast and shrouded in darkness, save for a few flickering torches that lined the walls.\n'Does every floor have a different atmosphere and aesthetic?' Stark wondered as he stepped foot inside the floor.\n[Once you enter a floor, you aren't allowed to go back!]\n'Of course…' Stark didn't even bother to look behind him, instead opting to check out his surroundings.\nHe found himself in a dungeon-like environment, with damp stone walls and floors with patterns, and in the distance, he could hear cold metal chains rattling against the stone.\nIt truly felt like they were in a prison dungeon: occasional torches as sole source of light in the darkness, footsteps and weird noises in the distance, cells with sturdy silver bars, basically… this floor was much more oppressing than the previous.\n[Introducing a new perk once everyone enters this floor :D]\n'Not like I'm gonna sit around and wait for the others to find out,' Stark gestured for his clone to follow him, and it nodded as they both turned around another corner while the others just entered the floor.\n'…' no more talking now, and each and every one of them headed toward a different path, making sure to split as to not allow anyone to try and betray someone else.\nThey were all very cautious of their surroundings, so normal surprise attacks probably won't work.\n~PLOP, CLING~\nThe ambient sound of water drops and of the chains was still present, but it didn't bother Stark as he kept going deeper, his clone right behind, the smile on its face never going away.\nAnd after only five minutes…\n[Everyone has entered the third sublevel!]\nSeems like Akira and Leader easily found the exit thanks to their maps, and so the panel that would introduce the new 'killing' perk soon appeared.\n[Introducing the \"TOP 3\" perk!]\n[If before the end of sublevel 2, only three people remain alive, then you will completely skip sublevel 1 (the hardest and most deadly of them all) as well as the ones you are in, even if it is sublevel 3, immediately heading toward the warden!]\n'Cheap tricks…' Stark couldn't help but let out a small laugh, basically, if right now only three people were alive, then they would immediately be sent to the warden, cutting short any danger they would come across.\nThis would completely defy the point of this trial, as it is to prove that the domination users in question are worthy of owning their abilities.\nSo why…?\n'Maybe… just maybe… the warden is something that even three domination users cannot take down, sending those alive to their doom…' he couldn't know right now, but to be honest, all of this seemed so weird, and it was entirely possible that after each floor, the perk would become more and more tempting, to the point even Stark or even Officer would be forced to kill.\n\"Spatial Inventory,\" Stark opened the void and took out two [Potion of Regeneration], three [Potion of Speed] and three [Potion of Strength], then he drank them all, getting him back to full HP and granting him and his clone a boost in speed and strength.\n~PLOP, PLOP~\nThere were skeletons of humans inside the dozens of medieval jail cells scattered across the hallways, yet he hadn't encountered any monster yet.\nAnd then…\n~DING!~\n[As the first to get the key AND open the door to the next floor, you have been granted one reward from the list without having to kill!]\n[Reminder that if you kill, you get your map back and two rewards instead of one, wink wink ;)]\n'Doing anything to tempt me, heh~' Stark ignored the second panel and instead focused on the first one.\n[Would you like to unlock your reward now?]\n[Y/N?]\nA colorful clickable button appeared below the question, and Stark didn't hesitate to click on Y as there was no reason not to.\nOf course, under normal circumstances, the others would have to think about instantly using their rewards since they would need to hide them in case anybody would steal them or even figure out that they had murdered, but it was a different story for Stark since… he has [Spatial Inventory]!\n[Nice! Now just spin the wheel!]\n'Seems oddly familiar,' this almost reminded Stark of the times he had to spin his class wheel, but of course deep he knew this was different.\nA crimson wheel with horns on top of it and a very overwhelming aura appeared in front of the boy.\nThere were 10 sections, except the one with the 'Killing Spree' perk was chained, meaning it was impossible to get.\n[If you fall on 'Killing Spree', you get nothing :D (should have killed more people, its on you)]\n[Now just pull the tail to spin the wheel!]\nAnd as it said, a demon tail emerged from the front, inviting Stark to pull it, and he did so without a single ounce of hesitation.\n[Good luck!] and then all the panels disappeared.\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWISH~\nThe wheel began to spin at intense speed, hovering over every perk available.\n'Not as much pressure as the classes, that's for sure…' yet he was surprisingly calm.\nAnd so after around thirty seconds…\n~BIP, BIP…~ it slowed down, then suddenly stopped moving altogether, ~BEEEEPPPP~\nIt had chosen the reward, and it was…\n[Reward: Revive Token!]",

yourself once in the event of death, one time use.]\n'But I also have [Chosen One], which can revive me once too…' Stark's face began to contort into a smile as scary as his clone's.\nBecause it meant… that he could revive himself twice.\nPeople would fight to the death to be able to revive themselves just once, and pay astronomical amounts of money to get their hands on items that could come even close to save their lives, and here Stark was, with the ability to revive himself twice…\n'This is good… this is VERY good…' he laughed out loud like a maniac, and thankfully there was nobody to hear him, or they would probably attack since he would seem crazy.\nBut right at that moment…\n~CLING CLING~\nHe heard some noises coming out of some of the cells ahead of him, as well as in the hallway behind him: it was the sound of chains, and of small steps hitting the concrete stone.\n~CRACK~\nA giant hand held the corner of the hall, and destroyed a part of the wall with its sheer strength.\nAnd so, the giant monster (even bigger than the sublevel 4 guards), appeared.\n[Name: Chain Cyclops]\nIt had beige skin with a brown cloak over its genitals (oddly similar to the guards, heh), except it was way more muscular, didn't have disgusting bumps all over its body, and on its face… was just a single eye.\nThere was no mouth, no nose, nothing, it was just a giant eye that looked down on Stark as the cyclops seemed to be at least fifteen meters in size.\nIn the cyclops' left hand was a giant silver chain, and he was spinning it around with scary momentum.\n~THUMP, THUMP~\nHis footsteps echoed everywhere as he slowly approached Stark.\nBut this wasn't all, since there were two other types of monsters: the first was some sort of green lizard with sharp teeth that made a weird sound as it walked on the ground, they were around two meters in size.\n[Name: Dungeon Lizard]\nAnd the other were giant bats, the size of a human torso, flapping their dark wings, these bats didn't have eyes, they only had a very large mouth on their bodies, one that could easily swallow a human head if they grabbed it with their sharp dark teeth.\n[Name: Blood Mouth Bat]\nSo basically, behind Stark was a giant cyclops, while in front of him were two lizards and three bats.\nYet, Stark's giant smile never disappeared from his face, and his crimson aura surrounded him, giving him a crazy look that even his clone would envy.\nAnd so when he turned his gaze to the monster…\n\"…!\" they immediately looked distressed: the lizards took a few steps back while the bats flapped their wings in the opposite direction, slowly getting away from Stark.\n[Dungeon of Fear] monsters are supposed to cause fear to the opponents because of their terrifying appearances, yet… in front of this very human, THEY were the ones that feared for their lives.\nStark then turned his head to the cyclops, staring it in the eye, and its sole eye also widened, a few drops of sweat appearing on its bald forehead.\nBut this one didn't back, instead it stood its ground, yet Stark didn't to care much, after all… even his clone would be enough to take care of these things.\n~THUMP~\nAlthough it definitely looked like the cyclops was hesitating, it still took another step toward Stark.\n'Perception,' meanwhile, the boy decided to check out his opponents as they would probably be the most common monsters in the lot.\n…\n[Name: Chain Cyclops (STRONG)]\n[Level: 105]\n[HP: 218000]\n[Strength: 5427]\n[Stamina: 1203]\n[Speed: 836]\n[Defense: 2382]\n[Skills: Cyclopsian Might, Chain Whip, The Final Blow, All-Seeing Eye, Stone Wall, Dungeon of Fear, Steel Smash, Eye Block]\n…\nHe wasn't an ELITE, but he was at the category right below it: strong, plus it seemed like the level of monsters was now above 100.\n…\n[Name: Dungeon Lizard]\n[Level: 103]\n[HP: 112000]\n[Strength: 2193]\n[Stamina: 3768]\n[Speed: 3231]\n[Defense: 1482]\n[Skills: Lizard Claw, Tail Whip, Dungeon of Fear, Lights Out, Enemy Detection, Attach Camouflage…]\n…\nThis one was much weaker, and its HP were even lower than the guards even though it had a higher level, also most of its skills seemed useless in combat… maybe there was a trap?\n…\n[Name: Blood Mouth Bat]\n[Level: 102]\n[HP: 138500]\n[Strength: 2482 (to be able to behead)]\n[Stamina: 4928]\n[Speed: 2011]\n[Defense: 736]\n[Skills: Blood Absorb, Mouth Throw, Darkness Burst, Dungeon of Fear, Bat Swarm, Miniature Duplication, Behead (if it hits you, you're dead), Fly…]\n…\nThe bats were also pretty average, except for the fact they cold behead you if their skill hit you, otherwise their defense was so low only one or two hits would be enough to send them away.\nAll monsters had the [Dungeon of Fear] skill too though, maybe it was a passive?\n\"=)\" meanwhile, Stark's clone just positioned itself in front of the lizards and bats, leaving Stark to take care of the cyclops.\n'Sigh…' he turned around, hoping his clone wouldn't be dumb enough to fall into a trap, but… to be honest, it was so twisted and evil that he couldn't see it lose.\nAre all [Superior Clones] going to be like this? And if yes, then doesn't that mean it is Stark's very own aura that is the problem?\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS,\" the clone, before even starting its fight with the other monsters, summoned three spears and sent them all at the cyclops' eye.\n~BOOM, BOOM, BOOM~\nIt was too slow to avoid it, and so all three spears hit its eye.\n\"-37162! -40103! -38994!\"\n\"=)\" it didn't even look back to see what it did, and that surprised Stark.\n\"…!!!!\" the cyclops couldn't scream since no mouth (duh), but it held its eyes with its two hands, and it looked to be in a lot of pain.\n~OPEN~\nWhen it opened its eye back, there were giant blood tears coming from it, and three red spots on it where the spears hit.\n\"I get it…\" Stark sighed, but this was pretty damn obvious: the cyclops' weakness was its eye, and the moment it was destroyed, the monster would become blind.\nIt was kind of easy to figure out, but why the hell did the clone intervene before Stark could even begin to analyze his opponent?!\n~DASH~\n\"AURA SMASH!\" Stark looked back, but his clone was already rushing at the rest of the monsters, activating his skills in the process.\n\"I really need to figure out what that thing is thinking…\" he decided not to think too much about it and faced the cyclops again, but this time it would be him against it.",

Stark scratched his chin while squinting his eyes, it was interesting to know.\nThe cyclops was visibly trying to tame its chain and get Stark's out of the way, but it couldn't no matter what, even going as far as holding the edge of its weapon with its two sturdy hands and pulling.\n'AURA SMASH… MERGE!' taking yet again advantage of that opportunity while the cyclops was busy getting rid of the chain; Stark began to concentrate his power on his right hand as he ran in the cyclops' direction.\n~SLAM~\nThe cyclops finally decided to use its brain, if it even exists, to hit the chain and destroy it as it only had 10000 HP.\n\"…!\" then its giant pupil fell on Stark, noticing that the human was getting closer, so it immediately decided to attack again.\nAre monsters just brain-dead robots with the sole orders they were given being 'VIOLENCE'and 'KILL HUMANS'? Who knows, but they sure do look like it!\n\"STEEL SMASH!\" its free hand's color began to change, going from beige to silver-like, and it was obvious: it literally turned to steel, like actually.\n~FWISH~\nIt aimed it down at the running Stark.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" the hand was extremely big, so Stark was forced to roll away thanks to his invincibility frames.\n~BOOOOM, CRASHHH~\nThe sheer impact of the attack destroyed the area around the floor that had been hit, but it also resulted in the cyclops' hand being stuck temporarily as it couldn't get it out.\n\"DUMBASS,\" Stark laughed as he turned around and used the cyclops' own hand and arm to head toward its head.\n\"CYCLOPSIAN MIGHT!\" the cyclops began to charge up its powers, the aura around it being more bright, and the pupil in its eye growing three times its normal size, then… \"CHAIN WHIP!\"\nAfter taking control of its chain, it immediately sent it toward Stark while actively trying to get its steel hand out of the hole it had created.\n~JUMP~\nStark avoided the attack by jumping, but…\n\"CHAIN WHIP, CHAIN WHIP, CHAIN WHIP!!!\" thanks to the use of [Cyclopsian Might], the cyclops was able to continuously throw attacks at the human.\n~FWISH, SLIDE, JUMP~\nStark would avoid them all though, getting closer to the giant eye, and then, when his [Aura Smash] was fully powered up…\n\"AURA SMASH… MERGE!\" he punched the air in the direction of the giant eye, sending a giant crimson fist as big as it was toward it.\n~FWISH~\nThe fist left a powerful crimson trail as it headed toward the cyclops, who could only watch in shock as the attack closed on it.\n~BOOOOOOOM~\nIt hit its eye straight on, right in the middle, with not a single possibility to deny the fact it was a critical hit.\n\"-219382!\" the damage was beyond the 200K mark, something Stark had never achieved before, but it was mostly because the weak point of the cyclops made its defense irrelevant.\nAnd so that meant…\n[Chain Cyclops HP: 0/218000], well to be honest the final attack would have been enough, but the clone had done some damage at the start with the spears.\nIts HP reaching 0, the cyclops stumbled, knowing that its end was close.\nBut… it wouldn't go down like this.\nAnd so…\n[Death of the cyclops incoming!]\n[Passive skill activated: The Final Blow!]\nIt had a skill that could be used if it was about to die.\n'WHAT?!' Stark's eyes widened as he saw the cyclops stand back up, its eye had popped because of the fist, but it could still sense where Stark was, and so it unleashed everything on him.\nMaybe it was a bad idea to sit there and do nothing, but Stark couldn't deny that the sight of that monster still trying to eliminate the human after knowing that its death was coming regardless was… kind of amazing?\n'BRING IT ON,' he smirked as he got ready to avoid it all (hopefully).",

      "content": "\"THE FINAL BLOW!\" the cyclops' eye turned completely dark, and its skin also changed color, becoming entirely red now that it was in its final state: the one right before it would die.\n~FWISH~\nIts silver chain became sturdier and made out of pure black obsidian, one simple swing resulting in the entirety of the walls around to be destroyed.\n…\n[Skill: The Final Blow]\n[Description: When its HP reach 0, this skill will automatically activate, granting the cyclops godly powers and a new form, but this will only last for one attack, afterward the cyclops will immediately pass out.]\n[Note: The attack can be comparable to the one of a 'Calamity' level monster, so you better run!]\n…\n'Oh well… who cares when I have [Dodge Control]' Stark smirked as he got ready to avoid it, the cyclops grabbing the edge of its darkened chain and getting to swing it with all its might.\n\"DODGE CONTRO-\" Stark immediately wanted to activate his skill.\nBut…\n\"EYE BLOCK!\" the cyclops' eye and its now crimson pupil glew even brighter, then a beam of light hit Stark directly, putting some sort of lock symbol on top of his head.\n\"DODGE CONT-\" and afterward, he couldn't use his skill anymore, \"DODGE CONTR-\"\n\"Huh…?\" no matter how many times he tried to chant his skill, all that would appear before him was...\n['Dodge Control' has been temporarily blocked by 'Eye Block'!]\n'This…' Stark looked up to seeing that the cyclops was on the verge of striking with his chain, probably destroying the entire hallway with it as it was much more powerful than before.\n'Is…' Stark looked toward his clone, it had already eliminated all the other monsters, and was looking at Stark with a huge smile on its face.\n'A joke…' It seems like Stark's clone could still use [Dodge Control] as it wasn't affected by the skill.\n\"Right…?\" Stark turned his head toward the cyclops again, and it was already beginning to swing down at intense speed.\n~FWISH, VIOUM~\n\"TIME VISION,\" Stark instinctively activated the new perk of the [Focus] skill when the chain was right above his head, threatening to destroy him if it ever as much as grazed him.\n[3 seconds of slow left!]\nOf course, using [Time Vision] didn't completely stop time, it just slowed it down to around 0.25 of the actual time, which meant that he could still actively observe the chain slowly go down toward him.\nBut he just decided to use these three seconds to think…\n[Dodge Control] was out of the question, although his clone was currently using it, probably since it could only lock a skill from ONE entity.\n[Invincible Dodge] wasn't an option either since dodging would do nothing as the area effect would surely kill him, meaning that trying to dodge normally or with [Judicator's Wings] wouldn't do anything.\nHe had already used [The Purgatory Shadow] and none of his other equipments would help.\n'Think…'\n[1 second of 'Time Vision' left!]\n'…!' suddenly, Stark's eyes widened as he finally saw it, and he almost wanted to hit his forehead for being so dumb, 'I know how to escape now!'\n['Time Vision' stopped, time is resuming]\n~BOOM~\nThe cyclops' chain hit the exact spot Stark was in, and the entire hallway ahead completely shattered by the sheer impact: the walls were destroyed, the floor collapsed, revealing the fourth sublevel under it, and everything was shaking, safe to say even those very far from Stark could sense it.\n~FWISH~\nStark's clone on the other hand was able to easily dodge all the attack thanks to [Dodge Control], avoiding not only the chain, but also the destruction and debris.\nAnd as for the original…\n'…?' he opened his eyes, and found himself right behind the cyclops, unaffected by the attack as the damage wasn't that big from behind.\nAnd as to how he did it… well it was obvious.\n…\n'I KNOW HOW NOW,' he peeked from behind the cyclops and noticed that the [Crimson Ball Transmission] TP point was still there, perfectly placed.\nAnd so he just snapped his finger.\n~SNAP, FWISH~\nHis body almost instantly disappeared, leaving a crimson smoke of his exact figure, and after a fraction of a second, he found himself at the spot the ball had hit after emerging from a massive crimson flash, resembling a portal.\n[Teleportation successful]\nThe ball and circle symbol disappeared, but it had already saved Stark and done its job.\n~BOOM~\nThat's when the chain hit, and all Stark did afterward was brace himself for impact, and he received 0 damage in the process.\nAnd so after ending its attack, the cyclops turned back to its normal color, losing all of its power and aura, then falling to the ground with a large thud.\n'…' Stark rolled his eyes, this had been way too much for a 'STRONG' level monster, he wished his clone actually helped too if it had eliminated the monsters already, but oh well.\n…\n[You have slain 'Chain Cyclops lv105', gained 572621 EXP!]\n[You have slain 'Dungeon Lizard

stats]\n[Experience: 612340/1195000]\n'I guess that's done…' Stark sighed.\n\"=)\" meanwhile, his clone immediately jumped over the giant hole that had formed, then made its way walking on the corpse of the cyclops before reaching Stark.\nTo be honest, he wasn't even that interested to know how it killed the rest of the monsters, because if it could do the job, and he got EXP from it, he had nothing to complain about.\n'Well, I doubt I'm going to be able to find the key twice in a row, plus I would need to watch out more than before if I want to open the door…' Stark scratched his chin while thinking, he would indeed keep going to increase his level, but his chances of finding the key were slim now, this level was much darker and harder to navigate the fourth sublevel.\nWell… except if [Chosen One] suddenly decided to activate again that is, but that was unlikely…\n\"=)\" the [Superior Clone] had gained a will of its own, but it couldn't refute the words of the original, so it just waited around, analyzing their surroundings in case any more monsters showed up.\n'Well, let's keep going,' Stark nodded and jumped over the giant hole using the cyclops body, going back would only result in meeting someone else = fighting to the death and taking unneeded risks after all.\nOf course, if someone attacked, he wouldn't even hesitate for a single second to counter with everything he had, but it was rather peaceful on his side, so he didn't mind.\nBut of course… 'peace' wasn't something that everyone could get, because as soon as Stark took one step toward the next hall…\n[A participant has been slain by another player!]\n[Oh~ I'm loving it when the killing starts to become more interesting :)!]\n'…' these two panels appeared before Stark, and he couldn't help but sigh.",

      "content": "(Far from Stark, still on the third sublevel)\n~PEW, SHOOT~\nOfficer was currently busy shooting monsters with his guns, each bullet dealing up to 50000 damage, meaning that he could easily take down a swarm of them without any issues.\nHis guns adapted to his surroundings and feelings.\nAt first, he could only summon pistols, but after reaching level 30, he gained the ability to transform them into Uzis, dealing less damage but giving him more speed and a faster shooting rate, also his 'bullets' are made out of aura, so as long as you give him time, he can shoot infinitely.\nIt was a rather unique ability, and it was obvious that the stronger he got, he would be able to upgrade his guns into shotguns, snipers, and maybe even rocket launchers.\n\"Phew~ that's done for,\" he wiped his forehead after taking care of five [Dungeon Lizards] and three [Blood Mouth Bats], each dying after around 4/5 shots.\nIn terms of strength, he was obviously weaker than Stark, but when it came to taking down enemies precisely and fast, he was way better than the other boy, who could only use his fists.\n\"…\" even when fighting against a [Chain Cyclops], he did struggle slightly more than Stark because of its high defense, but once he figured out that its eye was its weakness, he shot a dozen bullets at it and it died.\n\"THE FINAL BLOW!\" of course, the cyclops used its final attack, but…\n\"FULL PRECISE MOVEMENT,\" he used one of his legendary skills, and a trail of aura behind as he parkoured right behind the cyclops, shooting its neck a few more times to make sure it died.\n~BOOM~\n'…' Officer shrugged as he was surrounded by the golden aura and then the level up prompt appeared before him.\n[Officer: Level 57]\nStark was obviously not the only one able to level up, so of course all the others had also gained some levels since coming here, although it was also pretty obvious Stark was the most motivated out of them all.\n'Need to watch out for all those criminals…' he mumbled as he clearly remembered the text above Yuri and Akira.\nOfficer had the [Police Judgment] skill, which helped him identify good and bad people, something he had acquired solely thanks to his high sense of justice, and all he wanted was to put all criminals behind bars.\nA golden scale would appear above their heads, and if it went to the right, surrounded by a crimson evil aura, then it meant the person was a criminal, if the scale went to the left and surrounded by a green aura, then it meant the person hadn't done anything yet.\nHe used it in this trial to identify all the criminals he would need to take care of later, and for now, that list was: Yuri as he killed Lolia, and Akira since… well… it's obvious.\nAs for Stark… the scale stayed completely neutral, it didn't show whether he was good or bad, but that worried Officer even more since he had never seen something like that before.\nPlus, when he saw the other crimson Stark, the scale went crazy and dozens of panels appeared around him, stating that it was not just evil, but… [Pure Evil], which was why he panicked and immediately pulled out his guns.\nIt was also something he had never seen before, even Akira and Yuri had been given the [Evil] title, so why the hell was that thing [Pure Evil]? He didn't know, but surely it would be bad…\n'…' Officer was already pissed because of this trial: it made him seem like a criminal since he was technically a prisoner of the Lucullus prison, but he was probably the most righteous out of all these people.\nBut of course… being a hero of justice or righteous doesn't mean anything in the [Domination Trial].\nAnd so when he took a few steps after assigning his skill points…\n~FWISH, VIOUM~\nHe sensed something behind him, and when he turned back… he saw a giant green snake rushing in his direction, its mouth big enough to swallow him whole.\nThe snake was floating in the air, and its body was completely made out of green aura except for its eyes and teeth that were white…\n'A human created this,' Officer immediately sensed something was wrong and avoided the attack by ducking under it, resulting in the giant snake to explode against the wall behind him.\n\"REVEAL YOURSELF… LEADER!\" he instinctively also knew the culprit.\n\"…\" and as expected, Leader, the sect leader looking guy with his long black hair and green robe that hid his feet swaying lightly, that robe of his had a giant snake drawing behind it resembling the one he had sent.\n\"Should have known instantly,\" Officer didn't hesitate to pull out his guns and point them at Leader.\n\"…\" but the other party didn't even speak, instead he just sighed, \"I truly wanted to send you away with the less amount of pain possible, but… it seems like you have chosen the hard way.\"\nLeader raised both hands, and the air around him started to ripple. The snake reformed on the ground and began to grow, elongating its body and increasing in size until it was as large as a whale, it slithered gracefully across the ground, ready to strike.\nAs guessed, Leader didn't have any kind of weapon, instead he used summon-related abilities, and his only summon was the 'snake', which is why his cult worships these very same snakes he creates.\n\"GUN DISPLAY!\" Leader summoned four pistols behind him, they were floating in the air and all of them had a blueish aura, aimed at Leader, \"SHOOT!\"\n~PIOU, PEW, SHOOT~\nAll six guns shot dozens upon dozens of bullets toward Leader, whose expression didn't even budge.\n\"Snake Shield…\" he calmly mumbled as he lifted his arms up, summoning another serpent that formed a circle around Leader, creating a transparent barrier that none of the bullets could break through.\nAnd then…\n\"Serpent Restrain…\" he raised one of his feet, then swung it upward.\n~FWISH, BIM~\nAnd two very small snakes came out of the ground beside Officer, then began to slowly bind the guy by restraining his legs.\n\"…SHIT!\" Officer stopped shooting his bullets as he aimed them at the snakes, this was very bad news for him.\nBut this was already over…\n\"Snake Fury…\" Leader pointed at his opponent, and the giant snake that had been resting suddenly got up, launching itself toward Officer, who couldn't move because of the small snakes restraining him below.\n\"…\" he turned his head in the direction of the giant snake and saw its mouth opened, ready to swallow him: it was a terrifying sight as the aura of the snake was everywhere, and it was almost as big as the hallway, its white eyes leaving a small trail behind.\nNo matter how many bullets he shot at it, it wouldn't disappear.\nAnd so what had to happen happened.\n~FWISH, NOM~\nOfficer was completely annihilated by the snake, and when the giant mouth closed on him, he received enormous damage (even with the domination aura blocking most of it)\n\"-67382!\"\n\"Cri…mi…nal…\" Officer slowly pointed at Leader before falling, his body destroyed from the aura and teeth of the summon.\nAnd so, Officer obviously died.\n[A participant has been slain by another player!]\n[6 participants remain!]\n\"…\" Leader's face stayed neutral through all of this, and he just snapped his fingers to make all his summons disappear, leaving only the destroyed body of Officer on the ground.\nHe had gotten his reward after all… who would be his next target?",

      "content": "Only ten minutes after the announcement of another person dying, while Stark was busy fighting off two [Dungeon Lizards] under the watchful gaze of his clone…\nA new message appeared.\n[The sublevel 2 Floor has been opened! Head to the exit to be able to climb to the next level!]\n'Oh…?' was it because of the rewards they had gotten, or maybe it was just that someone got lucky and somehow found the key extremely fast, it hadn't even been more than 30 minutes since they entered this level after all…\nThe sound of the announcement echoed through the dimly lit dungeon halls for everyone to hear.\nThe fact it was done so quickly probably meant the person that had opened it was the only one up here now, the rest of the people still busy fighting monsters.\nAnd as expected, after only two minutes since the first announcement…\n[Akira has reached the second sublevel first, granting reward…]\n'Maybe he got the [Key Location Map], he did get two rewards after all…' Stark thought as he sent a crimson fist toward the last [Dungeon Lizard].\n~BOOM~\n\"-66381!\" and so it fell dead on the ground.\n[You have slain 'Dungeon Lizard lvl103', gained 153559 EXP!]\n[You have slain 'Dungeon Lizard lvl103', gained 154122 EXP!]\n'Only one or two monsters…' Stark couldn't contain his excitement: he was level 49, so close to being level 50 and finally being able to unlock his new class, as well as many other features, much like when he reached level 25.\nIt was kind of anticlimactic to get to level 50 just like that in opposition to having to fight a 'Godless Demon' apostle like last time for his first milestone, but who cares?\n'Now I need to figure out the way to the exit…' he didn't have a map, and he had gone pretty far inside the [Dungeon of Fear], so finding his way back wouldn't be possible easily…\n[Only two people remain in the third sublevel!]\nPlus, it seemed like that most people had already rushed to the second sublevel using their maps after checking the announcement.\nBut this also meant that… someone else was still there…?\nTo be honest, Stark already had an idea of who had died and who did it (his clone also confirmed it): Kokoro, Yuri, and Akira wouldn't be possible since they were cautious, plus the latter had opened the second door.\nAnd the white haired lady looked too strong to be taken out like this, which meant the only people remaining were Officer and Leader, and he had a deep feeling that the former was killed by the latter.\n'Need to watch out for the sect leader I guess… always had a bad feeling about him,' it was all speculation of course, but it was pretty spot-on.\nIt didn't matter much though, he would be alone on this floor for a while and would have all the opportunities in the world to get to level 50, then he would become much stronger…!\nEven if it wasn't a big fight that got him to this huge milestone, it didn't really matter to him.\n[WARNING! If you enter the second sublevel, then the limited offer of getting your map back and TWO rewards will be cancelled, think wisely!]\n'Well… not like I'm going to meet anybody as most of them are up, and the last guy must be currently heading to the exit too…' it was sad such a reward would be left out, but he surely wouldn't be able to take this offer currently.\nOr at least… that is what he believed.\n'I guess there's Yuri, Akira and Leader on the dangerous list now, although I think the first two are much more dangerous by their auras alone-' Stark mumbled while walking.\nBut…\n~FWISH, CROWKA~\nHe sensed something coming from behind, and when he and his clone turned around, they saw a giant green snake coming at them.\n\"=)\" the clone didn't even budge, keeping its massive smile on its face as it crouched down to avoid the massive snake, and Stark did the same.\n'Must be one of the participants,' he immediately thought, 'I remember one of them having a snake at the back of his robe…'\nAnd as expected, it was at this moment that Leader revealed himself, the same expression on his face, almost as if he expected Stark to do that.\nBut he did: the exact same thing happened with Officer, and it wouldn't change with Stark, who was much weaker.\n\"Heh~ a sect leader trying to kill someone, should have known, did you do that to Officer?\" Stark smiled as widely as his clone, they basically looked like twins.\n\"…!\" Leader for the first time did look slightly surprised, he didn't know how Stark knew, but it was weird.\nPlus… what was that thing behind him?\nLeader wasn't present when Stark explained about his clone, so to him, this was just… an anomaly, and a scary one at that.\nEven he could see it: that thing was twisted and evil, maybe even more so than he himself was as a sect leader.\nLeader's sect was called \"Snake Symphony\", and they all worshiped the snakes that he created, making him somewhat of a god to his followers, who ranged in the thousands.\n\"I hope you don't regret that decision of yours later,\" Stark and his clone positioned themselves for combat, with absolutely zero hesitation to kill the guy.\nAnd for some reason… Leader actually hesitated.\nHe had been completely confident in himself when against Officer, easily taking him down using the usual method he did when killing people weaker than he was, but this time… he felt like it wouldn't work.\nMaybe it was those evil smiles that he hesitated, or maybe this aura…?\n'…' Leader breathed in before summoning the giant snake as big as a whale in front of him again, 'It's going to work.'\nHis plan had never failed, why would it not succeed against a kid so weak, he was the last to reach level 50 and last to leave this floor after all, right…?\n\"I guess that's your decision, then let's start this battle,\" Stark shrugged.\n\"=)\" the [Superior Clone] looked excited.\n[FIGHT!]\n'Heh~ guess I shouldn't have talked too soon…' Stark mumbled to himself, after all he had said that this rise to level 50 would be anticlimactic, yet here he was, facing off against the possible strongest enemy he had fought against until now, even stronger than [Judicator], [Sierra], [The Corrupter Ghoul] and [Soulayer]…\n\"SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT, SECT LEADER,\" he smiled as he activated his aura as well.",

      "content": "While all the others had already ascended to the second sublevel of the Lucullus prison, Stark and Leader were now facing one another, with the clear intent to fight and kill the other party.\nIt had been Leader that attempted to ambush Stark, but now that he was forced to fight, he wouldn't hesitate to take this opportunity to climb to level 50 but also to accept the offer he had been given.\n\"…\" Leader's expression remained neutral as he saw Stark activate his aura, the clone behind him still smiling widely.\nFrankly, Leader hated that clone more than any of the other participants, and he didn't know why, something just felt off about it: its eyes, its mouth, and its entire figure, it felt like it could kill him whenever it wanted, but just chose not to for fun.\nBut of course, he would never show his expression faltering, it was something he learned as a sect leader: always being shown as all powerful with no flaws.\n\"GET READY, SECT LEADER!\" Stark shouted with a smile as he stood his ground.\n~FWISH~\nLeader on the other hand already had the giant green aura lying in front of him, but he also decided to summon dozens of others that ranged from small to middle-sized, each of them surrounding his body: shoulders, neck, one was on top of his, others around his torso and legs.\n\"Am I supposed to be impressed,\" Stark rolled his eyes while activating [Perception], if he so wanted to waste time, then Stark would use it wisely to check out his opponent.\n…\n[Name: Leader]\n[Level: 61]\n[Class: Domination]\n[HP: 34000]\n[Strength: 2938]\n[Speed: 5372]\n[Stamina: 4314]\n[Defense: 5409]\n[Skills: Domination, Snake Summoning, Venomous Touch, Ultimate Fusion (MYTHICAL), Serpentine Charge, Reptile Swarm, Serpent Restrain, The Symphony of Snakes, Snaky the Giant Snake, Giant Bite, Attack Frenzy, Snake Shield, Better Summons (PASSIVE)…]\n…\n'Hm…' his HP were very low, but it was expected as the [Domination] does seem to leave out HP to prioritize skills and stats, meaning that even a hit from Stark would probably only do around 8000 points of damage as the [Domination] aura would block most of it.\nAs for his general stats, they were insanely good, way better than Stark's and even better than the level 100 people he had fought at the 'ClassiTop Event'…\nAnd of course, he had the [Domination] skill as well as twelve others since he was level 61, meaning that he got one skill every 5 level, much like Stark.\n\"Reptile Swarm!\" was the skill he had used to summon all these snakes around him, and he could send them all to Stark any time.\nMeanwhile, the giant (and strongest) snake out of them all that was lying in front of Leader, its eyes never leaving Stark, and its tongue hissing, was from the [Snaky the Snake] skill, and yes, it sounded ridiculous, but that skill is extremely powerful.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" not wanting to do nothing, the [Superior Clone] immediately sent two crimson fists at Leader.\n\"Snake Shield,\" but he just used this skill to summon a serpent that circle in front of Leader and formed a giant barrier.\n~BOOM, BOOM~\nThe crimson fists did nothing to the transparent barrier.\n\"=)\" but the [Superior Clone] didn't seem affected.\n'Alright… it's time,' Leader had used this method dozens if not HUNDREDS of times against monsters and humans alike: letting them attack first, blocking their attack, and while they are busy anticipating what comes next, he would bind their feet to the ground using another one of his skills then send [Snaky] to deal the final blow.\nThis was an attack that hadn't failed ONCE, and he would make sure today wasn't the first either, it couldn't be: he was stronger than Stark, and he looked so weak…\n'Come on…' his expression was neutral on the outside, but deep inside, he was trembling slightly, it was the first time it happened, and he didn't know why, 'ALRIGHT, LETS GO!'\n\"SERPENT RESTRAIN…!\" just like last time, he raised one of his feet then swung it upward in Stark's direction.\n~FWISH, QUWIK~\nTwo snakes came out of the ground below and attached themselves to his legs, making him unable to escape.\n\"SERPENT RESTRAIN…!\" but he used it twice, this time in the clone's direction to restrain it as well since it could ruin his plans.\n\"=)\" the [Superior Clone] looked down at the small snakes restraining its legs, then back at the original, who looked indifferent to the attack as well.\nNot only did he have [Invincible Dodge], but he also had [Dodge Control] available in case anything happened.\n\"COME ON…\" Leader whispered while focusing his entire aura on the snake in front of him, making it get up then sending it at intense speed toward Stark and his clone, it was taking the entire hallway, so normally, avoiding it should be impossible, \"IT'S MY WIN…\"\n~FWISH, GROOWWW~\nThe giant green snake opened its mouth, big enough to swallow both Stark and his clone in one go, yet none of them looked afraid of that thing.\n\"…\" Stark looked at his clone then made a quick gesture with his head, asking it to do 'that'.\nHe didn't even plan to waste his [Dodge Control] or [Invincible Dodge] on such a WEAK combo of attacks.\nAnd so…\n\"DOMI-CHAIN,\" the [Superior Clone] summoned the crimson chain and sent it toward the giant aura snake, closing its mouth and slowly wrapping itself around it.\n\"…!\" Leader for the first time in months if not years showed signs of legitimate surprise, \"KEEP GOING…!\" he wanted to shout to his snake.\nBut…\n~FWISH, STOP~\nThe chain wrapped itself around the snake's mouth, face, and body; making it abruptly stop right before reaching Stark as the chain was absorbing its energy, making it fall to the ground, unable to keep going.\n~FWISH, KICK~\nRight afterward, Stark and his clone got rid of the small snakes attached to their legs by punching or kicking them.\n\"MOVE…\" Leader ordered [Snaky The Snake] to keep going, but…\n[Snaky is unable to move since he is bound, try again later!]\n\"Well, I'll just summon his back to the space and use him later then…\" Leader lifted both his arms with the intent to bring Snaky back to himself, but yet again…\n[Snaky is restrained by the 'Domi-Chains', making him unable to come back until the chains are off him!]\n\"…\" Leader was astonished: his most powerful combo had been stopped by a mere chain while his opponents were restrained, and they didn't even seem to care about that, taking it as some sort of weak attack.\n[Snaky the Snake] was Leader's second most powerful skill, yet it was now tamed by Chosen, making him unable to control it as long as it was bound.\n'…' Leader breathed in and out again, focusing his aura and attention on what he should be doing next, 'It doesn't matter, I'm still stronger…'\nHe got ready to keep going while using his other skills, after all it wasn't because his most powerful combo had failed that it was the end of the world, it was bound to happen at some point against someone who had the convenient skills to stop it.\nBut… even when he thought of all of this… the faces of Stark and his clone at that moment, their massive smiles as they saw his surprised look, sent shivers down his spine.",

      "content": "Now that his second powerful skill [Snaky the Snake] was tamed by the crimson chain, Leader could only watch as the other two removed the small snakes that were restraining them and then looked back at him.\nHis plan has miserably failed simply because Chosen had the PERFECT skills to counter this attack, was it finally karma coming back at him for everything that he did in the real world? Or maybe it was something...?\nMaybe... Stark was smarter? No, this couldn't be, he was in control of thousands of people, and they would do anything by a simple request, a child like him cannot be smarter...\n'These smiles...' he silently gritted his teeth internally, 'You dare show such an expression in front of an all-powerful being...' Leader truly believed he was some sort of god because of the constant cheers and praises from his followers.\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS,\" Stark and his clone summoned six spears and threw them all toward the enemy.\n\"SNAKE SHIELD!\" but it seemed like that skill of his had no limitations, as the snake just circled him again and created the transparent barrier that deflected all the spears.\n\"=)\" Stark looked at his clone, and it just lightly pointed its head at Leader.\n\"...\" Stark thought about the implications of the clone's suggestion, but it was too risky, especially when Leader was almost as fast if not faster than them, plus he had the [Venomous Touch] skill, which surrounded his entire body with poison that could deal damage over time if they even as much as grazed him.\nThis could be deadly to his clone as it only had around 500 HP left...\nBut there was a solution to that very same problem he was facing, and although it was risky, he did think that it was for the best.\n\"HP Transfer...\" he sighed as he pointed at himself, a green trail of aura appearing at the tip of his index finger, then he pointed at his clone, \"Send.\"\n~FWISH~\nThe trail of aura shot at the clone, and it hit it straight on as it didn't avoid it, after all why would it when it was the original that did that?\n[+10000 HP to Superior Clone]\nHe had given around half his life to the clone, but it was needed if they wanted to battle someone who constantly fought with hundreds of small snakes that could poison you.\n[Stark HP: 12300/22300]\n\"VENOMOUS TOUCH,\" sensing the increase in their auras, Leader immediately activated one of his passive skills, which made it so that his body is poison itself: if Stark or his clone punched him, then they would receive the [Poison] status for a minute.\nAnd then, without wasting time...\n\"SERPENTINE CHARGE!\" he yet again used the skill he had used first to ambush both Officer and Stark.\nHe pointed his arm at Stark with his palm facing them, then a giant magic circle appeared around a huge chunk of the hallway.\n~FWISH, FWIIISHH.... VIOUM~\nAnd as expected, a giant green snake came out of the magic circle, vertically rushing at the two enemies with its mouth open.\n\"SNAKE RESTRAIN,\" plus, he yet again attempted to restrain the two Stark with his skill, summoning two small snakes that were ready to bind their legs again.\n'A sect leader that doesn't even think...?' Stark was confused, there was no way he truly believed that this would work, right?\nI mean, he did watch the fight Stark had against Soulayer, so he should have at least been able to identify some of his skills...?\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" both Stark and the [Superior Clone] activated their skill to roll away, fazing through the small snakes and also the giant one, dealing 0 damage as it exploded against the wall behind them.\n\"...?\" Leader was surprised: his attack had surely hit them, but it literally just went through them like it was air, \"...!\" that's when he remembered something like this did happen with Stark before, but he was so focused on sending everything at them that he didn't realize it.\nLeader was losing his patience, and Stark's arsenal seemed to be highly focused on countering/blocking/dodging for some reason, which was his PERFECT counter...\n\"AURA SMASH,\" Stark and his clone sent four crimson fists at Leader, who immediately activated [Snake Shield].\nBut this time...\n~BOOM, CRACK~\nA very small crack formed at the corner of the shield, almost invisible to most, but Leader knew this was bad: his shield wasn't invincible, it just had 500,000 HP, if these went down, it would be destroyed and would take 12 hours to reconstruct it.\nAnd right now...\n[Snake Shield HP: 312821/500000]\nIt was almost half destroyed by the spears and crimson fists the two Stark were constantly sending.\n'You little...' Leader began to grit his teeth, losing his temper as everything he sent would be countered by those two fuckers.\nBut he couldn't give up yet…\n\"REPTILE SWARM,\" he opened his arms widely, and dozens upon dozens of snakes began to materialize around him: some were in the front, others behind, some on his body and the rest even on the walls and ceiling, but they were all looking at Stark, their eyes glowing with red aura as they got ready to all attack at once.\nGetting rid of so many enemies would seem hard, and if they were bitten by a dozen of them, they would be paralyzed and killed.\nSo what could they possibly do...?\n...\n[Skill: Reptile Swarm]\n[Description:] Summons 300 snakes (increases with skill level) that all attack the enemy at once, each of them only have one hp, but it is hard to get rid of them all.\n[Flaw:] 'They all attack at ONCE'.\n...\n\"=)\" Stark's clone didn't have to read the flaw that it already figured out how to win this battle.\n\"...!\" but Stark also figured it out as well, and so he just looked at his clone, asking it to do it instead of him.\n\"Go, my minions...!\" Leader pointed at the Stark, and all 300 snakes rushed at them with the full intent to eat them both alive.\nBut...\n~FWISH~\nThe [Superior Clone] drew a big circle on its palm, then pointed at the ceiling right in front of them, absolutely confident its plan would work.\n\"HEAVEN'S WRATH,\" the crimson glow appeared in the sky to announce the fact the beam was powering up.\nStark and his clone had perfectly calculated the moment the beam would erupt, so they just stood there, looking at Leader with big smiles on their faces.\n'Why aren't they moving...' for the first time, Leader sweat a bit, 'Anyone who saw my reptiles would usually try to run or fight them off, but I would always kill them while they were distracted... WHY AREN'T THEY RUNNING?!'\n\"=)\"\n\"=)\"\nAnd when the small snakes were about to reach them, the entirety of them concentrated in one simple area as they had all been ordered to reach for the boys…\n~FWISH… BOOOOOOM~\nThe giant crimson beam descended upon all of them at once.\n\"SsSSsss…\"\n\"Sss-\"\n\"…\"\nEach and every single one of the snakes was INSTANTLY vaporized by the attack.\nAnd so, while the giant crimson beam was still descending, hiding Stark and his clone from the unsuspecting Leader, he suddenly had a bright idea.\n\"It's our time to attack now, we've been on the defensive for long enough,\" he smiled, and the clone nodded.\nHe immediately put his plan into action.\n\"CRIMSON BALL TRANSMISSION!\"",

      "content": "Stark had been attacked by Leader around four times, while all he and his clone did was dodging all the attacks he sent at them, since they REALLY wanted him to despair.\nSince the moment they saw him and his calm expression, they instantly knew that guy thought himself superior to all of them since he probably had power and influence in the outside world.\nBut Leader had forgotten just one simple thing: the outside world doesn't matter during the 'Domination Trial', you can be the king of a country, a president, a CEO, but you would still get killed if you didn't fight with all your might.\nPlus, they knew from that simple combo with [Snake Restrain] and [Snaky the Snake], as well as his expression after they avoided it that this was probably what he did against all his other opponents, yet it somehow didn't work against Stark and his clone since… well… they weren't dumb?\nAnd after four attacks, it was apparent that Leader was slightly panicking, although he kept his neutral expression on the outside, his aura was more shaky and less confident than before.\n~BOOM~\nThe crimson beam that eliminated all 300 snakes was still there, separating Stark and Leader, while also keeping them hidden as it was impossible to see through the beam.\nAnd so… Stark decided to take advantage of this opportunity to finally attack and end this battle.\n\"CRIMSON BALL TRANSMISSION!\" he summoned the crimson ball in his hand, then immediately threw it.\nThe ball couldn't be damaged while it was in the air, so it passed right through the beam, and thanks to [Focus], Stark had perfectly been able to aim for where he wanted to: right behind Leader.\nThe ball lobbed above the sect leader, who was too focused using [Snake Summoning] to create new snake allies, so he didn't even notice it flying above him, then swiftly falling.\n\"Stay back here,\" Stark smiled at his clone, and it nodded.\nAnd then… before the ball even reached the ground, while it was still falling, now around Leader's waist…\nStark snapped his fingers.\n~SNAP, FWISH~\nStark's body disappeared from its original spot and a trail of crimson aura went a lightning speed toward the spot the ball was currently in, resulting in Stark teleporting right behind Leader.\nThe transmission was almost instantaneous and made no noise, so there was no way for Leader to know…\nAnd he didn't, at least… not until it was too late.\n\"DOMI-CHAIN!\" Stark could have obviously dealt a good amount of damage by immediately attacking, but it would be dumb as he could definitely guarantee his victory if he just played it safe.\n~SCWING, BIND~\nThe crimson chain headed toward Leader, who immediately sensed that something was wrong and turned around.\nBut…\n~FWISH~\nAll he saw the Stark's fist in front of his face, and he could do nothing to block this attack as [Snake Shield] couldn't be activated this fast from this close…\n\"URGHHH!\" Leader subconsciously tried to block the fist with his own, but the force was too strong. The blow sent him flying backward, slamming into the ground and almost entering the area of [Heaven's Wrath].\n\"-9382!\" when [Domination] aura clashed against [Domination] user, then the amount of damage would be massively reduced, which was why [Domination] were always some of the greatest to ever occur.\n\"SNAKE SUMMONING!\" Leader summoned two snakes in his hands and used their teeth to stop himself from entering the giant beam, and he actually succeeded at the last second, his legs on the verge of being vaporized.\nBut of course… the fact Stark hit Leader could only mean one thing…\n[You have received the 'Poisoned' effect for one minute (100 damage per second)]\nThe [Poison] effect would obviously do 6000 damage; and thankfully enough he had more than enough HP to survive this, but it was still very annoying.\n'…' Leader tried to take a step forward to stop Stark but… 'Huh?'\nHe hadn't noticed the chain since had deliberately punched him at that exact moment to divert his attention, meaning that the chain was already up to his knees, and carefully rolling around him.\n'I can't move, shit…' Leader immediately used [Giant Bite] and summoned two semi-sized snakes roughly the size of his legs, then ordered them to bite off the chains.\nBut… when he thought he was free since the chains did come out once the snake bit them… something else appeared behind him, someone much more powerful than anything he had ever felt before.\nThe beam had already disappeared by this point, and Stark's clone didn't remain idle, after all they had a plan since the moment Stark teleported, and it was going perfectly.\n\"AURA SMASH… MERGE,\" Stark's clone immediately began to charge up the attack once Stark went away, taking a long time to gather all its aura inside the giant fist, making it more powerful than before.\nAnd once the beam disappeared and [Superior Clone] noticed Leader was struggling to remove the chains… he shot the giant fist, roughly 1,5x times the size of Leader, toward him.\n\"SNAKE SHIE-\" Leader turned around and immediately summoned his shield again, but… it was too slow.\n~FWISH, BOOM~\n\"-14281!\" the damage was incredible for something against a [Domination] user, and it meant that Leader was now at his final 6000 points of health.\n\"Gurh~\" Leader stumbled slightly, the attack making him feel intense pain, and blood pouring out from his eyes and mouth.\nHe genuinely couldn't understand how he was losing against such a weak kid.\n\"HOW… HOW… HOOOOOOW~\" he suddenly shouted out of nowhere, completely leaving his normal and composed self behind, his face full of fury.\nHe was surrounded by a huge amount of green aura, and in addition to that…\n~FWISH~\nHis hair, normally long and black, suddenly began to turn completely green, and scales began to appear on his face, his pupils dilating and transforming into a yellow color resembling those of a snake.\n\"SSSSssssTOPPPP~\" he hissed while speaking, his tongue also transformed, it wasn't human anymore.\nAnd once all of this shit was over…\n\"ULTIMATE FUSION!!!\" he activated his [Mythical] skill, which was pretty much his ultimate.\nBasically… Leader had turned into some sort of snake man.\n\"Heh~\" Stark found this transformation ridiculous, but couldn't deny it looked strong.\n\"=)\" the clone on the other hand just pointed at Leader and laughed while holding its forehead.\nThis time, it would truly be the end of Stark's first fight against another [Domination] user.",

      "content": "\"ULTIMATE FUSION… REPTILE MODE!\" Leader had pretty abandoned much his calm expression, now staring at Stark and his clone like they were his biggest enemies ever, which they probably were, not going to lie.\nHis long hair that reached his knees went from black to completely green, with snake coming out of it, and his body also began to develop scales on it, plus his eyes looked like those of a serpent ready to attack, basically... his past body had been left behind, almost as if he was reborn.\nAlso, both his arms and legs were now completely surrounded by dozens of snakes, making it very disturbing as the serpents were swirling all around him, he was their master after all.\n\"Get ready to be ssstopped…\" Stark saw a snake tongue coming out of his mouth whenever he said the letter 's'.\n…\n[Skill: Ultimate Fusion (MYTHICAL)]\n[Description: Fuses with his snake summons to become one big 'snake-man' himself, granting him a boost in strength and making his attacks more poisonous and powerful]\n[Flaw: none, you just have to beat him up]\n…\n'Hm…' Stark didn't quite like this transformation, but he couldn't do much about it.\n\"=)\" and of course, the [Superior Clone] wasn't even bothered as it literally laughed in Leader's face, amused by its attempt to win.\n\"GET READY YOU SSSSTUPID FUCKER…\" Leader dashed in the clone's direction.\n\"=D\" but the clone didn't even take him seriously.\n\"ATTACK FRENZY,\" Leader's eyes glew with a yellow color as he sent his snake-filled fist toward the clone.\n~FWISH~\nBut it just avoided it by moving its head to the side, the smile on its face growing wider as it immediately attempted to take him by striking his legs.\n\"SNAKE SUMMONING!\" But Leader was ready and summoned five snakes in front of the attack, causing the clone to stumble and fall to the ground instead.\n\"=)\" the clone now on the ground, looked up to Leader with the same sadistic smile.\n\"SERPENTINE CHARGE,\" Leader also smiled this time as he pointed his arm toward the clone, the giant circle looking much more complicated and powerful than before.\nAnd from that distance, not even one meter, then this attack would surely hit and kill the clone.\n\"Goodbyeeessss, BITCH!\" he activated his attack and the giant snake began to come out, its mouth wide open.\nBut…\n\"Tsk, tsk, tsk,\" Stark, who was right behind, shook his head, \"A sect leader shouldn't swear!\"\n\"TARGET MANIPULATION,\" he didn't want to use [Domi-Chain] yet, so instead he opted for another skill that he didn't use much in battles.\n~FWISH~\nHe pointed his right arm at the enemy, his index and middle finger raised at Leader like a gun, a deep aura concentrated on them.\nAnd then… his aura was shot toward Leader, hitting him and making his entire body surrounded by a small outline of crimson color.\n\"GOT YOU…\"\nAnd so right before he could summon his snake to kill the [Superior Clone]…\n~FWISH, SNAP~\nStark turned his 'gun' hand to the right, resulting in Leader being slightly sent to the direction he pointed at.\n~SSSSSS, BOOOM~\nLeader sent the giant snake, but as his body swayed to the left, his arm and circle did as well, meaning that it missed the clone by a hair's length.\n\"WHAT THE?\" he turned to see Stark pointing his arm at him, and that's when he noticed that he had been controlled by Stark's aura… which made him even more furious, \"YOU FUCKING AsSSSSHOL-\"\nHe tried to swear but…\n~PUNCH, SLAM~\nThe [Superior Clone] immediately took advantage of that to get up and hit Leader in the face, sending him flying toward Stark.\n\"-4837!\" didn't do much damage because of his snake-man form, but it was still good.\n['Superior Clone' has received the [Poisoned] status for 1 minute]\nThe fact that for every 5000 points of damage, the enemy would receive 6000, frankly made it extremely unfair, but oh well.\n\"AURA SMASH,\" Stark focused his aura and sent three crimson fists toward Leader who was repeatedly hitting the ground after being hit.\n\"SNAKE SHIELD…\" but even while being hit, he still activated his shield and tanked all three attacks.\n~CRACK~\nMore cracks began to form on the shield, though.\nMeanwhile, [Snaky the Giant Snake] was still unconscious because of the [Domi-Chain] aura, meaning that it was just lying there almost in the middle of the hallway, taking lots of space as they were forced to fight only on one side of it.\nIt did advantage Stark and his clone though as they were fighting from close range while throwing projectiles…\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS,\" then Stark and the clone, as if they had linked minds, both threw six spears at Leader from different directions.\n\"ARGH, SHIT…\" Leader was enraged as he immediately got up, \"SNAKE SHIELD… EXPAND!\"\nObviously Stark wasn't the only one who could use perks, all other people had some too, and 'expand' was one of the perks of the [Snake Shield].\n~BOOM, CRACK~\nThe [Snake Shield] would grow in size, forming a giant circle around Leader to completely protect him from any attacks.\nBut this also made it easier to damage the shield, which was why he hadn't activated it.\n[Snake Shield HP: 98392/500000]\n[Leader HP: 5500/34000]\n\"ULTIMATE FUSION… HEAL!\" he used the second perk of his mythical skill, and most of the snakes that were on his body suddenly bit any part of his body they could reach, inflicting him with their poison.\nBut in this case…\n[+10000HP], instead of being poisoned, since he was a snake-man himself, he had been healed.\n\"Spatial Inventory,\" while Leader was busy getting healed, Stark pulled out his inventory void and grabbed three [Crystal Stun] potions from it.\nOh, and yeah, Stark is always under the effect of the [Strength] and [Speed] potions, since he always makes sure to drink some before being in battle.\n\"CRIMSON BALL TRANSMISSION,\" the clone sent a ball, landing it right next to Stark, then snapped its fingers to teleport right next to the original.\n\"Here,\" he handed two of the three stun potions to it, and it just smiled as it knew perfectly what they needed to do.\nThe [Crystal Stun] potions didn't work against the [Cyclop] or monsters that were too big or immune, but against a simple human that was affected by it like any other…? It was extremely deadly.\nMaybe Leader was immune to it, who knows, after all he had the body of a snake, and he was also immune to poison and many status effects, so you could never know.\nBut… Stark just a gut feeling that this was THE solution to end this battle.\nAnd so… Stark and his clone took a step forward, their potions in hand as they were ready to eliminate the sect-leader once and for all.\nBut of course… the other guy didn't stand doing nothing after being healed…\nInstead…\n\"SYMPHONY OF SNAKES!\" he used the final skill he hadn't used yet, and also probably the second strongest beside [Snake Fusion] since it was legendary…\nAnd so just like that, both parties were ready to give it everything they've got to end the battle.\nThe winner takes all: rewards, levels and confidence, while the loser just dies.",

      "content": "\"SYMPHONY OF SNAKES,\" Leader was tired of being played with, he had always been respected and worshiped by his followers, and even those outside his cult were always fearful of his powers since they didn't know he was a [Domination] user.\nEven among [Domination] users and classifiers, he had always been super strong, being able to take most of them down using his simple combo he did every time, and when he felt bored, he wouldn't use it and instead torture them with his poison.\nBasically… he liked to torment people and show them they never stood a chance to begin with.\nBut doesn't that remind you of someone else… isn't that just like… Stark?\nNo… he was just… an inferior version =).\n…\n[Skill: Symphony Of Snakes]\n[Rank: Legendary]\n[Description: By using the powerful aura of the 'Snake Guardian' to support his body, the user transforms into a new form. In the new form, the transformed user is capable of summoning and controlling hundreds of snakes, whose bodies become an extension of his own.]\n[Note: This skill adapts to all other skills!]\n…\n\"ASSsssHOLE!\" Leader got up, some blood apparent on his face as he had been hit by Stark's powerful aura fists twice already, as well as the merged [Aura Smash].\nAnd now that he had activated his most powerful legendary skill, while using [Ultimate Fusion]'s reptile form… he was unstoppable.\nAs if proving his point, [Symphony of Snakes] instantly activated.\nLeader's body started to swell, hundreds of snakes poured from the ground, walls, and ceiling to connect to his snake-man form to create a single, massive entity.\n\"DO YOU SsssEE WHY YOU ARE GOING TO LOSsssE NOW?\" Leader looked down upon Stark.\nHe was now just as tall as the [Sub-Level 4 Guards], although it was just that his entire figure was made up of snakes, now that he himself grew, which meant that his head was just as small as before.\n\";D\" the [Superior Clone] couldn't help but laugh while slapping its knees, the fact Leader was controlling such a massive body completely made out of visible snakes, while his head remained just as small, looked frankly ridiculous.\nBut Leader was in no mood to be mocked, \"YOU SssshALL NOT Laugh! THIS IS A BATTLE OF LIFE AND DEATH HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT?\"\n~FWISH~\nHe extended his arm toward the clone, and like some sort of shotgun, dozens of snake were sent toward it.\n\"=)\" but it just moved to the size to avoid the snakes, which all died once separated from the main body.\n[Symphony of Snakes] was a skill of course, but its form by itself could result in hundreds of different attacks Leader could send.\n~SMASH~\nLeader then smashed the ground using his snakes, and a massive crater was left there, almost completely breaking the floor.\n\"YOU WILL DIE TODAY!\"\n\"AURA SMASH, CRIMSON SPEARS,\" Stark and his clone yet again sent all of their attacks toward Leader, who used the now massive shield to block them all.\n~BOOM, CRACK, CRACK…~\nThe shield was now almost completely destroyed, but Leader was in such a frenzy state that he didn't even notice, too focused on eliminated the humans.\n[Snake Shield HP: 21921/500000]\n~STOMP, STOMP~\nIt looked like Leader didn't REALLY know how to control this form though, he was struggling to take a few steps, and all his attacks…\n~FWISH, VIOUM~\nNo matter how many he sent…\n\"Haha,\" even Stark laughed as Leader missed a 'Snake Shot' while he didn't move.\n~BOOM, AVOID~\nThey were just not hitting.\n\"Probably the skill he got at level 60…\" Stark could easily guess this, no one could be a pro at using a skill instantly after all, not even he was this good.\n\"SsssTOPPPPP THISsss BULLSsssHIIT!!!\" Leader was getting angrier.\nBut…\nStark and his clone had enough fun, as they instantly stopped laughing.\nThey looked at one another before nodding.\nAnd then…\n\"DOUBLE ASSAULT!\" they both activated their skill, rushing at Leader for the final push and then beginning to run around him at a crazy speed, leaving crimson trails behind them.\n[9 seconds remain for 'Double Assault']\n\"AURA SMASH!\" the first thing they did was for the clone to send all three of his fists toward the giant Leader.\nMeanwhile…\n\"AURA SMASH… MERGE!\" while that was happening, and while still running circles around the giant snake-man, Stark focused his aura in his right hand, combining all three fists into one.\n[8 seconds remain for 'Double Assault']\n\"SNAKE SHIELD,\" Leader, thinking he could easily deflect the attacks, activated his giant shield and got ready for impact.\nBut…\n~BOOM, CRACK… BOOOM!~\nWhen all three fists hit, the transparent shield that had been protecting him all this time suddenly exploded, with no way to get it back now as it would take at least 12 hours for him to be able to use it again since it was the cooldown for such a powerful defensive skill.\n\"YOU LITTLE…\" Leader realized too late that his shield had been broken, then he immediately tried to punch the clone with one of his 'snake arms', sending it at intense speed toward it.\nBut… this was exactly what they wanted.\n\"=)\" the clone kept smiling as it slowly pointed one of his fingers toward the other direction.\n\"…?\" Leader turned his small head in the direction the clone pointed, and he saw… a giant fist, half the size of his giant snake torso, rushing at him.\n\"AURA SMASH… MERGE!\" Stark had used the distraction from his clone as well as the destruction of the shield to use this attack himself.\nAnd it hit.\n~BOOOOM~\nIt hit Leader's torso, which was what Stark aimed for since the head was too small.\nAnd…\n\"-13382,\" this would usually be enough to kill, but [Symphony of Snakes] and [Ultimate Fusion] blocked damage really well even without a shield.\n[6 seconds remain for 'Double Assault']\nBut of course, both Stark and his clone knew of the possibility their plan wouldn't totally kill Leader, so they immediately looked at one another and in less than a fraction of a second created a second plan.\nBoth their minds were linked as if they were one, which was pretty obvious since the clone was made of Stark's aura.\n'ALRIGHT, LET'S DO THIS,' Stark pointed at Leader, a crimson mist still around him, it was the after effect of the merged crimson fist after being used while [Double Assault] is active.\nAnd so, taking advantage of that…\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS,\" both Stark sent the spears in Leader's directions while beginning to run in circles around the giant snake-man again.\n\"NO…!\" but as if sensing those attacks, Leader just swung his giant arms in the directions of the spears, destroying them all in the process as the snake took all the hits, so he received zero damage.\n\"Alright, I think we've had enough fun,\" Stark smirked.\n\"=)\" the clone also put one [Crystal Stun] potions in each of his hands.\nThis was their final plan: using those three potions to destroy Leader.\nHe only needed one or two more attacks to be defeated, that was true, and he honestly kind of looked defenseless right now since he was so panicked: nothing like this had ever happened before.\nHE was the one humiliating people, yet this time… he felt like HE was the one being toyed with by Stark and the clone.\nAnd the worst feeling of all… was that he also felt like he couldn't do anything about it, all he could try was to keep attacking and fight as long as he could.\nBut this time…\n\"=)\"\n\"…\"\nThey weren't playing anymore, so they just got ready to throw all the potions at Leader.\nStarting the final plan: Operation Stun-Chain!\n[4 seconds remain for 'Double Assault']\n[Finish him quick =)!]",

Or maybe… something else?\nIn the end, it didn't matter much.\n~BOOM~\nThe snakes, at least five times the size of the two humans (well just one to be honest), rushed at them both, ready to kill them in one strike.\nBut…\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" they both rolled away at the last second.\n[Perfect Dodge x2!]\nThey both got a perfect dodge, and it even showed it on the panel with the x2 sign.\n[In the case of a double 'Perfect Dodge', time moves much slower than before!]\nAnd just as expected, instead of being able to see Leader's body slowly go up after the attack, it was now so slow that the movements wouldn't be visible if you didn't REALLY focus on them.\nBut this also meant that Stark could get more time to think.\nWell… he didn't really need it tho since… operation 'Stun-Chain' was going exactly as expected, actually it was going even better.\n\"=)\" the clone now just stared at Stark, its expression so sadistic that even he could feel how some of the others felt when seeing it.\nIt just looked at Stark, after all it didn't have anything else to do: the plan now completely depended on what Stark did.\nAnd so… he decided to finish it.\n\"CRIMSON BALL TRANSMISSION,\" there was only a five minutes cooldown between each ball, so he already got it again and summoned it in hand.\n~FWISH~\nThe world retrieved its normal colors (since perfect dodge turns it to black and white), and time began to move normally again.\nBut instantly…\n~FWISH, THROW~\nStark threw the crimson ball perfectly, and [Focus] actually aided him as much as possible this time, even going as far as drawing the perfect line which he needed to throw the ball at.\nAnd so… he did it.\nThe crimson ball perfectly lobbed over Leader's body while he was still trying to throw attacks at Stark and his clone, which they all avoided even though it was becoming harder and harder to do so.\n\"WITH THIS…\" Stark's aura took over his entire body, hiding his figure by surrounding it by crimson aura, with only his eyes and mouth being white, making him look like his creepy clone, although his expression was totally serious, \"IT'S OVER!\"\n~SNAP~\nHe snapped his fingers when the ball was right behind Leader's head, and he already positioned himself to throw his potion from the location he was in.\n~FWISH~\nHe instantly teleported behind Leader, now able to see his small head from behind as it was normally mostly covered by the snakes and his giant body.\n\"Good fight,\" Stark acknowledge Leader's strength before the fight even ended, this was just how confident he was in his final attack, \"You were strong.\"\n~THROW~\nAs said before, he had already positioned himself to throw the potion, and so the exact moment he teleported, he was already in the position to throw the [Crystal Stun] potion, which he did immediately.\nAnd it hit Leader's head.\n~BOOM, CRACK~\n\"H-HUH?!\" Leader looked back to see Stark smiling while floating in midair, \"I GOT YOU NOW!\"\nHe moved his left arm and threw a massive fist that would surely kill and poison Stark if it hit.\nBut right at that moment…\n\"Huh… I… can't move my body?\" he couldn't move his fist, or any of his body parts at all in that regard, resulting in the attack not hitting Stark, who just fell to the ground and landed graciously.\n[Leader has been stunned!]\n\"DOMI-CHAIN!\" the final part of the plan was executed, and Stark threw the massive crimson chain around Leader's body while he was stunned, and all he could do was watch in horror as the chain wrapped itself around his legs, then his torso, then his arms… and after less than thirty seconds… his head.\n\"N-NO, PLEASE, NO STOP, I-\" Leader was now begging for mercy, something he had never given to any of his opponents, something he himself loved to hear from his enemies.\nAnd now… he was put in such a lowly position.\n\"Pathetic,\" Stark shook his head as Leader's entire body was taken over by the chain, his aura and life force being absorbed.\nAnd now that he couldn't do anything…\n[Leader was knocked out]\nThe [Ultimate Fusion] skill as well as the [Symphony of Snakes] both deactivated, resulting in both the giant snake body to disappear into thin air, but also his original one to transform back to its human form.\nAnd so Leader fell to the ground from that height, while his aura was deactivated.\n~CRASH, THUD~\nHe splashed onto the ground in a sickening thud.\n\"-99999!\"\nAnd so, just like that, Leader, the all-powerful sect-leader, died.\n********\nHey guys, Webnovel gave me some kind of reward since I've been uploading chapters for 2 months straight, and I can basically share it with you all:\nGo on your profile on the phone app, go down and click on redeem, then put this code: ABDHYUWR2G6WH5JYB\nThere are 10 uses and you get 10 fast passes that you can use on any novel (or mine lol) to be able to read for completely free :D!",

Stark was astonished by the sheer amount of experience he had gotten.\nWas killing a [Domination] user always this profitable? And if so… then wouldn't hunting other users be the best way to increase your level?\nStark shook his head, he couldn't let such desires take over him, after all, if he did that, then the [Superior Clone] would detect it and probably immediately go on a rampage.\nAnyway, killing Leader granted him the most amount of experience he had gotten at once, even more so than Soulayer and the Corrupted Ghoul.\nAnd this could only mean one thing…\n~DING, DING, DING~\nHe was surrounded by the golden aura thrice.\n[Your level has increased to level 50, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 51, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 52, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Experience: 702242/1348000]\nOf course, removing the fact that he had actually climbed up to level 50, Stark noticed that the amount of 'skill points' he was getting increased to three instead of two.\nWould they keep going by one every 25 or so levels? If yes then that's great!\n[Skill Points: 22 Available!]\nHe had more enough skill points to upgrade a bunch of his skills, that was great, but for now…\n~DING, DING, DING… DING~\nMany panels appeared around Stark, there were so many that he was actually surrounded by them, blocking his view.\n'Let's take it in order…' Stark smiled, \"Oh yeah, can you defend me?\" he asked the [Superior Clone] who just mischievously smiled as it positioned itself to fight whoever or whatever came in its view.\n'Alright… first of all…' he turned his eyes toward the first panel that had appeared.\nAnd it was…\n[Level 50 Reached: please pick a card!]\n'Heh, of course,' Stark nodded as the usual three cards appeared-…?\n'Huh?' Stark squinted his eyes, as if not understanding.\nThere weren't three cards displayed in front of him, but FIVE, each in a crimson color with two eyes staring at him, a visible vortex of darkness in them, that was the back of the card.\n\"Hey, clone, help me out!\" he asked his clone for aid as it just killed a [Dungeon Lizard], and it immediately rushed toward Stark, \"Please check the drawings behind the cards and tell me which is the best…\"\n\"=)!\" it nodded its head and went behind the five cards.\nAnd after a few seconds… it pointed at the one to the far right.\nStark immediately grabbed it, he actually fully trusted his clone since it had no reason to lie, even though it was insanely twisted and evil.\nAnd when he turned the card… he saw the drawing that always represented the skill: this time it was a pair of eyes with the text \"EGO\" written under them.\nYes, this was all.\n\"This is the skill you picked?\" although this was the first time text was written on one, it was weird his clone picked this one…\n\"=)\" the [Superior Clone] just shrugged as it pointed at a second card.\n\"…?\" weirdly enough, none of the cards disappeared when Stark picked one, usually they would evaporate instantly.\nAnd so…\n~FWISH~\nAll the cards turned at once, revealing that ALL of them had the same drawing.\nThe white eyes staring at Stark's soul, as well as the 'EGO' text was visible on all of them.\n'Does this mean… my choice didn't make a difference to begin with?' Stark wondered, this wasn't logical.\nOr maybe…\n\"Hey, clone, were the drawings different the last time?\" maybe his choice didn't matter to begin with, maybe whatever he picked, he would have gotten the same skill…?\nBut…\n\"=)\" the clone shook its head, meaning that the previous times, the two other drawings were completely different from the one he had picked.\n\"Phew…\" Stark sighed, it would have been pretty sad to know his choice, even though it was luck, didn't matter.\nAnd so he decided to immediately check out this skill, it was the first time five cards appeared, and also the first time each of them had the same skill behind…\nSo what could it possibly be…?\n[Rank: MYTHICAL]\n'…!' Stark's eyes widened, a [Mythical] skill all of a sudden?\nOf course, Leader also had his own mythical skill, but it was still fairly new for Stark to get something so powerful just like this, and coincidentally when he reached level 50…\nNo… it couldn't be a coincidence, maybe every [Domination] user would get a mythical skill once they reached level 50.\nIn the end, it didn't matter much, as he excitedly looked down to read the description.",

Is the user supposed to figure it out on his own, since they are way too overpowered? Or maybe it's only for Stark…?\nIn the end, it didn't really matter much, and so Stark moved to the next panel, maybe that EGO thing would increase later.\n'Alright…' he looked to his left, and the next panel was…\n[Congratulations, you have killed another player, thus completing the offer that had been given to you! WOOHOO!]\n[You have earned the 'MURDERER' title!]\n'…' Stark looked at those panels as they appeared with the blankest of expressions.\n[You now get your MAP back!]\nAnd the moment it said that, all the panel faded away, replaced by a giant one that looked like a map of the third sublevel.\nIt was a view from above, almost as if given by satellite, and Stark was marked by a small flashing red dot.\nEvery passageway, dead end, and turn was clearly marked on the map. But there was something else too – a golden arrow pointing towards the exit, marked by a blinking green dot.\nIt wasn't very far from his location, actually only five turns, and he would be there, yet it would have probably taken him hours if he didn't have that map now.\n'So useful…' he couldn't believe the others had that while he was stuck with himself, his clone, and his pure instinct alone to figure out where he needed to go.\n[As part of the offer, you also get TWO rewards from the 'Kill Perk' instead of one! Good job!]\n'Finally…'\n[Would you like to unlock your rewards now?]\n[Y/N?]\n'Yeah.'\n[Spin the wheels then, participant!]\nHe had already done it once before to get the [Revive Token], but this time, two giant wheels appeared before him, both had the weird demon horns on top of them, and their auras was overwhelming.\n\"…\"\n[Pull the tails!]\nJust like before, two demon tails emerged from beside the wheels, urging Stark to pull them both at the same time.\n'Killing Spree is unlocked…'\nWhen he first spun his wheel, that section was chained, but now that Leader was dead, it meant that only five participants remained: Kokoro, the white haired lady, Akira, Yuri, and himself.\nAnd so…\n[The 'Killing Spree' reward has been unlocked as promised, since only five participants remain!]\nIn retrospective, it would surely make you think: 10 people alive at the start, and now only 5.\nBut… Stark didn't care much about that.\n~GRAB, FWISH~\nHe grabbed both demon tails at the same time, then pulled them both, resulting in both wheels spinning at the same time.\n[Good luck!]\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWISH~\nThe wheels began to spin at intense speed, hovering over every perk available.\nStark saw the arrows point at the different perks available, all 10 of them were extremely good, but it was obvious some were better than others.\n~BIP, BIP~\nIt would make a rather pleasing sound after passing each section.\nAnd… after thirty seconds…\n~BIP… BIP... BIP…~\nIt began to gradually slow down, then both wheels suddenly stopped, landing on their respective rewards.\nAnd they were…\n[Reward: Key Location Map]\n[Reward: Killing Spree]\n\"Oh nice, so I got the 'Key Location Map' and 'Killing Spr-', WAIT WHAT?\"\nStark immediately looked onto the descriptions.\n[Key Location Map: You will receive a map that shows you which exact monster holds the key that will allow the group to head to the next level]\nHe already knew this one, but he couldn't deny this was probably one of the best rewards.\nAnd the second reward he had gotten, the best reward of them all… the one with only a 1/10 chance to get it after five people had died… was [Killing Spree].\n[Killing Spree: This reward charges up a destructive power that increases after each monster/enemy defeated, the more monsters killed, and the strongest they are, the more this attack's power increases, also note that the amount of monsters killed counts since the beginning of the trial!]\n'Doesn't even seem that good in comparison to [Revive Token] or some other ones, though…'\nBut as if to shut him up…\n[With enough monsters killed, you will be able to instantly kill the warden in one blow…]\n\"Oh,\" Stark was actually surprised, being able to defeat the final boss of this trial in one attack seemed impossible, but if even whatever was controlling all of it said it, then it must be true… it never lied after all.\n[Killing Spree: You have slain 64 monsters inside of this trial, the power of the perk is massive, but only use it when necessary!]\n'I guess that's all of it for now…' he didn't even need to put his rewards inside his [Spatial Inventory] since none of them were actually physical: [Key Location Map] just showed the dot of the monster which held the key, while killing spree only counted the monsters in a panel.\n'Next panel…' he moved his gaze to the right, and this time…\n[Survey: do you realize that your life is only ever going to be full of suffering and torture?]\n[Y/N]\n'Of course, already knew that,' he pressed on the Y option without hesitation, these survey questions were getting weirder and weirder, but for the second time, Stark couldn't shake off the feeling that these would be important later.\n[Thank you for the answer, see you later for the next survey =)]\n'Only two more panels,' Stark thought as he turned his head to the right for the hundredth time, probably.\n[You have reached level 50, you can now initiate the 'breakthrough' sequence to increase the skill level limit from 15 to 25 (Silver-Tier)!]\n[You need a \"Breakthrough Stone (Bronze-Tier)\" to ascend to Silver-Tier though!]\n'Oh yeah… that thing…' the first time it happened was during level 25, and it basically increased his skill level limit from 10 to 15, but this time it was from 15 to 25, making it much better.\nStark noted at the back of his head that he would need to buy a breakthrough stone (which were all pretty damn expensive) for later.\nAnd these were pretty much all the panels Stark had to go through, quite a big amount of them, but it was expected after reaching level 50!\n'…'\nLooks like it's time to go back out there, as he had his map, meaning he could easily find the exit.\n\"…\"\nNo…\n\"…\"\nSomething's missing…\n\"…\"\nAnd so as expected, once Stark turned his eyes again… he saw a giant panel, at least ten times his size, in front of him.\n[You have reached level 50, you already know what that means…]\nStark's heart raced with anticipation as he read those words.\n\"Class Wheel!\" he shouted, he didn't know why he did, but it just felt right.\nAnd so… the giant colorful wheel appeared, the same size of the panel that was previously there.\n[8 classes available, spin the wheel!]\n[Pull me!]\nStark didn't want to waste a single second, so he immediately reached for the also now giant lever that was beside the wheel and used his two hands to pull it down.\nYet again… the wheel began to spin, announcing that Stark's fate would yet again change, for better… or for worse.",

Stark's eyes gradually widened.\n[So… why not absorb it… comrade =)?]\n'What do you mean-'\n[Domination is currently absorbing the 'Exorcist' class…]\n[Do not resist it, it is a process that will make US stronger]\n'THIS IS… WHAT?' Stark was actually astonished, he couldn't understand anything that was happening.\nAbsorbing the [Exorcist] class since it isn't convenient? Doesn't that mean that [Domination] would basically become much stronger by absorbing the powers of the [Exorcist] class? And if so, then would he get skills related to it…?\nStark's pupils were shaking, the uncomfortable feeling wasn't leaving, it was just increasing by the second, slowly turning into dread at the face of the unknown.\n\"=)\" the clone just stood there though, it looked like it already knew what was about to happen.\nBut after yet another minute…\n[100/100]\n[Absorption complete!]\n[The 'Domination' class has absorbed the 'Exorcist' class, thus inheriting its aura and powers!]\n[Basically… Exorcist has become part of Domination, it didn't disappear, it is still with us, but we just made it so that it is easier to use…]\nAnd with this information out of the way, all the panels disappeared, and no matter how much Stark waited, no more appeared: this was everything.\n'STATUS WINDOW,' he shouted in his mind.\n…\n[Level:] 52\n[Health:] 6300/24900\n[Bloodline:] Human\n[Classes:] Domination; Alchemist; Exorcist (Absorbed by Domination).\n[Note: A class that is absorbed by Domination doesn't disappear, it just becomes part of Domination as a whole, meaning you can still use its powers, but they become much stronger as Domination enhances them!]\n[Talent:] Chosen one\n[Attributes:] Strength 3392; Speed 4149; Mind/Soul 3987; Stamina 3590; Defense 3493\n[Skills:] Spatial Inventory; Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv15; Focus lv15; Aura Smash lv10; Clone Frenzy lv15; Invincible Dodge lv5; Double Assault lv5; Crimson Spears lv1; Heaven's Wrath lv5; Alchemist lv3; Potion Crafting lv3; Target Manipulation lv1; Dodge Control lv1; Crimson Ball Transmission lv1; EGO lv1 (Mythical)…\n…\nExorcist was still showing, but beside it was a small text saying that it was already absorbed by Domination.\n[As Exorcist has been absorbed, you have been granted one skill!]\n'…?' Stark didn't even have the time to think that it appeared before him.\n…\n[Skill: Crimson Purification]\n[Tier: Legendary]\n[Description: A divine ability that eradicates evil and impurities from the surrounding area, dealing massive damage to demonic and cursed enemies while increasing the Holy aura, making you stronger against these types of foes. However, it has no effect on other types of enemies.]\n[Note: 10 minutes cooldown between each use]\n…\nEverything was going so fast: he got his new class, but apparently it would be useless under normal circumstances, so Domination had absorbed it to make it more powerful, and now he got a skill that merged both [Domination] and [Exorcist] into one…?\nAt first, it didn't seem to make much sense: the Exorcist class was primarily used against demons, so people who had it were mainly dispatched to rifts where these beings resided, however, now that it had been absorbed by Domination, the holy aura and attacks would be strong even against regular enemies, or at least that is what he thought.\n[Domination X Exorcist is now active, have fun!]\n'Oh well… I'll just think about it later…' he turned his gaze toward his clone, and immediately, his eyes widened.\nUsually, the [Superior Clone] would only be made out of crimson aura, only its eyes and mouth made out of white one, but now…\n\"=)\" there were now some strands of golden aura in the body of the clone, and its eyes had reversed crimson crosses in them, shining with red aura.\nBasically… it finally hit Stark that Exorcist had actually merged with Domination.\nAnd the most interesting of all… was that his aura had also changed, the golden strands visible in it too, making it much more 'holy'.\n[You can spin the 'Class Wheel' again at level 75]\n\"That's incredible,\" Stark smiled, \"But I need to move, so the last thing I need to do is just… use my skill points.\"\nAnd so Stark opened his skill panel again, he had 22 skill points available, and he would make sure to use them well.\nDid all of this make sense to him? Would it even matter in the future?\nFrankly, Stark didn't know, and all he could see in his field of view was the giant smile of the now [Holy Superior Clone], much more sadistic than before, as if absorbing [Exorcist] made it more evil than before (although it should be the opposite).\n'Sigh… I don't know, let's just get this over with,' and so he picked the skills he wanted to upgrade.",

awaited them at the following floors, and there was no saying if he would need to fight someone else: they only went up two floors, yet five of them had died.\nAt this rate… only 2… no… only 1 person would live to see the warden.\n…\n[Skills:] Spatial Inventory; Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv15; Focus lv15; Aura Smash lv10; Clone Frenzy lv15; Invincible Dodge lv5; Double Assault lv5; Crimson Spears lv1; Heaven's Wrath lv5; Alchemist lv3; Potion Crafting lv3; Target Manipulation lv1; Dodge Control lv1; Crimson Ball Transmission lv1; EGO lv1; Crimson Purification lv1\n…\nThese were all the skills he had, and to be honest there was starting to be a huge amount of them.\nIf he got too many, he would surely abandon some of these skills to use stronger ones, which was what other people must do, as it is impossible to take every skill into account in a battle.\nSomehow… for some strange reason… Stark didn't like it, but he shouldn't be bothered by it for now, so he quickly moved on.\n'Hm…' although he wanted to do it fast, he also wanted to choose wisely, rushing and picking a bad skill in this situation to upgrade was like asking for death.\nAnd so after two minutes of deep thinking…\n\"Alright, got it all,\" he selected all the skills he wanted and assign the amount of skill points to them.\n[You have upgraded 'Invincible Dodge' to level 10!]\n[You have upgraded 'Double Assault' to level 10!]\n[You have upgraded 'Dodge Control' to level 5!]\n[You have upgraded 'Alchemist' to level 5!]\n[You have upgraded 'EGO' to level 5!]\nStark decided to go for the safe options this time, as these were all skills he was guaranteed to use, except for [EGO] but it was a mythical skill so it would be dumb not to upgrade it, as well as [Alchemist] since he had two skill points left, and it was at level 3, so why not.\nAnd of course, upgrading 5 skills to their threshold could only mean one thing… PERKS!\n~DING, DING, DING, DING, DING~\nFive panels surrounded Stark, and he began reading them to assimilate the new perks he was getting, it was always good to know even if you couldn't test them out after all.\n…\n[Skill: Invincible Dodge lv10]\n[New Perk: Combo Dodge]\n[Description:] If many attacks are coming your way, you are able to continuously dodge them in opposition to being able to only dodge once, the limit is 10 dodges currently though.\n[Note:] Basically, if someone attacks you 10 times, then as long as it is continuous within a short time, then you will be able to avoid all the attacks by fazing through them (as long as you have the right timing of course)\nIf you do dodge an attack and no attack comes after a second, then the [Invincible Dodge] combo will be considered over, and you will have to wait a minute to use the skill again, as per usual.\n…\n'Interesting… so I can dodge 10 attacks one after another as long as there is less than 1 second between each of them…' Stark was already happy as this meant being able to avoid many attacks at once, it almost fucked him up many times before after all, 'Next…'\n…\n[Skill: Double Assault lv10]\n[New Perk: Increased Usage]\n[Description:] You can use Double Assault for 20 seconds instead of 10, that's all.\n…\n'Fair,' Stark shrugged, it was incredibly good, and there was nothing much to say about it either, so he just moved on.\n…\n[Skill: Dodge Control lv5]\n[New Perk: Semi-Control]\n[Description:] When you activate this skill, your aura completely takes over your body, thus meaning you cannot control it whenever it is dodging, but thanks to this perk, you have regained a bit of control while dodging, meaning that by trying hard enough, you can dodge all attacks while also lending some good hits (you still can't use any other skill while Dodge Control is active though…)\n…\n'I do remember the feeling of not controlling my body, and the fact I can't use skills while it is active sure is annoying, but hopefully it will slowly and slowly give me back the control, so I can do everything while dodging…' Stark nodded in approval, and his clone kept smiling, it seemed joyful the more perks it was getting… wait no, not it, but Stark… obviously, right?\n\"=)\"\n…\n[Skill: Alchemist lv5]\n[New Perk: None]\n[Description:] You can just craft potions that require this skill level, that's all.\n…\nThis skill was completely passive and mostly for potion crafting, so it was completely normal.\nThus… Stark moved to the last skill, the one he had been waiting for the most: EGO, the mythical skill.\n…\n[Skill: EGO]\n[New Perk: EGO EGO]\n[Description: Your ego is… never mind, just keep increasing it]\n[EGO Meter: 0]\n…\n\"…\" Stark was hesitating between calling it a scam or something great that he would surely discover later, but as expected, he got no information on this skill, it was so bad even the description of the skill itself looked like it hesitated to tell him, \"Oh well,\" he just shrugged.\nWith that out of the way, he had done everything that needed to be done concerning the fact he reached level 50, and he felt great about it: new class (although it was absorbed by Domination), new skills, new perks, all in all it was good.\n'Alright, need to reach the second sublevel now,' Stark opened up his mouth and began to follow it, rapidly turning over the corners and checking where the red dot (him) was compared to where the green one (the exit) was.\nAnd so after less than three minutes… he arrived in front of a silver door that was already opened.\n'Quick, quick,' he didn't waste time and began to climb the spiral of stairs that would lead him to the second sublevel.\nAnd so after a minute, he could see the entrance of the floor, the silver door in front of him already opened, but impossible to see inside because of the light beyond it.\n\"Everyone must be already far inside the second sublevel's maze, let's just go,\" he began to calmly walk toward the door, his expression as neutral as ever before, while his clone was still behind, the big smile on its face still there, but they had one thing in common: both surrounded by a powerful crimson aura, now enhanced by the specks and strands of golden and holy aura from the exorcist class.\nIt was truly only the beginning, and he was ready to explore that floor while hopefully not meeting anybody.\nBut… unbeknownst to Stark… all the other participants were waiting for him beyond that door.\n\"=)\"",

      "content": "\"Seriously, for how much longer do we have to wait?\" Yuri sighed, \"We would have probably found the key already by now…\"\nKokoro taped letters on her tablet, and after a few seconds a blue panel appeared, displaying what she wrote, \"Risking our lives for no reason is useless, even more so now that we are only six,\" at this point, Leader hadn't died, him and Stark were still fighting.\n\"…\" the white-haired lady kept inspecting her slender hands, unbothered by the presence of the others.\n\"Come on, people,\" Akira clapped his hands as he smiled, \"I already told you, but I got the [Instant Use Key] from killing one of the other ANNOYING players… so all you need to do is wait for everyone to enter this level so that we can head toward the final one together…\"\nAs Akira said, he had been the first to enter this sublevel, and so whenever someone went up the flight of stairs, he would show them the key and advise them to stay here, in exchange he promised that he would open the door to the next sublevel once everyone reached this floor.\nHe even went as far as showing his second item, which was the [Healing Spring], to prove that he wasn't trying to ambush them all then use his perk item to kill them all.\nAnd in the end, surprisingly, all of them sat down beside the entrance of the second sublevel, just waiting for the final participants that were still down to show up.\nBut after less than five minutes…\n[A participant has been slain by another player!]\n\"…!\"\nThe four people that had been previously silent read the message and figured out why it had taken the other people so long to come here.\n\"They were busy fighting, huh,\" Yuri shrugged, \"I guess only five of us left…\"\n\"Hm…\" Akira scratched his chin, \"But I do have a question now…\"\n\"What is it?\" a blue panel appeared above Kokoro's tablet.\n\"I mean… if only five of us remain, and there are four of us here, it means that only one person among Chosen, Officer and Leader survived, right?\" Akira had a big smile on his face as he revealed that fact to the others.\nAnd it was undeniably true: all those alive were obviously present, and the only other three they knew were still alive were those three he cited.\nWhich meant… one among them was a monster that had essentially killed another monster, or one monster that killed two people: people who kill must be truly confident in their strength, and so if someone killed another participant, it would undeniably mean that they are strong, enough to be called a monster at least.\n\"I don't wanna seem biased, but Leader probably killed Chosen, then killed Officer, it seems the most logical since he is the strongest among them,\" Akira shrugged, it was completely logical thinking, Officer didn't seem that strong with his guns, especially against a legitimate sect-leader with no mercy in his eyes, and Stark… well… wasn't he the weakest among them all?\n\"What if Leader killed someone, then got killed by the other one?\" Yuri proposed.\n~TAP, TAP, TAP~\nKokoro's expression became more serious as she mercilessly taped words on her tablet, her eyes darting everywhere as if she was analyzing something.\nAnd so…\n\"Impossible, I have already analyzed all three of them, and by far there is no chance Leader would die to any of them, Chosen was probably the first to die, then Officer followed!\" Kokoro had a skill called [Tablet Analysis], allowing her to analyse things at incredible speed, and most times her predictions were right, making her someone incredibly useful in terms of gathering information.\nAnd so with that, everyone nodded: they were already ready to see Leader come out of the door, his usual neutral expression visible on his face.\n\"How are you so sure?\" Yuri asked, he had a feeling this was wrong.\n~TAP, TAP~\n\"As I said, I gathered information about their powers, we obviously saw Chosen fighting, and as for Leader… well… I knew about him from real life,\" Kokoro revealed as she continued taping, \"He is a powerful sect-leader, feared by thousands of people, and I know about some of his skills, but one thing is for sure: they are terrifyingly powerful, so it isn't likely he would die to Chosen based on the skills he showed to us!\"\n\"Interesting,\" Akira nodded.\n\"…\" the white haired lady was looking at Kokoro.\nAnd to add to that… Kokoro continued taping and gave her final statement.\n\"There is a 0.4% chance that Chosen won against Leader, that is all I know, so Leader definitely won,\" Kokoro sighed, it was her skill that told her everything, but she truly believed in its analysis powers.\nBut… she continued taping regardless.\n\"But…\" Kokoro's expression darkened, \"If by some miracle, the person we see coming out of this door is Chosen… then… please be wary of him.\"\nHer aura sent chills down the spine of them all, even the white-haired lady, although none showed it on their faces.\n\"Let's just wait for Leader then, doesn't matter if he killed two people as long as he doesn't try it on us,\" Akira shrugged, seemingly ready to kill the sect-leader if he tried anything.\nWith those words, it seemed everyone had already considered the fact Chosen and Officer died to be the truth.\nEveryone except… for the white haired woman, who knew that something was up.\nAnd so… after around ten minutes…\n~THUMP, THUMP~\nThey heard noise coming from the beyond the darkness of the door, precisely the sound of someone climbing up the stairs.\n\"It's him,\" Akira sighed.\n\"Fucking finally,\" Yuri rolled his eyes.\n~THUMP, THUMP~\nThe sound of footsteps in the hallway leading to the door were heard getting closer and closer.\nAnd once the sole survivor of the 'Sublevel 3 Incident' appeared…\n\"Leader, finally you are here, dear friend!\" Akira laughed while pointing the key toward the door to show it to him.\nBut…\n\"Leader…?\" Stark smiled as he looked at the four people sitting around the entrance, \"I'm sorry, but you won't be able to find him anytime soon.\"\nAll participants had faces full of disbelief and shock, except for the white-haired lady who actually let a small smirk once seeing Stark emerge from the entrance.\n\"What are you all doing here?\" he asked, acting as if nothing was wrong.\n\"You… are… alive?\" Akira asked, he was the first to be surprised: Leader was powerful, just like Kokoro said, and he TRULY expected him to be the one to emerge victorious.\nAnd yet… Stark won?\n\"If by some miracle, the person we see coming out of this door is Chosen… then… please be wary of him,\" the last words Kokoro said rang in the ears of everyone as they looked at the boy.\n\"So… Leader and Officer are…?\" Yuri hinted, trying to get the answer out of Stark.\n\"Yeah, dead, Leader killed Officer then he tried to kill me,\" Stark shrugged, he didn't really care to reveal anything as it was already pretty damn obvious he was the one who killed if he was the last person to come out of the third sublevel, \"And of course, the moment he tried to kill me… I just HAD to end his life, didn't I =),\" Stark smiled as coldly as his clone.\nAnd with that… all people present realized two things: Stark hid most of his skills from them during the fight against Soulayer, yet still won, and… he was an extremely dangerous person.\n\"Well, anyway,\" Akira retrieved his composure, \"I got an [Instant Use Key] as a reward and plan to use it on this level.\"\n\"That's good, then let's get going,\" Stark began to head in a random direction, of course he planned to take the exit, but not with any of these people as it would be too dangerous.",

Oh!\" he immediately understood what he meant, and so he smiled.\nFor some reason, the [Superior Clone] didn't follow closely behind him, maybe since it knew itself that its presence could result in chaos among the participants?\n'Just come,' he ordered the clone, and suddenly…\n~FWISH~\nIt emerged from the other side of the door.\nAnd the moment it did…\n~FWISH, VIOUM, KWICH~\nEvery participant activated their powers, especially Akira who had never seen it before.\nThe clone's aura was now even more overwhelming than before, the small strands of golden aura from [Exorcist] somehow enhanced it and making it even more powerful.\nAnd… the clone's body was also extremely beautiful, it was glowing, and although it was completely made out of crimson aura, the small specks of holy aura made it as if there were hundreds of stars in it.\n\"=)\" Yet that chilling and cold smile never went out.\n~THUMP, THUMP~\nAll participants were cautious around the clone, it was quite the scary thing even for them.\nMeanwhile, the [Superior Clone] just looked around before dashing toward Stark, arriving beside the original in less than a second.\n\"We'll be leaving, see you at the exit,\" he spoke as he turned the corner with his clone.\n\"What the fuck was that thing…?\" Akira's pupils were still shaking a bit.\n\"We don't know, but I think I understand why Kokoro said we need to be wary of him…\" Yuri added, he was biting his thumb's nails, \"Anyway, I'm out of here,\" and he disappeared out of the thin air, leaving star particles behind as he also headed toward the exit.\n~TAP, TAP~\n\"See you later,\" Kokoro taped a button on her tablet, and a blue light emerged from it, taking over her body like some sort of shield, \"I hope to see you all alive later.\"\n~FWISH~\nShe began to float in the air thanks to that blue light then headed toward a direction the others didn't take.\n\"Just us two now, heh~\" Akira smiled as the beautiful white haired woman, who didn't even acknowledge his presence, \"Well, we'll meet at the exit again anyway,\" and so he took yet another hallway.\nThere were at least seven different halls to take from the entrance, so pretty easy to take different paths as to not meet one another.\n\"…\" the white-haired woman didn't move for another minute, instead looking at the ground, her eyes clearly thinking about something else, \"Stark Heartsouls…\" she mumbled as she finally got up and took another path as well.\n***\nBack to Stark, he was walking beside his clone, the two just looking ahead, while the latter obviously kept smiling.\nAnd at the very moment everyone separated… new panels appeared before him.\n[5 participants alive!]\n[Welcome to the Second Sublevel: The Undead Realm]\nStark looked around, he hadn't really taken his surroundings into account, but the halls were filled with eerie purple mist that seemed to twist and coil around the walls like ghostly tendrils, and the air was heavy with the scent of decay and the sound of distant whispers echoed through the corridors.\nThere were some torches made out of human bones, and a blue fire coming out of them, giving the small amount of light needed to be able to see, plus the walls and floor were made out of sturdy black stones, a linear granite line in the middle of each of them.\n\"Just go to the exit…\" he mumbled to himself as he continued following the map.\nBut of course… that wasn't all the panels, there was ONE missing, wasn't there…\nAnd it was…\n[New Perk!]\n'Oh boy…'\n[Introducing the 'Private Duel' perk!]\n[It is too difficult to find another participant and kill them safely while avoiding suspicion from the others, so this perk allows you to ask for a duel with another player, and as long as they accept, you will be both put into a giant arena, away from all players and monsters, guaranteeing a fair fight!]\n[Use the 'DUEL' panel to request a duel with another player, note that the duel will NOT start until both parties agree!]\n[Note: when receiving a duel request, the person who requests the duel will be anonymous!]\nAnd before he could even register what all of this was about…\n[You have received a \"DUEL REQUEST\" from \"ANONYMOUS PLAYER\"!]\n[Do you want to accept the duel request?]\n[Y/N]\n\"…\" someone, as soon as they saw that new perk, probably immediately sent invitations to everyone, 'Fuck that shit,' Stark didn't click neither on Y nor N, he just minimized the panel.\nStark had already a pretty giant idea of who it could be: either Yuri, the guy trying to look innocent, or Akira, who didn't hide his intentions to kill for rewards.\n\"=)\" the clone just kept smiling, the smile on its face telling Stark it was the right thing to do, as wasting time on pointless battles wouldn't do him any good.\nAnd so just like that, Stark continued to walk through the purple mist, trying not to bump into walls or anything of the sort since it was pretty hard to see ahead, even with the map as it didn't specifically show exactly where the turn was.\n[Watch out!]\nBut after five minutes of nothing happening, Stark's [Focus] skill warned him, and…\n~BIM, BIM, BIM~\nAll the eyes of the skull torches in the hall he was in lit up with a blue aura, and…\n~CRUMBLE, GROWA~\nFrom the ground below emerged dozens of undead monsters, surrounding Stark completely.\n'I mean, I can just avoid them all and rush, but it would be annoying as I don't know where the walls are because of the mist, plus… it's just free experience points, isn't it =)?' Stark positioned himself as he began smiling.\n\"GROAOR!\"\n\"Klklkl…\"\n\"Ooooou…\"\nHe heard many different noises coming from around him, but he couldn't see the monsters clearly.\n\"Alright, let's just get this over with,\" he waited for them to approach him first as to not make a fatal mistake.\nIt wouldn't be long until he would reach the exit of this floor anyway, so might as well take advantage of that and discover which monsters were in the 'Undead Realm', right? As it would be his only ever fight in this sublevel.",

The mist twisted and turned around them, creating a surreal and ominous atmosphere in the corridor.\nAnd when they got close enough… Stark was able to see all the undead monsters: skeletons with rusted armor and jagged swords, ghouls with decaying flesh and glowing red eyes, ghosts with pale figures, their mouths open as if ready to suck Stark's soul, and even a massive zombie with rotting limbs dragging behind it.\nThey moved in a slow but coordinated manner, their intention clear as they advanced towards Stark.\n\"GROAOR!\"\n\"Klklkl…\"\n\"Ooooou…\"\nThey were taking slow steps, but the more they approached, the more Stark could see their disgusting bodies and faces.\nAnd also… he noticed just how many of them there were.\nFrom the ground, ceiling, walls, from all around Stark, there were at least fifty of those monsters.\nOf course, their sheer number meant that they weren't even that strong, thus giving less EXP per monster, but it didn't matter since it would be really easy to be overwhelmed.\n\"Perception!\"\n…\n[Name: Skeleton Warrior]\n[Level: 90]\n[HP: 50000]\n[Skills: Critical Strike, Bone Shatter, Shield Bash, Skeletal Body, Undead…]\n…\n[Name: Undead Ghoul]\n[Level: 93]\n[HP: 70000]\n[Skills: Feast of Flesh, Decay Aura, Shadow Crawl, Fly, Undead…]\n…\n[Name: Trial Ghost]\n[Level: 92]\n[HP: 58000]\n[Skills: Ghostly Wail, Soul Drain, Phantasmal Form, Ethereal Touch, Undead…]\n…\nNone of these monsters were truly strong, one attack from Stark probably enough to destroy them all, plus they didn't have that many skills compared to other monsters in the trial.\nWhich meant that it was truly all about the numbers, and while Stark analyzed them, a dozen more monsters appeared, their numbers rising after each second.\nThere was a single monster stood out from the rest though: the giant zombie.\n…\n[Name: Undead Elite Zombie (ELITE)]\n[Level: 110]\n[HP: 400000]\n[Strength: 4873]\n[Stamina: 7281]\n[Speed: 1492]\n[Defense: 3910]\n[Skills: Raging Smash, Corpse Explosion, Decay, Flesh Feast, Diseased Bite, Undead Control (MYTHICAL), Rotting Grasp, Undead Regeneration, Hulking Presence, The Ultimate Zombie…]\n…\nNot only was this zombie the bigger out of them, easily towering over Stark and being almost as big as the [Elite Guard] from the fourth sublevel, but it was also the strongest monster Stark encountered yet, even more so than the other elite.\nHis stamina was extremely high for some reason, while the rest of his stats were still good, but still below those of the other elite guard.\nAll in all… this monster was powerful.\nThe Undead Elite Zombie's skin was a sickly green, with patches of flesh hanging loose from its body. One of its eyes was missing, leaving only a hollow socket that seemed to glare at Stark with malevolent intent. Its jaw hung agape, revealing rows of jagged, broken teeth that dripped with black ichor.\nIt didn't have any kind of weapon, just its bare hands slowly advancing toward Stark, carrying a bunch of corpses that were put together likes chains, it was a disgusting sight.\n\"GROAOROA~\" it roared, but by its tone, it didn't seem like it was talking to Stark… but to the monsters?\nAnd as expected, the moment the elite roared, the monsters suddenly stopped in their slow rush, completely surrounding Stark.\n\"…\"\n\"=)\"\nBut… Stark wasn't scared, and neither was his clone.\nWhy, you might ask? Why would Stark not be at least worried of dying by those monsters and maybe even turning into of them, even though there were at least 80 of them around him now?\nWas it because he could revive himself twice? Or because he truly believed he could come out on top against all the odds?\nWell… no… the real answer was… [Crimson Purification]!\nIt was the basic legendary skill he got from [Domination] absorbing [Exorcist] and merging them both into one.\nBut… wasn't this sublevel called the [Undead Realm], and weren't all those enemies somewhat related to undead beings…?\nIf that is the case… then… isn't [Exorcist] in its perfect element?\nAnd so… without wasting time, Stark's aura grew as he kept smiling: none of these monsters could put a dent on him.\n\"…?\" the zombie was the controlling all the monsters tilted its ugly head, confused as to why the human was so vividly smiling.\nBut after a few seconds, it decided that it was over and that they should get rid of him quickly.\nAnd so…\n\"GROAORK!\" he roared again, and all the monsters suddenly rushed at Stark, leaving their slow approach from before and now actually running.\nBut… this was futile.\n\"CRIMSON PURIFICATION!\" Stark shouted.\n[Description: A divine ability that eradicates evil and impurities from the surrounding area, dealing massive damage to demonic and cursed enemies while increasing the Holy aura, making you stronger against these types of foes. However, it has no effect on other types of enemies.]\nA blinding light erupted from Stark's body, enveloping the entire corridor in a radiant glow. The undead monsters screeched and wailed as they were consumed by the purifying flames, their forms disintegrating into ash before vanishing completely.\nThis skill was extremely powerful against undead, able to weaken those that are very strong, but completely annihilate the ones too weak to tank the power of the holy aura.\nAnd so just like that, EVERY monster beside the elite zombie disappeared, the floor of the hallway now filled with deep gray ashes, which were previously the monsters that wanted to eliminate him.\n\"Gro…arork…\" even the giant zombie seemed to have been weakened, forced to get on its knees as a small part of its head had evaporated from the holy aura.\n\"-173819!\" this was the damage it had received from this attack, completely destroying its control over the monsters as it had lost all its minions because of the holy aura coming out of Stark's body.\n\"I feel like a true saint now,\" Stark smiled as he took a step toward the giant zombie.\n\"Gr…\" the zombie looked down on the floor, its expression darkening as it saw the ashes of its comrades/minions, and then… \"GROOAKRK~\"\nIt suddenly got up again, retrieving its full form, and although its now half-destroyed face wasn't restored, it did make it much creepier than before as its sole yellow pupil looked at the human who dared to attack it like this.\n\"GROAOOOOROA~\" it roared again, also taking a giant step toward Stark, making the ground around him shake.\nAnd so just like that, Stark was forced to fight another elite monster even though he just wanted to reach the exit.\nBut… this was an opportunity to test out [Exorcist] while also getting stronger, so why the fuck not?\n\"COME AT ME, ZOMBIE,\" Stark didn't back down as he saw the zombie rush at him.",

The zombie let out a guttural scream as its decaying flesh began to disintegrate rapidly, unable to withstand the purifying power of the skill.\nAfter all, if Stark could use a skill, then his clone could too, which meant that he could use [Crimson Purification] twice.\nSmoke was coming out of the elite zombie's flesh as it was affected by the holy aura coming out from the clone's body.\n\"-142719!\" although it was weaker than Stark's attack, it wasn't even that far in comparison.\nAnd so the zombie elite fell to the ground again, it wasn't dead or anything, but just too weak to even move as it just lay there.\n\"Gr…o…a..krz…\"\n\"Damn, undead monsters really are nothing now,\" Stark was astonished: the skill worked way better than he ever thought it would, able to take down dozens if not hundreds of undead instantly if they were within the range of the holy aura, \"Well, let's just kill this guy!\"\n\"DOMI-CHAIN RESTRAIN,\" he summoned the chain in his hands and threw it toward the zombie, its face and body facing the cold ground.\nBut…\n~GRAB~\nThe zombie moved its arm at the last second to block the chain, then used his other one to break it in half…\n\"Groa…k…\" it began to get up for the second time, its spirit hadn't left it yet (well yes it did, but you know), \"GROAOROAK~\" and after a few seconds, the elite zombie was back up again.\nIt had lost one of its arms, its leg had a chunk of it, and overall its body was in worse condition than before, even though it was already bad at the start.\n[Elite Zombie HP: 83462/400000]\nIt had already lost three fourths of its life from the two [Crimson Purification] skills, and even though it was back up and seemed to roar in anger, it was apparent that its movements were weak.\nBut…\n\"UNDEAD REGENERATION!\" suddenly, the zombie activated one of its legendary skills.\nThe ash that was scattered all over the hallway began to float in the air, then after a few seconds, it started heading toward the elite, precisely in the spots where it was damaged: its legs, and head.\nIt couldn't retrieve its arm since it was already detached from its body, but…\n\"+175000!\" it got back a lot of its health, plus the ash of the other monsters had actually managed to heal its leg and the part of its head that had been destroyed, meaning that except for its lost arm and some small destroyed pieces of flesh, it had mostly recovered its previous form.\n\"…\" Stark didn't even seem bothered by this: it had lost an arm, so it was still much weaker, and even the zombie should know it, as it didn't retrieve its complete confidence even with that much.\n~STEP, STEP, THUMP!~\nYet again the giant zombie began rushing ( slowly as its speed stat was low) toward Stark.\nIts movements were weak, its body was scarred from the damages, but it was still coming for him.\n\"DISEASED BITE…\" the giant zombie jumped at Stark, its gaping mouth opened to swallow him whole.\n…\n[Skill: Diseased Bite]\n[Description: A massive bite that will surely kill, but the special power of this skill is that those swallowed or bitten by the zombie will also transform into one of them, now under the control of the elite forever…]\n…\n\"GOAIRAKK~\" the zombie's mouth was now right in front of Stark as he was ready to bite him.\nBut…\n\"AURA SMASH… MERGE,\" Stark's [Superior Clone] was already ready for this, and so Stark didn't even bother moving out of the way.\nThe clone had immediately begun charging up the fist the moment it saw the zombie lying down, and although it didn't expect for it to get back up, it didn't matter much since the attack had already been ready.\nAnd so…\n~FWISH, VIOUM~\nThe clone sent the giant fist, two times the size of the zombie's head, toward it.\n~BOOOOM~\nAs it was currently jumping horizontally to eat Stark, the fist hit it straight on, breaking some of its already destroyed teeth and smashing its head in more than before.\n\"GROAKFKQ~\" it couldn't even reach Stark that it was sent away in the opposite direction, crashing against the wall at the very end of the hallway.\n\"-113928!\" the damage was very good, able to damage the zombie's corpse even more so than it already was.\nOh, and as for the reason why [Crimson Purification] did just a littlez more damage than this attack against an undead was because although that skill was extremely strong against undead beings, it didn't specifically mean that it could massive damage.\nBasically, its main power was to \"WEAKEN\" an enemy, and this is exactly what it did.\n\"Groaoro~\" and this is the reason why damage doesn't matter in such a situation as although the fist hit him for 100k points of damage, the zombie still got up, clearly less damaged by this than by the holy aura.\nAnd just like that, Stark could truly understand why an [Exorcist] was so powerful against these beings.\n[Enemy stunned!]\n\"Well, it's our win,\" Stark smiled as he looked at its clone, and it nodded.\n\"DOMI-CHAIN RESTRAIN,\" the clone sent another crimson chain toward the elite, and this time it couldn't do anything but watch as the chain put itself around its legs, slowly but surely taking over its stomach, chest, arms, then head in that order.\nAnd after a few more seconds…\n[Elite Zombie is now unconscious!]\nThe chain has successfully absorbed all its force, knocking it out in the process.\nTo be honest, seeing it in that sorry state, Stark REALLY wanted to wait another ten minutes for [Crimson Purification] to be usable again so that he can torture it more, but… he didn't really want to wait all this time, so he just decided to end its life.\nMuch like the [Sublevel 4 Elite Guard], this elite died so quickly that it couldn't even use most of its skills: Stark got rid of its minions immediately, then destroyed its body right afterward, making it harder for it to use skills, and then he knocked it out before it could even attack.\nIt was a magnificent victory for him in that regard as other classifiers always say that killing a monster before it could even act was something.\n\"Aura Smash… MERGE!\" he focused his power in his right hand, and after ten seconds summoned the giant fist, much more powerful than his clone since he was original, sending it toward the unconscious giant zombie.\nAnd so…\n~FWISH, BOOOOM~\n\"-163748!\"\nAnd just like that…\n[Undead Elite Zombie HP: 0/400000]\n[You have defeated the 'Undead Elite Zombie lv110'!]\nHe was able to defeat that elite extremely easily, like… it was ALMOST too easy.\n\"…\" Stark had a neutral expression on his face as he saw the corpse of the zombie, as well as the ashes around him.\nWas he getting too strong for even the monsters supposed to be at his level…? Or maybe it was just a convenient battle for him since he had all the right skills?\nHe didn't know, but it was good he could finally get this over with so that he can reach the exit.",

Stark never believed in the \"it's just my imagination\" thing, so he carefully walked toward the monster, with the sole intent of turning around the corner and leaving this hall.\n~STEP, STEP~\nStark and his clone got closer to the massive zombie.\n'Oh well, looks like everything was fine,' and they were able to pass the zombie, now on the verge of turning around the corner, which meant they were closer to it than ever before.\nAnd right at that moment...\n\"CORPSE EXPLOSION, ACTIVATED!\"\nThe zombie's body began to glow with a terrifying crimson aura, almost as if it was... about to explode?\n'Fucking knew it,' Stark looked at the glowing zombie for a single second before dashing inside the hallway.\nBut... [Corpse Explosion] was almost instantaneous, so there was no way to truly escape it from there.\nAnd so...\n~BOOOOOOOM~\nThe corpse of the massive zombie completely exploded, sending blood, flesh and organs everywhere, reducing it to nothing but a pile of disgusting green flesh as all its body was scattered everywhere now.\nThankfully enough, Stark's quick thinking allowed him to get out of the radius of the explosion.\nBut...\n~SPLASH~\nSome of the blood that had been spread out everywhere actually hit him straight on since it emerged from the corpse like a fountain of blood, every wall having traces of blood on it now.\n'...' Stark stopped in his tracks: his body was covered in zombie blood now, and although it didn't do anything, it was still disgusting, and thankfully enough his head had been spared, meaning it was mostly his clothes that had been tainted, \"Fucking hell...\"\nIt was indeed unexpected, but it wasn't surprising a monster was able to use a skill even after death to possibly take out its opponent when it least expects it.\n\"Oh well,\" Stark quickly moved on as he still needed to get to the exit.\nBut...\n~DING, DING, DING~\nHe heard dozens upon dozens of notifications, and around 80 panels appeared around him, obstructing his view.\n[You have slain \"Skeleton Warrior lv90\", gaining 23272 EXP!]\n[You have slain \"Undead Ghoul lv93\", gaining 25824 EXP!]\n[You have slain \"Trial Ghost lv92\", gaining 24119 EXP!]\n.\n.\n.\n[You have slain \"Undead Elite Zombie lv110\", gaining 2,658,487 EXP!]\nAnd so with all of this...\n[Your level has increased to level 53, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 54, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 55, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Experience: 1122262/1500000]\nAnd so that could only mean one thing...\n[Level 55: please pick a card]\nAnd so, just like before, three purple cards appeared in front of him.\n\"Not five anymore, huh...\"\n[Note that some cards will now contain skills related to \"Exorcist\" as it has been merged with \"Domination\"!]\n'Amazing news...' Frankly, Stark wanted to stack up on the maximum amount of [Exorcist] skills possible.\nThe reason?\nNot only were they immensely strong against undead and demons, but also...\nThe major reason why was because of... the [Devil Abyss] rift, which he had the key of.\nIf the name was true, then it would be filled with demons, so getting [Exorcist] skills for as long as he could was the best choice to dominate it completely, even more so with the possibility of other classifiers being present after he opened it.\n'You know what to do, clone...' Stark smiled at his clone, and it smiled back, the reversed crimson crosses that now served as its pupils shining brightly.\nAnd so the clone went behind the cards to check out the pictures that were on them.\nThe clone couldn't speak, so Stark just looked at it while it was observing each of the images, trying to discern which one would be better.\nAnd after thirty seconds... the clone pointed at the one in the middle.\n~FWISH~\nStark grabbed that card almost instantly then turned it.\nAnd on it was... the picture of a giant crimson cross floating above a stickman figure, at least five times the size of the figure.\n'I knew you wouldn't disappoint,' Stark nodded, almost wanting to tear up because of his clone's understanding.\nWhy? Because it was DEFINITELY an [Exorcist x Domination] skill!\nAnd so Stark immediately read the details.\n...\n[Skill: Wielding Cross]\n[Class: Domination X Exorcist]\n[Rank: Epic]\n[Description:] Activating this skill allows the wielder to summon a giant crimson cross above them, which emits a powerful aura that is very uncomfortable to undead beings and demons.\nBut this isn't the TRUE power of the cross, the real power is that the user can use that giant cross and swing it toward enemies for THREE attacks (meaning you can swing it three times), afterward it will disappear!\n[Note:] Each attack of the cross has a cooldown of five minutes, so use them carefully.\n…\n'Incredible...' Stark almost wanted to hug his clone, this would definitely be a useful skill against demons and undead, making him a killing machine against those types.\nBut right as he thought that everything was going well...\n[A participant has been slain by another player!]\nAnother kill happened, although everyone had gone in different directions and vowed to meet one another at the exit for Akira to open it...\n'...' Stark's expression did darken slightly, but he didn't mind much.\nThe only thing he needed to know was that among the other four, one of them was dead, killed by another person.\nOf course, Stark never TRULY believed in the fact that they would begin to cooperate together in escaping this trial together, it would have been too good to be true, after all, he could sense that ALL of these people were twisted in some way, even Kokoro and the white-haired lady who didn't talk.\n\"Oh well… I guess teamwork was never an option…\" although it would have been so much smarter to just fight the monsters together and then the warden since they were all extremely strong, it seems like one or two people among them believed otherwise.\nNow, Stark just needed to be more careful and head toward the exit to figure out who died.\nIf one person had died while each had gone in different directions, it meant that either something else ambushed them by following them right after everyone left… or…\n\"The duel feature…\" Stark mumbled, which would mean that the person who died had actually accepted the duel in the hopes of killing the person who sent the invitation.\nWas it the person who sent his invite? He didn't know, but for now, he just needed to increase his awareness as none of these people were allies to begin with.\n[4 participants remain!]",

Had to fight it as well, it seems like everyone did actually, maybe it was the way this sublevel was testing us since we already had the key to leave it?\" she shrugged.\nIt was rather interesting as it meant that everyone, including Sora, Yuri and Akira had probably fought the elite zombie.\nBut now that Kokoro was here… it meant that someone between Yuri and Akira had died.\n~TAP, TAP~\n\"I knew that neither of them were trustworthy, probably used the duel request thing to fight one another…\" Kokoro sighed, it was the first time anyone could hear a small glimpse of her voice, although that wasn't really words.\nAnd right as they spoke of them…\n\"Hey!\" Akira appeared from around another corner.\n\"…!\"\n\"…\"\n\"=)\"\nAll people in the exit hallway turned their heads toward Akira, his white hair and mature face visible thanks to the light of the blue skull torches.\n\"Shall we go,\" he adjusted his neck tie while walking toward the exit door, which was made out of gold.\nThe fourth sublevel's door was bronze, the third's was silver, and this one was gold, so what texture could the first's…? Only one way to find out!\nAkira approached the golden door, grabbing his key from his pocket and ready to place it in the lock.\nBut… right as he was about to do that… he turned around.\n\"Hey,\" he spoke again, his expression darkening.\n\"…\"\n\"=)\"\n\"…\"\nNo one said anything, except for the Stark somehow found himself smiling.\nHe already had a giant idea as to why Akira suddenly stopped, and his clone too since the smile on its face grew wider.\n\"Let me guess,\" Stark spoke first, and all eyes fell on him, \"The 'TOP 3' perk, right?\"\n\"…\" Akira sighed, \"Precisely.\"\nAnd so everyone remembered about it:\n[If before the end of sublevel 2, only three people remain alive, then you will completely skip sublevel 1 (the hardest and most deadly of them all) as well as the ones you are in, even if it is sublevel 3, immediately heading toward the warden!]\n\"I might sound crazy, but if someone sacrifices themselves here, then we would be able to directly reach the warden, meaning three people would be able to possibly live instead of only two or one if we don't all die…\" Akira's logic would be okay under normal circumstances.\nBut… who wanted to die?\nWHO would sacrifice themselves after reaching so far?\n\"Let me tell you something,\" Stark took the initiative, \"No one is gonna sacrifice themselves or whatever bullshit you plan, if you want to do that perk, then how about YOU die,\" Stark's smile grew wider, and it even sent a shiver down Akira's spine, \"Or what? Are you going to try to kill one of us?\"\n\"…\" Akira didn't even say anything, he would usually try his hardest to argue back or force his way to whatever he wanted, but for some strange, he didn't like Stark's aura and expression, so he just turned around and turned the keyhole with the key inside of it, opening the golden door.\n[The door to the first sublevel has been opened, thus canceling the 'TOP 3' perk!]\nBut this wasn't all…\n[Too bad!

IT appeared.\n[New Perk: \"Wheel Target\"!]\n[A giant wheel will appear in front of everyone, this wheel will contain the faces of the four remaining participants]\n'...?'

Good luck!]\nAnd so the giant crimson wheel began to spin by itself, turning so fast the faces of the participants were but a blur.\n~TICK, TICK, TICK~\nNo one talked as they all observed the wheel slow down, the anticipation in the air growing thicker by the second as EVERYONE wondered who the unfortunate soul that would have to face off against the other three would be.\n~TICK....

THE panel that he wished he would have never seen in this situation.\n[Talent: Chosen One, activated!]\n'...!' Stark instantly realized what this meant.\n[Chosen One] would only activate in such situations to help him out or to do something bad to him, and in this case where he had a 1/4 chance to be selected, what kind of good thing could over occur?\nMaybe it was a pun with the talent's name since, you know, \"Chosen One\" and Stark would be the one chosen by the wheel, but it was still bad.\nAnd so... Stark immediately knew who would be selected as the target before the wheel even stopped spinning.\n'Yeah... I'm out of here,' he didn't even want to try his luck.\n~TICK.... TICK...~\nThe wheel was now moving so slowly they would be able to predict who it would land on.\nAnd at that moment...\n~DASH~\nStark ran in the opposite direction, toward a random hallway further inside the sublevel.\n\"YOU LITTLE- IT DIDN'T EVEN STOP!\" Akira was furious, and so... \"MOON DOMAIN... SLASH~\"\nHe swung his katana in Stark's direction, and as he was in Akira's domain, the swing translated into a giant silver slash that reached Stark out of nowhere: when Akira swung in his domain, the attack would land wherever he wanted.\nBut...\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" Stark rolled immediately once he saw the attack come in his direction.\n\"FUCKER!\" Akira was getting extremely mad for some strange reason, maybe he truly despised when things didn't go his way?\n\"MOON DOMAIN, SLASH!\" Stark was still in the domain as it was fairly big from Akira upgrading it to the max, and so he immediately slashed again.\nBut…\n\"COMBO DODGE x2!\" thanks to the new perk of [Invincible Dodge], Stark was able to follow his first roll with another one, meaning he was able to dodge the second slash.\n\"SLASH! SLASH! SLASH! SLASH!\" Akira was ruthless as he kept slashing in Stark's direction, not understanding how he would avoid him so easily.\n\"COMBO DODGE x3; x4; x5… x8!\" Stark kept running.\nAnd after the 8th combo dodge hit… he was able to escape the [Moon Domain].\n\"=)\" and now that they were out, Stark and his clone stopped, able to watch the wheel from their point of view while also escaping the slashes of Akira as they wouldn't be able to hit them from here.\n\"I'M GOING TO KILL YOU, FUCKER,\" Akira shouted again as he turned his head toward the wheel.\nAnd at that moment, it stopped on… Sora?\nHuh? Why would it stop on Sora? Wasn't Stark the one going to be selected?\n\"SEE, YOU DIDN'T EVEN NEED A REASON TO RUN!\" Akira groaned again as he was ready to slash Sora in half.\nBut at that moment…\n~TICK~\nThe wheel went crazy and suddenly did a complete 180-degree turn, resulting in the red arrow landing on Stark, who was in the section completely opposite to Sora.\n\"Knew it,\" Stark sighed as he got ready to run.",

good' of their trial.\n\"=)\" Stark's clone backed away as there was no need for it to stay in the radius of the explosion while it wasn't targeted.\nAnd as for Stark…\n'Come on…' he mumbled as the

Dodge!]\n[+10 EGO!]\nThe world around Stark turned gray, and it slowed down, Akira and Kokoro's movements now so minimal it almost looked like they froze in time, but some signs of movement were still there to confirm they could move.\n\"PERCEPTION!\" without wasting time, Stark activated his skill to check out his two opponents, it was something he always did of course, but finding the good timing was something essential, and thankfully enough, doing a [Perfect Dodge] gave him exactly enough time to analyze them.\n…\n[Name: Kokoro]\n[Level: 58]\n[Class: Domination]\n[HP: 49250]\n[Strength:

her hands so tightly, her stamina was extremely high in that regard because it was needed for her to cast a lot of spells, and her speed was high as well, thus sacrificing strength (as she didn't need it), and defense.\nBut… now that he knew…\n'That tablet…' Stark thought as he kept staring at it, 'If I somehow manage to destroy it… then… never mind, I don't have much time left…'\nHe immediately

fast and end the battle quickly.\nEach of his skills, much like Leader with the snakes and Kokoro with the tablet, were related to his power, which was the [Power of the Moon]…\n~TAP TAP~\nKokoro tapped something on her tablet for Akira, and the message [Got him] appeared.\nOf course, from their point of view, Stark was just hit by a FUCKING missile straight up, and so they thought that he would be seen dead on the ground after the smoke from the explosion dissipated.\nBut that would be a mistake…\n'Got them now…' Stark thought as he finished reading the panels.\nHe was surrounded by a smoke screen… and he wanted to take advantage of it.\n\"CRIMSON BALL TRANSMISSION!\" he summoned the crimson ball in his hand and threw it, aiming for the spot right behind Akira and Kokoro.\nThe two participants were not suspecting Stark to be alive, or at least he would be knocked down as [Holographic Missile] was a skill that needed around a minute to charge up (without being able to cast anything else), meaning Kokoro had spent precious time powering it up, which is why it was so powerful, worthy of a being a legendary skill.\nShe had defeated many monsters and people using this skill, so she was absolutely confident in its ability to kill or knock down people.\nBut… had none of them learned yet that Stark could avoid all their attacks using [Invincible Dodge] when it was aided by [Focus]?\nOr maybe they just couldn't understand how Stark did it? Thinking it was a rare skill that could only be used once in a while.\nWell, frankly, it didn't matter much for the boy as the smile on his face grew wider.\n~FWISH~\nThey didn't notice the crimson ball flying over them.\nAnd the moment it was in midair at the spot right behind and between Akira and Kokoro.\n~SNAP~\nStark snapped his fingers, teleporting behind the two enemies instantly.\nRight at that moment, the smoke disappeared, and the two noticed that Stark was nowhere to be seen.\n\"Huh? Wait a damn minute-\" Akira turned around, and his face turned livid as he saw Stark, a huge smile on his face, right behind them.\n\"…\" Kokoro didn't even let out a noise, but her expression was clearly of someone that is surprised and scared.\n\"Thought I would go out this easily?\" Stark smiled as he punched both of them in the face at the same time.\nThis time, the battle would truly begin.",

A sword, shield, hammer, bow, and spear materialized, all towering above her and connected to the tablet by a thin stream of blue aura, proving their origin from the device in Kokoro's grasp.\nBoth of them were now ready, and it also meant that Stark was in a really bad position.\nEven if his clone TECHNICALLY counted as another person, it was just another Stark but slightly weaker, meaning that he wouldn't be able to keep up with other people as strong as he was.\nKokoro and Akira were now back to back, the girl looking at the smiling clone, and the man in the suit at the original Stark.\n\"MOONLIGHT SLASH,\" Akira shouted, brandishing his katana with a pretty much unnoticeable flick of his wrist. The silver aura trail he had been building up earlier was now fully unleashed, and his katana seemed to glow with the power of the moon.\n~SLASH~\nAnd although he wasn't even CLOSE to Stark, at least ten meters apart, he still sliced in his direction, and what resulted from that attack was… a crescent moon trail cutting through the air, emanating a sharp, vitalizing silver luster.\n\"Aura Smash,\" Stark sent a crimson fist toward the aftereffect of the slash, which was still rushing at him, and they both collided, dissipating into thin air.\n\"…!\" Akira was surprised, his attack would normally be almost unstoppable against most monsters no matter how much they tried to stop it, \"Oh yeah… domination…\" he mumbled as he remembered that Stark also had domination aura, meaning he could counter his attack with one of his.\nStark already knew that, but Akira took a few seconds to realize it.\nTo be honest, Stark was in such disadvantage in this fight that it was already scary enough he didn't just run for his life and hoped Sora would find the key to open the door: Stark attacked from close range using his fists, and who else attacked from close range? Well… Akira of course, he had a katana in hand after all!\nAnd so… he dashed toward Stark.\n\"Half-Moon Technique,\" using this skill meant that Akira was entirely changing his strategy: going from long range to short range using the power of his half moon.\nThe moon that was spinning around him responded accordingly and went from a full moon to a half moon as well.\n~FWISH, SLASH~\nIn a fraction of a second, the white-haired man was already right in front of Stark, his blade aimed at the boy's neck.\nStark easily avoided the attack by backing away though, yet Akira followed him.\n~SLASH, SLASH, SLASH~\nUsing the moon powerhouse that was spinning around him, Akira kept slashing at Stark's decision, who was forced to keep avoiding the attacks to not get cut.\nAnd after a few seconds…\n\"Crimson Spears…\" Stark summoned one single spear above his head, then sent it not a Akira… but… the moon around him.\nAnd while he was too focused on attacking Stark, he avoided the spear, thinking it was aimed to him.\nBut…\n~BAM~\n\"-74271!\"\nThe powerhouse could actually be hit.\n[Moon HP: 925729/1000000]\n'Bingo…' Stark thought as avoided another attack and kicked Akira out of his range.\n\"-1381!\" the kick didn't do much, but it served as a way to temporarily allow himself to think before another assault.\nAll of Akira's power probably came from this moon, but it had so much HP, and it was so small that it would be impossible to destroy it, which is quite understandable as eliminating someone's powers easily would be bad.\nIn exchange for incredible powers, Akira was forced to put himself at risk by letting his powerhouse constantly spin around him, in the view of the enemies, although most of them never even thought of destroying that though…\nBut Stark was different: this was a 2v1.5, and so killing Akira's power core would be an almost instant victory in his book.\nStark glanced at his clone afterward, and he saw that it was holding on against Kokoro, who was sending her hologram weapons toward it in a frenzy, with not a single second of rest.\nKokoro vs Fake Stark, and Akira vs Original Stark, who would win this battle? No one really knew…\nBut one thing was certain: only one team would remain by the end.",

And that when battling against Stark, there would ALWAYS be surprises?\n~FWISH~\nAkira turned his head right as the crimson fist was only a meter away from reaching him, his eyes widening as he saw the giant attack in front of his face.\nBut… he wouldn't fall for it twice.\n\"SHADOW STEP,\" he vanished into thin air, leaving a dark smoke behind, then reappearing a few meters away, sweating a bit.\n[Shadow Step] was a very hard skill to use, and even he didn't control it well enough, which is why it took so much energy for him to cast it.\n\"Nice try, but that fist won't attack me or anyone!\" Akira proudly shouted as he got ready to go on another attack spree.\nBut… Stark just smiled as he kept observing the punch go straight, not even paying attention to Akira.\n\"Target Manipulation…\" Stark calmly mumbled as he pulled his right arm forward, his palm facing Kokoro, a thin crimson aura now appearing not only around him, but also Kokoro's figure as he had set her as the target of the manipulation.\n'Focus…' he mumbled to himself over and over as he closed his eyes and breath in and out.\nKokoro was busy fighting off the clone, who was like a parasite, not dying yet not doing any damage either, slowly but surely taking her stamina away while his just never seemed to deplete.\nAnd so once the clone noticed what Stark wanted to do, it just smiled and focused as well.\n\"AURA SMASH, CRIMSON SPEARS,\" it summoned everything in its arsenal, then sent it all at Kokoro at the same time.\n\"GLITCH BARRIER!\" she placed it in front of her, thus receiving no damage.\nBut at this very moment… the crimson fist that Stark sent was behind her.\n\"…?\" she turned around just like Akira, to see that the attack was heading straight at her, her expression full of horror.\n~FLY~\nShe surrounded herself with the aura of her tablet to begin floating and avoiding the attack.\nBut… it was too late.\n\"GET BACK DOWN, DUMBASS,\" Stark pointed downward with the hand that had been facing Kokoro, and suddenly, her entire body was taken over by his aura, resulting in her going down instead of up to dodge the attack.\nAnd so what had to happen happened.\n~BOOOOOOOM~\nThe explosion and attack was so powerful even Sora probably heard it from the other side of the sublevel.\n\"-38372!\" the damage was phenomenal as well, taking most of Kokoro's life as she was sent flying backward, the knock back of the attack almost knocking her out cold.\n\"SHIT!\" Akira knew he couldn't allow his companion (even though it was only temporary) to die like this since it would basically become a 1v2, and he really didn't want to use up his items yet, even though he had five.\nKokoro could die later for all he cared, but now he needed to her to hold off the other enemy.\n\"Ouch…\" for the first time, Kokoro spoke, her mind feeling hazy as the explosion hit her straight on, her eyes almost closing.\n\"DOMI-CHAIN RESTRAIN!\" in addition to that, Stark's clone took advantage of that to send the crimson chain toward the girl, attaching it around her while she was still in midair, then slamming her to the ground with it.\n\"-1239!\" low damage, but now Kokoro's arms and legs were bound by the chain, meaning she couldn't do much anymore.\nAnd so just like that… the situation became really bad for Kokoro and Akira, who truly thought they would easily win against Stark.",

What the fuck…?\" he loudly spoke, at least loud enough for Kokoro to hear as she approached him.\n\"…?\" she titled her head.\n\"No… but if someone is dead… then the 'Aura Blocker' should be deactivated as there is no aura to begin with…\" he was holding his chin with his hand, mumbling something to himself.\n[6 seconds left for 'Aura Blocker']\n~TAP, TAP~\n\"What does that mean,\" Kokoro tapped some words on her tablet, and the blue screen displayed what she wrote.\n\"It means…\" Akira became to sweat profusely, \"It means…\" he repeated, holding his forehead and gritting his teeth as he looked up, \"It means he is alive…\"\nKokoro's eyes widened, and she began to look around.\nIf he was alive, then where could he be?\nThey killed his clone, then immediately aimed for him as he was under the usage of [Aura Blocker], so how could this kid survive…?\nKokoro turned around, looking behind them, and thus, she got her answer: the clone had never died to begin with.\nAs stated before, it used [Dodge Control] the moment the bubble of [Celestial Sanctuary] popped, meaning that even though both Akira and Kokoro teamed up on it, it would still be able to dodge everything as someone using [Dodge Control] could NEVER be hit.\nRight after quite literally teleporting away because of the explosion, Stark's clone immediately noticed that the two used a reward item to block Stark's aura and dashed in his direction.\nTo be honest, wasn't it weird that even though Stark's aura was stopped, the clone was still there?\nWasn't he made out of Stark's aura after all? So how… was it possible…?\nMaybe… heh, it didn't matter.\nAll that it knew was that it could still move, and that it would have to do everything to protect the original.\n\"FOCUS… EYES VISION,\" it slowed down time, and that was something Stark noticed too since he himself was now affected by it, meaning that for three seconds, he saw the figures of Akira and Kokoro at 0.25 speed in front of him.\n\"CRIMSON BALL TRANSMISSION!\" it summoned the ball in hand and placed it in the spot it was in.\n[Target point set!]\nIt focused everything it had in its legs, then… it dashed toward Stark at incredible speed.\n~FWISH…FWISH… FWIIISHHH~\nIn a fraction of a second it was alright beside Stark while Akira and Kokoro were now mere centimeters away from killing the weakened Stark.\nAnd so…\n~SNAP~\n~BOOM~\nStark's clone held onto him from behind so quickly it was invisible even for the other [Domination] users.\nThen… it snapped its fingers while holding him, both of them INSTANTLY teleporting to the target point of [Crimson Ball Transmission].\nAnd so just like that, Stark was able to avoid the explosion and powerful attacks that shook the very hallway they were in.\n[Aura Blocker has been deactivated, 30 seconds have passed!]\nStark was able to get his aura back the moment the other two figured out what was happening.\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nAkira and Kokoro were speechless as they saw the figures of both Stark and his clone looking back at them, the smiles on their faces still there, haunting them forever.\n~TAP, TAP~\nThe first to act was Kokoro as she tapped on her tablet.\n\"M-Maybe we should just try to find the key and fight the warden together…\" she began, \"I mean, I did see that you had the [Key Location Map], so it's definitely possible…\"\nShe was tired of fighting and attacking just for Stark to avoid everything and somehow living through it all.\nBut… Akira wasn't of the same opinion, he truly wanted to kill Stark, and the more time the boy spent avoiding his attacks and mocking him, the more he truly wanted to see him in pain.\n\"You want to give up?\" he turned his head toward Kokoro, his expression darkening, \"Well…\" he raised his blade, \"I guess you are useless now.\"\n~SLASH~\nKokoro already had low HP from Stark's previous attacks, and so that slash from Akira…\n\"-12426!\"\n[Kokoro HP: 0/49250]\nIt killed her.\n[A participant has been slain by another player!]",

Well, it was because Kokoro proposed that they stop their assault on Stark to try and find the key to the next floor.\nWhy would he need to do that when he was stronger than Stark? Why would he need to put himself so low and stop his attacks because it wasn't worth it?\n\"YOU AREN'T STRONGER THAN ME, KID,\" he shouted at the boy and his clone, his pride hurt he wasn't able to hit or kill Stark no matter what.\nBut… what Akira didn't expect… was…\n\"I… Shall… Avenge… Myself…\" Kokoro mumbled as the upper half of the body fell to the ground, separated from her lower half.\nThere was no way for her to survive this, her HP had already reached 0, but in her final moments before death… her tablet began to glow brightly with that same bluish aura, visible glitches appearing in it.\nAnd suddenly…\n~FWISHHHHH~\nThe entire hallway was taken over by the glitchy aura, the walls, floor, EVERYTHING, now replaced by that very same aura, making the floor look as though they were in some sort of simulation.\n\"VIRTUAL WORLD!\" through her sheer determination, Kokoro was able to activate her mythical skill.\nAnd so… her body suddenly began to fade out of existence.\n\"…?\" Akira and Stark looked around, it was extremely weird.\n\"Time to end this,\" and only a few seconds later, a hologram of Kokoro appeared, it was an exact copy of her, except it had no colors, it was just a blue and transparent hologram.\n~SLASH~\nAkira immediately tried to slash her in half, but his katana fazed right through her, meaning they couldn't damage her.\n\"You are in my world… and you both shall suffer now…\" she put her hands together and closed her eyes, an uncomfortable aura swirling around her, and she was strangely beautiful in that moment, the sight of her in this pose extremely peaceful.\nBut…\n[Virtual World] was everything but peaceful.\n…\n[Skill: Virtual World]\n[Rank: Mythical]\n[Description: In a world of glitches and technology, this skill will allow the user to completely change her surroundings to her likings, placing all her enemies in a simulation where he was complete control, this skill lasts 30 seconds]\n[Additional info: if the user dies, then if they have enough determination, they can cast this skill to avenge themselves]\n…\n\"Akira, Chosen,\" she said, her voice distant and muffled, as if she were speaking through a glitchy radio, \"You both…\" she raised her holographic hand, and suddenly, hundreds upon hundreds of giant blue hands came out of the walls of the virtual world, surrounding the three of them completely (yes, the clone counts as one).\nAnd…\n\"Goodbye,\" she closed her hand.\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWISH~\n~SLAM~\nDozens of hands rushed at each of the participants, each enhanced by [Rune Engraving] as fire, water, or lightning aura surrounded them.\n~BOOM, SLASH, SLASH, FWISH~\n\"PHANTOM DANCE,\" Akira positioned himself, holding the handle of his katana with two hands, placing it upward.\nAnd then… he started to swing it at each of the hands.\nSurprisingly, he was able to cut through those attacks, meaning that as long as he managed to keep like this, he would surely manage to pass the 30 seconds…\n[Phantom Dance] allowed Akira to swing his blade to the rhythm of the attacks, abandoning everything else to focus on dodging and countering instead of his usual attitude and skills, which were all on the attacker side.\nLike he was dancing, his movements were smooth and following a clear pattern, each swing leaving some white trial of aura that looked beautiful.\nAnd as for Stark… he was struggling more than he thought.\n[Focus] allowed him to see all the of attacks, whichever angle they came from, allowing him to dodge them by a hair's length every time, but it was still fairly difficult as there were so many of them.\nHis clone was on the same situation, although it was still confidently smiling.\nAll three of them felt one thing: if any of these things hit, then they would be dead.\n[23 seconds of 'Virtual World' remaining]\n\"Holographic Missile…\" Kokoro closed one of her holographic eyes, then raised both her arms, summoning not one, not two, but THREE missiles, sending one at each of the people stuck in her virtual world.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" not difficult for Stark and the [Superior Clone] to dodge them using their dodge attack, then following through with a combo of 10 [Invincible Dodges] thanks to the new perk.\nBut as for Akira…\n\"COSMIC BARRIER,\" he was forced to place his barrier in front of him as slashing a missile wouldn't do anything.\nAnd so…\n~BOOOM~\nEven though he was protected, the fact the attacks were enhanced by the [Virtual World], as well as the fact he took the explosion in the face…\n\"-3472!\" his barrier shattered and he was sent flying backward, forced to continue slashing in the direction of the hands who didn't stop coming.\n[19 seconds of 'Virtual World' remaining]\nKokoro's face remained neutral through all of this, she could clearly see that they were all struggling, yet she didn't stop, why would she after all, they were her murderers.\nBut somehow, around 70 percent of her power was specifically targeted at Akira, maybe since he was the one who dealt the finishing blow…\n[13 seconds of 'Virtual World' remaining]\nBy this point, the three got the hang of it, and now smoothly managed to avoid all the holographic hands coming their way, even though their speed and numbers were in fact increasing.\n[9 seconds of 'Virtual World' remaining]\nAnd at that very moment… when all were confident they would be able to get out of this place safely… Kokoro began to float in the air, her eyes closed, her mouth shut, and her hands still together, as well as her legs crossed, almost as if she was meditating.\nAnd so… she used her final resort.\n\"I didn't want to do this…\" she spoke loudly, \"But all of you are monsters, undeserving of living or leaving this place, I shall take you with me to spare the world of your presence…\"\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\n\"=)\"\nAnd…\n\"ELEMENT SIMULATION!\" she used her strongest [Legendary] skill.\nHer hands, feet, torso, her entire body basically, began to glow with four different colored auras: red for fire, green for earth, blue for water and white for wind.\nIt looked like she was powering them up as some sort of energy sphere was forming in the middle of her chest, a trail of aura leaving each of her body parts and powering up that ball at the center, regrouping all the elements.\n[7 seconds of 'Virtual World' remaining]\nAnd while she was doing that, ALL attacks had stopped, meaning that Akira and Stark could Kokoro and whatever she was doing.\nYet in that moment… both of them could sense that this wasn't good, not one bit.\n[Element Simulation] was a beam-like attack that could be used from long-range, where Kokoro using her tablet would simulate the four elements and launch it at her enemies.\nAnd now… that attack was coming at them, with only five seconds left before 'Virtual World' ended.",

ball was growing more and more as she was pouring the aura of the four elements inside of it.\n[4 seconds of 'Virtual World' remaining…]\nThe ball of energy was growing more and more, and in less than a second it was already three times Kokoro's size, meaning that it was extremely powerful.\n\"Tsk… lucky idiots, if I had just a bit more time, this entire hallway would have been destroyed…\" Kokoro sighed as she wasn't able to power her attack anymore since only three seconds remained before she would disappear forever.\n~FWISH~\nShe separated the giant energy ball into two different ones that were slightly smaller, yet just as powerful, and then… she sent them at Akira and Stark.\nShe didn't even bother to send an attack at the clone, option only for the real threats: the actual participants.\n\"And with this…\" Kokoro looked down, a sad expression on her face and tears forming on her holographic face, \"I guess it's over for me…\" she fell to the floor, sitting down and just looking at the energy balls head toward them, \"You'll be joining me…\"\n'Well… time to use [Dodge Control] I guess…' Stark got ready as soon as the energy ball headed his way.\n'…' Akira didn't think of anything, he closed his eyes as soon as he saw the first giant energy ball, and the moon around him began to grow more and more, slowly seeping into his body as it gradually disappeared inside of it, 'FULL MOON FORM!'\n~FWISH, FWISH~\nBoth energy balls headed toward Stark and Akira, the latter already having activated his skill, getting ready to cut the ball in half using his mythical skill.\nBut… at that moment…\nKokoro opened her tearful eyes one more time, then pointed her arms toward Stark and Akira.\n\"TIME DILATION!\"\n…\n[Skill: Time Dilation]\n[Type: Epic]\n[Description: Completely slows down the skill of the users you select (limit of two skills per user), thus allowing you to place an attack as they believe they would be able to dodge it/counter with their skills]\n[Note: it pretty much deactivate the skills]\n…\nAnd so…\n\"DODGE CONTROL!\" Stark got ready to easily avoid the ball.\nBut…\n['Dodge Control' is affected by 'Time Dilation', thus the speed is too slow to be cast!]\nThis was the second time such a thing happened to Stark, the first being against the cyclops who locked its skill using its eye to lock [Dodge Control] while it was using its final attack.\nAnd now…\n\"I'm fucked…\" Stark saw the ball of energy, combining all element as well as Kokoro's entire power, heading toward him, only centimeters away from his face\n['Invincible Dodge' is affected by 'Time Dilation', thus the speed is too slow to avoid the attack, try something else!]\nIn addition to that, Kokoro had upgraded that skill to level 10, thus allowing it to lock two skills instead of only one… and so he decided to block [Invincible Dodge], taking Stark completely aback as there was no way for him to avoid now.\n~FWISH~\n'Ah…' he smiled as he saw the energy ball, 'I guess… heh… doesn't matter…'\nHe turned his head slightly toward his clone, just to see what it was doing in his final movements as it had been his greatest companion yet.\nAnd…\n'Oh…' he saw it right next to him, jumping in his direction.\nIt didn't have that =) on its face anymore, instead its expression was completely serious, and it was following only one order: \"Protect the original Stark, at all costs\".\nClones don't have feelings, and the [Superior Clone] may seem more 'human' and sadistic, as well as able to think for itself, it was still following its ultimate rule: Stark needs to live.\nAnd so… it pushed the original out of the way.\n~SLAM~\nIt bumped into him with incredible force, sending him flying to the right and falling to the ground.\nBut of course… when it did that… the energy ball hit it.\n~BOOM, FWISH, ZAP, SPLASH~\nThe explosion was deafening, a mixture of fire, wind, water, and earth elements colliding with incredible force against the clone, who received all of it and began to tremble, a powerful aura swirling around it as its body convulsed repeatedly.\nIt didn't have the smile on its face when it saved to Stark, but now that the original was save, then it went back to smiling, the pain was nothing to it.\nAnd so just like that…\n\"-56732!\" it received damage, and it would have more than enough to kill Stark if it actually hit.\n'…' Stark sighed, 'There was no need… I can revive myself…' he shook his head, he couldn't understand why his clone did that.\nBut somehow… Stark did feel somewhat sad, almost as if he had lost a true companion.\nHe could summon it back after 1h30 since it was the time needed for all three clones to be restored, but… he didn't know why it was still… well… doesn't matter, he had survived.\n[The \"Superior Clone\" has been killed!]\nAnd as for Akira…\n\"…\" he had already activated his [Full Moon Form], so Kokoro couldn't slow it down, meaning she decided to slow down [Moonlight Slash] and [Half-Moon Technique] instead.\nAnd yet…\n\"Pathetic…\" Akira raised his katana and cut the energy ball so easily it was actually quite scary, the ball exploding behind him and creating a cool effect.\n\"-17362!\" he did receive some damage but the elements, but he didn't even look bothered.\n\"I… No… None of them thing…\" Kokoro's eyes widened as she saw that both Stark and Akira avoided her ultimate attack, \"T-This… wasn't… how this was supposed… to… g-go…\"\nAnd so just like that, her holograph body faded, as well as her tablet, and after a few seconds, [Virtual World] deactivated, meaning that the simulation-like surroundings disappeared, replaced by the normal golden hallway of the sublevel.\n\"At least that's done with…\" Akira spoke, his figure was hidden by a wall of smoke created by the explosion of the energy ball, making Stark unable to see how his new form looked like.\nBut he wasn't interested to be honest, since he was too focused on something else…\n[EGO Meter: 75/100]\nThe EGO meter was somehow growing each time he avoided an attack or hit one himself… it was definitely interesting.\nIn the end, he just closed this panel and focused on his final opponent.\nHe didn't understand how shit could become this crazy in such a short amount of time, but now that it happened there was no going back.\nOnly three participants alive: Akira, Stark and Sora.\nJust how many would survive by the end… no one knows… but one thing was certain: at least one person between Stark and Akira will die by the end of their battle, and the latter was in his mythical form, and he had 4 more rewards that he could use.\nBasically… Stark was in complete disadvantage as he had also lost his clone.\nJust how would he get out of this situation…?",

Stark didn't expect this much, wasn't this cross made out from [Exorcist]? So wasn't it supposed to be mainly used against the undead and demons? And yet… it still did good damage, huh.\nMaybe because [Domination] was mixxed in with it?\n\"Fucking hell…\" Akira instantly got up, rubbing his forehead, he was protected by his armor, but his head wasn't, \"QUIT TRYING SO HARD…\"\n~FWISH~\n\"MOONSLIGHT SLASH!\" he yet again dashed toward Stark, this time faster and stronger.\nAnd yet…\n~FWISH~\nThe cross still ended up in front of him.\n\"NOT THIS TIME!\" he tried to slash it using his two katanas.\nBut… it was useless as it fazed right through them.\n\"-4928!\"\n\"STOP DOING THAT…\" Akira gritted his teeth, and as he looked up… he saw the cross above him again.\n~SLAM~\n\"SHADOW STEP,\" forced to use his skill, he instantly teleported away, leaving a dark trail of smoke behind as the cross hit the ground he was in before and vanish.\n[3 swings done, wait five minutes for another hit]\nStark could definitely understand why each hit was five minutes of cooldown: each was extremely powerful.\n\"The cross is gone,\" Akira was still cautious as he observed around him, Stark through all his battles, and even against Soulayer, always found a way to play 'dirty' to win, and yet again he had proved himself by pulling out skill after skill to avoid or counter him, and this was probably why Leader had died: tricked by the boy he thought was weak.\nAkira refused to fall for that, and so he perfectly considered Stark as a great opponent, if not the greatest he ever faced.\nBut now that all his tricks were out of the way…\n\"LUNAR STRIKE…\" he powered up his blades like before, but as there were two, the power of the attack and explosion would be much, muchhhhh bigger.\nAnd so…\n~FWISH~\nRight as Akira was about to jump in the air to finish this…\nA panel appeared before him, Stark, and Sora, who was far inside the sublevel.\n[Boooorinnngggg… this fight is taking ages, so… lets spice this up, shall we?]\n[Releasing the 'Death' monsters…]\nAkira stopped everything he was doing as he stared at the panels, the few words written on it bringing a confused look to his face.\nWhat the hell were the 'Death' monsters? Were they the monsters of this sublevel? No one knew.\nBut just as they got ready to resume their fight.\n\"Kriiiii…\" the sound of a sword sliding against the ground of the [Golden Palace].\nFrankly, none of them had spent the time to observe the surroundings of this sublevel, but it was quite simplistic: just pure luxury everywhere, chandeliers hanging on the high ceiling, white marble walls and ground, adorned with golden paths that made it look really nice.\nPaintings everywhere, each depicting a human with a strange power swirling around them, maybe were they other [Domination] users?\n\"Groaw…\" they also heard weird beast-like noises coming from beyond the corner of the hallway.\nAkira and Stark were stuck in a hallway with their only exits being the path to the left and to the right, meaning that they were closed off if an ambush happened.\nAnd just as expected… it did.\nBecause after only twenty more seconds… the 'death' monsters appeared.\nThere were dozens upon dozens of them, blocking all exit paths from the hallway, and they all looked different from one another, dozens of types.\nThe most notable ones were a knight that carrying a sword, making it slide on the ground, creating sparkles.\n[Crucible Knight (ELITE)]\nAnother was a orange beast with flames on its back, also carrying a fire sword and a golden necklace between its neck, it looked like a lion with fire mane, yet the skin of its body was grey and it was standing on its two feet.\n[Misbegotten Lion (ELITE)]\nAnd the third was a giant black shadow that seemed to be formed from the darkness itself, floating above the ground and emitting a chilling aura, its presence making the air feel colder, it didn't seem to have a body except for its crimson eyes staring at them.\n[Nightmare Shadow (ELITE)]\nWay too many elites were present, and the difficulty jump from the last sublevel to this one was out of this world.\nOne thing was absolutely certain: none them, neither Stark or Akira, would be able to defeat all these things while they were cornered.\nWas this the true reason no one completes a [Death] difficulty trial?\nThe levels before that had been a cake walk, and although many people died, it still seemed doable.\nAnd now… the trial shattered that hope, giving them impossible enemies to defeat, all the while being together in a group.\nIt was unfair… completely unfair…\nAnd yet… neither Akira nor Stark did back down, both kept staring at one another.\nThe monsters were a threat, that is for sure, but in the face of it all… nothing was stronger than them in this hallway.\nAnd to add to that fact… both pulled out the item that would save them from this situation: the [Monster Scent] they both owned.\nIt was a spray with a green liquid inside of it.\n[Monster Scent: Upon usage, all monsters will ignore you as they recognize you as their own, even if you kill many of them, this lasts ten minutes, one time use]\n[Spray it on yourself…]\nAnd so they did as told, both spraying all the green liquid all over their bodies, making their scent seem friendly to all the monsters, and thus making ALL of them stop their assaults, unable to understand where the humans that were just there go.\n[You are protected from 'monsters' by \"Monster Scent\" for 10 minutes, use them wisely!]\nSo basically… they had ten minutes to end this fight and get out of this situation, and hopefully find the key while they were at it.\nThis was not a lot of time, but it could still be doable.\n\"I hope you are ready, Chosen!\" Akira shouted as he positioned himself, holding his two blades.\n\"That's my line,\" Stark smiled as he also placed his two crimson fists in front of his face.\n[EGO Meter: 95/100]",

Was it because he knew nothing he did would work on Stark? Was it because he really didn't want to lose against him…\nIn the end… surrounded by monsters, in a place far from everything, where the two of them were fighting to the death… for the first time in his life… he was going to be a coward.\nWell, not really a coward since he is allowed to do that, but a 'coward' in his own rules as he vowed to always fight against his opponent fairly, each victory bringing him intense satisfaction.\nThey were in a place not even known by anybody but them, and people outside were probably enjoying their daily lives, yet here they were… in this trial, in this hell…\nNo one would know about their existence, even if they did.\nAnd Akira… would never allow that.\nHis expression darkened as he reached into a pocket in his armor that held all his items, and he pulled out… the [Invincibility Token].\n[Invincibility Token: Will grant you invincibility for the next five minutes following the usage of this token, meaning that no participant or monster can do any damage to you, one time use]\nHe had earned it fair and square by killing, and he truly just wanted to use it against the warden at the start.\nBut now that he was forced to do it in front of another human… he would give it his all.\n\"Congratulations, Chosen,\" Akira laughed loudly, his handsome face contorted into a wide grin, \"You truly pushed me to the edge, now you shall learn your mistake…\"\nThe token was like a simple coin the size of a human palm, it was made out of gold, and there was a symbol carved on it: a scale.\n[Hold the token in your palm and close your hand, thinking about using it…]\n'…' Stark just kept looking at Akira.\nAnd so… Akira did as he was told, the [Invincibility Token] vanishing into particles of gold, seeping into Akira's body.\nAnd with this…\n[You are now 'Invincible' for 5 minutes!]\n\"This was… my victory… FROM THE START,\" he grinned as he immediately dashed toward Stark.\n\"…\" Stark perfectly knew what he had done, yet he wasn't bothered.\n[+1 EGO]\nSomething inside of him was swirling, ready to come out at any moment, and he felt that the closer the EGO meter got to 100, the harder it would be to contain it.\n\"MOONLIGHT SLASH!\"\n\"Aura Smash!\" Stark summoned his three crimson fists and sent them toward Akira, each exploding in his face.\nAnd yet…\n~FWISH, DASH~\nHe emerged from beyond the crimson smoke of the explosion, unbothered.\n\"-0! -0! -0!\"\nIn addition to that, a warning appeared in front of Stark.\n[You cannot harm someone using the \"Invincible Token\", just run!]\nStark ignored it as he swiftly backed away, bumping into the body of the minotaur that was behind him.\nAnd then…\n~SLASH, SLASH~\nAkira slashed twice in Stark's direction.\n\"Invincible Dodge!\" he rolled away, but the minotaur behind wasn't as fortunate.\n\"-194821! -182710!\" and so it fell down, dead.\nAnd instead of being angry or attacking, the rest of the monsters continued cheering.\nHis [Moon Blades] tainted in monster blood, and his face full of malice, Akira turned around, his pupils not leaving Stark for even a second.\nHe had never been so confident in his entire life.\n'Shit… I need to stop him as much as possible…' Stark thought as he backed away.\n[+2 EGO]\nIt was all or nothing at this point, so might as well use up all of his skills as there was no reason to stop himself anymore: it nothing worked he would run away.\n\"HEAVEN'S WRATH,\" he drew a circle in his palm and pointed at the ceiling above Akira, who did notice the attack, but didn't bother to even move out of the way.\n~SWISH, BOOOOOM~\nThe crimson beam erupted from above, hitting Akira straight on as he was in the radius.\nAnd yet… after a few seconds… he emerged from the other side, unharmed and unaffected by Stark's strongest attack.\n\"Is that all?\" Akira smiled, even his face now darkened by his white aura, covering his body completely, much like Stark when it covered his face.\n\"I always knew you were a coward anyway,\" Stark laughed, \"Using an item to get out of a situation where you would lose, this was totally expected…\"\nStark's plan was simply to run away now, the monsters wouldn't attack, and if five minutes was all he needed, then [Double Assault] would definitely help to put some distance even in Akira's [Full Moon Form].\n[+1 EGO]\n[EGO Meter: 99/100]\nAnd right at that moment… another panel appeared before him.\n[The time has come, let the demon out, your EGO shall defeat this fool even in his current state, do not run…]",

He didn't get stunned by the crimson fists after all, but maybe it was pure bad luck?\n~FWISH, CLANG~\nAkira grimaced as the crimson chain wrapped around his armor.\n\"…!\" Stark's eyes widened for a second there, because surprisingly… the chain was actually absorbing power from Akira.\nAnd this meant one thing: someone couldn't receive damage… but status effects would still be received.\nAfter a small moment of struggle where his smile did falter a bit, Akira broke free with a powerful jerk, destroying the chain.\n[Do not run, face the wrath of the Moon]\nHe didn't know who was speaking to him, was it his own aura again? Or maybe EGO?\nIn the end, it didn't matter, as when Stark turned around and began to run away…\n\"Oh no you don't,\" Akira smiled as he activated another skill, \"Cosmic Barrier… REVERSE!\"\nUsually, the [Cosmic Barrier] would just surround Akira himself, but once he upgraded his skill to level 10, something else could be done with it: instead of just him, he could surround an entire area with that cosmic barrier, meaning no one could enter or leave except if they broke it.\nOf course, this would use an enormous amount of [Moon] power, but in this case, Akira didn't care much, all he needed was for Stark to be trapped with him as he couldn't deal damage to him.\n~BUMP~\nStark tried to run away using his crimson aura and focusing it on his legs, but the moment the barrier activated, he was trapped like a mouse, bumping into the cosmic walls of the sphere-like barrier and falling to the ground while scratching his head.\n\"What the…?\" he looked up, and saw a wall in a purplish color, small white stars all over it, and it truly is a beautiful sight if he didn't know what it actually meant, \"Ah shit…\"\n\"Don't run away, please,\" Akira laughed.\nAnd to finally finish the job… he decided to make sure that Stark wouldn't be able to survive this, no matter what.\nAnd so…\n\"MOON DOMAIN!\" he activated the very same power he had used against him, Kokoro and Sora when the [Target Wheel] was spinning to stop them from running.\nAnd coincidentally… the radius of the domain was the exact same one as the barrier he had set, meaning that Stark was trapped, in a space where Akira could hit him from wherever he wanted.\nTheir arena was massively reduced now, only 30 meters in circumference.\n~SLASH~\nAkira didn't even waste time, slashing both his katanas at once in a random direction, yet the two slashes reaching Stark as if he had been in front of them.\n\"Invincible Dodge,\" Stark rolled forward, wanting to get close to Akira as much as possible.\nBut of course, he wouldn't let him rest.\n~SLASH, SLASH, SLASH, SLASH~\nWhat followed was just a one-sided beat down.\n\"Invincible Dodge… Combo x10,\" after wasting his 10 dodges, he was forced to continue avoiding using his own speed.\nBut this was harder than expected.\n~SLASH~\n\"-3837!\"\n\"Fuck…\" he did crouch, but the second slash hit one of his shoulders, blood pouring out of it as the blades were extremely sharp.\n\"Why keep going?\" Akira mocked, \"You know it's useless, just forget about everything and die!\"\n~SLASH, SLASH, SLASH~\n\"…\"\n\"YOU ARE GOING LIKE ALL OF THEM!\"\n~SLASH, SLASH, SLASH~\n\"ITS…\" Akira laughed as hard as he could, enjoying torturing Stark, \"OVER!\"\n\"MOONLIGHT SLASH… ALL-TIME SLASH,\" he revealed another one of his card, focusing his entire energy in his blade and then suddenly slashing like crazy in every direction, not even aiming specifically for anything.\nHis attacks were so fast that even Stark couldn't see them with his naked eyes, Akira truly was going too fast.\nAnd after he finished…\n~SNAP~\nAkira snapped his fingers.\n\"Adios,\" he turned his back to Stark at the moment and began to walk away.\nHe had slashed inside the domain around a hundred times, and the moment he snapped his fingers… all those strikes came back toward Stark, reaching him from every direction: above, below, right, left, anywhere he looked, one slash was coming from that direction.\nHe was cornered, and he had used [Invincible Dodge] already.\nAt that moment, the vortex inside of Stark's eyes grew so powerful that his eyes began to actively hurt.\nAnd yet…\n[+1 EGO]\n[EGO Meter: 100/100]\n[Release the demon of hate, and the wrath of the moon shall be nothing to us]\nStark's body suddenly emitted a terrifying aura, as if every particle of his body was screaming for retribution.

Well… Stark was finally able to read the panel, his body aching all over as the power residing him was too much for even him to handle.\n…\n[Skill: EGO]\n[Rank: Mythical]\n[Description: A power dormant within the host, the EGO meter will keep rising every time they feel a strong emotion during battle, and once it reaches 100, the EGO demon (made out of the host's aura and completely listens to his orders) will be released, ready to annihilate any and everything]\n[Note: this also gives a boost in stats to the host as EGO powers him up]\n[Other Note: EGO mode has a one-week cooldown]\n…\nAnd the second thing that appeared… was the perk of the [EGO] skill, after all he had indeed spent five skill points on it.\n…\n[Skill: EGO]\n[New Perk: Negate Explosion]\n[Description: By using the user's will, he can make his own body errupt and thus negate any ability surrounding him in a close radius]\n[Note: You can use this thrice in EGO mode]\n…\nUnlocking that new perk had saved his life, but it didn't matter.\nBecause now…\n\"It's time to finally make this battle fair, even if you're invincible,\" Stark took a step toward Akira, who had lost his smile, the demon above Stark actually making him sweat.\nThis was EGO.",

      "content": "\"AURA SMASH... MERGE,\" Stark sent the giant fist in Akira's direction, who was slowly walking toward him, preparing to use his second [Moon Fatality] to end this battle once and for all.\nAkira had truly tried his hardest since the beginning, as he had seen many people lose fights because of their overconfidence, yet Stark somehow always managed to avoid his attacks or counter them against him.\nAnd yet… he was actually breaking his own values by being this smug, maybe it was the [Invincible Token] that made him act so unusually?\nEGO mimicked Stark's movements and launched a crimson fist as well: it was the main attack, as the demon was the one that would enhance it and also be the one to cast it, meaning that the [Aura Smash] that would appear before Akira would be the strongest one Stark ever launched.\n~FWISH~\nThe fist, at least five times Akira's size, rushed at him, leaving a massive trail of powerful aura behind.\n\"Futile,\" Akira laughed, \"Why keep attacking when I cannot receive damage, do you truly not comprehend what it means to be INVINCIBLE?\" Akira didn't budge even in the face of that thing.\nBut he couldn't deny the fist was powerful, so he instinctively positioned his two katanas to cut it and thus prove to Stark that he truly was the ultimate participant of this trial, even in his first, he had killed everyone with absolutely no mercy in his eyes, and it wouldn't change, even during the third or fourth trial…\n~FWISH... SLASH, SLASH!~\nHe even went as far as using a second [Moon Fatality] on the attack, using the entire power of the moon he absorbed in his blades to cut the fist of crimson aura.\nAnd his katanas did in fact manage to cut through the aura of [Aura Smash].\n\"DO YOU NOT REALIZE?\" he repeated as his weapons were slicing the fist in three.\n\"No... YOU do not realize,\" Stark smiled.\nAnd suddenly...\n~BOOOOOMMMM~\nEven though he did in fact cut it, the fist still reached him and exploded in his face, its aura and power way too strong for even the [Full Moon Form] Akira.\n~FWISH~\n\"-0\"\nAkira was sent flying yet again, bumping extremely hard against the walls of the [Cosmic Barrier] he himself had formed, then falling to the ground.\nHe didn't receive any damage at all, and not a single drop of blood appeared on any of his body parts, since he hadn't been \"physically\" affected by the attack.\n\"Do you not realize-\" he tried to get up.\nOr at least… that is what he believed.\nSince…\n\"Huh?\" Akira's vision was drowsy, he couldn't see well, he was tired, and in addition to that, his body still hurt somehow.\nHis legs weren't listening to him, even though he screamed for them to get up.\n\"What the...\" he placed his two palms against the ground and breathed in and out loudly, drops of sweat dropping on the ground under him, \"Why... am I... what...?\"\nNo matter how much he tried, his body wouldn't answer.\n[You have been stunned!]\nIn addition to his body actually hurting from the crimson fist and his stamina depleting, he had been stunned, meaning that he was stuck there.\n\"Do you not realize?\" Stark repeated his exact same words, \"You were never truly invincible...\"\nAkira took the word \"invincible\" way too seriously, thinking that NOTHING would affect him.\nBut what about his stamina, or if his body hurts?\nEven if he doesn't receive damage, these things still affect him, and it was until too late he realized he had pushed himself too hard.\nBut the biggest mistake he had made of all... was to forget about status effects.\nStark noticed it thanks to [Domi-Chain], but Akira could actually get affected by things other than damage, and so that is why he fed his confidence by sending all these attacks at him: fists, spears, and even used [Heaven's Wrath] to make him think even the strongest of attacks would do nothing.\nAnd when his confidence was at its peak... he would pull out [Aura Smash] and stun him.\n\"WHAT THE FUCK...\" Akira tried as hard as he could to move, but even his [Moon] power couldn't be used.\n\"Well... it seems like you lost,\" Stark arrived in front of Akira, who could only look up as he saw Stark and the EGO demon looking down on him.\n\"I lost?\" Akira was enraged, \"NICE JOKE, I'M STILL INVINCIBLE DUMBASS, YOU CAN'T HURT ME!\"\nStark looked at Akira's rage with the blankest of expressions, his face covered by his crimson aura and letting only his judgmental white eyes visible to the man below.\nSuddenly, the boy intertwined his two hands together and raised them right behind his head.\nThe demon repeated the action: it looked like he wanted to smash Akira using EGO.\n~FWISH, FWISH~\nHe powered up the attack for a few seconds as Akira kept insulting him and telling him that he would soon be free and kill him.\nAnd then...\n\"I win...\" Stark's eyes lit up as he swung down with his joined hands in a powerful smash attack.\nAnd just as expected... the EGO demon repeated what he did.\n\"YOU THINK I'M SCARED? YOU CAN'T HURT ME!\" Akira shouted as loud as possible, trying to hide his shaky voice as much as possible: even though he was confident he wouldn't be hurt, that thing's attack was still terrifying.\n~FWISH~\nThe demon's sturdy hands smashed Akira's body while he was lying on the ground, creating a small crater because of the sheer power.\n\"You... what... I... can't lose...-\" and so Akira fell unconscious, the pain in his body so strong this time that he almost believed that [Invincible Token] had deactivated, otherwise why would it be this painful?\n\"-0!\" yet the damage output proved otherwise: it wasn't that the invincible token wasn't working, but that his own body was still feeling the pain regardless, the adrenaline slowing down after being stunned.\n\"You can't receive damage, that is true,\" Stark smiled, \"But don't forget that I can also knock you out, IT'S MY VICTORY!\"\n[Akira has been knocked out!]\nImmediately, his aura disappeared and the [Cosmic Barrier] vanished, revealing that the monsters had gotten closer to inspect it.\nAnd the moment they saw Akira's body lying down...\n\"GRAOOWLL!\"\n\"HIKHIKHIK!\"\nThey all cheered.\n'What the?' Stark was actively confused, but he just shrugged, 'Well, it doesn't matter...'\nHe had around 6 minutes of [Monster Scent] left, and more monsters had appeared as they fought, meaning that it would be difficult for him to escape even like this when monsters were everywhere.\nAnd so... he left Akira's unconscious body in the middle of the monster-filled hallway.\nHe truly wanted to kill him, but another two minutes waiting for the [Invincibility Token] to wear off were just too much for him.\nAnd to add to that...\n[The door to floor 0 has been opened, head toward the exit!]\nIt seemed like Sora actually managed to kill the monsters and find the key by herself.\n'I don't have anything else to do here,' he mumbled as he opened his map and began to run through the horde of monsters.\nThey didn't try to attack as they saw him as their own, but he still didn't want to touch them or stay around for too long.\n\"Goodbye, Akira,\" Stark looked back one last time to see the white-haired man's body, \"You were truly strong.\"\nAnd so he ran off, leaving him and the monsters behind.",

      "content": "(5 minutes after Stark left)\n\"HIKHIKHIK\" a dark bird was happily flapping its wings.\n\"Houhpuh!\" and a giant red monkey was jumping left and right while clapping its two hands above its head.\nAll the monsters seemed to be really happy they had witnessed such a battle, and also the winner of them.\nBy now, Akira's [Invincible Token] had already worn out, meaning he was vulnerable to monster attacks, yet thankfully enough for him [Monster Scent] was still active.\n[19 seconds left for 'Monster Scent']\n\"...Argh,\" and at that very moment... Akira actually woke up.\nHe opened his eyes, still drowsy from all the attacks, and his head felt like it splitting in two, as well as all the aching in his body.\n[14 seconds left for 'Monster Scent']\nHe slowly sat on the ground, his surroundings blurry as he was still adjusting.\n[11 seconds left…]\nSuddenly, he remembered everything that happened, the memories of the fight, of him being stunned, then smashed by the giant demon's hand came back to him.\n'Fuck…' he held his face with his hand.\nHe had lost, for the first time ever, Akira had actually lost.\nBut… wasn't he alive right now.\n\"I lived…\" his eyes widened, \"Fucking hell I actually lived,\" he almost wanted to cry of joy, believing Stark would wait for him to lose his invincibility to easily kill him.\n[5 seconds…]\nAfter laughing for a bit, he tried to get up, but miserably failed.\n\"Ouch… my legs…\" he couldn't move his legs, and they weren't broken, it was just that his stamina and body were aching, meaning he would need to wait for a bit before being able to continue.\n[2 seconds…]\n\"Well, he isn't here anymore, so it's fine,\" he finally decided to look around.\n[1 seconds…]\n\"…!\" fear immediately took over his entire being as he saw the dozens of monsters dancing and cheering all around him.\nAnd right at that moment… a panel appeared in front of his face.\n[The effects of 'Monster Scent' have worn off]\nImmediately… all the cheering and dancing stopped.\nFinally able to detect their prey, the monsters all turned their eyes toward Akira, who had sweat dripping all over his face.\n\"W-wait, w-we were friends just a while ago, y-you were cheering!\" he tried to talk to the monsters, who began to approach him, their expressions darkening as they finally sensed the human.\nSome of them were confused as to how they couldn't sense him, but others didn't waste time and immediately pulled out their weapons or whatever they used to fight.\n\"HAKHAKHAK~\" the dark bird flew above Akira, its beak ready to pierce.\n\"OUHPUHOU~\" and the red monkey was violently hitting its own chest, making soundwaves with it that shook the hallway.\nIt was truly… unwinnable.\n\"I'm… fucked…\" Akira looked down, no matter how much he tried to move, his body wouldn't answer.\nAnd so soon enough…\n\"HIIGIHIK~\" a giant skeleton with a hammer in its hand hit Akira's side, sending him flying toward another monster who looked like a lizard, hitting him with its tail.\n\"-23726! -17371!\" just like that, he was already down to his final bit of HP.\n\"I… fucking… hate… this… why… do… I HAVE TO ENDURE THIS…\" Akira shouted as hard as he could, begging for anything, ANY miracle to happen and save him.\nYet… in this trial… nothing could save you.\n~SLASH, SLAM, GRIM, BOOM~\nDozens of monsters surrounded him and began to hit him with all sorts of weapons.\n\"Why… me…\" he extended his arm upward toward the light of a golden chandelier above him, but quickly… he fell.\n[Akira: 0/43700]\nHe died at the first hit, yet the monsters continued, reducing his body to nothing but a pile of flesh, and even then they kept eating him or burning him.\nAnd just like that… Akira was completely erased out of existence.\n***\n(Back to Stark)\n'Hah~ hah~' he was still running, following his map while avoiding the monsters that were all over the sublevel, although much less in numbers than when he was fighting Akira.\nAnd suddenly, the moment he turned around the corner right before the exit…\n[A participant has been slain by another player!]\n[You have slain \"Akira, the Moon Warrior lv64\", gaining 3,921,449 EXP!]\n[Your level has increased to level 56, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 57, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 58, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Experience: 113711/1970000]\nIt seemed like knocking down Akira and doing most of the damage/work actually registered it as though he was the one who made the kill, even though it was the monsters that did the final blow.\nMaybe it was to make it fair, since it would stop others from stealing other people's kills?\nBut then, why didn't he receive experience or the reward for killing Kokoro? Of course, he didn't deal the final blow, but he did lots of damage to her too, right? Yet only Akira was rewarded…\nAll of this was weird, but Stark decided to give up thinking about it as his [Monster Scent] had also worn out, meaning that he was being chased by a horde of ELITE monsters right now.\n'Got it!' he saw the exit door, and it was made out of the blue platinum, already opened as Sora had already done so.\nWithout wasting a single second, he dashed at it and entered the hallway that led to the spiral of stairs.\nThe platinum closing right as he left the sublevel since he was the last one, and the sounds of the door banging now hearable from his position.\nThat sound was terrifying, and he could hear the screams of dozens upon dozens of monsters who had let go of a prey.\nAfter a few moments, all the noise stopped, almost as if all the monsters had been erased the moment the humans left the sublevel.\n\"…\" Stark shrugged as he turned back and began to climb the spiral of dark stairs.\nThis was the end, the true end.\n10 participants at the start, now only 2 remained, and who says he wouldn't have to fight Sora to the death as well?\nFor now… he just needed to focus on the warden.\n[You have a reward waiting to be revealed!]\n[Would you like to spin the wheel?]\n[Y/N]\nStark didn't stop climbing as he clicked on Y.\nThe crimson wheel with the tail appeared in front of him.\n[Pull me!]\nHe did as it asked him, and it began spinning extremely fast.\nBut surprisingly… as the wheel gradually stopped…\n[Talent: Chosen One, activated!]\n\"…\" Stark was actually feeling quite exhausted from his fight with Akira, blood pouring out from a side of his stomach and his right shoulder as he had been hit Akira's blades there.\nHe wouldn't be able to keep going for long if things kept going like this.\nAnd so… by a twist of luck and fate… no… it was definitely the world itself that granted him this luck.\nHe received…\n[Item: Healing Spring!]\n[Healing Spring: A special spring that will instantly heal all your injuries and recover your stamina, one time use.]\nThe perfect item he needed in this situation.\n[Chosen One] had actually been nice to him this time.\nHe did notice something though: every time [Chosen One] fucked him over one way or another, in this example it would be selecting him as the target by twisting reality itself even though it was Sora that was selected, then there would ALWAYS be a reward for his efforts, as [Chosen One] would activate yet again to bring something positive.\nA bad for a good? Was this what this skill was all about?\nIn the end it didn't matter, and so Stark finished climbing up the stairs to floor 0, the final level of the Lucullus Prison.",

Maybe Stark actually died and the one of the remaining persons betrayed the other?\n\"...\"\n~STEP, STEP, STEP~\nSuddenly, she heard footsteps from below.\nAnd after a few minutes...\n~STEP... STEP... STEP!~\nShe usually had a neutral expression to everything around her, and even her friends and family considered her to be emotionless by standards since she NEVER showed any kind of expressions on her beautiful face.\nAnd yet... she actually let out a small smile, barely visible compared to her normal face, but it was still there.\n\"Hey,\" she greeted him, her voice still emotionless though.\n\"Yo,\" while walking toward her, Stark put the [Healing Spring] around his neck and activated it, giving him back his full health and stamina.\n\"...\" She got up as she has been sitting against the dark walls of the hallway leading to yet another platinum door.\n\"I guess that's floor 0...\" Stark mumbled.\n\"I was just waiting for someone as I didn't want to fight the warden alone,\" she shrugged calmly.\n\"Makes sense,\" Stark nodded, \"But you're awfully chatty all of a sudden, what happened?\" she had not said even a word in front of the others, yet here she was speaking like it was a common occurrence.\n\"Didn't want to waste my saliva on pointless matters, but now that everybody is gone and it's just the two of us, we might as well try our best,\" she headed toward the door to finally open it, \"I hope you're ready,\" right as she was about to reach her arm for her palm to touch it, she turned around and looked at Stark.\n\"Always ready,\" Stark shrugged, \"We might as well get this over with.\"\n\"...\" she just nodded as she put her palm against the platinum door, and after glowing for a few seconds it opened.\n~CRANG~\nSlowly but surely, the door opened, and once it was fully opened...\nBeyond it was nothing but darkness.\nLike, actually, it was pitch-black.\n[Sora was the first one to touch the door to level 0]\n[Unfortunately, no rewards can be given from now on]\nSeems like the final floor wouldn't give rewards anymore, and Stark and Sora wouldn't attack one another when the warden was there.\nWhich means... that there would be no more rewards.\n[Stark Rewards: Killing Spree, Revive Token and Key Location Map]\nThis was the hand he had been dealt, and he would need to make use of it.\n\"Come on, stop looking at your items,\" Sora pointed her head at the darkness beyond the platinum door, \"We need to go.\"\n\"...\" Stark just sighed and followed after her.\nThey entered the dark space... and the moment Stark traversed the threshold, the platinum door closed and disappeared.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nSora and Stark could still see one another somehow, and so they just continued walking.\nAnd after less than a minute...\n~FWISH, CLANG~\nThey heard the sound of machinery, and a massive triangular-shaped vault-like door appeared before them.\nIt was so big and wide it could allow thousands of people to pass at once.\nAll over it with were cogwheels, advanced screens, technological pieces of equipment and much more, each turning or flickering with energy.\nThis was...\n[The entrance (or exit in your case) of the Lucullus Prison]\nThe massive metal door that was emitting lots of gray smoke appeared before Stark and Sora, yet the darkness around was still present, meaning it was all they could see.\nThey both approached the door, touching everything they could from the bottom, but nothing would happen: no keyhole, no way to push it with strength, basically, nothing to open it.\n[The door will only open once the 'Warden' is killed]\n\"Sure, but where the fuck is the warden,\" Stark sighed as he looked at Sora, who was scratching her chin while thinking.\n\"...\"\n\"I don't know, but keep looking for him,\" a voice answered from behind, sounding quite different.\n\"...?\"\n\"Huh,\" Stark turned his head toward Sora again, who raised her eyebrows, \"Since when did your voice sound so manly Sora...?\"\n\"I thought you were the one who spoke, though?\" she tilted her head, still as emotionless as ever.\nAnd once the two of them looked at one another, they realized something: neither of them talked.\n\"Surprised?\" the manly voice came from behind them, and once they looked back...\nThey finally saw IT.\n[Warden, The Prisoner Killer]\nIt was peeking its head from beyond the darkness, completely covered in a dark blue armor with an oval hole in the middle that let them see how it looked like: it had blue skin, sharp teeth and pitch black eyes.\nIts body was covered in that same cool-looking and sturdy armor, and it also had two sculk horns on both sides of its head.\nIts arms' and legs' edges also had some sort of 'skull' protection on them made out of human bones.\nBut the most important part of it all... was the black hole in the warden's chest, and there seemed to be blue glowing spheres visible in the middle of its torso, right at the spot where the void was.\nThere were three spheres, each around the same size, and around them were some sharp bones (ribs) that came out directly from the armor, shielding them yet still allowing Stark and Sora to see them because of the powerful light they emitted.\nThat was all for the general appearance of the Warden, who looked extremely powerful.\nBut before Stark could even look at its weapons.\n\"Goodbye, prisoners,\" the warden lifted its [Sculk Hammer] and swung it sideways in the direction of Stark and Sora.\n\"FLOWER BARRIER!\" Sora calmly lifted one of her arms, and vines came out of the ground, three white flowers appearing instantly like shields and blocking the blow.\nAnd right after that... the warden disappeared into the darkness again.\nIt almost felt like it was using [Soulayer's] skill, except instead of mist it was just pure darkness.\n\"You should watch out,\" Sora spoke to Stark as she looked around, analyzing her surroundings.\n\"Yeah yeah, it can be anywhere,\" Stark sighed as he activated his aura and got ready to finally fight the final boss of this trial.\nBut unbeknownst to him...\n\"Prisoner...\" it was already behind him, its hammer lifted higher than its head, and its pitch black eyes emitting a powerful aura, stronger than anything he had ever seen before.\n[FIGHT!]\nAnd so… the warden swung down its hammer at Stark, who didn't even realize where it was yet since it could freely navigate in the darkness without being noticed.\nSince the moment they left the safety of the hallway with the stairs and passed through the platinum door into the darkness… they were already in its territory.\nStark and Sora vs the Warden, the final boss of the trial.",

The ceiling was adorned with swirling patterns of light and dark, and the mysterious hum of energy permeated the air.\nThe sound of machinery could be heard from anywhere, and obviously, the giant metal door that was the exit of the prison was still there.\nFloor 0 was basically a giant arena, and it was completely closed off as there was no way to leave now, going back to a floor below this one impossible as the door had disappeared.\n\"Ten of you at the start,\" Warden held its hammer in its own hands, making it glow with aura, \"Now only two remain…\"\nHe hadn't observed it well, but his hammer was just a giant and normal one, except for the fact it was ENTIRELY covered in sculk, which was some sort of liquid with white points that were slowly flickering repeatedly.\nAnd the last observation… was that Warden had some sort of chain around its neck, some sort of gem that was also covered in sculk: it was the [Sculk Necklace], something that gave it power and allowed it to use many of its skills.\nSora immediately rushed right next to Stark to assist, positioning herself while summoning her flowers around her, a vine with flowers of different types surrounding her completely.\n'Domination is so weird…' Stark thought as he looked at her.\nHe had been given fists as powers, but in comparison to others… it was pretty lame.\nOfficer got guns, Leader got summons, Akira got the moon, Yuri got stars, Kokoro even go a fucking tablet that can summon holograms, and now Sora has the power of the [Flowers]?!\nThis meant that [Domination]'s weapons could be pretty much anything, but oh well, it didn't matter for now.\n~THUMP, THUMP~\nWarden slammed its two legs on the ground like a sumo fighter, its entire body glowing with 'sculk' aura.\n\"Perception!\" and Stark decided to check that thing's window before continuing the battle.\n…\n[Name: Warden, The Prisoner Killer]\n[Level: 125]\n[HP: 591628/640000]\n[Strength: 8372]\n[Stamina: 3291]\n[Speed: 5094]\n[Defense: 7268]\n[Skills: Warden's Darkness, Sculk Infusion, Hammer Slam, Sculk Surge, Ultrasound Aura, Prisoner Chain, Horns Detection, Sculk Handcuffs, Flickering Movements, The Dark Spheres, Warden Smash, Armor Sculkification, The End of the Line, The Lucullus Prison…]\n…\nOther than the fact it had 14 skills, its stats were also extremely high, its strength almost reaching the five digits, and its defense also being really high.\nIts speed was extremely decent, although slower than Stark and Sora, while its stamina low, meaning that it would prioritize powerful attacks rather than keeping the fight going.\nAnd as for the HP… 640000 was a lot.\n\"He has-\" Stark immediately tried to talk to explain the warden's skills, stats and HP to Sora.\nBut…\n\"No need, the flowers have already informed me,\" it seemed like she could also check it out thanks to a skill called [Flower Analysis].\n\"Huh, then doesn't that mean you also checked me out?\" Stark tilted his head, one of the flowers from [Flower Analysis] was indeed pointed at him, emitting some sort of signal.\n\"I won't deny that, you can check out my status as well, we need to know one another better to fight after all,\" Sora shrugged.\nAnd so Stark just did what he felt like doing.\n…\n[Name: Sora]\n[Level: 62]\n[Class: Domination]\n[HP: 83000]\n[Strength: 2728]\n[Stamina: 7201]\n[Speed: 6472]\n[Defense: 5983]\n[Skills: Domination, Flower Analysis, Radiance, Elements of Nature, Vine Surge, Pollen Bombs, The Flaming Rose, Regenerative Drop, Nature Distortion, Flower Barrier, The White Jade (MYTHICAL), Evergreen Resilience, Petrification…]\n…\n[Domination] as well as 12 other skills since she was level 60, it made sense, and as expected all her skills were related to her flower power.\nLow strength, but all other stats were pretty high for someone at her level.\nBut the thing that caught his attention the most… was the fact that her HP were extremely high, 83000 was around thrice as much as Stark, and even twice as much as Akira.\nAfter observing the status windows of this many users, Stark realized one thing: everyone's stats were different because of their style of combat, for example he had low HP, yet somehow Sora and the others had higher HP than him.\nIt truly made him feel… that every [Domination] user was unique in their own way, yet all forced to participate in these deadly trials.\nBut before any of them could finish…\n\"Prisoners need… to go back to their cells…\" the warden suddenly took a step forward, its hammer still in hand, and the blue spheres in the middle of its torso glowing.\n\"Make us,\" Stark smiled as he positioned his hands in front of his face, \"The moment you get closer I'll just rip you apart!\"\n\"We… will… SEE!\"\n~FWISH~\nIn less than a fraction of a second, the warden dashed at Stark and Sora, swinging its hammer at them.\n\"HAMMER SLAM!\"\nThe sound of the impact echoed through the chamber as the warden's hammer connected with the ground. Stark and Sora used the moment to dodge the attack, the force of the slam causing the floor to shatter and sending up a cloud of debris.\nBut while they were avoiding… the warden revealed that he was actually doing a combo attack.\nAnd so…\nIt pointed the arm that wasn't holding the hammer toward Stark, and suddenly, sculk appeared all over it, created freshly thanks to the [Sculk Necklace].\n\"SCULK SURGE,\" and it sent a laser-like attack of sculk toward Stark.\n\"Oh come on, why me,\" he sighed, although he kept smiling, mimicking the [Superior Clone]'s confident attitude.\nThis time, the fight would truly begin, would they be able to beat the strongest the enemy they ever faced, or would they succumb to the [Death] difficulty trial like all the others…\nAnd if they did in fact kill the warden, then just how many would survive by the end?",

IMPOSSIBLE!\nSora was strong, probably just as strong as Stark, there was no denying it, and he also needed her if he wanted to kill it.\nBut… this warden wasn't normal.\nStark felt like… everything it showed until now was but a facade: its attacks, expressions, actions, everything was just to make them lower their guard.\nAfter all… he was the final boss of the trial…\nStark had a bad feeling, that same feeling he always had when something was amiss.\nThat same feeling you get… when you know that death is coming.\nWarden was currently on the ground, his hammer down and his head looking at the ground, black liquid oozing from the opening of his helmet.\n\"The Flaming Rose,\" Sora got ready to end this battle once and for all as she charged up her [Legendary] skill, unaware of what was coming as she couldn't sense emotions.\nBut right at that moment… the warden's eyes, which were completely dark until now, suddenly grew yellow pupils.\nThe TRUE 'Warden' would now appear.\nThe TRUE boss of this trial.\n\"Well, well, I had enough fun with you all,\" it lifted its arm with an emotionless voice, leaving out all its rage as if it never existed.\nAnd suddenly… a metal chain enveloped in sculk came out from the ceiling behind Sora, rushing toward her neck.",

What could he possibly do?\nSora had already summoned her [Regenerative Drop], and he was too far to reach her before [Horns Detection] would alert Warden who would kill her than attack him.\nWhat could he do in this situation to win…\n\"Think…\" this trial actually pushed Stark's brain power more than anything else before, and strangely, the more the thought, the stronger the vortex in his eyes and his aura became, \"… Oh!\"\nHe figured out something.\n\"Spatial Inventory,\" he summoned the inventory void and grabbed something from it: it was a gun-shaped object that resembled just a normal pistol, although it had weird devil symbols all over it, and the words 'Killing Spree' written on the side.\nThat's right: he grabbed [Killing Spree], the ultimate reward.\n[Killing Spree: This reward charges up a destructive power that increases after each monster/enemy defeated, the more monsters killed, and the strongest they are, the more this attack's power increases, also note that the amount of monsters killed counts since the beginning of the trial!]\nHe had defeated over 250 monsters as well as Leader and Akira, meaning that the power of the gun should be enough.\nAnd so… right as Warden grabbed Sora's lavender and stomped on it, Stark pointed the gun at the boss, ready to end it all.\n\"Here goes nothing…\" and without a single second of hesitation, he pressed the trigger.\nYet instead of firing instantly like a normal gun… [Killing Spree] was different.\n[Charging up power!], a panel appeared before Stark.\n[268 monsters killed, 2 enemies killed]\n[Amazing, host, you are a true KILLER!]\n~FWISH, FWISH~\nA crimson ball of energy formed in front of the hole bullets were supposed to be fired from.\n[You have slain 'Sublevel 4 Elite Guard', power increasing!]\n.\n.\n[You have slain 'Chains Cyclops', power increasing!]\n.\n.\n[You have slain 'Undead Elite Zombie', power increasing!]\n.\n.\nAnd that crimson ball… began to grow more and more as each panel that showed the monsters he killed appeared.\n~FWISH… FWISHHH… FWISHHHHHH~\n[You have slain 'Leader, The Sect Leader', power increasing!]\n~FWISH~\nAnd in the end…\n[You have slain 'Akira, the Moon Warrior,' power increasing!]\n[Power has been maxed out! Please fire!]\nThe gun that Stark had been holding completely evaporated, not able to withstand the power of the crimson energy ball, meaning that it was just there, its energy pulsing through Stark's body as it floated in the air, ready to be sent at the enemy.\n\"How do I…\" yet before he could even finish his sentence.\n[Punch it!]\n\"Alright…\" Stark breathed in and out as he focused, the crimson ball of energy before the sole thing that could help them kill that warden monster.\nAs focused his entire aura in his right hand, he remembered everything that happened in this trial: the fourth sublevel and the elite guard, the fight with Leader in the second sublevel, the awakening of his new class and the moment he killed all those undead with it, the fight with Kokoro and Akira in the first sublevel because he was selected as the target.\nNow… all those experience and memories, all those fights and struggles… he put them all in this punch, his right hand filled with an aura so red it could be a demon's to shame.\nAnd then…\n~SWING~\nHe punched the crimson ball so hard that it felt as if time stood still.\nThe energy ball exploded in a burst of crimson light upon impact with his fist and was sent toward Warden at the speed of light.\nAnd it hit him, saving Sora right as he was about to smash her body.\n~BOOOOM~\nWhich brings us back to the moment before.\n\"You're just a false hero,\" he smiled at the warden, who was clearly damaged from the [Killing Spree] ball.\nAnd so just like that, the fight became a little more fair.\n-----------------\nOne chapter today because I'm currently reviewing the previous chapters to enhance them and also increasing stockpile, in exchange this a little longer than the others.",

      "content": "[You have used 'Killing Spree' on 'Warden, the Prisoner Killer'!]\n\"…\" Warden was sent flying toward the giant metal door of the Lucullus Prison, the crimson ball of energy sent by [Killing Spree] hitting his left shoulder, and essentially evaporating his left arm in the process, \"You… prisoner…\" The yellow vortex in the warden's eyes grew darker as he got up, holding his hammer tight in his right hand.\n\"You're just a false hero,\" Stark took a few steps forward and arrived in front of Sora, checking her out.\n\"…\" she was still breathing, and her eyes were opened, just enough to be able to see what was happening, yet unable to move her body.\n\"Useless…\" Stark mumbled, he knew she wouldn't be able to help, even though he had been sure she was the strongest one of the batch, \"Just sit back and watch me send that asshole to hell…\" Stark continued walking toward warden.\n\"SCULK INFUSION,\" but Warden cast his skill, and suddenly…\n~FWISH~ His left arm reappeared, well… not really… but it was just entirely made out of sculk.\nBasically… he artificially created another arm as he couldn't retrieve the last.\n\"+100000,\" he couldn't heal himself anymore, and this was the maximum his skill could do at this point.\nMeaning… that both parties were in their final form.\nA true 1 on 1.\nWarden swung his hammer a few times to adjust to the feeling of his new arm, completely made out of sculk, then he stared at Stark.\n\"Do you believe that you have the right to fight back?\" he tilted his head, cracks visible all over his armor, which protected him from dying of the [Killing Spree] energy ball.\n\"What are you talking about?\" yet Stark wasn't bothered, his crimson aura taking over his entire body, his figure being replaced by that aura, except for his mouth and eyes which were white.\n\"Mere prisoners trying to escape and cause chaos in this world, I am the warden, I am JUSTICE,\" Warden grabbed his hammer with both his hands and smashed the ground with it, making the entirety of floor 0 tremble, and making cracks appear on the ground.\nHe was extremely close to reaching his second phase, or \"Berserk\" mode.\n\"ULTRASOUND AURA,\" Warden held his necklace with the \"sculk arm\" he created, unleashing a deafening wave of sound that echoed through the room.\nStark had seen that he used that to stun Sora before, and he wouldn't fall for that trick.\nThe blue rings of sound rushed in his direction, but he just swiftly avoided them by starting to run around the warden.\n\"You seem to be smarter than the other one,\" Warden smiled, \"That's good, shattering all your hopes will be much more fun.\"\n\"Heh~ and you call use the evil ones,\" Stark smiled back, although his was so demonic that even Warden's eyes widened slightly.\n\"SCULK SURGE… CANNON!\" Warden pointed his \"sculk arm\" toward Stark, but instead of immediately shooting… it started to morph.\nThe cannon-like structure on Warden's arm grew larger and larger, as if gathering energy from the very air around them.\nAnd by the end of that transformation… his arm was like a giant cannon that could send giant balls of sculk toward his enemies.\n~BOOM~\nHe immediately fired at Stark, who avoided the lightning-fast bullet by a hair's length.\n\"Is this… your justice?\" Stark said as he avoided two more cannonballs.\n\"Shut up, prisoner.\"\n\"SCULK CHARGE… ULTIMATE CANNONBALL!\" as if sucking in the air, Warden charged up his attack, the sculk all over his armor and body slowly disappearing and going inside the cannon.\nAnd after a few seconds… ~BOOM~ He fired the ball, and it was so fast Stark would have no chance to avoid it, especially since Warden had [Horns Detection].\nAnd yet… ~SNAP~ Stark snapped his fingers, and he immediately teleported behind Warden.\nThe reason was simple: while he was running around Warden, he had activated [Crimson Ball Transmission] and sent a ball right behind the beast.\n\"Watch out, false hero, your justice is wavering,\" Stark immediately aimed to slam his fist onto Warden's back.\nBut…\n\"Flickering Movements,\" Stark's vision became dark for a split second, almost as if the lights in his eyes had been turned off, and when his vision came back… Warden was…\n\"My justice will never lose,\" he was behind Stark.\n\"Sculk Handcuffs,\" before Stark could even react, sculk formed around Stark's arms and handcuffs appeared on them, joining them both together.\n'Can't move…' he couldn't move his arms anymore, the sculk blocking his movements.\n\"HAMMER SLAM,\" he swung his hammer sideways and hit Stark straight on as he couldn't move.\n\"-23713!\"\n[Stark HP: 9787/33500]\nThankfully enough, the [Sculk Handcuffs] disappeared the moment he was hit.\nBut on the other hand… Stark was now only one attack away from dying, blood pouring out from his head, and his arm hurting like hell as he infused it with aura and blocked the attack with it to minimize the damage received.\n\"You're the only left,\" Warden pointed his [Sculk Hammer] at Stark, who got up from his kneeling position to continue fighting.\nStark lifted his gaze, and that's when he noticed something: the rib-like bones that were protecting the three [Dark Spheres] in the middle of the warden's torso were on the verge of breaking as well.\nIf these things were the warden's weakness, then he would need to use them to defeat him, otherwise he had no chance, especially now that Sora was useless and could only watch the fight as it happened.\nStark needed a plan…\nAnd so… he began acting.\n\"Hahahahahahah!\"\n\"…?\" Warden was confused, after all… why was Stark suddenly laughing like a maniac, \"Gone crazy?\"\n\"I already figured out everything, WARDEN!\" he smiled, \"You think you're so righteous, protecting the people from us criminals, huh?\"\n\"That is right, I am the good of this world,\" Warden actually agreed, he was full of himself and loved to be called a hero.\n\"And yet, here you are, violent, despicable, nothing but a mere tool used by those above for this pointless game!\"\nStark continued, the smile on his face growing more sinister.\n[Keep pushing…]\nWarden's expression changed at that moment, his neutral look from before faltering.\n\"You are nothing at all, Warden, and when I end up killing you and getting out of this place, I'll make sure to cause the higher amount of chaos possible.\"\n\"You… little…\" Warden was beginning to become angry.\nWarden, as stated by his role and name, was the guardian of this prison, the one that stopped all evil from escaping, which is why he was fueled by justice and good, refusing to submit to the evil of this world and loving to be called a hero.\nAnything that went against these beliefs would need to be wiped out.\nAnd yet…\n\"You are just a monster, Warden,\" Stark went for the finishing blow.\n[Push him to his limits… make him make a mistake…]\n\"Stop… talking…\" he smashed his hammer against the ground again, debris falling from the ceiling and his body being taken over by sculk and aura.\n\"YOUR CORRUPT JUSTICE IS WRONG, AND YOU ARE NOTHING,\" Stark shouted as hard as he could, the atmosphere around both opponents so powerful that Sora couldn't understand how any of this was happening, \"NOTHING BUT A FALSE HERO!\"\nAnd the moment Stark pronounced those last words…\n\"WARDEN'S DARKNESS,\" Warden used up his [Legendary] skill again, the same one he activated when Stark and Sora first entered this floor.\n\"I'LL SHOW YOU THAT I AM THE TRUE HERO, PRISONER,\" Warden hid in the darkness of the floor as everything turned dark around Stark.\n\"Come at me, false hero,\" Stark sneered as he wiped blood pouring out from his nose.",

      "content": "\"Justice… justice… justice…\" Warden could be heard mumbling those words again, it does seem like it had gone crazy from Stark's talk and his attack which damaged him, \"JUSTICE!\"\nA spiral of aura and sculk formed around him, making it practically impossible to distinguish his true form as he was powering up, not wanting to hold himself back anymore as the prisoners were now an actual threat, well it was mostly Stark though.\nThe aura was so intense that it seemed as if the very fabric of reality was being warped around him.\nSuddenly, Warden let out a loud, ear-piercing scream that echoed throughout the entire prison, and they both had to put their hands on their ears if they didn't want to go deaf by the noise.\nAs he screamed, the sculk and aura surrounding him began to swirl and coalesce, forming a massive, ominous structure that resembled… a colossal [SCULK HAMMER]!\n\"Is this… his ultimate form?\" Stark couldn't help but wonder, feeling a chill run down his spine.\nAnd after that spiral of aura and sculk disappeared, as well as his body stopped glowing… Stark was finally able to check out the warden's [Berserk] form.\nWarden, now in his Berserk form, was towering above Stark, his body covered in thick, undulating sculk that mixed with his aura to create a formidable appearance. His eyes, now filled with pure wrath, seemed to hold an almost otherworldly darkness.\nHis cracked armor was now completely repaired and looked more majestic than before, his fists also were surrounded with aura, much like Stark when he did it with his own.\nBut there were two major details in its appearance now: first of all, the helmet with a hole in it had completely disappeared, meaning that Stark could now see the face of the warden: it had blue skin, pointed teeth, pointy ears as well as dark blue straight lines on its face that were glowing.\nAnd the second detail… was the warden's cores.\nThey were no longer visible in his torso, instead they were now floating around him like they were the warden's very essence.\n~THUMP~\nThe giant hammer, at least ten times the warden's size and fifteen times Stark's, dropped in the monster's hands, who grabbed it as if it was a mere stick.\nThe hammer had no physical appearance, it was LITERALLY made out of sculk, its edges not straight but always moving.\n\"Justice…\" Warden stared at Stark in the eyes, and just this was almost enough to paralyze him, that aura was not normal.\nNot wasting time, Stark decided to check out the two [Mythical] skills of the warden as to prepare him for whatever monstrosity was coming his way.\n~THUMP~\nHe needed to be quick since Warden was slowly approaching, leaving a trail of sculk as his legs were also surrounded with it.\n…\n[Skill: The Dark Spheres]\n[Rank: Mythical]\n[Description: Use your three cores and make them spin around you, granting you an increase in aura and sculk,

opponents whole, and each of the spheres can be used to block one of the opponent's skills.]\n[Condition: The protection of your cores (aka the rib bones) needs to be destroyed to be able to use it]\n…\n[Skill: The End of the Line]\n[Rank: Mythical]\n[Description: All your stats are increased by a lot, and you enter your 'berserk' form, making you intimidating to most opponents who won't even be able to avoid your attacks anymore]\n[Condition: your HP needs to be under 50000]\n…\nOne of the skills (Dark Spheres) used his skills to improve his aura and sculk, while the other (The End of the Line) is used to upgrade his stats.\nThis was… a horrifying combo, and Stark had somehow managed to let the warden fulfill both of these conditions at the same time.\n\"…\" Stark looked at Sora's direction for a quick instant, seeing that her emotionless face was looking at him, although drops of sweats betrayed her actual feelings.\nAnd when he looked back at where the warden was…\nThe monster had disappeared.\nLike literally, the warden wasn't in the spot it was in less than a second ago.\n[Above]\n[Focus] warned him, and when he looked up… he saw Warden in the air, his colossal sculk hammer in hand, his eyes burning with the fury of the cosmos.\nHis aura was stronger than ever, and his body seemed to shimmer and shift, as if he were made of the very fabric of reality itself.\nThe three glowing cores that floated around him now seemed to dance, twirling and spinning in perfect harmony with each other.\n\"GOODBYE, CRIMINAL,\" he spanned in the air before striking down with his hammer, grabbing the sculk handle with both hands as he aimed down toward Stark.\n\"…!\" Stark's eyes widened, even he knew that thing was no joke.\nAnd when he saw the perfect opportunity to avoid the attack…\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" he rolled away.\nBut… for the first time ever…\nFor the first time since he acquired [Invincible Dodge]… he actually failed to dodge, missing the window of opportunity by a split second.\nThe reason was simple: two of the dark spheres spinning around Warden suddenly rushed toward his legs, and he used them as platforms to jump again as Stark avoided.\n\"FUCK IT,\" Stark got ready, \"DODGE CONTROL!\"\nBut…\n[One of the 'Dark Spheres' has stopped the use of your skill!]\nHe used two spheres to juke Stark into using [Invincible Dodge] and waited 3 seconds in the air so he couldn't combo dodge him, then used his final sphere (which couldn't be used since a sphere can only do one thing at a time) to stop him from using [Dodge Control].\nThat Warden… was way too smart.\n\"Justice is the winner in the end, it seems,\" Warden actually smiled, his face full of malice as he began to go down.\nAnd then… as he spanned one more time… the colossal hammer slammed down onto Stark's position, the force of the blow sending shockwaves throughout the prison and shaking the very foundations of the structure.\n\"-93827!\"\n\"GAH…\" Stark's eyes went blank as he received the damage, his HP reaching 0, \"…\"\nBut instead of falling like he usually does… Stark held on for a few more seconds, his pure determination stopping him from dying, even though he knew it was inevitable.\n[Stark HP: 0/33500]\nStark noticed that there was sculk all over his body, taking over his legs and entire torso, leaving only his head visible: that sculk was taking control of him even though he was about to die.\n\"I sense that your life force is going down in opposition to before, looks like it truly is the end of the line for you, prisoner,\" Warden smiled as he kept looking at Stark being taken over.\nSoon enough, half his face, his hair, his mouth and his nose were taken by sculk, leaving only one of his eyes, burning with crimson aura out.\n\"It is already a miracle that your determination is keeping you alive,\" Warden nodded slightly, acknowledging Stark's strength, \"But it's time to fall,\" and as he snapped his fingers…\nThe rest of the sculk too over Stark's eyes, his pupils shaking as rage took over his entire being.\nEven if he was revived now, even if he somehow came back, the sculk would still deal damage and kill him as he would only have 1 HP.\nHe was done for, he couldn't live anymore.\nThe trial… beat him.\nAnd yet… the last thing he did as his last remaining eye was taken over by the dark blue liquid… was look at Sora.\nShe had a shocked expression on her face, holding her mouth with her right hand and visible tears appearing on it.\n\"Sorry…\" he couldn't hear her as his ears were covered, but he could see her mouth's movements, \"I'll be joining you all soon…\"\nHis eye was taken over by the liquid.\nAnd then… nothing.\nHe couldn't see anything, his entire vision was covered by that thing, and all that Stark could feel was his own heart still holding on, beating slightly as if to keep him alive, trying its hardest not to lose hope.\nLosing hope is like accepting defeat, and in this case, if Stark did do that, then both him and Sora would be wiped out.\nNo one would remember him.\nBut this was an unacceptable thought to Stark: would everything he did be in vain?\nHe wanted to be strong, he wanted to show the world that he was here, maybe try to get into a relationship at some point and leave his print on this ruthless world.\nBut now... as he was facing the Warden, an enemy impossible to even imagine or defeat for classifiers that were level 100 or above...\nHe felt like it could maybe be the end.\n\"...\"\n[No it's not, get up.]",

already been in this place twice before.\nEvery second that passes in this space is one in real time, meaning that he needed to be quick to make his decision.\n[You have 60 seconds to decide, otherwise it is game over!]\nHe was put on a timer, if he passed that minute he would be dead forever.\nBut…\n\"What is the point…\" Stark looked down.\nHis body was taken over by the sculk, Warden had made sure this time that Stark wouldn't be revived, and even if he did then he would be killed.\nSo what is the point if doing this… why would he revive himself just to die?\n[30 seconds remain!]\nStark remembered everything he had went through, not only in this trial but since his appearance in this world and even in his past life.\n\"…\"\n[20 seconds remain!]\nNobody is waiting for him beyond this trial, he had no friends or family, all of them probably thought he had already died.\n[Are you sure?], a panel appeared in front of him, and right next to it appeared a picture of a smiling Lana.\n\"…Yes.\"\n[Are you sure?]\nA picture of his hotel room (the one he was currently in), as well as dozens of pictures of videos showcasing his power in battle.\n\"Maybe…\"\n[Are you sure?]\nA final picture, one where Dora had that terrified expression on her face, one that actually scared even Stark as he was used to her being emotionless.\n[10 seconds remain!]\n[Make your choice!]\n\"…\"\n~FWISH~\nAnd when all his thoughts were culminating into his answer…\nA crimson replica of Stark appeared five meters away right in front from him.\n\"You…\" nothing like that had ever happened before as normally in this void between life and death, he had always been alone, \"What?\"\nAnd yet… the only thing that [Domination] replica of Stark did was bend its arm, pointing at him.\n\"Stop being a bitch, get up,\" this was all it said in Stark's voice before disappearing.\n\"…\" at this point, Stark's entire existence was taken over by his crimson aura and rage, his pupils shaking so fast they almost became invisible to the naked eye.\nAnd then…\n[3 seconds remaining]\n[Do you want to be revived?]\n[Y/N]\nStark clicked on Y with all his strength, shattering the panel itself as his body and consciousness were transported back to reality.\n[Make use of that chance, Chosen One.]\n***\n\"Foolish,\" Warden peeked one more time at Stark's figure, which was now completely covered by the sculk, making it look like a pile of mud, nobody aware that a human was inside at first glance, \"The moment I kill you is the end now.\"\nHe turned back toward Sora, who had her stomach against the ground, her right hand positioned against her mouth, and her left one reaching for Stark.\nFor the first time in her life she cried, and for the first time in her life she actually felt sad and shocked.\nThis was the power of a [Death] domination trial, it was unlike anything anyone could imagine.\nThey didn't know each other for that long, and yet the fact they fought together and were the last two alive built a strong connection, beyond anything possible in such amount of time.\nSora couldn't deceive herself: Stark was dead, he couldn't have a second [Revive Token].\nAnd so… she just looked at the warden, who was slowly approaching her, creating another [Colossal Sculk Hammer] out of nowhere, ready to smash her and engulf her in the dark blue liquid, much like her companion.\nBut right as he reached her and was ready to kill the final prisoner…\n~FWISH, BOOM~\nBehind him, a vortex of crimson aura formed around the pile of sculk he had trapped Stark in, and as if it was allergic to his aura, all the liquid flew away, revealing Stark's figure as he got up, his eyes red with crimson aura and fury.\nHe had a neutral expression on his face, not saying anything as he immediately began to walk toward the warden, cracking his fingers.\n\"What the…?\" Warden looked back, his eyes widening and actual fear displayed on his face, \"How is this… possible?\"\nBut he wasn't the only one: Sora also looked surprised, unable to comprehend how in the world could Stark get out of such a situation.\nNot only was he out of [Revive Tokens], meaning that he could revive himself alone to begin with, but also that he somehow eliminated all the sculk that stopped him WHILE BEING DEAD.\nNone of this made sense for neither of them.\nAnd all they could do was watch as Stark slowly walked toward them, his eyes so determined and his aura is smooth and powerful there was no saying how strong he had become.\n\"…\" not wanting to back away from a criminal, Warden also began to walk toward Stark while carrying his hammer, the two would soon enough meet.\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWISH~\nAnd add to that…\n['Dodge Control' has been blocked by a \"Dark Sphere\"]\n['Double Assault' has been blocked by a \"Dark Sphere\"]\n['Heaven's Wrath' has been blocked by a \"Dark Sphere\"]\nWarden actually used his three spheres to completely block Stark's three most powerful skills, scared that he would be able to take him by surprise using them.\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Stark shook his head as he spoke, \"Was planning to end your pathetic life with my own hands anyway.\"\nHearing those words, Warden looked at his [Colossal Sculk Hammer] for a few seconds, then threw it toward Stark in a quick gesture.\nThe boy easily avoided it by stepping to the side, his eyes not leaving the warden for a single second as he did that.\n\"Alright, I like to catch prisoners with my own hands too,\" Warden smiled, hiding the small amount of fear deep inside himself as he positioned his own hands, both filled with intense blue aura and sculk, ready to throw down with Stark.\n\"Doesn't matter to me,\" Stark positioned himself as well, \"You're going to die either way, and your first mistake was putting all that shit on top of my body and thinking it could ever stop me.\"\n[Warden HP: 21339/640000]\n[Stark: HP: 1/33500]\nStark was one hit away from dying and didn't have all his skills, while Warden had his advanced armor and all his skills to fight back against the human.\nNo more second chances now, Stark couldn't revive himself if he was hit, meaning that this was his last attempt at beating this hellish trial.\nThe second trial was much, MUCH harder than the first, this was a certainty now.\n\"…\" all Sora could do was watch, her legs damaged, she herself didn't know she could let all these emotions flow so easily at this very moment, and she didn't hate it.\n\"COME AT ME,\" Warden roared, shaking the entire floor.\n\"That's my line,\" Stark responded, he wasn't scared of that thing anymore, all he saw was a parasite trying to stop him from achieving victory.\nStark glanced at Sora one last time, and he quickly nodded at her while smiling, it was reassuring, giving her the impression that Stark could actually win.\nAnd so…\n[FIGHT!]\nWinner takes all, loser goes to the shadow realm.",

      "content": "Not wasting a single second, Warden threw a direct jab, one filled with aura and power, toward Stark.\n[Warden: 10382 speed]\nHis speed stat had actually reached over 10000 from the combination of both [Dark Spheres] and [The End of the Line], meaning that he was confident he would be MUCH faster than any of the humans present in this prison, which is how he had been able to take Stark aback the first time and kill him.\nAnd yet…\n~FWISH~\nStark moved his head to the side, the punch striking only a few centimeters from where he was, yet his pupils never leaving the warden, who was quite surprised by the sheer speed of the human.\nAnd in response…\nStark swung back, his fist filled with crimson aura and rage, aiming for Warden's armor as his face was too difficult to reach.\n\"ARMOR SCULKIFICATION!\" unable to avoid this attack since it was a direct counter of his, Warden activated his skill and filled his entire armor with sculk, pretty much stopping Stark's fist but also… engulfing the boy's arm in sculk again.\n\"You're an idiot, aren't you,\" Warden smiled as he pointed at Stark's right arm, which was progressively getting taken over by the liquid, \"You're done for again.\"\nBut in response, Stark just looked at his arm for a few seconds, tilting his face as if he was confused how did this changed anything.\nAnd then…\n~BOOOOOM~\nHis arm literally exploded with crimson aura, sending away all the sculk that was from it, almost like his aura was an antivirus against that bacteria.\n\"???\" Warden's eyes widened.\n\"I think you're the idiot,\" Stark swung again, and this time the attack actually hit as Warden was sent back by a few meters, although it was just his legs sliding against the ground.\n\"-13827!\" his HP was reduced even more than before, scaring him more than it should.\nHe had vowed to fight against criminals forever, until he died doing his job, and yet… in front of this one prisoner… he felt like he was nothing.\n\"Aura Smash, Crimson Spears,\" he summoned three spears and fists and sent them at the warden, who extremely easily avoided them all, \"Crimson Ball Transmission,\" he summoned the ball in his left hand, but instead of instantly throwing it, he kept it inside, just incase something happened.\n\"SCULK SURGE!\" Warden pointed his arm at Stark, then began to fire bursts of sculk at the boy, who ran around in circles around the boss.\n\"Didn't we say we would only be using our fists?\" Stark tilted his head as he slid on the ground.\n\"You threw projectiles at me, so I consider the deal to be over,\" truthfully, even if Stark hadn't done that, he would have started using his other skills anyway: deep down he knew he wouldn't win against Stark in a one on one with their fists, even though his were enhanced.\n\"Oh well,\" Stark shrugged.\nAnd then…\n~FWISH, DASH~\nHe closed in the distance between the two of them in mere instants, the speed so fast even Sora had a hard time following those two as they exchanged blows and avoided each other.\nThis kept going for a few minutes, none of them to damage one another as the sculk armor absorbed all the damage Stark would deal, while the sculk Warden sent would be neutralized by Stark's aura.\nAnd after a while…\n\"WIELDING CROSS,\" Stark grimaced as he summoned the giant glowing crimson cross right above him.\n\"…!\" Warden took a few step backs.\nBut before he could do anything…\n~FWISH, SWING~\nStark dashed at him again and… swung the giant cross at him, the holy power now also extremely intense, at least strong enough to scare Warden.\n\"COME BACK TO ME, HAMMER OF JUSTICE,\" he pointed his right arm toward his hammer that had fallen right in front of the giant exit door of the prison, and its handle began to be surrounded by dark blue aura.\n~FWISH~\nAnd as if controlled by an invisible thread, the hammer began to float and flew back to Warden's hand, who immediately used it to deflect the first blow of the cross.\nBut the holy power was still slightly more powerful than the warden's counter attack, meaning that even though he didn't receive any damage, he was still pushed back.\n\"What the…\"\nNot letting him a single instant to rest, Stark pushed himself toward Warden, swinging his cross to the other side as he spanned.\nYet again, it was met with the powerful hammer of the warden, who deflected it.\n[One attack remaining!]\nHis cross could only attack one more time before disappearing, and so Stark knew he needed to make it count.\nHe jumped in the air, joining his two hands together and mimicking the movement of Warden smashing his [Colossal Sculk Hammer] at Stark like before.\nAnd so… the cross did the same, rushing at Warden from above.\n\"…!\" this attack was much more powerful than the others somehow, and he knew he wouldn't be able to deflect it without receiving damage.\nSo he decided to finally end this once and for all, actually using his brain to outsmart Stark.\nHe had always thought using sheer strength would be enough as he was extremely powerful, but that didn't seem to be the case against all opponents, you actually needed to use your brain against some otherwise you would lose, don't you, huh?\n\"FLICKERING MOVEMENTS!\"\n~CLICK~\nStark's vision went completely dark, as if all the light had been purposely shut in his eyes.\nAnd then…\n~CLICK~\nHis vision came back.\n\"Goodbye,\" and as expected, Warden was right behind him, already beginning to swing down his hammer.\nBut…\n\"Dumbass,\" Stark smiled as he snapped his fingers.\n~SNAP, FWISH~\nRemember how he had used [Crimson Ball Transmission] yet kept the crimson ball in his hands?\nWell… right as his vision went black, he immediately gently threw the ball behind him without even looking back, meaning that it landed RIGHT behind Warden.\n~SMASH~\nWarden smashed his hammer in Stark's location, creating a massive explosion and a crater forming in that spot.\nBut Stark was already behind him in the air, ready to punch him one last time and finally end this battle once and for all.\n\"…\" Warden's horns glowed intensely, and then… the monster looked back with a wide smile on his face, as if he had predicted that Stark would do that.\n\"…?\" Stark was confused, but he still went for the kill, as there was no reason not to hit when he had the opportunity to.\nAnd yet… just as his fist was about to connect…\n~FWISH, CLANG~\nA collar-like chain wrapped itself around his neck, closing in on him as he was suddenly held back.\n\"Fucking… IDIOT,\" Warden laughed maniacally as he saw Stark on the ground, \"You were SOOOO focused on everything you didn't even notice the chain slowly approach you!\"\nThat's right, Warden had activated [Prisoner Chain], yet instead of making it go fast, he could also make it go slowly as to not alert his opponent.\nAnd so just like that… Stark was stuck with a sculk-filled chain around his neck, one that would normally stop him from moving.\nWarden lifted his hammer as he arrived in front of Stark, ready to finally end all of this, having outsmarted the human.\n\"So long, prisoner.\"\nAnd then… he swung down.",

You can move now… you got stronger…\" the first time he had been hit by [Prisoner Chain], the sculk and chain made it impossible for him to move as he was restrained, yet now… he was able to move with a neutral expression as it if meant nothing.\nAnd then…\n~BOOM~\nStark's neck literally exploded with aura as well, letting out a crimson fire that burned all the sculk, and weakening the chain as it was made of the same stuff.\n\"…?\" Warden was surprised: his chain was actually designed to be EXTREMELY durable, so durable actually that it would take around five hits from his hammer to break it.\nAnd yet… here Stark was, weakening the chain with that same neutral expression, with his aura alone.\nJust how powerful was that crimson aura? Maybe even more powerful than even his?\n'It's fine, he weakened it, but I can still act!' Warden dashed at Stark as he knew that the chain wouldn't go down with only that.\n\"Crimson Spears,\" but the boy summoned two spears: one was aimed at the chain that came from the ceiling, cutting it in half.\nThe [Prisoner Chain] collar that had been around his neck immediately vanished as its link had been cut, thus freeing him and allowing him to retrieve his movements.\nAnd as for the other spear…\n\"Crimson spear, please shape my path,\" Stark's eyes glowed as he sent it toward Warden.\n\"FOOLISH,\" but Warden just crouched down to avoid it, since it was aimed at his head, why would the prisoner even attempt such a useless attack after everything they had gone through, did he not learn that Warden was now much faster?\nBut wait… was it truly aimed at his head?\nOr…\n\"=)\" Stark smiled as he saw the warden crouch, because at that moment, he knew that he had won.\n~FWISH, SNAP~\n\"…!\"\nWarden actually stopped in his rush toward Stark, his eyes widening as he clenched his chest, his body trembling as he looked up at Stark, who was still smiling.\n\"What?\" Stark mockingly asked as the warden had stopped.\n\"Y-You…\" Warden looked up… and… one of his cores had been shattered by the spear.\nThe dust and dark blue remains fell in his hands, and all he could do was clench them both, anger filling his entire being.\nHe didn't receive damage from that, but it greatly decreased his powers and actually hurt him like hell, who said monsters couldn't feel pain? Judicator, Sierra and Warden sure as hell did, but maybe it was because they could talk that Stark noticed it.\nBasically, Warden's cores are like his hearts, so what Stark did was like stabbing a human heart and shattering it in 1000 pieces.\n\"PRISONNNERRRRRRRR,\" he shouted, creating yet another spiral of sculk around him.\n\"Fine by me,\" Stark kept smiling.\nAfter all… if one of the [Dark Spheres] that had been blocked was destroyed, it meant… that he got back one of his abilities!\n['Double Assault' has been retrieved!]\nStark joined his hands together as he saw Warden approach him, spinning his hammer in his right hand as his eyes were filled with darkness.\n\"…\" Sora on the other hand was just a spectator of it all, \"These two are… what the hell are you… Stark Heartsouls…\"\nShe knew of Stark's real name since she knew about him in real life, but she would have never, even in a thousand years, guessed that this guy was such… a monster.\nAnd he was doing all of this to save her (at least that's what she told herself).\n\"Aura Smash,\" Stark sent three fists toward Warden, who didn't even bother to avoid them: the sole spiral of aura surrounding him literally evaporated the attacks, meaning no projectiles could get close to him anymore.\nIt was a physical match now.\nWarden put himself in his position, he spread his legs, his sculk arm placed in front of his face, while he was spinning his hammer in the other one: he truly was ready to end it all.\nStark, on the other hand made quick jumps from left to right, his two fists in front of his face.\nBoth of them knew that this was the final assault of this battle.\n\"It was interesting while it lasted, prisoner.\"\n\"Couldn't agree more!\" Stark smiled.\nAnd then…\n\"DOUBLE ASSAULT!\"\n\"THE END OF THE LINE!\"\n~BOOM, FWISH~\nBoth their legs exploded with aura as they closed in the distance between each other, Warden's hammer swinging while Stark's arm responded.\nBut Warden didn't realize, just HOW strong Stark was when using [Double Assault].\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWISH~\nStark was WAY, WAY, WAYYYYY too fast, even for Warden to comprehend.\n~BLOCK~\nHe blocked the blow with his hammer, but before he could even respond, Stark disappeared from his view.\n[Horns Detection: Behind]\nHe turned around to block another attack.\nStark was running everywhere around the floor, leaving a trail of dark crimson aura, impossible to completely follow his movements as he attacked from different spots.\n[Horns Detection: LEFT! RIGHT! UP! DOWN! BELOW! ON YOUR LEFT!]\nEven his [Horns Detection] was struggling to keep up as it was clearly overwhelmed.\n[15 seconds of 'Double Assault' remaining]\nIn addition to that, Stark had upgraded [Double Assault] before, and the new perk increased the usage from 10 to 20 seconds, meaning he could afford to do what he was doing.\n[Horns Detection: L-Left!]\nStark appeared on the left as instructed, and Warden swung his hammer toward it.\nBut…\n~FWISH~\nBefore the hammer connected with his attack, Stark used his speed to slide behind Warden.\n[Horns Detection: BEHIND! BEHIND! BEHIND!]\n~SMASH~\nHe instantly smashed his hammer behind him thinking that Stark was there, but…\n\"Idiot~\" Stark jumped in the air and… punched another one of the warden's cores.\n~SMASH, SNAP~\nIt shattered as well.\n[Two cores destroyed, one remains]\n\"GAhhhh…\" Warden fell to his knees while still deflecting Stark's attacks, his entire body was trembling, a second one of his hearts was destroyed, and if this kept going then he would surely die, \"FUCK YOU PRISONER-\"\nBut right as he shouted…\n\"Shhh…\" Stark arrived in front of him, punching his hand upward, resulting in the heavy hammer to be sent flying toward the ceiling as his grip on it weakened.\n~FWISH~\nStark jumped in the air toward the hammer, and while he was still above, both Sora and Warden looking at him…\n~CRACK… BOOM~\nHe split the hammer in two, separating its handle from its head, meaning that it was useless and unusable, then launching the two parts in different directions.\n['Dodge Control' has been retrieved!]\n\"DODGE CONTROL,\" he immediately used his skill as he descended back toward Warden, who through his sheer determination got up and was waiting for Stark to use his entire strength to punch him.\nBut…\n~FWISH~\nThanks to [Dodge Control], he is easily avoided all the attacks.\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWISH~\nWarden went on a crazy rampage, swinging his fists everywhere and extremely fast, putting his entire energy on his attacks as he only needed to just TOUCH Stark once.\nAnd yet… nothing would hit.\nStark would LITERALLY teleport away from his attack at times, making it impossible for the warden to hit him.\n[7 seconds remain for 'Double Assault']\n[12 seconds remain for 'Dodge Control']\nThe reason Stark wasn't actually hitting Warden was because he literally couldn't: he threw way too many attacks, and [Dodge Control] gave him less control over his own body, meaning that even with its new perk, it was still hard to throw even one punch.\nAnd yet… after a few seconds…\nStark saw THE opportunity.\nA crimson line formed, moving in different directions toward the boss.\n\"IT'S THE END, WARDEN,\" Stark rushed while following that line, avoiding all the attacks.\n~FWISH~\nHe spanned in the air as he avoided a [Warden Smash], arriving in front of the last [Dark Sphere], and then…\n~PUNCH, BOOOOOM~\nHe punched it, using all his strength to take over his body for this simple action.\n[All cores have been destroyed!]\n['Heaven's Wrath' has been retrieved!]\nSuddenly, the warden stopped everything he was doing, kneeling on the ground as liters of blood poured out from his mouth and nose.\n\"This is… insane…\" he had a hard time breathing, and once he looked up… all he saw… was Stark, who was peeking at him from above, a wide and terrifying smile on his face.\n\"Are you done?\" he asked, his gaze piercing the warden's soul.\nAnd all the monster could do… was look down.\nHe was finished: even though he could rebuild his cores over time, he was too weakened to fight back anymore.\nStark… won.\nThe prisoners… won…",

      "content": "[Finish him]\nWarden was kneeling, all his organs screaming for him to get up, yet it was impossible as all his cores had been destroyed, which were basically his hearts and the thing that kept his 'essence' alive.\nEven if he somehow found the strength to get up, not only would he not be able to use his hammer, let alone summon it, but he wouldn't be able to use any of his skills or his sculk either.\nHe was fucked.\n\"Goodbye,\" Stark drew a circle in his palm, then pointed at the ceiling: he wanted to end this with a bang.\n\"HEAVEN'S WRATH,\" the crimson glow appeared on the ceiling, slowly charging up while Warden was unaware of it above since he couldn't even use [Horns Detection] properly either.\nThen… Stark just ran away, heading toward Sora, and arriving in front of her in less than a second.\n\"C'mon, you owe me a lot for this,\" he shrugged as he carried her body and put her on his back, giving her a piggyback ride.\n\"…\" Sora was back to her neutral and emotionless self, she had felt strong emotions during the fight as she knew her life was also on the line, and all that happened was frankly crazy, but now she was back to her normal self, \"What about him,\" she pointed at the Warden, who was clenching his fists, his face mere centimeters away from the ground as he let out lots of blood from his mouth, \"Aren't you going to kill him?\"\n\"He is already done for,\" Stark looked back at her, and she just nodded as he pointed above, making her notice that crimson glow that was on the verge of exploding, its aura so powerful even Sora knew this was bad.\n\"Huh, what about it-\" she didn't even have the time to finish her sentence that…\n~BOOOOOOOM~\nThe powerful ray of crimson light descended from above, piercing through the ceiling and reaching Warden, who could only look up at the last second, his expression filled with utter despair as the attack reached him.\nThe blast created a shockwave that echoed throughout the entire prison, and it was for one simple reason: the beam actually traversed the ENTIRE foundation of the prison, from top to bottom.\nUnfortunately, all monsters were \"unsummoned\" once all participants reached the next floor, but this would have made Stark get at least 10 levels otherwise.\n\"AAAAAAAAGGGGHHHHHHHHHH-\" Warden screamed pierced their ears as they stood in front of the beam, observing its beauty, strands of golden holy aura also apparent in it for some reason, \"PRIISOONNNERRRRRR-\"\nAnd then… nothing, no more sound, no more nothing, the Warden's presence had been completely erased.\nThe crimson of the beam hit Stark's and Sora's face as she peeked from his shoulder, her head cutely placed on it, although she wasn't blushing or anything as she remained emotionless, all she wanted was just to leave and go back to the safety of her home (well more like mansion, y'know).\n\"…\" Stark looked at the beam for a whole minute, not averting his gaze even after it had disappeared, and it was as if he was lost in his own thoughts after everything that happened, his mind trying to replay the entire fight to assure that he did everything he did right.\n\"Hey?\" Sora shook her hand in front of his face, bringing him back to reality.\nAs the beam disappeared, all that was left was a massive circular crater, and below it, you could see the four other floors as the power of the attack was so strong that it broke through the entire structure of the prison.\nWarden was nowhere to be found, not even his ashes were visible anymore, like the other enemies Stark annihilated with the destructive beam.\nWarden's legacy… was truly over.\nAnd so that could only mean one thing…\n[You have slain 'Warden, The Prisoner Killer lvl125', gained 5,240,000EXP!]\n\"Finally,\" Stark let out a sigh of relief, still gazing at the spot where the beam had struck.\nNo more tricks, that thing was truly dead.\nAnd even cooler, the amount of EXP Stark got was exceptional.\n\"Did you get experience too?\" he asked Sora, wondering if such a system existed as it would be unfair for only one person to get EXP if everyone fought, although this time he did most of the work.\n\"Yes,\" Sora nodded, \"Around 1.8 million, what about you?\" she asked.\n\"Haha…\" Stark scratched the back of his head, \"Huh, a little above 5 million!\"\n\"…\" Sora didn't show or say anything, but deep inside even she was astonished by the amount: this was beyond ANYTHING they had gotten until now.\nShe almost felt humiliated that she had gotten so little since it meant that she did much less work than Stark (which was true), and she was ashamed of herself for letting him save her not once, but twice!\nIn the end, she just sighed as she acknowledged the boy's strength: there was no denying he was her savior, and she was grateful for that.\n~DING~\n~DING, DING~\nSora was surrounded by the golden glow of leveling up once, while Stark twice.\n'Feels farm…' she thought, she had never been close to anyone, but the warmth of someone as they leveled up felt very comfortable.\n[Your level has increased to level 59, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 60, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Experience: 1293711/2150000]\n'…'\nHe was level 60, meaning that he would be able to unlock another skill using a card.\nBut before he could even do that… a crimson panel appeared in front of both Sora and Stark.\nAnd it could only be one thing…\n[The 'Warden' has been defeated!]\n[Survivors: 2]\n[CONGRATULATIONS], as this panel appeared, dozens upon dozens of confetti and fireworks lit up and exploded right before reaching the high ceiling, the face of both Stark and Sora drawn with the fireworks.\n[You have officially completed the second domination trial \"Lucullus Prison\" from the \"Death\" difficulty, granting both of you incredible rewards based on effort in the trial!]\nAnd then, another panel appeared before Stark, this one different from Sora's as it was the rewards they would receive, each one of them getting different ones as it wouldn't be fair for all of them to get the same rewards if one person clearly did more than the other.\nAnd obviously…\n[MVP: Chosen]\n[+3 Equipment Pieces, +20000 HP]\n\"Ready,\" Stark suddenly said while looking at Sora, who was also inspecting her panel.\n\"…\" she just nodded, making sure to hold Stark as her legs were pretty damaged from the attacks of the warden.\n\"Alright!\" he warmly smiled as he began to walk toward the giant metal door.\nAnd right as they checked all their panels…\n[Opening exit!]\nThe sound of machinery became ten times more intense, gray smoke escaping from every part of the giant metal door as pipes were going up and down, buttons were flickering, and cogwheels were turning.\n~CREAK~\nThe middle part of the metal door began to slowly separate one side from the other, opening itself as Stark continued walking toward it.\nA bright light could be seen on the other side, impossible to see what was beyond as it was completely white.\nAnd after a minute…\n~SWHIP~\nThe sound of machinery completely stopped, and the metal door stopped moving as it opened more than enough for them to pass through.\nStark stopped right before he was about to enter the light, with no way to return, looking back at floor 0.\nThere was lots of damage on it from the battle of him against Warden, and all he could do was sigh as he remembered everything that had happened.\n10 were alive at the fourth sublevel a few hours ago, and now that they were at the top, only 2 were left, mostly because they all killed each other for rewards and items.\n\"…\" Stark let out a quick smile.\n\"Let's just go,\" Sora dared to ask, she truly hated that place, especially this floor.\n\"Fine,\" Stark shrugged as he passed the threshold of the metal door and entered the light.\n[2 people have successfully escaped the 'Lucullus Prison'!]\n[Sending you back to a \"safe place\"!]\nStark's body began to slowly evaporate, starting from his legs and going up his torso and head, and Sora as well.\n\"Hey, Stark,\" Sora suddenly spoke, breaking the silence as they were traversing the threshold between reality and the trial.\n\"Oh, you know my name, huh,\" Stark sighed, \"What do you want?\"\n\"Thank you,\" this was all she wanted to say as she actually ALMOST let out a smile.\n\"No problem,\" Stark patted her head, it was just a reflex at this point and he quickly realized what he did so he removed it, \"If we meet each other again, which probably won't happen, then just treat me somewhere!\"\n\"Deal,\" she nodded.\nAnd then…\n~FWISH, FWISH~\nTheir bodies evaporated, then were sent back to reality.\n[Congratulations on completing the second 'Domination' trial!]\n[You're on a roll, Chosen!]",

      "content": "\"HWAHHH~\" Stark opened his eyes.\n~SPLASH, SPLASH~\n\"Huh?\" every time he moved to get up, he could hear the sound of water, and that's when he remembered, \"Oh shit…\"\nHe had fought Soulayer right before entering the trial, thus meaning that he had been transported to the trial from this location, and so he was back here when he woke up since his \"real life\" body never left that space, or at least that's what he theorized.\nHe got up from his slumber, the back of his head wet from staying in the 'soul water' for a long time.\n\"Oh,\" and as he looked up, he saw that Soulayer's body was still lying there, dead, \"I mean… I guess I did kill him heh…\"\nBut that wasn't what interested Stark, instead, what did was…\n\"Here!\" it was the two dark blue sparkles around Soulayer's body as they were pieces of equipment dropped from defeating the boss.\nHe had failed to grab them right before being transported to the trial, but luckily they were still here, and seems like nobody even came to this place as his body would have probably been found.\nIn the end, none of this really mattered: he had completed the trial, got his rewards, and now had five pieces of equipment to check out/sell.\nHe kneeled down to grab both dark blue sparkles and placed them inside his [Spatial Inventory], not wanting to stay any longer since this place smelled awful because of the rotting corpse of Soulayer.\nBut… wait a damn minute…\nHow can a corpse rot so fast…?\nHe had only been gone for a few hours… so…\n\"…!\"\n[You have been inside the 'Lucullus Prison' for 3 weeks!]\n\"…\" Stark sighed, \"Alright.\"\nHe had believed that time would flow NORMALLY, much like during the first trial, but it looks like he was wrong, every trial had a different concept of time.\n\"Need to get out anyway,\" he mumbled as he noticed that a portal had appeared in the distance on top of the 'soul water'.\nHe marched toward it, then jumped with not a second of hesitation.\nNot a single thing was going through his mind at that moment except for the intense desire so sleep on the bed of his new hotel room.\nThings such as his new skill, checking out his equipment, or whatever else that would happen in the future… didn't matter, just for this moment.\n~FWISH~\nStark traversed the portal and immediately was sent back to the start of the rift, where dozens upon dozens of people could still be seen fighting monsters to level up.\nYet, the moment he left the portal…\nAn overwhelming aura completely twisted the atmosphere, taking aback everyone, monsters and classifiers.\nAnd then… sensing its source, everyone turned their eyes to look at him.\nEveryone's heart raced with caution and a bit of fear as they saw Stark walk toward them, his body completely covered with crimson aura, yet his eyes looking into the void, tired, yet still powerful.\nThey let him pass easily as he kept going in a straight line, making sure not to annoy such a being as they felt it in their bones that this thing was extremely powerful.\nAnd then…\n~FWISH~\nStark jumped into the exit portal, leaving that rift behind.\n\"What the fuck was that?\"\n\"Contact the association, was that a monster?!\"\n\"No, its a human, just forget about it and don't lose focus!\"\nSome just wanted to forget about that thing, although it would probably haunt their nightmares.\n\"…\" Stark kept his neutral expression as he was transported through the threshold between the rift and reality, and after a few seconds…\n~FWISH~\nHe emerged on the other side.\nYet again, his arrival was met with several reactions, and some even tried to some him, but one look from his tired eyes was enough to stop them from acting or touching him.\nStark… just… wanted… to… rest.\nStark arrived in the massive room which regrouped all the portals to different rifts, thousands upon thousands of classifiers there.\n\"...\" the number of widened eyes on him obviously increased, more and more people stopping to check out what that boy was doing, as his aura was still sickening to be around.\nBut then...\n\"Hey, bud,\" a classifier with a large chin and. very short gray hair, almost making him look bald, could be heard behind Stark.\nStark turned around, his movements slow and smooth, making it feel like he could black out at any time.\nThe man before Stark was alone, and he was decently muscular, although not on the extreme side like some other people, he was indeed tall though, at around 1.85cm.\n\"What the fuck are you doing?\" the man spoke as soon as Stark looked at him in the eyes, the vortex of aura still in them as it took the man aback the moment he saw them, but he quickly recovered as to not lose face, \"You're scaring people, why don't you leave?\"\nThat guy tried so hard to act menacing, but Stark squinted his eyes in annoyance, clearly realizing what he was trying to do: he was just trying to be a hero, speaking up for the others, and receiving praise if Stark does leave.\n\"Hey,\" Stark spoke as he looked at him, and even the tone of his voice sent shivers down the man's spine, \"Fuck off.\"\nAnd so Stark turned back, walking toward the exit again.\nBut... the man couldn't allow that: if Stark had the last word of the matter, then he would just seem like a coward who ran away and be more humiliated than all the others.\nAnd so...\n~FWISH, DASH~\nHe summoned his sword, which was a claymore, in his hands, and dashed at Stark.\n'I'm level 92, there's no chance he can beat me, his aura is probably just for intimidation!'\nHe didn't realize though... that Stark had just went through fucking hell, a hell he would have died in for sure.\nAnd so... right as he swung his sword down...\n~FWISH, BAM~\nStark, without even looking back, took one step to the side, avoiding the attack, and then... he punched the man in the stomach, not even letting him follow up with another strike.\n~BOOM~\nThe impact could be heard through the entire room, the man sent flying toward the wall as everyone avoided his body.\nHe crashed against it and fell unconscious, the stares of everyone on him before looking back at Stark, astonished expressions on their faces.\n\"You were also just a false hero...\" Stark mumbled as he finally left the room, nobody else annoying him after that even though his aura became even more powerful, remembering Warden increasing his power.\nHe arrived onto the streets, even more people watching and filming him, some even doing live streams, garnering thousands of viewers, yet all were shocked at the sight of Stark.\nHe hailed for a taxi, yet even after five minutes no one stopped for him, all too scared their lives.\n\"...\"\nKnowing no one would stop, Stark grabbed his phone from his [Spatial Inventory].\nAnd... he did the unthinkable: he contacted Lana Moonless.\n[You have 136 unread messages and 28 missed phone calls]\n\"...\" Stark didn't even bother reading any of it.\nInstead, he began to type on his phone.\n[Stark Heartsouls: Help, I'm at the fighting district, can you come pick me up?]\nThis was all he said, it was currently 7pm, so he didn't expect any response for awhile.\nYet...\n~DING~\nHis message was immediately set as \"read\", and a response came even faster.\n[Lana Moonless: Where were you again? Anyway, don't move I'm close so I'll be there in 10 minutes!]",

      "content": "\"Oh wow,\" Stark was surprised she responded this quick, \"Must mean she was really worried, but oh well.\"\nTo be honest, Stark was mostly focused on fighting and getting stronger, so romantic relationships were something who didn't pass through his head even once.\nWhether in his past life as an accountant or this one, who would him anyway?\nAnd so after ten minutes of just waiting, the overwhelming crimson aura not disappearing once, and even Stark not knowing how to remove it...\n~VROOM~\nA beautiful luxury car painted in red appeared before him.\nSome classifiers even stopped pointing at him and filming his appearance to check out the car, as it was a beast that would probably cost a fortune.\n\"What the hell happened to you?\" Lana had a weirded out expression as she lowered the windows, confused how Stark could end up like this.\n\"Stuff,\" Stark was actually surprised she was able to recognize him even though his appearance should be hidden by the aura, but oh well, a stalker always recognizes their target, don't they?\n\"Anyway, just get in, we have things to talk about,\" Lana patted the seat beside hers, and Stark got inside the car, a cute smile on her face as she didn't look scared of Stark one bit in comparison to all the others.\n\"Thanks.\"\nAnd so just like them, both of then drove off, toward Stark's hotel room as he instructed the blonde-haired girl.\n***\n(20 minutes later)\nThe ride was just Lana talking about what she did during those three weeks, while Stark remained silent, too tired to even engage in the conversation.\nAnd Lana clearly noticed it as she noticed his eyes were slowly closing, although he was trying not to fall asleep.\n\"Here we are,\" she parked herself in an empty spot.\n\"Anyway, thanks,\" Stark was grateful, and he got out of the car.\nBut...\n~TUT, TUT~\nLana also left, locking the car behind her.\n\"What?\" he titled his head.\n\"I'll just stay a bit, I did say I wanted to talk about something, right? If you read my messages you should know about it,\" Lana raised her eyebrows, absolutely confident Stark hadn't read any of them.\n\"Huh...\" Stark scratched his head, \"Yeah... just come up.\"\nThey reached his hotel room rather quickly, and Stark was thankful he had paid for a full month stay, otherwise it would have probably been taken by someone else.\n\"Nothing much,\" Stark opened the door and welcomed Lana in, he was still tired but if she wanted to say something important, then he would need to listen.\nNot wasting a single second, he jumped and laid on the bed, his face staring at the ceiling, yet his body still surrounded with that crimson aura.\n\"Anyway, I'll be quick,\" Lana pulled out her phone and tapped a few times on it, before pointing the screen at Stark.\nAnd on it was written…\n[Rift Conqueror Academy Entrance Ceremony Cooldown: 3 days]\n\"…!\" Stark's eyes widened, he had literally completely forgotten about it, his thoughts only filled with the idea of finally resting after going through that trial.\n\"Yeah, as you may know, the academy is in the capital, which is the most powerful part of the entirety of Fellarburg as it regroups all the guilds and classifiers that truly make a difference, meaning that we'll need to go move there,\" she said casually as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.\n\"…\" Stark just stared at her as she explained.\n\"My father has already recommended you and paid for the tuition fee, meaning you should have received an email containing all the information, anyway, I already got a train scheduled to move me to the capital as it will take a few hours to reach it,\" she smiled, \"Oh and, don't tell it to anyone, but I heard anyone who is late by even a single minute to the ceremony will be instantly expelled, truly harsh huh…\"\n\"Huh…\" Stark's face was slowly darkening, at least more than it already had.\n\"…\" Lana stared at him for a second, before letting out a giant laugh, \"Hahaahahha~ I knew you would know nothing, It's just like you,\" she wiped one of her eyes with one of her fingers, \"Don't worry, I also got you a train ticket!\"\n\"Oh!\" he almost wanted to jump and hug her, but being tried and in this form made it kind of hard, \"Thanks!\"\nStark had the habit of checking his emails since he was an accountant before, so he would have surely figured it out, but the [Domination] trial had put him to sleep for three weeks, meaning he couldn't know anything.\n\"Anyway, I'll let you rest, make sure not oversleep as I'll come pick you up tomorrow,\" she gently waved at Stark as she headed toward the exit, peeking her beautiful face out of the door right before closing it, \"See you later, Stark.\"\n\"Cya,\" she was cute, but Stark just wanted to sleep, as so as soon as she closed the door…\n~FWISH, SLAM~\nHe immediately fell asleep, not able to contain it the dizziness in his head anymore.\n***\n~FWISH~\n\"…\" Stark opened his eyes, and once he got up, \"Ah shit, here we go again.\"\nHe was yet again in the black void again.\nAnd obviously, before him were [Alchemist] and… huh, what?\n[Alchemist] was there in his white robe and holding his potions.\nBut…\n[Domination], even though he was weird, looked different than usual.\nHe still had that giant smile on his face, one that was evil, much like the [Superior Clone], but… instead of his body being completely made out of crimson aura, his pupils had a golden cross in them, and strands of holy aura could be seen in his figure.\n\"New look,\" Stark smiled.\n\"You could say that,\" [Domination] responded.\nThe reason was obvious: [Domination] had merged with [Exorcist], meaning that they became one, although it seemed like [Domination]'s personality completely ruled out [Exorcist], fragments of his holy aura and power being the only thing left.\nIn the end, it didn't matter, as it meant less annoying doppelgängers to speak to.\n\"Good work,\" Alchemist clapped his hands together.\n\"I do agree,\" Domination nodded.\nIt was the first time they actually praised Stark instead of blatantly insulting him or criticizing what he was doing.\n\"But…\" Domination's expression darkened, \"It is not over.\"\n\"Remember you're starting your life inside that rift conqueror academy or whatever, be ready to fight things possibly even stronger than the warden,\" Alchemist shrugged.\n\"…\" Stark nodded.\nAnd then…\n\"\"Get up, then, dumbass,\"\" both Alchemist and Domination (Exorcist) spoke, pointing at the sky.\nAnd when Stark looked up, he saw a giant demon, one that looked very similar to EGO.\n\"It's time for things to get real,\" Domination snapped his fingers, and both of them, as well as the demon, disappeared.\nAnd just like that, Stark's consciousness began to fade as well.\nHe knew that what they said was true: the Rift Conqueror Academy regrouped people that were over level 125, meaning that they some would potentially be able to fight back against Warden, if not beat him.\nAnd… he would have to join this academy, and fight his way to the top to survive as the passing rate for JUST the first year is less than 5%.\nJust how bad could this school be…?\nWell… he was about to find out.\nThat it was true hell as well.",

So it didn't make much more of a difference, since whatever they did, it could NEVER, EVER, be as bad as the [Domination] trial, especially the last one with that warden.\nThen he moved on to his messages, and he had actually received a new one from Lana right after sleeping.\n[Lana Moonless: I'll be coming at exactly 3PM since the train leaves at 4PM, please be ready and have your luggage with everything, we won't be coming back here for a very long time since the capital has EVERYTHING needed.]\nThis was good.\nBut this also meant one thing: Stark was finally able to check out everything he wanted to check, since it gave him enough time to do so.\nHe had 6 pieces of equipment to check: 1 from the Corrupted Ghoul, 2 from Soulayer, and 3 from the trial.\nIn addition to that, he also had his [Conjoined Warrior's Cloak] and [Mirror Master's Crystal Shard], which he had NEVER used before as they were way too annoying to do so in battle.\nThe latter could be infused into a ring, so Stark thought he should maybe look into that.\nYet Stark hadn't noticed one thing until now: the fact [Soulbearer's Embrace] had not activated even ONCE during the trial to give him back some of his health.\nAnd the reason was simple: once Stark reached for his neck… the necklace wasn't there anymore.\nAt some point, probably before the trial even started, he had lost it as it could easily be detached from his neck if the battle became too intense, no wonder it was only from the [Rare] category.\n\"Fucking hell,\" Stark sighed, but it didn't matter much to be honest as the amount of health he regained at this point would be so small and insignificant there would be no point in even having it: he needed better equipment/items now.\n\"Status window,\" he whispered.\n…\n[Level:] 60\n[Health:] 57000/57000\n[Bloodline:] Human\n[Classes:] Domination; Alchemist; Exorcist (Absorbed by Domination).\n[Talent:] Chosen one\n[Attributes:] Strength 3781; Speed 4309; Mind/Soul 4223; Stamina 3956; Defense 3512\n…\nHis HP had indeed gone up by 20000 in addition to the ones he got from leveling up, meaning he was more resistant, which was good.\n[Skill Points: 24 Available]\n'I should probably wait to upgrade my skills to silver though as to allow them to be upgrade to level 25…' he thought, it would definitely be the smarter option since upgrading [Domination] and the essential skills was definitely the right choice.\nSo for now… he just needs to check his equipment, then try to go to the trading district to buy everything he needs when he is at the capital, the strongest place of Fellarburg, and also the biggest.\nAnd of course, sell the spare equipment, he still had [Sierra's Crystal Bow] after all since he kept it in case he ended up being an archer, but looks like fate decided otherwise.\n\"Spatial Inventory,\" Stark summoned the inventory right above his bed, then thought of all the items before pulling them out one after the other.\nSix sparkles were now on his bed, so brilliant in fact it was impossible to see what the item was, increasing the element of surprise.\nStark reached for one of them, it was an actual eyeball the size of Stark's palm, and immediately...\n...\n[Item:] The Ghoul's Corrupted Eye\n[Type:] Arrow Spell\n[Class:] Archer\n[Tier:] Legendary\n[Required Level:] 100\n[Quality:] Normal\n[Attributes:] +1200 Mind, +1000 HP\n[Special Perks:] infuse this eye into a ring or around a necklace, then wear it to be able to cast the [Corruption] spell around your arrows, each time an arrow hit, the enemy will be slightly more corrupted, until eventually unable to even move.\n...\n'Archer...' Stark thought, basically he couldn't use it, and the fact it was legendary meant even more cash by selling it.\nThen he quickly moved to the other sparkles, this time reaching for the dark green ones, which were from Soulayer.\nHe reached for one of the items, and it was... a sword, a greatsword to be precise, the exact one Soulayer had been wielding when he was fighting him in that rift right before entering the domination trial, so Stark knew that it was pretty powerful just by its looks.\n...\n[Item:] Soulayer's Greatsword\n[Type:] Sword\n[Class:] Warrior\n[Tier:] Legendary\n[Required Level:] 110\n[Quality:] Artifact\n[Attributes:] +2000 Strength\n[Special Perks:] None, it's just a really good sword.\n...\nAnd the next item was... something he had actually never gotten until now.\nIt was but a simple piece of paper, on it was the drawing of three green orbs with creepy faces on them, a text reading [Triple Soul Summon] above.\n...\n[Item:] Skill Card\n[Skill:] Triple Soul Summon\n[Class:] Magus, Assassin, Soul Wielder\n[Rank:] Epic\n[Description:] Summon three souls that aid you in battle, enhancing three of your weapons/skills.\n...\nIt was a downgrade of the real thing as the real skill was [Mythical] and much more powerful than that, but oh well, it could get him good money anyway, so he didn't ask questions, it was already a privilege to be able to earn money like that instead of working a 9-5 like in his previous life.\nStark threw the two items from Soulayer on the bed right next to the bow, ghoul eye and warrior cloak as they were of no use to him, then turned toward the final and most interesting items: the ones granted to him by the [Domination] trial.\nHe reached for the first one, and it was... a horn, just a single horn, one that looked oddly similar to the ones Warden was wearing.\n...\n[Item:] Warden's Horn\n[Type:] Wearable\n[Class:] All\n[Tier:] Legendary\n[Required Level:] 50\n[Quality:] Good\n[Special Perk:] Ability for the user to use \"Horns Detection\", Warden's Skill, when you put this horn on your head (it will automatically stick once you put it against it)\n...\nStark noticed that the required level was lower, something he could actually use, as any class could use it as well.\nHe hadn't really paid attention, but all other pieces of equipment required a level well above 100 since the monsters he had defeated to get those were around that level.\nYet... for the [Domination] items, the level was enough for him to use it, probably since the trial itself knew that this was the level of its winning participants.\nBut even then...\n'Useless,' he threw the horn in the pile of items he would sell.\nWhy you ask?\nWell.... because... [Horns Detection] was simply worse than [Focus], just a downgrade version of the skill, so what would be the point in keeping it.\nMoving on to the next item, and it was... a giant fucking hammer.\n'Yeah, no,' Stark didn't even bother checking it out, all that he knew was that its name was [Warden's Sculk Hammer] and that it had no special perks.\nAnd then… he turned his eyes toward the last item.\nIt was his final chance to get something that could actually help him…\n\"Come on,\" Stark's aura actually began to appear around him as he reached for it.",

      "content": "Stark reached for the final item of the lot, hoping with all his being that it would be useful in battle to him.\nHe literally only had two pieces of equipment: the [Purgatory Shadow] which was way too useful and saved his life quite sometimes already, and the [Crystalheart Band] which absorbed 10 percent of damage, pretty useless to be honest as he could die from pretty much anything and the damage removed wasn't even noticeable.\nThere were probably some [Mythical] equipment pieces that remove up to 90 percent of damage received, this was a certainty, but Stark wouldn't afford or be able to use them anyway.\n\"COME ON,\" he swiftly grabbed the dark blue, and in his hands was… a necklace, \"Oh.\"\nImmediately, Stark realized what this was.\n…\n[Item:] Sculk Necklace\n[Type:] Necklace\n[Class:] Domination\n[Tier:] Mythical\n[Required Level:] 60\n[Quality:] Artifact\n[Special Perk:] Ability for the user to use three 'sculk attacks', with a 12 hours cooldown between use.\n…\n'…!' it was perfect: for the [Domination] class but also within his level range, and also the special perk did seem interesting.\nHe didn't understand what it meant with 'three sculk attacks', but he could always try it out in the [Memories Museum], couldn't he?\n'Ok, now I need to sell the rest and buy that stupid breakthrough stone…' Stark mumbled.\nHe took a quick shower (he hadn't bathed for three weeks and the black water was actually disgusting), then wore some clothes and went outside.\nAs expected, rumors and videos of him yesterday spread across the entire city, if not country.\nDozens of videos of him walking and knocking out that classifier with one carefree punch spread like wildfire, people wondering who that mysterious entity (yes, entity, that thing couldn't be human), was.\nIn the end, Stark hailed for a taxi, someone actually stopping this time, and headed toward the trading district to do everything he needed to do.\nHe entered the [Classifiers Trading Association] then asked for a 'appraisal room', and was yet again led toward the luxurious rooms.\n\"You again, huh?\" it was the same white-haired woman with long hair in a ponytail that was smoking her cigarette, \"I expect good stuff after you've been gone for this long!\"\n\"Don't expect too much, I'm not even going to school yet,\" Stark smiled as he sat down on the red sofa right in front of the lady, he did remember checking her panel and that her name was \"Violette Winkson\".\nAnd even though he said that…\n~SNAP~\nHe snapped his fingers as he summoned his [Spatial Inventory] above the 'appraisal table', then all items that he wanted to sell appeared: the [Conjoined Warrior's Cloak], the [Mirror Master's Crystal Shard], [Sierra's Crystal Bow], the [Ghoul's Corrupted Eye], [Soulayer's Greatsword], the [Triple Soul Summon Skill Card], [Warden's Horn] , and [Warden's Sculk Hammer].\n8 items to sell, 8 items that would earn him good money.\n\"Oh?\" Violette lifted her eyebrows, her eyes glowing as she was currently using her [Item Appraisal] skill, something that made her wanted by hundreds of guilds and associations through the entire world, \"These are… amazing…\"\nSkipping the entire process of checking every item and telling their price to Stark, they finally finished their appraising session.\nAnd Stark gained… 8.58 million rher coins!\nThis was incredible compared to the 2.63 million he got from his last session, truly showcasing just how much better the items he was getting were than before.\nWith this amount, he could already afford to rent a luxury apartment!\nBut of course, this wasn't in Stark's projects, as he still had a lot to do.\n\"Thank you,\" he bowed at Violette, who was staring at him intently, her gaze full of suspicions.\n\"I wanna be nice to you kid, but you come out of nowhere and bring some of the greatest items from the 100-150 level range we get in months,\" Violette pressed her elbows on the luxurious wooden table, joining her hands, \"Just what are you?\" she asked again, having already demanded the last time they met.\n\"I'm just me, the average classifier,\" Stark smiled as he began to walk toward the door, \"also I probably won't be coming here for a while since I start my academy year,\" he gazed at her, a massive and malicious smile on his face, \"Goodbye, Violette,\" and so he left, closing the door behind.\n\"Fucking hell,\" Violette scratched her head, the 8 items Stark brought in front of her.\nThese items were truly incredible for their current level, and yet here he was acting as if it was nothing.\nAlso… she noticed that he got a lot stronger than before, his eyes now so powerful even she was slightly intimidated.\n\"Oh well…\" she shrugged, \"The customer is king, huh…\" and so she began to fill the forms to send the items to the store or to check if anyone wanted them: she was sure they would be sold in under an hour if put on sale.\nStark didn't think much about it, but now his assets reached 13.5 million rher coins!\n'Anyway… one more thing and I'm good…' oh and by the way, the [Classifiers Trading Association] is open 24/7, which is why he was able to reach it even though it is a little under 6 am.\nStark headed toward the [Market] section and specifically stopped at the [Boost Items] part, walking through the massive hallway with hundreds of classifiers.\nAnd after a few seconds, he found the sign that read \"Breakthrough Stone\", looking at the many displays with screens showing different stones on them.\nAnd so, just like that, he found the item he wanted.\n…\n[Item:] Breakthrough Stone (Bronze-Level)\n[Tier:] Rare\n[Quality:] Normal\n[Perk:] Increases your skill level from 15 to 25 when you meet the conditions to do so.\n[Price:] 6.2 million rher coins\n…\n\"Holy shit, inflation hits hard,\" there was no way that thing was worth half his fortune.\nAnd yet…\n[Do you want to buy it?]\n[Y/N]\n[This will automatically remove the money from your account using your fingerprints]\n[Oh, and by the way, no refunds.]\n'Fuck off…' Stark groaned as he clicked on Y, taking the stone from the display as another one appeared right as he did that, 'At least that's done with.'\nHe had done everything he needed to do, and it was only around 6 am, meaning that he had lots of time in his hands.\n'Well, let's get to my hotel room then prepare, what else, it did say that this school would be hell, huh…'\n40 minutes later, Stark was back in his hotel room, the stone in his hands, his account full of money, and all his useless items sold.\nHe was COMPLETELY ready to begin his new chapter in life, and although he knew it would only get more difficult from now on, entering a school with powerful people, and possibly even some hidden [Domination] users, Stark knew that his sheer determination will be enough to overcome all of it.\n'Well, anyway,' Stark looked at the 'Breakthrough Stone' in his hands, it was a rune with silver-colored symbols all over it, and the word 'silver' written on some sort of magic circle in the middle, an aura emanating from it, 'Alright.'\nHe put a lot of his aura inside the stone while holding it, and instantly, a panel appeared.\n[Do you want to initiate the breakthrough from bronze to silver?]\n[Y/N]",

      "content": "[Do you want to initiate the breakthrough from bronze to silver?]\n[Y/N]\nStark clicked on Y.\n[Very well, please break the stone now!]\nThe process was literally the same as last time: he clenched his fist with the stone inside, and it shattered inside his hand after enough pressure was put.\nThe runes around the stone glowed, and they began to fly around Stark, seeping into his body after a few seconds.\n[Breakthrough passed smoothly, you have high potential!]\n[Bronze -> Silver]\n[Skill limit increased from 15 to 25!]\n'Alright,' after doing this, Stark grabbed the [Sculk Necklace], the mythical item and only one that he could use, then put it around his neck.\nA surge of power coursed through Stark's body as the [Sculk Necklace] activated: the gem in the middle glowing intensely as the sculk liquid he hated so much formed around it.\n[You are now able to use the necklace's ability!]\n'Nice…' Stark nodded, \"And now…\"\n[Level 60 Reached: please pick a card]\nThree magenta cards appeared in front of him.\n'Clone Frenzy,' he summoned one of his clones, then instructed it to check out the back of the cards and point at the strongest looking one.\nBut…\n\"…\" it just shrugged.\n\"You… can't see?\" Stark asked.\n\"…\" the clone shook its head.\nWhich meant… that it was only the [Superior Clone] that was able to do that.\n'Interesting…' Stark scratched his chin, 'Well, anyway,' he closed his eyes and quickly grabbed one of the cards at random.\nAnd once he turned it… he saw the drawing of a + sign glowing in crimson light.\n…\n[Skill: Crimson Healing]\n[Rank: Legendary]\n[Description: You are now able to heal yourself using the power of your crimson aura, able to regain 20000HP in one go.]\n[Note: One day cooldown and you can't heal others]\n…\n\"FUCKING FINALLY, HOLY SHIT!\" Stark jumped in joy, he had finally gotten a healing skill.\nHe had almost died so many fucking times because his HP were way too low, even for a [Domination] user, and now… he could finally regain 20000 at once.\nOf course, this was weak compared to the healing of all the others, for example Sora was able to heal upward to 50000HP and all status effects, even for others, while he was only able to do it for himself and for 20000HP.\nBut… Stark was a fighter, and being able to heal just ONE HP was enough for him as it could potentially save his life.\n'Alright, and last…' he turned toward another panel.\nAnd he was frankly excited.\n[Skill Points: 24 Available]\nBecause…\nHe would finally be able to upgrade his skills!\n…\n[Skills:] Spatial Inventory; Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv15; Focus lv15; Aura Smash lv10; Clone Frenzy lv15; Invincible Dodge lv10; Double Assault lv10; Crimson Spears lv1; Heaven's Wrath lv5; Alchemist lv5; Potion Crafting lv5; Target Manipulation lv1; Dodge Control lv5; Crimson Ball Transmission lv1; EGO lv5; Crimson Purification lv1; Wielding Cross lv1; Crimson Healing lv1.\n…\nThe amount of skills he had was starting to get out of hands, and Stark truly wondered how ANY of these people at the top remembered the skills they never used.\nOr maybe… it was just that there was something he didn't know about?\nSomehow… he had a feeling that his intuition was right.\nBut for now, all he needed to do was upgrade his skills.\nAnd for the first time, he didn't hesitate for a single second.\n'Come to me, new perks!'\n[You have upgraded 'Domination' to level 25 (Silver-Tier Max)!]\n[You have upgraded 'Focus' to level 25 (Silver-Tier Max)!]\nWhat else would he do but upgrade his most important skills, yes, even more important than [Heaven's Wrath], [Double Assault] or even [Clone Frenzy].\nAnd of course, as he passed two thresholds for those skills, it meant he would be getting two perks for each!\nOr… that's what he thought.\n[From now on, skills reaching level 20 will require 10 skill points to get a new perk, meaning that once reaching level 20, the next perk you get will only be at level 30, 40, 50…]\nAnd so that only meant one thing: he only got one perk from each skill as they had only crossed level 20, meaning that upgrading them to level 25 did increase their power, but no new perk was given.\n'Oh well… I think I'm starting to get it…' the amount of perks he would get will probably decrease the more he upgrades his skills, meaning that this was one of the reasons people wouldn't get confused with so many perks.\nAnd so Stark began to read the new perks he was getting.\n…\n[Skill: Domination lv25]\n[New Perk: Facial Camouflage]\n[Description: You are now able to hide your face entirely using your aura, making it not entirely up to luck and emotions but now able to control it completely if you want to hide your identity.]\n…\nHis perks for 'Domination' were this: protection shield at lv5, fear inflict at lv10 (pretty damn useless since all the opponents he fought were stronger…), dominated status at lv15 (this one was useful, but having it activate on an opponent is still hard), and finally… facial camouflage at level 20.\nUpgrading [Domination] though wasn't about perks… but simply about enhancing his aura since it became stronger after each level, which is why he didn't even bother using its perks, and why they were pretty much all 'passive'.\n[Facial Camouflage] would be extremely useful in the future if he wants to hide or when he was in the academy, though.\nBut in the end, Stark just moved to the next perk.\n…\n[Skill: Focus lv25]\n[New Perk: Target Set]\n[Description: You can place a target on an opponent, thus allowing you to observe their movements better and have your crimson 'eyes' always following them, no matter what they do]\n[Note: this skill will deactivate if the opponent is out of view or runs out of the range, you can set a target whenever you want, but only one at a time]\n…\n'Fair…' much like [Domination], [Focus]'s skills were mostly passive too except for 'Time Vision'.\nNonetheless, these were his two most important skills, so he was kind of forced to upgrade them if he wanted to be stronger.\n[Skill Points: 4 Available]\n'…'\nStark also knew exactly what to upgrade: he had underestimated that skill, but after it helped him many times during the trial, he knew he couldn't afford to let it stay at its current level.\nAnd that skill was…\n[You have upgraded 'Crimson Spears' to level 5!]\nYes, it was [Aura Smash] but weaker and with spears instead of crimson fists, but they were still useful, being the ones that broke Warden's first core and helped him win many battles because of the spears' sheer speed.\nOf course, another reason he upgraded it was because it had been level 1, meaning he had the perfect amount of skill points to allow himself to get a new perk.\nAnd so…\n…\n[Skill: Crimson Spears lv5]\n[New Perk: More Spears!]\n[Description: Instead of only summoning three spears, you are now able to summon 5!]\n…\nOf course, he didn't expect anything exceptional from the first upgrade of a skill since it was only [Rare] in rank, much like [Aura Smash], but it was still better than nothing.\nAnd so right after doing everything he needed to do, his mind appeased as there was nothing to worry about…\n\"Memories Museum, come to me,\" he mumbled, and the dark door appeared before him.\nHe still had around 7 hours of free time, so why wouldn't he train and discover the power of his new perks, as well as his necklace?\nHe would need it for later… because that academy is going to be a true hell, much more than Stark anticipated.",

      "content": "(6h45 later)\nStark had trained inside the 'Memories Museum', attempting to defeat the Warden again, as well as combine him with some other bosses, but he would somehow keep dying over and over by their hands.\nWas it the security of not putting his life in danger that made it so that he was more careless? Or was it that he just got lucky during his fights…?\nNo… luck doesn't exist in battle, it was all about skill and power at that very moment, meaning that no matter what anyone would think, it was just that Stark had been stronger than all those bosses, although he did get some help with the guardians of the first trial.\nIn the end, he managed to take down the Warden for the second time right as the time for Lana to arrive came.\nThe [Sculk Necklace] actually revealed itself to be quite good, dealing decent damage and able to restrain enemies if they were hit, although it was hard to control the sculk as he wasn't used to it.\n~FWISH~\nStark emerged from the black door leading to the [Memories Museum], finding himself in his hotel room again.\nSome people would definitely panic at the thought of bringing EVERYTHING they needed as luggage space was limited, but… Stark was pretty calm about it, he was never really the kind of people to stress over traveling.\nNot only did he not have much to his name (pretty sad when you think about it), but he also could just use [Spatial Inventory] to store all his items, potions and ingredients, as well as his clothes and food, meaning no reason to burden himself.\nAnd then…\n~DING~\n[Lana Moonless: I came a bit early, please come down.]\n[Stark Heartsouls: Alright.]\nThis was it, he would have to take the train leading to the capital of Fellarburg.\nAnd then… what then… Stark himself didn't know.\nBut one thing was for sure: that bad feeling he always got when things were going to go south was omnipresent, always there within him as if to warn him of not only the academy, but the entire capital as a whole.\nWasn't Fellarburg in the top 5 of strongest countries in this world? And if that is true… then the capital, the main point of power, would surely be terrifying, filled with many classifiers that could probably beat him in less than a second.\n~DING~\nStark left his room, making sure to keep it clean as he wouldn't be returning there, then arriving in front of his hotel and seeing Lana at the back of a luxurious limousine, her palm against her beautiful chin, and her blue eyes staring at him.\nThey lightened up as she saw him, then she opened the door, greeting him inside.\n\"Are you ready,\" she smiled at Stark, who remained stoic, looking ahead while the driver started up the engine.\n\"I guess so,\" in comparison to him, the limousine, which was pretty long and gave them lots of space (although Lana somehow still found herself sitting next to him) was full of luggage, at least a dozen of them, \"Is this needed?\" he pointed at all of it.\n\"First time I ever leave the city alone, I am usually with my parents when I travel, and I won't be seeing them for at least a year or two considering the academy and other stuff, so I just wanted to be ready,\" Lana smiled cutely, and Stark just kept his neutral expression as he sighed.\n\"Sure,\" he nodded, not minding that much since it was none of his problems, because as long as he can graduate too, then he didn't mind.\nAnd thus… they drove to the station that would transport them to the powerhouse that is the capital.\nThirty minutes later, they arrived at the train station, and left alongside all of Lana's luggage.\n\"Be careful, my lady, I have heard rumors about the capital being extremely dangerous,\" the old man that served as a driver bowed as he warned Lana, he was a very faithful servant of the Moonless family, and he wouldn't want anything to happen to the young lady after all.\n\"Thank you, but I'll be fine,\" she smiled, and the driver went back inside the limousine before leaving.\n\"How are you going to carry that?\" Stark asked as all the luggage was on the ground, he had [Spatial Inventory] so he could probably her out by putting all of it inside.\n\"Hehe~ don't underestimate the Moonless family,\" but Lana grinned as she pulled out her bow and shot an arrow at each of the bags, the arrows appeared out of nowhere in her hand, probably from her arsenal as she could summon it whenever she wanted.\nAnd suddenly…\n~FWISH~\nAll of them began to fly around Lana, slowly following her.\n\"I just use a [User Attraction] arrow, and they follow me around, hehe~\" she seemed really proud of herself, \"Our family was the one to manufacture it after all!\"\n'There are arrows even for that…?' Stark sighed, it was indeed weird, but she probably had dozens upon dozens of different arrow types in case of battle, so no surprise.\nAs they made their way to the train platform, Stark couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had been lingering within him.\nIt was 15:38, meaning 22 minutes left until the train would arrive.\nAnd yet… the first thing Stark noticed was… that the station was FILLED with young people around his age.\nAll of them looked extremely powerful, some even letting their auras out to intimidate others, while the rest carried their weapons/items in hand and speaking to the rest.\nThere was not a single adult on sight, it was only flashy and young classifiers.\n\"Hey, why are there so many people like us here?\" Stark asked, wondering what the hell was happening since this definitely couldn't be normal.\nAnd in response, Lana just laughed and pointed at a giant, colorful sign above the train tracks.\nAnd it read…\n[Rift Conqueror Express]\n[Only students of the academy are allowed to board this train]\nThe academy went so far in its research of powerful students that it allowed anyone that got accepted into their school to travel to it extremely easily by having their very own trains and even airports, welcoming classifiers from all over the world.\nNo wonder it was one of the top 3 strongest schools in Rheria, and also considered to be the hardest to graduate from of all.\nJust looking at these people… gave the whole picture Stark needed to realize just what he's plunging himself into.\n\"Sigh~\" Stark was forced to stand up next to Lana as there were no seats or benches.\nBut suddenly…\n\"Oy~ if that's not Lana Moonless, I'd never think I would see her in person,\" a tall gangster-looking man with rock star purple hair and a piercing in his nose appeared, followed by two other people that had the exact same aesthetic as his.\n\"Piss off,\" she groaned as she turned and walked behind Stark, hiding behind him as if he was her knight and protector.\n'…?' Stark was confused, he was pretty sure she could just shoot one of her weird arrows at them, right?\n\"Come on, we're going to be classmates, we don't know when any of us will die or leave the academy, why don't we be friends,\" that guy sounded like a total playboy, \"Quit hiding behind that weak-looking punk.\"\nHe approached his face to Stark's, sticking out his tongue.\n\"Oy~ look at you…\" he tried to continue, many people all over watching as they wanted to see who was dumb enough to argue not even on their first day.\nBut, before he could even finish his sentence.\n~PUSH~\nStark pushed him out of the way with a single hand then looked at him with a disgusted look, \"There's no way a loser like you is hitting on a random girl while the year hasn't even started,\" Stark truly hated people like that, and he made sure to show it.\n\"Huh?\" the punk couldn't answer, and neither could his friends.\n\"I mean, look at you, I can pretty much guarantee you're not even surviving the first few months,\" Stark turned around and walked away, his hands in his pockets, Lana following him closely.\nAnd surprisingly, the \"Punk Group\" didn't follow after him, only looking at one another and shrugging, a smug look appearing on the leader's face: everyone knew that fighting fellow students right now would be stupid, they would have more than enough time to do that later after all.\n\"…\" Stark contained his laughter, a wide smile appearing on his face.\n\"Thanks,\" Lana sighed, \"I hate people like this, don't you as well-…?\" but before she could finish her sentence, her eyes widened as she looked at Stark's face.\n\"=)\" he was smiling like a maniac.\n\"I think…\" he turned his head toward Lana, \"I think I'll enjoy this academy much more than expected…\"\nThere were hundreds of people just like them, and many challenges.\nBut… Stark felt like he would enjoy it all.\n[3:55PM]\n[The train is arriving shortly, please be ready!]",

      "content": "[4PM]\n[The train is arriving, please make sure to enter, anyone not inside by 4:05PM will be left behind and expelled!]\nThe train pulled into the station, looking extremely luxurious as it was dyed in red and had all sort of graffiti representing the academy on it, it also looked to be controlled by magic as there was no driver.\nThe doors hissed open, inviting the eager students to board, and everyone on the platform (around 300/400 people) went inside at once.\nStark and Lana made their way inside, the bustling crowd of classifiers following closely behind. The interior of the Rift Conqueror Express was nothing short of luxurious, with plush seating and elegant decor.\nAnd yet… there was no chattering.\nThe atmosphere was as quiet as death itself, everyone's expressions being grim and desolate of any excitement.\nMost people would be excited to enter a powerful academy and make their way to the top.\nBut… with this one… no one could say they were really excited as they knew their lives would be in danger no matter what they did.\n\"Let's go,\" even Lana's cheerful attitude disappeared, as if the train and its aura itself had removed all her happy emotions, \"There are many seats, let's relax.\"\n\"…\" Stark just nodded and he sat on one of the dozens of sofa's that were placed all around, Lana sitting beside him as her luggage was still in the air.\nAll around, people from the same \"groups\" sat on their respective sofas.\nAnd just like that, people could already have a good view of who was with whom, teams had already been formed after all.\n[4 hours 23 minutes until reaching the capital!]\n[Get to know each other, it will be greatly needed, teamwork makes the dream work after all, RIGHT?!]\nAnd with these announcements out of the way…\n~VROOM, VROOM~\nAll they could hear was the sound of the train moving, only able to look out of the windows to check the landscape of the city as it quickly passed.\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nNo one spoke, some were playing with their skills, others with their weapons, a few just sleeping and the rest just analyzing the other classifiers to get a head start.\nAnd so… just like that… four hours passed.\n[20 minutes until destination!]\n[We have entered the capital, by the way!]\nThey were still in Fellarburg, the landscape of the different cities passing through them as they observed the different buildings, but now… they were in the capital, the biggest and strongest area of them all.\n\"Hey?\" Lana suddenly spoke, breaking the silence, and the people close to them were so bored, and it was so quiet that they actually turned their heads toward them, hoping for anything interesting.\n\"Hm?\" Stark smiled.\n\"I've just been wondering…\" Lana seemed quite nervous, \"You… You've been smiling the whole time…\"\n\"Oh? Really =)?\" Stark knew that perfectly well: he had been smiling for the entire ride, and some people even pointed at him for that.\nNo one liked seeing that devilish smile of his, and dozens of people already noted him in their \"be cautious around him\" list.\n\"Don't worry,\" Stark patted Lana's beautiful blonde hair, \"I'm just getting ready for whatever's coming.\"\nStark during these few hours had been part of the \"analyze others\" group, observing their auras as well as the things they showcased in case it would help, a vortex in his eyes appearing as he continued his observations even beyond his own car, looking at the people on the other ones using [Focus].\nAnd so… after everything was done…\nThe train came to a screeching halt, signaling their arrival to their destination.\n[We have arrived at the center of the capital, the academy is extremely close to here, please do check it out!]\n[2 days until the entrance ceremony!]\nAs the doors slid open, the students emerged cautiously, taking in the grandeur of the city that lay before them. Skyscrapers towered overhead, casting shadows over the bustling streets filled with classifiers.\nThey called the capital \"Classifier City\" since only people from that line came to it, anyone else that attempted to live here would just be asking for death.\nThe soon-to-be students of the academy left in their own directions, heading toward their hotels or apartments as they had prepared themselves to live here, since the academy doesn't provide dorms or anything of the sort.\n\"Oh?\" many groups of classifiers stopped as they saw the students emerge from the train and platform as it was pretty much in the middle of a busy street, only stopping people from getting crushed by a barrier which opened for the students to pass.\n\"Hey, it's them…\"\n\"Holy shit, those kids have guts…\"\n\"Most of them are going to die anyway, just move on.\"\nEveryone in this city knew about the reputation of the [Rift Conqueror Academy], and the students knew as well, it was just that they held onto the hope and idea that if they ever as much as just PASSED the first year, then their future would be guaranteed, and they would become the powerhouse of their families.\nImpossibly high risk, extremely high reward.\nSome of these people didn't even value their lives other than for the sake of completing these two years inside that academy, while others truly just wanted to push themselves to their limits and grow stronger.\nEveryone had their own desires, but only the strongest would come out on top.\nBut… what about Stark.\n\"=)\" what was his desire? What was his goal…?\nWell… no one knew, and probably not even Stark himself: he just wanted to see what this academy had to offer, maybe he would pass, maybe he would get stronger, who knows…\nIn the end…\n\"Hey,\" Lana tapped Stark's shoulder as he was dozing off, \"Let's check out the academy before anything, we can spend the next two days exploring the capital as we'll be spending the next 2 years here!\"\n\"…\" Stark looked at her, and his smiled grew, \"That is… if we stay alive, isn't it?\"\n\"…\" Lana's looked nervous, avoiding Stark's gaze as a drop of sweat appeared on her forehead, \"Sure… but I'm sure we can do it!\"\n\"Optimistic, huh…\" Stark nodded, \"Anyway, let's check out the academy quickly, I need to go look for a hotel room or apartment if they don't have dorms.\"\n\"Oh! You don't have to worry about that either…\" Lana smiled for the first time since she boarded the train, \"My dad already prepared everything…\" she sighed while whispering, just loud enough for Stark to hear.\n\"…?\" He was confused, but quickly moved on as they followed the crowd and began to walk toward the academy.\nIt only took ten minutes to reach it from their current location, and they were able to see the top of it from far because of how high the building was.\nAs they approached the towering structure of the Rift Conqueror Academy, Stark's expression remained neutral.\nBut as for the others…\n\"Wow…\"\n\"Holy shit, that's insane…\"\nTheir reactions only showed shock and admiration.\nThis was the [Rift Conqueror Academy], the hell that Stark would need to enter.\nThe hell all these people oh so wanted to pass through.\nThe hell where everyone would have to fight friends and foes alike, with the sole hopes of surviving.\nThis was… the [Rift Conqueror Academy].\nAnd now that they saw it… all they could do was observe its beauty, awaiting the day they would have to enter it since the gates were currently locked, only allowing people to see it from afar.\n[2 days until 'Entrance Ceremony'!]",

      "content": "\"…\" Stark stared at the academy with serious eyes.\nThe building loomed over them, its architecture both ancient and futuristic, with intricate runes etched into the walls that seemed to pulse with mystical energy.\nThere were 9 symbols on the marbles and gold walls that people could see from the entrance: two crossed swords (warrior), a magic staff (magus), three claw marks (beast tamer), a cross (exorcist), a dagger (assassin), a bow (archer), a heart (soul wielder), a potion flask (alchemist) and a demon tail (succubus/incubus).\nBelow all these was a holographic text that read the name of the classes related to these symbols, but it didn't really take a genius to figure out what they were.\nAll these symbols on the walls pulsated and were in constant movement: for example, the swords of the warrior class would clash together before going back to their original position, while the flask from alchemist would shake, the liquid inside it changing colors.\nIt was truly like they were considering classes as \"divine\", something all classifiers took pride in and seemed to enjoy, though.\nBut Stark noticed one thing…\nDomination was there.\nWas it really that unknown? Probably, yes, but it didn't make sense for even the experienced teachers and chairman to not know about it.\nThey actually probably did… but somehow no one talked about that class even though it was the strongest.\n\"Holy shit, what is that,\" a girl pointed at the very top of the building, dozens of long rodes on it with a flag that showed a blue portal with a stickman figure entering it, probably the logo of the school, the biggest rode of them seemed to be ten meters in height, showcasing to the entire capital their flag.\nAnd once Stark looked at the sky…\n'…!' there was legitimate dragon flying around the school building, but mainly around the rodes, zigzagging between them, \"Oh, it's fake.\"\nThe dragon cast no shadow on the ground even though the time was sunny, meaning that it was just a super-advanced holographic display, he couldn't deny it was impressive though, and that dragon looked so real some people could be scared.\nIn the end, they just kept looking for a good five minutes, taking in the view as this 'school' looked more like a palace, and what so big that it could easily host over ten thousand people.\nNext to the school was a giant arena where fights could be hosted, probably used for later, and people seemed to call it the \"Fate Colosseum\" for some reason.\nAnd… that was pretty much all.\nThere weren't really many ways to describe the school if you weren't there to see it, but just know that it was big and luxurious, truly showcasing the importance of each class as every one of them had a different terrain to train in, leaving nobody behind (except Domination).\n\"This is great, I'm actually excited now,\" Lana held her chest as she took quick breaths, \"It was really terrifying to think that you could die at any point in this school, but now I feel a bit more confident, let's go, Stark,\" she smiled as she took his hand and guided him.\nBut… Lana wasn't the only one.\nEVERYONE felt a bit more confidence after seeing the grandeur of the academy, actually now believing in their powers to survive.\nEveryone had their dreams, and everyone wanted to fulfill them.\nYet… it was impossible.\nAll of this confidence and sudden excitement was nothing but a ploy to put your guard down.\nAnd there was no denying it… this school was hell, much more than any of them could EVER imagine it to be.\nAt the highest floor of the academy, beyond one way sapphire windows, twenty pair of eyes were staring at the student as they left.\n\"Haha… idiots…\" a manly voice rang, \"Do they really believe the world is sunshine and rainbows?\"\n\"It doesn't matter, it only starts in two days, they will realize just how wrong they were at that time,\" a woman that was sitting right beside the man spoke, spinning the glass of wine in her hand.\n\"Ohoh~\" the chairman slowly clapped his hands while adjusting his glasses to get the attentions of the 19 people sitting on chair around a big circle table, \"Do not worry, my dear teachers and instructors, the students are going to come soon, and at that time… then their first hellish year will start, and we shall enjoy seeing which will be the strongest to come out of the lot,\" he smiled.\nEVERYONE in this room were graduates of [Rift Conqueror] back in their time as well, meaning that they knew exactly what true horror and hell was, and just how to adjust it for people to become strong.\nThese 20 people, the powerhouses of the academy, capital, if not entire country, even though they weren't invited to events such as the 'ClassiTop', were present.\nIn their room, they were surrounded by a sturdy walls, but most importantly, a screen that shows the entrance of the academy from all angles.\nThey enjoyed observing the new students, and noting the ones that looked strong as they actively enjoyed playing a gamble game of \"who is gonna live, die or quit\".\nYes, these people were teachers and instructors, yet they were extremely twisted as well: who in their right mind would teach in this academy, which took the most amount of lives between all in the world, after all?\nAnd as to allow themselves to do this, this room was completely isolated, with not even the most stealthy and observant of classifiers would be able to detect it.\nBasically… it was their little hiding place to check out the bugs they would play with during the first year: yes, they don't consider classifiers who didn't complete the first year as people, after all they had done it themselves and suffered through all of these \"trials\" to be in their current position.\nOnly when you reach the second year while they respect you and consider you human, but in contrast it will also become much harder.\nThey were called the \"Harsh Council\" for a reason.\n\"Well, folks, the students are leaving,\" the chairman smiled as he looked at everyone, their figures cloaked by the shadow of the closed room, impossible to see their appearances.\n\"Seems like this year's batch is… interesting,\" another man remarked.\n\"That is true, I analyzed them, and I can confirm with certainty that this batch of student is the strongest we have had in around twenty years,\" a middle-aged woman, holding a crystal ball, smirked.\n\"Amazing, it does seem like this year is going to be truly fascinating, let us have fun, then!\" the chairman laughed, and all others began to leave their seats.\nBut right at that moment…\n\"Wait a damn minute,\" the chairman spoke, a surprised look on his face as he looked at the screen around him, pointing at the entrance.\nSuddenly, all the other members of the council stopped in their tracks and looked at the screen, it still shows the outside, but extremely zoomed in.\nIt was zoomed… on a boy.\n\"He is… looking at us?\" one of the members mumbled.\nAnd who could that boy be?\nWell... who other than Stark, duh?\n\"He knows,\" the chairman smiled as the camera zoomed in on Stark's eyes, who was clearly looking at the room they were currently in.\nJust who is that kid, was what they thought.",

      "content": "There wasn't anything left to discover, so they would need to wait 2 days when they were called to participate in the entrance ceremony.\nBut…\n\"Hey, wait,\" Stark stopped Lana as she was walking toward the street like all the other students after checking out the academy.\nHe got a gut feeling in his heart, and his mind was screaming for him to stop as they were \"observed\".\n[Focus: Look up, toward the top window of the middle tower]\nHe did as he was told and then…\n~GULP~\n\"Oh shit…\" Stark's eyes widened as he sensed an extremely powerful aura coming from that room, it was actually so powerful he had a hard time not vomiting on the spot.\n\"Hey, are you okay, what's happening?\" Lana looked worried as she peered at Stark, who was still looking at the window with a determined look.\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Stark sighed after thirty seconds, \"Let's just go, I'm kind of tired.\"\nStark didn't like this at all, and if it was coming from the academy, then it meant they were probably teachers watching them.\nLana and Stark hailed for a taxi and the car drove them around twenty minutes away of the academy, arriving in front of a luxurious apartment complex.\n\"Thanks for the ride, sir,\" Lana bowed as she paid, she was actually very kind and respectful to others, yet somehow found the strength in herself to speak casually to Stark.\n\"Anyway, my father has rented out an apartment in this complex for you and me, its pretty close and luxurious enough to last for the two years as he already gave the down payment on all of it,\" Lana smiled as she pulled out a card, it had Stark's name on it with the room number [502], which meant the second room of the fifth floor.\n\"Oh,\" Stark took the card and thanked Lana, he didn't expect something so good to be given to him out of nowhere.\nAnd yes, it was too good, so Stark squinted his eyes while looking at Lana, knowing something was up.\nApparently she didn't know anything, as she happily entered the elevator and ordered him to come.\n\"It's fine, I'll take the stairs,\" he gestured, and she just shrugged then clicked on one of the buttons, \"Well, we'll be separated anyway so might as well get used to it, huh…\"\nAn apartment so close to the academy was really useful, and although he didn't know what to expect there, it was still good.\nHe climbed up the stairs quite easily, his stamina now so good that doing that didn't even make him break a sweat.\n'5th floor…' he lifted his gaze and saw a [Floor 5] sign written in blue letters.\nApparently, each floor only had two apartments, allowing for an immense amount of space, but that is why it was very expensive: only the rich could afford it, and Stark would sure as hell not waste his precious money on such a thing, a shabby hotel room was more than enough for him.\nBut right as he stepped inside the hall, reaching his room, which was the 502… the elevator door opened.\n\"Oh wooooow,\" Lana acted shocked, \"What a coincidence, my room is the 501!\"\n\"…\" Stark looked at her with the most neutral of eyes, \"Alright.\"\nHe entered his room by scanning the card and then closed the door behind him.\nOf course, he already figured it out: the sole reason Arthur, the archer king, put Lana and Stark so close together wasn't because of good will, but because he wanted the latter to protect his daughter.\n'Fucking hell… I'm not a bodyguard…' Stark wasn't found of that idea, being solo was his entire way of life, and it wouldn't change no matter what, \"Well, worse case scenario I get evicted somehow, and Lana should be able to defend herself…\"\nAs for the interior of his apartment, well… it was pretty damn good.\nLuxury furniture that were already placed, a bedroom, living room, kitchen, basically everything he would need during those two years.\nHe was used to living alone, so giving him a bigger space was useless, but it still felt better than going into a hotel room and entering it to directly see your bed and everything it had to offer.\nHe lay on his bed and looked at the ceiling.\nSomehow, that bad feeling of his never went away, and seeing all these students and this new city added to that pressure he was feeling.\nWhat could be waiting for them in two days.\n\"I… I'll find out eventually… let's just sleep…\" he was so tired.\nHe shouldn't be at such an important time, not after being so close to entering the hellish academy.\nBut…\n\"Zzzzz…\" even Stark, the most promising of [Domination] users, who was being watched closely by the [Domination Association], was tired.\nYes, even Stark knew and felt that sometimes he was being watched by a distant pair of eyes.\nThey did tell him they would ALWAYS keep an eye on him, probably already aware of the second trial and its results.\nHe hadn't heard of any type of 'Calamity-Level' monster attacks like the first time over though, but maybe it was because they figured out all the participants and contained them all?\nWere they even capable of checking out the trial and its results as well? Such a big organization should be able to, right?\nThis was probably what happened.\n'So many things I don't know about… I wish… it was this peaceful, huh…' Stark closed his eyes, \"Zzzz.\nAnd he slept, hopefully not long enough to miss the academy entrance, as it would mean instant expulsion.\n***\n(Dream World)\n\"…\" Stark didn't even act surprised, at this point, even a single second of rest meant that he would find himself in this place.\nWas this a curse or a blessing? He didn't know.\nIt was calm, though.\n\"Oh, hey,\" [Domination], who was merged with [Exorcist], visible by the strands of golden aura in its body, was currently playing chess with [Alchemist].\n\"Hm~\" Alchemist seemed to be concentrated on the game, moving his knight to take one of Domination's pawn.\n\"Is this what all of you do when I'm not here?\" Stark questioned as he approached their table, a chair magically appearing out of nowhere.\n\"Well, somewhat, we can see through your eyes since we are you, but we still are forced to stay here,\" Domination moved his rook.\n\"…\"\n\"You know, I've been wondering,\" Alchemist looked at Stark, \"How do you feel about all of this?\"\n\"…?\"\n\"I mean, with the ApostleDex, your goal in this world is probably to complete it by killing all the apostles, then meeting the 'Godless Demon' and kicking its ass,\" Domination resumed the discussion, \"Check by the way,\" it moved its bishop, checking the king, \"But what about all the rest?\"\n\"The rest?\" Stark was confused.\n\"I mean, do you plan to obtain all the classes? It makes more people to interact with, obviously, but also, what about the academy? And relationships? Fame? Power?\" Alchemist took back the discussion, and it was almost like the two were in synchro.\n\"Basically… you're asking what I plan to do?\"\n\"Yeah, I think that Lana chick is onto you, no doubt, and you're strong enough to earn enough money to live your life like this in luxury, what is your true goal, Stark Heartsouls?\"\n\"I don't know, but I don't have a choice but to keep going anyway.\"\n\"Why?\" Alchemist asked, trying his hardest not to get checkmated.\n\"Because, well, the [Domination Trial] is still present, so if I sit back and do nothing, there is a huge chance that I will still be teleported away and get fucked as I would be too weak,\" Stark's argument was literally unbreakable, and even the two classes knew it: Stark couldn't stop until all [Domination Trials] were over, or until he killed all the apostles and proved himself to the world.\nIt was a never ending cycle.\n\"But anyway,\" Stark smiled as he continued, \"I actually do enjoy fighting.\"\n\"We do too, we were just asking,\" Domination smiled, \"Checkmate, Alchemist,\" it cornered the king using his queen and rook.\n\"Well… Then everything is settled, just have to survive the academy and not get destroyed by the other students or some impossible tasks!\" Stark felt optimistic.\n\"We're gonna be fine, just wake up, or you'll be late,\" both Domination and Alchemist said as they looked at Stark.\n\"I did guess a long time would pass, thank you,\" Stark got up from his chair, and all the furniture, as well as the two class figures, disappeared.\nWhat was that feeling inside of him? Why did they talk about something so deep with him after acting goofy and carefree all this time?\n\"I… Ah, fuck, doesn't matter,\" Stark lost consciousness as he closed his eyes.\n***\n\"WAKE UP! WAKE UP STARK!\"\n\"…?\" Stark's vision was drowsy, but he could hear someone calling his name and frantically shaking him.\n\"Oh! Oh my god, finally!\" he also felt someone embrace him.\n\"What the fuck is happening…\" he was still confused, that dream of his lasted less than five minutes, but a long time must has passed in the real world.\nAnd so right at that moment…\n\"COME ON, THE ENTRANCE CEREMONY IS IN AN HOUR!\"",

Stark jumped from the very tall building's roof toward the ground, precisely right after the gate, as to allow themselves to pass.\n~DASH, FWISH~\nThe building's roof was at least fifty meters in height, and not a single one of the other people that were running on the roofs alongside him even dared to do what he was doing.\n\"What the fuck?\"\n\"Suicide?\"\nThey really thought he was insane.\nAnd to add to that, while he was still in midair, focusing his aura as faltering meant falling to his death, the reporters noticed his presence and turned their cameras toward him.\n~BOOOOM~\nIn a massive crash, Stark landed on the other side of the gate, actually creating a small crater on the ground.\n\"WHAT?\"\nPeople were both shocked and astonished, but Stark just continued walking toward the academy's giant red doors, which were opened.\n[12 minutes until ceremony begins]\nA massive text could be seen above it.\n[If you are outside when the door is closed, you will be expelled.]\nStudents actually guessed this was their first 'task': manage to get inside the school with all the commotion, thus proving your ability to adapt.\nSome were seen flying inside, others merged in the crowd and climbed up the gates, and some crazy ones like Stark used methods that weren't normal.\nThey passed the threshold of the red door, and found themselves in a massive room, so big in fact that thousands of students were already inside, all aligned.\n\"Huh... are you gonna let me down?\" Lana mumbled as she could feel the gazes of the others on her: what kind of people would enter this school carrying another person?\n\"Oh, my bad,\" Stark put her down, and he searched for an empty spot.\nOn the ground of the massive room were thousands of small squares, each with a number of them: they were spots where students could stand.\nAlmost felt like some sort of cult: everyone need to be in their own places, respecting the space they had been given.\n\"...\"\nLana and Stark found two squares titled [2729] and [2730] since they were right in front of one another.\n[There are 5000 squares], a panel above a stage at the end of the room could be seen on a holographic screen, [And 5358 people have been accepted into this academy, I think you already know what this means.]\nThis was just revealed to everyone who entered, meaning that...\n[People who are late aren't worthy, no matter how strong they are.]\n\"Oh.\"\n\"I guess you can thank me,\" Lana tapped Stark's shoulder from behind.\n\"Yeah yeah,\" he couldn't deny he would have woken up at the last minute, possibly meaning he would have been among the 358 that were going to be expelled for not having a square.\n[4 minutes until entrance ceremony]\nThe more time passed, the harder it was to acquire a square for yourself, since there were more and more people filling up the empty spaces.\nEven Stark and Lana had a hard time, and it was by sheer luck they found some that were right next to each at one of the lanes very far from the entrance.\nThe sound of cheering from classifiers and reporters was omnipresent, and Stark heard from some people nearby that this was actually broadcasted live for the entire country.\nJust what was so good about such a school?\nI mean, he could feel the aura in the air, it was pretty damn powerful, but so what?\nWhat could make this school so different and difficult…?\nStark didn't know, but he would for sure come to find out.\nAnd suddenly… right as all the squares were taken, and the timer reached zero…\n~THUMP~\nThe red door that was revealing the outside suddenly closed out of nowhere, leaving every student in pure darkness.\n[Anybody who leaves their squares from now on are expelled]\nAnd such a message appeared on the holographic screen above the stage.\n***\nGreat job!

      "content": "[Anybody who leaves their squares from now on are expelled]\nThe entirety of the room was quiet and dark now, it was impossible to hear anything from the outside world since it was soundproof, and not a single ray of light was there since no windows were connecting it to the outside.\nMeaning… that all 5000 of the present students were just waiting for what was about to happen.\nAnd suddenly…\n~BOOM, BOOM, BOOM~\nMany explosions happened ahead, and smokes with different colors began to spread around the stage as everyone was looking, trying to discern what the hell was happening.\nAnd after a while…\n~CLICK~\n\"Ultimate Light!\"\nThe lights came back inside the room, even though there was no window or any sort of lightbulb/chandelier.\nThat light was coming out… of nowhere, but it allowed EVERYONE to see EVERYTHING that was happening, all making sure to stay in their little squares as to not get expelled.\nAnd on the stage, not one, not two, not even ten, but TWENTY figures appeared.\nAll these figures all had long black robes and masks covering their faces, both with the [Rift Conqueror] academy's insignia on them, their auras impossible to discern as they emitted a chilling presence that engulfed the entire room.\nAll of them hid their faces from the students, but they could all guess that they were the teachers.\n\"Welcome, students!\" the one in the middle removed his mask, he had small lunar glasses, a dark green hair, he looked to be in his mid 60s, yet an extremely low amount of wrinkles were visible on his face, still making him look handsome, and his posture was impeccable, \"I know all of you must be wondering what the hell is all of this!\"\nThe remainder of the teachers then also removed their masks, revealing their faces, although Stark didn't pay much attention to that since he was mostly focused on the principal.\n\"First of all, let me tell you all that I am also a graduate from this academy, at least I was back in my days,\" the chairman sighed as he reminisced of the good times, \"And I can tell you all that you are going to have one hell of time, quite literally…\"\n\"Let's not waste time, Theodore,\" a woman with long purple hair, the one carrying the crystal orb, asked the chairman as she moved forward.\n\"Always so quick to act, Alice, but I think our dear students need to know too.\"\nTo be honest, the tension in the room was so heavy that they couldn't focus on anything but the chairman and Alice.\nAny piece of information that escaped their mouths could be important, as they had heard just how bad things could get for them during this year.\n\"…\" Stark on the other hand knew pretty much nothing, so he was pretty comfortable, actually finding the scene before him kind of annoying.\n\"Oh well,\" the chairman laughed as he suddenly stared in Stark's direction, his eyes widening a bit as he recognized the boy, and saw his neutral expression even though everyone was on edge, \"I think the students want to know after all, so let's show them what awaits them…\"\nTheodore and Alice, the two that stepped forward, backed down, and suddenly, the holographic screen turned on again, explaining all the rules.\n[5000 students]\n[This first year is going to be use a 'preliminary' phase!]\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What?\"\n[Basically, this year is going to be used mostly to weed out all the weak little bastards who think they deserve to be in our school!]\nThis was harsh, and even Stark felt that, but oh well, it shouldn't be the hardest school in Fellarburg if not the entire world for no reason.\n[Whether it is dropping out, failure in completing a task, or death, all these things will result in your expulsion, thus reducing the number of students.]\n[It has been said all around the world that the success rate for even the first year is 5% and…]\nThe tension was so high now that some people were shaking, trying not to get out of the square as their legs trembled.\n[It is true.]\n[Among the 5000 students of every year, only around 200-300 of them survive long enough to gain access to the second year.]\nOf course, the second year was a whole other talk as the difficulty obviously increased, but most people's goal at this moment was literally to just complete the first one.\nEven if you completed just the first year, you could immediately drop out and be recognized as one of the [Prodigies] who managed to conquer this academy's challenges.\nThus… this guaranteed your future.\nOf course, Stark wanted to fully graduate, otherwise why would he even enter this academy, he could have always gotten the 25 million rher coins from his mission and bought a house.\nNo… Stark wanted to get stronger, and he figured that the academy would have enough challenges and trials to increase his powers, at least just enough to not fall last in the third domination trial like he did in the second.\nThe screen kept going, this time changing into a background with very good and detailed drawings.\n[This year will be composed of three semesters, lasting 4 months in total, and each of these semesters is gonna be associated to a 'task'…]\n[Or maybe…]\nThe holographic screen turned into a detailed drawing of the academy, separated into three parts with the numbers 1, 2 and 3.\n[You could call them \"trials\"?]\n\"…\" Stark's expression darkened as he heard this.\nWhat a fucking joke.\nThey think they can make a scary trial? They can keep dreaming, not even in a million years can they even compare to the horror of the [Domination] trial.\nAnd so, somehow, even though many people in the crowd of students were nervous, Stark was just mad.\nThe word 'trial' had a big meaning to him, and probably to all [Domination] users as well.\n[Did you truly believe this is a normal school?]\n\"I mean, no, duh…\"\n[Did you think you would seat in a classroom listening to boring lessons? None of that happens, what could we even teach you all anyway, you're already between level 125 and level 150!]\nThis was true, one of the precise requirements of joining this academy was that ALL the people need to be somewhat in the same range, meaning that people below level 125 were out, and people above level 150 were also gone too, as 25 levels was around the average amount of levels where it is possible for a person to win if they manage their skills well.\nBasically, even if it is a lv125 classifier against a lv150 one, the former could still win.\n[The semester started since the moment you entered this room.]\n[So…]\nThe room's light became a crimson shade of red, and an ominous aura appeared around all the students from the stage.\n[Why don't we explain the first trial, which will last 4 months, much like all the others?]\nThey actually didn't waste any time in starting up that entrance ceremony: students enter the room, they speak for five minutes, then they reveal the entire plan for these students, specifically informing them that many will die trying.\nThis school was truly shameless, not caring about anything, not even its own students.\nBut maybe this was why people were so excited at the prospect of joining it?\nMaybe the thrill of risking your life made all these people enjoy it?\nIn the end, it didn't matter, and so Stark just looked up, a vortex of aura forming in his eyes as he awaited the next instructions.",

Stark tilted his head, why were they so keen on keeping the suspense going for no reason.\n[Because each of these 50 groups will be given a rift to conquer.]\n[And the 20 groups that fall last in conquering their rifts will be expelled.]\nThe room literally exploded as these words appeared.\nThis meant that 2000 people would be expelled in the first round no matter what, maybe even more as deaths were counted as failures, and there was no saying everyone would survive in their own teams, as fighting in groups of people of 50 meant, I don't know, AT LEAST 10 people per group had a chance of dying.\n\"SIR!\" A guy in military clothes raised his hand, he was in the first row, meaning he was one of those that arrived first, plus he acted exactly like someone in the military.\n\"Yes?\" the holographic screen stopped, and the chairman responded, he was the one that would take over if someone had a question or something they needed better explanations for.\n\"How will the rifts be given! And how will we decide about our teammates!\"\n\"Haha~\" the chairman laughed, \"Calm down, I like your enthusiasm, but everything will be explained later!\"\n~TAP, TAP~\nTheodore clapped his hands, and the video resumed as though it had never paused at all.\n[In addition to that, all those that fail to conquer their rifts will be expelled as well!]\n[General info: statistics gathered from decades of trials and hundreds of thousands of students from this academy have shown that the rifts given, even though they vary in difficulty, take around 2 to 3 months to complete, meaning that trying to speed run them wouldn't work in your favor, take your time, your life is the most important after all, right?]\n[What is the point of succeeding if you die in the end, only allowing the rest of the people to enjoy what you should have had.]\n\"...\" Stark could finally agree with something that screen said, but to be honest, the intent behind it was obvious: it was clearly telling them that sacrificing yourself is a useless and pathetic act as you won't be seen as a hero.\n[And now many of you may wonder: then how will we know about our rifts?]\n[Well…]\nThe video changed to the background of a casino, and right in front of the screen was a table with a box on it.\n[It will be decided by drawing, obviously!]\n[Note that some rifts are actually harder than others while some are easier, although I guarantee all are possible to complete!]\n\"Basically… its luck?\"\n[Yes! It is luck, luck is also a factor in being a classifier anyway, and if you aren't able to adapt and conquer any rift you are given, we believe you do not deserve to be here.]\n[The \"group leader\" will have to pick their cards, and each of these cards will contain a single picture of the interior of the rift, some information (monsters, level…), and its name!]\n[Each of these rifts are owned the by the 'Academy', meaning you do not have to worry about anyone beside you entering them!]\nPeople wanted to complain, but they literally couldn't as they could only abide by the rules and hope to get an easy one.\n[Oh, and inside the drawing box has been placed a single \"DEATH RIFT\" card, you will recognize it thanks to a skull with crimson eyes, it is a rift so difficult it is almost impossible to complete it with your entire group if they joined hands]\nA 3D model of the card began to spin in the screen, the information at the front hidden, obviously, but it was possible to see the skull they talked about.\n[And the reason for that, is that it contains a 'Godless Demon' apostle as its final boss!]\n\"…!\" Stark's eyes widened, and his ears twitched instantly as he saw and heard that, and a massive smile grew on his face, \"I need that card…\"\nMaybe he could find the person that got it and trade it with his, yes, this is definitely a good plan as anybody would be willing to not risk their entire lives!\nWhat about his teammates, you might say? Well, who cares, they wouldn't be affected if Stark completed it by himself anyway!\n[It's like a game! And I'm sure you will all love it!]\n[It's going to be sooo much fun!]\n\"Pfttt~\" Stark contained his laughter, he didn't know why, but this situation just seemed so funny.\nA game? Seriously?\nThis did make some people look at him in a weird way though, thinking he had gone insane, as many of them were simply just uncomfortable, and even the people that weren't couldn't see a single reason to laugh.\n[But before we tackle the final section: how the groups will form…]\n[I want to introduce you all to your 'year president'!]\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Year president? What kind of bullshit is this?\"\n[The year president is the strongest person in the entire year!]\n[So I would advise not angering them if you don't wanna have problems!]\n\"Please come on the stage, year president!\" Theodore laughed, and all the teachers and instructors clapped their hands to invite the president.\nEveryone waited, and in the distance Stark saw that a figure, which had been in one of the squares of the very first row, got out of their spot to head toward the stage.\nThe figure, with her long beautiful white hair, approached the stage and climbed up, stopping right next to Theodore, an emotionless look on her face as she didn't look one bit nervous.\nAnd so the reveal happened.\n[Year President: Sora Gardenis!]\nA picture of Sora appeared on the holographic screen, and her beautiful face could be seen by everyone.\n[The chairman and teachers have analyzed all the students, and Sora is by far the strongest among all 5000 of you!]\n\"…\" Stark's face was stuck in a state of shock, his mouth wide open as he couldn't believe this.\nWhat were the chances?\n\"AND WHO SAYS THAT?\"\n\"FIGHT ME AND YOU'LL SEE!\"\nPeople were already complaining, but Stark knew perfectly that this was the entire truth: not a single one of them could ever hope to match Sora.\nHe hadn't seen her fight much, since, y'know, the Warden was too strong, but her aura and skills were already an indicator for Stark.\nMaybe even he would struggle, who knows, even though he frankly believed he could beat her if she doesn't overwhelm him with her plants.\n\"But it's Sora…\"\n\"Makes sense…\"\nYet somehow, another group emerged: those that believed Sora was the strongest.\nIn comparison to what Stark believed, Sora and her family, \"Gardenis\", were actually extremely well known in the entire world, owning dozens of businesses, and all family members being extremely powerful classifiers.\nSora was not exception, and she had been called a prodigy by thousands of powerful classifiers since her youngest age, plus everybody knew about her and her flower powers, and that you shouldn't mess with them.\nHer 'emotionless' condition was also known, but Stark was kind of oblivious to that since he saw her cry during the trial, meaning it couldn't be this bad.\n\"Alright, you,\" the chairman pointed at a boy with a muscular body and blazing red hair in the second row as he was one of those that complained, \"Come fight Sora, if you beat her you become year president!\"\n[Anybody who beats the year president instantly becomes \"it\", obviously.]",

hair didn't waste a single second and jumped on the stage from his position.\n\"Holy shit, it's Karl…\"\n\"Karl Spikeford?\"\n\"Yeah!\"\n[Attempting to defeat the year president is futile!]\n\"Yeah, yeah, my ass,\" Karl, who was the person Stark had already defeated once back at the 'ClassiTop' event, positioned himself.\nIf Stark remembered right, he was a [Warrior], but his power consisted in his body being able to generate sharp spikes from any and all directions, as well as using them as sharp weapons.\nHe seemed to be stronger than back then when he fought Stark, maybe the beating actually forcing him to take his training more seriously?\n\"COME AT ME!\" Karl dashed toward Sora without wasting a single second, \"SPIKE SLASH,\" he summoned two spikes in his hands, ready to slash Sora.\nBut in the end…\n\"Evergreen Resilience,\" not even giving him a single look, her face emotionless and looking at the ground, Sora activated her [Legendary] skill, and the ground underneath her began to radiate with a vibrant green aura.\nMuch like against the Warden, her surroundings instantly grew grass, taking aback Karl as he was still dashing toward her.\nBut… it was too late for him.\n\"Boring…\" she mumbled in a low voice.\n~FWISH, FWISH, CRIWK~\nDozens upon dozens of vines came out of the ground and\nwrapped around Karl in a matter of seconds, not even letting him come close to her.\n\"What the–\" Karl tried to struggle against the vines, even attempting to cover his entire body in spikes using [Spike Armor] and [Spike Eruption], but they were too powerful and constricting, and they kept regenerating even when he broke them.\n\"I think you get it now, right?\" Theodore smiled as he saw Karl pitifully try to remove the vines from himself.\nEven though his body was renown to be extremely sturdy, and it was impossible to chain him because of the spikes that could come from anywhere, Sora somehow managed to do that, and with a single attack too.\nThis fight was not fair to begin with, and people all around the room could finally understand why Sora was the strongest, no wonder she was a prodigy.\nEven Karl, who was also someone people even in this room respected and feared because of his massive strength, was beaten this easily, after all, meaning that they never stood a chance to begin with.\n\"…\" Sora was kind enough to use the [Evergreen Resilience] vines to slowly sent Karl back at this position in the room, placing him exactly on the square, then deactivating the skill.\nHe had learned his lesson, and he wouldn't try to fight her anymore, that's for sure, nor anyone in this room for this matter, as they didn't want to risk humiliation or putting her on their bad side.\nAnd yet…\n\"Pftt~\" after the initial shock, Stark couldn't help but laugh at this entire situation, \"Hhahahahahahahaha!\"\nAnd it wasn't a chuckle or him trying to hold it in, he was straight up laughing like a maniac, unable to contain it anymore.\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAH!\" he pointed at the stage with Sora on it, while holding his stomach and trying his hardest to stop himself from leaving the white square, otherwise he would be expelled, \"HAHAHAHAHA…!\"\nEven Stark didn't know why he was laughing so hard, but after this fight and the chairman describing Sora as this impossible-to-beat opponent, the sole memory of Sora on the ground after being beaten by the boss brought tears to his eyes, and they weren't sad ones.\nOf course, the ENTIRETY of the room started staring at him, as his laugh echoed from every direction.\n\"…?\" Theodore seemed confused, but once he saw who the person that was laughing was, his eyes widened, and he let a quick smile, \"Hey, you,\" he pointed at Stark who was still holding his stomach as it began to hurt.\n\"Hahahah… w-what?\" Stark tried to answer between two laughs.\n\"If you think this is so funny, then please come on stage and fight Sora, we'll see if you laugh more afterward,\" this wasn't actually a proposition, but an order from the chairman, and everyone could sense it.\n\"S-Sure, hahahahaha,\" Stark wiped some tears from his eyes as he got out of his square and began walking toward the stage, still ominously laughing while people looking at him as though he was the biggest weirdo in the world.\n\"…Weird,\" Even Sora mumbled such a word, she didn't see the face of that person, but if they were mocking her, then she would make sure to teach them a lesson.\nShe had learned something important during the [Domination] trial, and she wouldn't let those teachings go away after being so close to death, and more than once.\nWell, she couldn't imagine Stark's pain though as he had literally died twice, but she wouldn't forget him, and hopefully one day…\n'Maybe… we'll meet again,' she sighed as she looked to her left, the person that had been laughing now on the stage.\n\"BOOOOO!\"\n\"GET THE FUCK OUT, LOSER!\"\n\"Stop laughing!!\"\nPeople were shouting at him as he got on the stage, and it's at that moment he could finally stop.\n\"W-W-W…What?\" Sora's eyes widened so much you couldn't even imagine she was emotionless, and she took a few steps back.\n\"Hello, Sora, the name's Stark, nice meeting you for the first time,\" Stark approached Sora, and he bowed down, his face with a giant smile full of malice.\n\"Sora? What's happening, come on, teach him a lesson,\" the chairman wanted to judge Stark's powers as he had managed to sense their auras even through their secret room.\nIf Sora defeated him, then he wouldn't be much, and if he did defeat her, then this year would become much more interesting.\nBut what he didn't expect was…\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Stark repeated as he extended his left arm toward the white-haired girl, who looked at it for a few seconds, unable to comprehend what the hell was happening, she quite literally had the same reaction as Stark, and although it didn't show much on her face, her mind was in utter chaos.\n\"Don't worry…\" this time he whispered just low enough for only him and her to listen, \"I was just as shocked as you,\" he smiled gently, his arm still extended.\n\"What are you two doing?\"\n\"Come on, Sora, kick his ass!\"\nBoth students and teachers awaited the clash between the two, but it had been around one minute, and all they did was stare at one another.\n\"She won't shake your hand, dumbass, just leave!\"\n\"I do agree with them, Mr. Laughter,\" Theodore finally intervened, \"You might already know it, but Sora never touches anybody-\"\nHe was about to say something everyone knew: Sora was NEVER seen being close to anyone, and even her powerful family had a hard time touching her or getting her to touch them, even a hug was already a miracle if it ever happened.\nPeople called her the \"Untouchable Rose\" because of her flower powers, her emotionless condition, and her personality which didn't allow her to touch anyone, especially guys.\nShe even said it once herself in a quick interview: \"I just don't feel comfortable touching people I don't know, it's like some sort of reaction from my body I cannot control that makes me immediately back away if someone gets too close.\"\nAnd yet…\n\"Nice to meet you, Stark,\" in front of everyone's astonished gazes, Sora returned the handshake, not a single sign of discomfort in her actions, \"I'm sorry, chairman,\" she turned toward Theodore, \"But this is my friend, I won't be fighting him,\" she said in her emotionless voice, although there was a strange hint of happiness in it, one that was NEVER present normally.",

      "content": "The room fell into an eerie silence as Sora uttered the word \"friend\" out of her mouth.\nEven Theodore and the teachers seemed to be quite shaken, actually, wondering what the hell was happening for THE Sora, THE 'Untouchable Rose' to be comfortable enough with Stark to be able to shake his hands without her body being disgusted/backing away.\nAnd more than that, she called him a \"friend\"! Meaning that they met before.\nBut then, why would Stark jokingly say \"nice to meet you\" before?!\nPeople were wondering what was happening, but no answers came as Stark began to go back to his square, his sole goal being to show Sora that he was here.\n'Looks like she told us her real name in the trial though…'\n\"Well, anyway,\" Theodore coughed and got ready to ease up the atmosphere as soon as Stark returned to his place, the boy ignoring the angry and judgmental gaze from Lana, \"As for the last thing you have all been wondering: how the teams will be made!\"\nThe chairman clapped both his hands together, and the final part of the video began to play, although this time it was just a golden text that said:\n[You students make the groups, yoohoo!]\n[Once the bell rings, you will all be free to choose your own teammates to conquer the rift for three hours, then immediately afterward we will start the 'boxing raffle' for each of you to get your trials!]\n\"NICE!\"\n\"Finally some good fucking news…\"\n\"Thank you, chairman!\"\nAfter all these bad news one after the other, getting just this much was enough to make the students happy.\n[NO ONE is allowed to leave until all teams are formed, and those teams pick their respective rifts!]\n[And if anyone remains alone by the end of the timer, then they will be randomly paired with teams that need more members or with other people that are alone!]\n\"…\" Stark didn't mind, he would solo the rift anyway, so all he needed were half decent people that could manage to not be annoying for him to kill the 'Godless Demon' apostle.\n[3…]\n[2…]\n[1…]\n[RING, RING]\nAn animation of a bell appeared on the screen, and as soon as the sound came out, the entire room shook as students rushed toward the people they wanted to pair with.\n\"Hey, wanna pair?\" Lana said as she smiled.\n\"Of course, but I'm the leader, since I want to pick the card!\" Stark proposed.\n\"Fine by me, as long as I complete this trial,\" she sighed, but was confident that with Stark in her team, there was no way they could be stopped.\nNow… they just needed 48 more people.\nBut surprisingly, people actually seemed to be avoiding them.\n\"…\"\nStark actually expected for people to rush for him to join their group after all that happened, but did it maybe cause the opposite reaction?\nWere they scared that Stark's recklessness could lead to their dooms, or even worse: expulsion?!\n[Do you want to invite 'Lana Moonless' into your party?]\n[Y/N]\n'Y'\nA panel had appeared in front of everyone as soon as the bell rang, allowing them to create their very own parties without having to go report everything to the chairman as they would now able to see when someone was in a party, and how many members each group had.\nIt was pretty useful for both students and teachers.\n['Lana Moonless' has been invited to your group!]\n[48 spots remain!]\n\"Hey, Lana is here!\"\n\"Pstt~ don't go, she's already in that weirdo's group, I wouldn't risk it…\"\nAnd the last feature was the most interesting of them all: you could look up the name of the students through the search bar or by scrolling through the 'participant list', and it would show you if they were in a group, and which one they were in.\nThis could be used to sway a person you want into joining your own group as a person could always leave another one if it benefits them more.\nEven this seemed like a strategy game, but Stark just remained still, a neutral expression on his face, not wanting to participate.\nAt this point, he was just waiting for the timer to end so that he can be paired with 48 random people and get this over with.\n[Timer: 2:37:58 left!]\n\"You're… not gonna try to recruit people?\" Lana tilted her head.\n\"Nope, I'm sure you already know I could manage to beat that rift by myself, let's just wait,\" Stark smiled.\n\"Alright,\" and Lana, knowing of his strength and capabilities, actually believed in him enough to wait too.\nSora was a student as well, so she immediately went back to her spot as soon as her announcement as the 'year president' ended.\nAnd as soon as the 'team picking' began, she was IMMEDIATELY surrounded by hundreds upon hundreds of people.\n\"…\" they were all asking her to joint their group as having Sora would basically guarantee victory.\nOf course, this was how it worked: the strongest and thus most famous people in the room were the ones with the highest demand as everyone attempted to approach them, meaning they had the choice to join whoever they wanted.\nPeople such as Sora, Karl Spikeford (even after being humiliated by the former), Olivier Stardust, Lala Hunter and many more were now surrounded as if they were celebrities at a red carpet event, each person throwing out their own tempting offers of partnership.\n[Timer: 1:56:32 left!]\nAn entire hour had passed, and so many groups had already formed.\nYet Stark and Lana remained, talking to each other calmly as if they didn't even care about any of this, and they clearly didn't.\nBut… something would change all of that.\nBecause after an entire hour, Sora finally managed to push through the crowd of annoying people surrounding her, a neutral expression on her face as she approached Stark, hundreds of people still behind her though as they didn't want to give up.\n\"Want to team?\" she said calmly with her normal voice, looking at Stark in the eyes.\n\"…\" Stark looked at Lana, who shrugged, then back at Sora, and he smiled, \"Sure, why not, but I'm the leader,\" he said again.\n\"I don't mind…\" Sora mumbled as she sent out an invitation.\n['Sora Gardenis' has sent an invitation to join your party!]\n[Do you want to invite her?]\n[Y/N]\n'Y'\nThe panel flashed again, and another name was added to the group.\n['Sora Gardenis' has been invited to your group!]\n[47 spots remain!]\nAnd so suddenly, as soon as that happened and people checked their own panels to search Sora's name and confirm whatever the hell was happening…\n[Sora Gardenis is currently in a group]\n[Group Leader: Stark Heartsouls]\nIf they wanted to be with Sora, they actually needed to speak to Stark, as it is the group leader that accepts invitations.\n\"…\" all these students stared at one another, and they actually regretted not joining Stark's group when no one wanted to, now the places were going to be limited.\n[You have received 437 party invitations!]\n[Do you want to check them out?]\n'Holy…' Stark was baffled.",

      "content": "\"Hey, let us join, we're really strong,\" brown-haired twins approached Stark, summoning their weapons and showing them to him, \"We can be useful!\"\n\"Get out of here,\" a two meters tall man pushed them out of the way as he began to flex his muscles in front of Stark, \"I can smash the heads of all these monsters easily, just accept my invite-\"\nA ninja girl drop-kicked him out of the way and landed in his position, though, \"I can be stealthy and take out monsters from the back!\"\nOver and over, people kept coming around Stark, displaying their powers in front of him as a way to impress him and possibly make him want to recruit them.\nHis team had Lana, a powerful archer, Sora, the strongest classifier in the entire year according to the chairman himself, and Stark, who was respected by Sora herself.\nWho wouldn't want to join this almost guaranteed win group?\n[You have received 643 party invitations!]\nSora and Lana stood beside Stark, looking at him as he was making his decision.\n\"Well,\" he began to speak, and he immediately the surroundings became infinitely quieter, \"It's not that you guys are useless, but I pretty much can beat the rift by myself, so all I need is half decent people that won't annoy me,\" Stark said the entire truth, as he truly ONLY wanted people that wouldn't be annoying over those that would keep asking questions and press him to participate.\n\"…\"\n\"Is this guy crazy? Beating a rift by himself?\"\n\"I mean, maybe if he teamed up with Sora, then she could carry him to victory, but otherwise this is just stupid.\"\nStark's bold declaration caused murmurs to ripple through the crowd.\nBut…\n\"See, this is the reason why I'm not choosing any of you,\" he just shrugged, \"Anyway, lets get this over with so you don't annoy me.\"\nStark opened the panel with all the [Party Invitations], making everyone anxious as they could see that he was scrolling through all their names.\nAnd then…\nStark closed his eyes.\n\"What?\"\n\"Just pick someone, dude.\"\n\"That's what I'm doing,\" Stark replied.\nAnd so to everyone's shock, while his eyes were still closed, Stark began to randomly scroll through the party invitation, not even looking at the screen.\nAfter a few seconds of constant movement, he clicked on the [Accept] option of a person whose name he didn't even know.\n\"YESSSS!\" he heard a girl's shout from the crowd, \"THANK YOU!\"\nAnd just like that, Stark kept repeating that same process 46 more times, every time he selected a person, he would be hearing a cheering in the crowd, followed by dozens of other angered noises from the people who weren't selected: of course, those that were chosen were extremely happy and found justifications as to why Stark did that, while the others would just keep letting out insults.\nOf course, once someone that was insulting Stark for doing this by sheer luck was selected, they would IMMEDIATELY switch their dialogue and go on his side.\nBut what can I say, that's a human's selfishness, isn't it?\nAnd eventually…\n[Your party is full!]\nStark opened his eyes again then shrugged, \"Sorry, can't recruit anyone else!\"\n\"FUCK YOU!\"\n\"I swear to god I'm going to rip your eyes out, you little shit.\"\nThose that were invited into the party surrounded Stark as all the others angrily shouted, ready to actively attack him for doing something as dumb as choosing the people in this important trial at random.\nWas he crazy? Or was he just reckless? Or maybe it truly was that he believed he could take the rift by himself.\n'Well, if they attacked I would have just beat all their asses, but oh well,' all the other students left, deciding to create groups between one another.\nAll of [Stark's Group] was now cheering as they had been selected.\nBut…\n\"Just don't come close to me during the rift, and we'll be good,\" Stark positioned himself in front of everyone and spoke, \"Let me do my own thing, and you'll pass the first trial easily.\"\n\"Alright.\"\n\"Yessir!\"\nSurprisingly, all these people listened pretty damn well, maybe luck was truly on his side!\n[Timer: 1:32:58 left!]\nAnd so just like that.\n[Timer: 54:11 left!]\nThe remainder of the time passed, with nothing else happening besides some more drama in the room, since people actively fought for places in the more powerful groups.\nKarl actually even hosted a mini-tournament between four people for the last spot, and the winner was selected.\n[Timer: 5:00 left!]\n[Be quick!]\nAt this point, almost everyone had already gotten inside a group, except for a few people who didn't even bothered looking for one, instead just opting for luck to do the rest of the work.\n~DING, DING, DING~\nThe bell animation appeared on the screen again.\n[Timer over, all groups have been formed, and people without a group have been randomly assigned to one!]\n[It is time to start the final part of this entrance ceremony: picking the rift!]\nThe chairman and teachers had been sitting on random chairs that appeared out of nowhere and discussing private matters, while the students were quite literally fighting for a spot in the top groups.\nAnd so once the [Team Gathering] phase ended…\n~SNAP~\nHe snapped his fingers, and all the chairs they had been sitting on disappeared, none of them were taken aback though, all standing up at the perfect moment, their timing immaculate.\n\"Very well,\" Theodore snapped his fingers for the second time, and a beautifully carved table, worth millions of rher coins, appeared on the stage, and he gestured dramatically toward a large, ornate box that had appeared on top of that table.\nStark eyed it, feeling the anticipation rising in his veins as he REALLY wanted to get that [Death Rift] card, thus giving him the rift that contained the 'Godless Demon' apostle as its final boss.\n\"Each group will draw a card from the [Drawing Box]. The card will reveal the rift you'll face. Some will be easier than others, but make no mistake, each has its own challenges,\" he explained for the second time as it had been more than three hours since they read the text on that screen.\nLana leaned in closer to Stark, whispering, \"You think we'll get a tough one? Would be perfect if we got the easiest one, hehe~\"\nBut unbeknownst to her, the black-haired boy was actually aiming for the hardest one of all, although Stark knew that if he said that to his team, then they would surely try to stop him, even Sora would possibly attempt to bind him, and with her reputation, she would easily be selected as the new leader.\nThough, he couldn't see any universe where Sora would do something about what other people said, especially since he had saved her and proven his strength already.\n\"Doesn't matter, just need to get in and out,\" he said nonchalantly, clearly avoiding the question.\nThe chairman gestured to the box, his voice booming through the lobby, \"All of you should have just received a number on your panel ranging from 1 to 50, it was selected at random and it will be the order you will pick a card in!\"\n~DING~\nAnd just as he said, a panel appeared in front of Stark, it was completely blue, with the number 8 written in white.\n\"So I guess we're picking pretty early, that's good, it means we have less chances to pick the [Death Rift] card,\" Lana sighed, and everyone else in the group felt happy too.\nAfter all, the bigger the number, then the higher your chances of picking that hellish card that the holographic screen had told them would be almost impossible to complete at their level!\nWell… that is as long as it wasn't picked by another group.\nAnd honestly, everyone, even Karl and all the strong classifiers didn't want to get it.\n\"Group number one's leader, please step forward and draw.\"\nA nervous looking girl in group one gingerly stepped forward, and arrived in front of the table with the box floating.\n\"Please place your hand and pick a card,\" Theodore, \"I promise there is no scary monster inside.\"\nShe reached a trembling hand into the box and pulled out a card.\nAnd as soon as she did…\n~DING~\nThe holographic screen that was set above the stage, which everyone could see, flickered to life, displaying the name of her chosen rift: [Forest of Shadows].\nIn addition to that, the card she had picked was actually displayed in front of everyone too, rotating around slowly as to allow people to read the front and back, much like when the [Death Rift] card they had been shown, although this one wasn't blurred.\nStark didn't read the info as he wasn't bothered though.\nMore groups passed, each getting their cards.\nAnd eventually…\n\"Group number eight's leader, please come forward,\" Theodore spoke, and Stark knew it was his time.\n\"Good luck!\" Lana nodded, while Sora just kept looking at him normally.\nIf only Lana knew that with Stark, luck wasn't a factor at all.",

Quite sadistic, aren't they?\n\"Good, thanks Breach,\" Theodore responded to the vice-chairman, he absolutely loved Stark's personality and how chaotic anything he touched or got near became, and to him, it would have been immensely funnier if Stark did in fact get the hardest rift of all.\nBut, alas, it was impossible…\nStark reached for the interior of the box, his teammates even more pressure than he did after his words.\n'Come on…' Stark kept mumbling over and over as he closed his eyes and sensed the cards inside the box, letting the cold feeling around his fingers decide which he would pick.\nAnd suddenly…\n[Talent: Chosen One, activated]\n\"…!\" this could only mean one thing, and so Stark smiled as a card seemingly appeared in his hand out of nowhere.\n~FWISH~\nHe pulled out his hand, and inside of it was… the card with the skull on it.\n[SOMEONE HAS PICKED THE DEATH RIFT CARD!]\nThe holographic screen above the stage displayed some sort of alarm as the room began to flicker in and out with a crimson color.\n\"As I said,\" he shrugged as he turned toward his teammates, who were all baffled.\n\"BREACH?\" Theodore turned toward the vice-chairman.\n\"H-How?\" Breach's eyes widened, \"This is not possible, Theodore, I can promise you that the spell was successful, this is not logical…\"\nAnd so this could only mean one of two things: the spell did indeed have a problem, or… Stark's bad luck defied reality.\n\"Well, I'll take it I guess,\" Stark sighed, fainting sadness, but deep inside he was throwing himself a party alongside [Domination] and [Alchemist].\nHe went back to his group under everyone's watchful gaze, and when he arrived…\n\"WHAT THE FUCK?\"\n\"IF YOU KNEW YOUR LUCK WAS THIS BAD, YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST ASKED SORA TO LEAD!\"\nMost of them were complaining, and even Lana looked uncomfortable at the idea of attempting such a rift.\n\"Don't worry, folks,\" Stark eased up the atmosphere, \"I promise to conquer it by myself if needed, I don't need anyone else!\" he hit his chest twice as a sign of promise.\n\"…\" no one could say anything, was this guy insane?\nBut…\n\"I think we should trust him… he is strong…\" Sora suddenly said, and the sole fact she spoke made everyone shut up as they wanted to hear her, \"Stark… is very strong…\"\nThis was all she said, but if even the Sora, who they believed was their only hope, acknowledged Stark, then maybe…?\n\"See, I told you!\" Stark smiled, \"You don't even have to enter the rift to be honest, I'll do it alone!\"\nOf course, this was only said by Stark because he didn't want to be annoyed while exploring, and also so they couldn't steal his experience or kill the 'Godless Demon' apostle!\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Lana sighed, \"Just us the card, quick.\"\n\"Righto!\" Stark smiled as he joined his palms and placed the card in the middle, since it was fairly big.\nThe ominous skull with its crimson eyes almost felt like it was staring directly at their souls, sending a shiver down the spines of several of them, but nonetheless, they still needed this info as it would be all they had.\n[Take the card for the information to appear!]\nThis was written on the card, but as Stark's hands were busy holding the semi-giant card between them, Lana was the one who gently taped it.\nAnd suddenly…\n~FWISH~\nA crimson panel appeared in the air right above the card, making it possible for everyone to read the information.\n…\n[Name:] Corpse Cemetery\n[Difficulty:] Nightmare\n[Level Range:] 125-150 (only people around this level are allowed to enter).\n[Boss:] ??? (Godless Demon Apostle)\n[Information:] A cemetery corrupted by the curse of the 'Forsaken', the monsters there are all dead, killed by him, yet their bodies move like puppets, following his will, with no chance of ever defying him.\n[There are 4 zones in this rift.]\n[Location of the Rift:] Each of you has been granted a [Location Panel], check it out to know the location of the rift!\n…\nThis was all the info they got, and below this wall of text were now one, but two pictures.\nOne was showing an ominous cemetery filled with mist, making it almost impossible to see anything.\nAnd the other… depicted a towering figure, draped in tattered black robes, its skeletal hands gripping a gnarled staff. A swirling mass of shadows hovered around it, twisting and writhing like a living thing.\nBelow the second imagine was the word \"Reaper\" written in gold.\nThis was all the information they would be getting, but the sole sight of that thing on the second picture, which they assumed was the boss, made them cautious.\n\"Still think you can take it by yourself?\" the tall man that had flexed his muscles to Stark before asked.\n\"…\" Stark looked at the pictures, then back at him, \"Yeah, I would win.\"\n\"Oh well, I am really excited to see that then,\" he groaned.\nSoon after that, all 50 groups had successfully passed, although the ones after Stark did feel relieved as there was no chance they would be getting that hellish [Death Card].\n\"Everyone got their cards and teams,\" Theodore gestured as he spread his arms wide, \"And this means… that the first trial shall begin, see you all in four months, or less depending on whether 30 groups complete their rifts before that!\"\nAnd so just like that, they were all dismissed, meaning that they could do whatever they wanted during these four months, under the condition that they beat the boss of their rift, obviously.\nStark was more ready than ever before, though, no chance in hell he was letting that opportunity slide!",

      "content": "Everyone was allowed to leave the entrance ceremony's room once all the announcements were over.\nBut they were given one more order:\n\"Do not say anything about what happened here today, anyone who does will be found and expelled,\" that is all Theodore said, and with this simple threat everyone vowed to keep quiet.\n\"Don't worry, I'll do it!\" Stark saw all the skeptical members of his group off as they all began to leave the room as the exit door had opened.\nOf course, not only were they met with the light of sun, which hit them kind of hard after staying inside for more than 5 hours, but more importantly… what surprised them the most was the sheer amount of people awaiting them.\nHundreds of reporters, cars, and even helicopters were filming their every move as soon as they left.\nThere were even some cameras on the very tall buildings.\nOf course, they were humans, so they absolutely loved the attention.\nMeanwhile, Stark, Sora and Lana were the only remaining members of the team to still be inside.\n\"Are you sure can do it alone?\" Lana questioned, seemingly worried that Stark was going on some crazy adventure and trying to fight impossible monsters against all the odds.\n\"Oh come on, Lana, have you ever seen me die doing this?\" Stark smiled confidently.\n\"Huh, yeah, I did?\" Lana remembered the time he did against Judicator, being cut in half.\n\"Same…\" Sora mumbled, as he had died twice in front of her.\n\"…\" Stark rolled his eyes, \"Have you ever seen me TRULY die, though?\"\nAnd as none of them answered, only glancing at each other to check if what they were hearing was right…\n\"Exactly!\" Stark nodded, \"Don't worry, I'll be fine by myself, I prefer to be alone anyway as, y'know, defending people isn't my thing,\" this time he specifically looked at Sora, who actually felt a little bit of shame, her emotionless expression faltering slightly.\nThey soon after left the room, but were also met with the crowd of reporters who kept taking pictures of them.\n\"…\" Stark liked attention, don't get him wrong, but he actually found that quite annoying.\n\"How are we supposed to get out?\" Lana was an archer, no way to get out, and Sora could potentially injure people using her plants.\nBut Stark on the other hand…\n\"Crimson Ball Transmission,\" he mumbled as he summoned the crimson ball in his hand, then threw it with all his strength, sending it very far, way above the horde of reporters and classifiers.\n[Point Set: It is safe to teleport!]\nAs soon as he saw that, he smirked.\n\"Hey,\" Stark turned toward the two girls, reaching his opened hands at them, \"Hold my hand for a second.\"\n\"W-What?\" Of course, Lana was flustered, \"What do you mean?!\"\n\"…\" but thankfully, Sora grabbed Stark's left hand without a single ounce of hesitation.\n\"Thank you, Sora,\" Stark smiled at her, he liked her straightforwardness.\n\"H-Hey, I can do that too!\" Lana also grabbed Stark's hand as to not be left out (she was totally not jealous, obviously).\n\"Thanks,\" Stark nodded, ready to snap his fingers.\nBut…\n\"Oh, I'm stupid,\" he realized he couldn't really snap his fingers if both his hands were holding someone, so he removed his hands from Lana's and instead put it around her shoulder.\n\"…\" Lana didn't say anything, although she did jolt a little.\nAnd so finally…\n~SNAP~\nStark quickly tightened the grip around Sora's hand, and hugged Lana as to guarantee she wouldn't stay here.\n~FWISH~\n~POOF~\nAnd so almost instantly, surrounded by a crimson aura, they found themselves in another street, far from the academy and all the reporters.\nStark looked to his left and right, then sighed in relief as he noticed Lana and Sora were indeed there, although both closing their eyes as they didn't expect this.\nThey had never felt something like this in their lives, and to be honest, they didn't want to experience it again so suddenly.\n\"Done,\" he freed himself from their grasp, then gave them a thumbs up, \"Now we can do whatever we want!\"\nAnd so he began walking away, with the full intent of going back to his apartment complex to prepare for the rift as soon as tomorrow arrives.\n\"Well… Goodbye, Sora,\" Lana waved at the white haired girl, then began to follow Stark.\n\"You're going in the same direction?\" Sora tilted her head, but was still holding that emotionless look, though.\n\"Oh, yeah, we live in the same building, actually right next to each other,\" Lana scratched her head in embarrassment.\n\"…\" Sora looked down at the ground, then back at Lana, \"Alright,\" and thus she began to walk away in the opposite direction.\nShe didn't want them to see it, but her face did falter slightly when Lana said that! Why were they living right next to each other? Could it be…?\n'No, doesn't matter,' she shook her head lightly, 'But… what the hell is this feeling… I don't know…' she decided to ignore it as she truly didn't know what it was, having never felt such a thing before was confusing to her.\nBack to Stark and Lana, they (yet again) hailed for a taxi, and were transported to their complex, thankfully enough the roads were a bit emptier than before, otherwise it would have been a hassle.\nThey both used the elevator to climb to the third floor this time, and each went inside their respective apartments.\n\"Are you really, REALLY sure?\" Lana asked one more time as Stark opened the door.\n\"…\" but the boy just looked at her, \"Yeah,\" he shrugged, \"By the way I'll probably be gone by the morning, so don't wait up or anything.\"\n\"You plan to go tomorrow?!\" Lana was shocked, usually people wanted to take a bit of a break, then discuss their plans with others to conquer the rift.\nYet… not only was he going alone, but without thinking of any viable plan at all?\nLana knew Stark was crazy and reckless, but this was going far beyond the limits of normal.\n\"It's fine,\" he patted her head, although she didn't blush or anything this time as she kept staring at him dead in the eyes, knowing the dangers of his actions, \"I guess we'll see each other when I kill that boss, and it's announced I completed it.\"\n\"And you also plan to do it all in one go? While even the chairman said it would take us two months?\" Lana was baffled.\n\"I mean, the rift has four zones, and it can't be that big, I think the average time it takes is because people know they have four months, if they were given one week, many would have completed it in under that, plus if your group is injured you have to take a one or two weeks break, which adds to the time,\" Stark explained, and the worst of all was that it actually made sense to Lana.\n\"That's- I- Sigh…\" Lana sighed then smiled, \"Alright, then I guess I'll see you later, you crazy idiot,\" she lightly punched Stark's chest in a friendly way, \"Just don't die on me.\"\n\"I won't,\" Stark's aura became more powerful as he said that, and so he finally entered his apartment, \"Well then…\"\nIt was time to start the trial of the first semester of this academy.",

      "content": "As Stark had some time left, he decided to yet again go inside his [Memories Museum] to train.\nHe had gotten very familiar with all his skills now, and even though controlling the [Sculk Necklace] was very complicated since the weird liquid never truly did it what he wanted, when he actually managed to touch a monster with the slime-like substance, then he would end up combo-ing the boss 70 percent of the time since it would be restrained by the liquid.\nStark knew why he struggled this much once the sculk ever so much as grazed him now: even other monsters had a hard time with it, so no wonder.\n\"The time…\" Stark mumbled, it had been so long that he had been inside the [Memories Museum] to try and fight a different combination of bosses he hadn't checked, \"WHAT?\"\nIt was currently 4 am, meaning that he had essentially spent all day yesterday, as well as a good chunk of the night, fighting.\n\"I mean…\" he scratched the back of his head, \"I wanted to be as ready as possible, and I think I am, but cutting back on sleep won't do it… I still need some stamina after all…\"\nAfter a fight against his own mind, Stark finally decided that he didn't need that much sleep, and that he would sleep around 3 or 4 hours, weirdly enough though, he actually wasn't THAT tired.\n\"Weird…\" was it [Domination] fueling him as to keep him awake?\nWell, it didn't matter.\nHe left the [Memories Museum], then jumped on his bed and closed his eyes, making sure to set up his alarm.\n***\n\"…\" Stark opened his eyes, fully knowing where he would be as it always happened, there wasn't a single night of sleep where he didn't meet them after all.\nStrangely enough, though, the scenarios [Domination] and [Alchemist] would find themselves in this dream realm were always different.\nRight now, Stark was sitting on the bench of a lively park, and although it was surrounded by darkness, trees and grass were still visible, making it much different than the usual depressing atmosphere of this world.\n\"Ready?\" he heard [Domination]'s voice to the left, and he saw it standing beside him, on the same bench.\n\"Of course he is, he can always use my potions to destroy them anyway,\" [Alchemist] shrugged.\n\"Oh yeah, of course, he can use the only GOOD potion you have, which is [Crystal Stun],\" [Domination] shook his head.\n\"Hey, if he actually took the time to buy some potions instead of praying to get some news one from monsters, then I'm sure our crafting station would already been at level 10!\" [Alchemist] scoffed, and it was true, since Stark didn't really take the time to do any of that, he just constantly bought materials for the potions he currently had, but never bothered to buy new ones.\n\"Doesn't matter, tomorrow is a big day for us!\" [Domination] closed his right fist and pointed it at the sky, \"New rift, new boss, new apostle to defeat!\"\n\"Right,\" Stark spoke for the first time.\n\"Anyway, we don't have anything much to say beside that you should be careful, going solo always worked until now, but I have a bad feeling about this,\" [Alchemist] nodded, and [Domination] agreed with that statement.\n\"Don't worry, I'll manage,\" Stark also got up from the bench, while Alchemist remained sitting.\nAnd so, before he could even realize it, the park had disappeared.\n\"Good luck,\" he heard Alchemist's and Domination's voice as they vanished as well, and then he lost consciousness too.\n***\n~BEEP, BEEP, BEEP~\nHis alarm was ringing, and Stark quickly shut it down as he opened his eyes and got up immediately, not wasting a single second.\nIt was currently exactly 8 am, and Stark wanted to leave while the streets were still mostly empty.\nQuick breakfast, shower, changing clothes, and he was all set!\n\"…\" he left his apartment, carrying nothing in his hands other than his sole determination, which was burning his heart so strongly that it actually hurt a bit.\nRight as he walked through the hallway before reaching the stairs, he passed in front of Lana's hand, stopping for three seconds to look at it.\n\"…\" but then he immediately continued walking.\nHe reached the ground pretty quickly.\n\"Anyway, need to find the location of the rift…\"\nHe remembered reading something about it on the [Death Rift] card, which he owned since he was the leader.\n…\n[Location of the Rift:] Each of you has been granted a [Location Panel], check it out to know the location of the rift!\n…\n\"Right… But how do I open it is the question?\" he mumbled, \"Well… might as well try.\"\n\"Location Panel!\" he semi-shouted.\nAnd… nothing.\n[You need to also say the name of the rift, since you have been put on the list of people who can do it.] another panel appeared to help him though, otherwise it would have been really difficult.\n\"Location Panel: Corpse Cemetery!\" he spoke again.\nAnd this time…\n~DING~\n[Follow the arrow!]\nExtremely similarly to back when he received that watch from Arthur, the archer king, to conquer [Sierra's Death Path], an arrow appeared on a panel visible to Stark, pointing to a direction.\n[26.7 kilometers away, inside the sealed cabin of the 'crosswood cemetery'.]\n\"Oh,\" it even added some sort of note afterward as to show him (and probably his other teammates) the exact location, looks like the chairman and the teachers had thought of everything, \"Well at least I'll know now.\"\nStark didn't want to waste any more time, and so he immediately hailed for a taxi, which were basically his primary way of traveling as he didn't have a driver's license, or a car in that regard, maybe he could ask Lana though, she would probably give one to him…?\nIn the end, he removed that thought from his mind as it actually kind of embarrassed him to think of Lana as his… money giver?\n\"Please, to the 'crosswood cemetery'\" he asked the driver as soon as he got inside the car.\n\"Oh?\" the driver looked at him for a few seconds, but just shrugged, \"You should be careful there, kid, it's been abandoned and no one goes anymore since there have been rumors that a powerful rift has opened there.\"\n\"Yeah, I've been tasked with conquering it,\" Stark said nonchalantly, not finding any excuse like 'I'm visiting someone'.\n\"…\" the driver stared at Stark with a neutral expression, then started up the car, \"Alright… I hope you do a good job, then.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\nIt took them around 30 minutes in the car to finally reach the cemetery, which was placed in a really 'creepy' side of the capital, since most of the buildings there were abandoned.\n\"Heard it was from monster attacks,\" the driver informed Stark, \"I would really be careful if I was you, kid.\"\n\"Interesting…\"\n[1.5 kilometers away, inside the sealed cabin of the 'crosswood cemetery'.]\n\"Well, that's all,\" the driver stopped in front of the gates of the cemetery, which was literal end of the road, there was nowhere else to go from there.\n\"Alright, thanks,\" Stark paid and left the car, then the taxi driver went away, disappearing as soon as he turned around the corner, \"And now…\"\n\"It's time to do this…\" he stared at the cemetery from behind the gate, and it actually sent a shiver down his spine.\nThere was a really creepy atmosphere, and he could sense it in his bones that there was, in fact, a rift in this place.\nBut right as he tried reached his hand to open the gate…\n~CLUNK~\nHe noticed that it was locked by a powerful-looking chain.\n\"Oh, great,\" Stark sighed, but it didn't bother him.\nThere was a sign right next to the entrance: [Do not attempt to climb up, an electricity spell has been placed on the bars.]\nHe could see the cemetery through the bars, but he couldn't access.\nAnd when he reached for one of them…\n~ZAP~\n\"-100!\"\nIt was in fact protected, but thankfully enough the people that set it up didn't make it too powerful, as it would have surely killed someone if it was.\n\"Crimson Ball Transmission,\" Stark though wasn't bothered, as he just summoned the crimson ball in his hand, then threw it above the gate, landing on the ground inside the cemetery.\n~SNAP~\nHe was teleported inside without a single problem.\nTo be honest, even outside of battles, [Crimson Ball Transmission] was an incredible and practical skill, at least much more than the boy originally believed.\nIt allowed Stark to set up a point in the real world in case he wanted to go back, but also allowed him to get past areas that wouldn't normally possible to get past, and quite easily too.\nAnd then there was the teleportation in battles, which were also amazing, allowing him to take enemies aback every time.\n\"Anyway,\" but now that Stark was inside the cemetery, he looked around, and all he could see was a small stone road leading deeper inside, tombstones scattered everywhere, and a thick layer of mist blocking the view.\nIt was in the morning, but the mist made it hard to see even though the sun was up.\n[800 meters away, inside the sealed cabin of the 'crosswood cemetery'.]\n\"Let's get this over with.\"\nAnd so he began walking down the stone path, trying to find the 'cabin' and the rift.",

      "content": "The mist swirled around Stark's legs as he stepped carefully along the stone path.\nEach footstep echoing against the silence of the cemetery, and the chill in the air wrapping around him like a cold embrace.\n\"…\" Stark didn't mind though, he wasn't afraid, and he just followed the stone path, looking around once in a while, just to see hundreds of tombstones from different people, probably classifiers that passed away from monsters?\nIt did seem like \"classifier\" was one of those professions where you wouldn't live long enough to grow old after all.\nStark kept walking for a pretty good amount of time, he didn't check his phone since no reason to, but it did feel like at least twenty minutes had passed.\nThis cemetery was so big it was actually scary to think it was abandoned only because of a rift appearing.\nAnd Stark could only wonder just how bad that rift would be.\n\"Well… as long as I can kill one of those apostles…\" he mumbled.\nAnd less than five minutes later… he reached the end of the stone path.\nAnd what was waiting for him at the end, as you might have guessed… was the wooden cabin.\nStark could FEEL the powerful aura emanating from it, and he didn't even know how the wooden structure didn't crumble as it was constantly shaking.\nStark reached for the closed door, ready to open it and see what this is all about.\nBut right as he was about to turn the handle…\n[Warning! You will teleport to a dangerous rift if you open this door!]\n[It is advised for you to go back!]\n[There isn't just one apostle-]\nSome sort of warning came up, but Stark didn't even bother reading all of it as he swung the door open.\nImmediately, he was greeted with a gray portal that was sucking everything outside towards it.\nAnd obviously, Stark was no different.\n\"W-Wow?\" Stark was being sucked by the portal, and even though he tried to resist slightly just to make sure everything was alright, he was still forced to enter the rift.\nAnd then the door closed behind him, meaning no one would come for him.\n***\n~THUD~\nAfter the weird feeling of being transported through time and space, Stark landed in the rift.\n[Welcome to the \"Corpse Cemetery\"!]\n[Difficulty: Nightmare]\n[Number of classifiers: 1]\n[Oh wow, you're brave!]\n\"Appreciate it,\" Stark shrugged.\n[You are in the first zone: \"The Road to Death\"!]\n[Good Luck!]\nAs always, the panels that explained everything Stark needed to do appeared, then disappeared just as quickly.\nAnd now… he was truly alone.\nFirst of all, the first thing Stark did was activate the perk of [Domination] he got at level 25, which was [Facial Camouflage], thus hiding his face with his aura, he didn't know why he did it, but it just felt right.\nThen Stark took a minute to observe his surroundings.\nAnd…\n\"Huh?\" he was extremely confused, \"Wait a damn minute…\"\nHe turned around and…\n\"Knew it,\" he saw a giant gate, extremely similar to the one he bypassed to enter the cemetery in the real world, and beyond it was nothing but darkness, meaning no way to leave.\nRight now, Stark was in an exact replica of the \"crosswood cemetery\" he had traversed to reach the cabin.\nThe dark green grass was omnipresent everywhere, the tombstones were placed in the exact same spots, and the stone path led ahead, although it was a bit more difficult to look far because the mist in the rift was much thicker.\nStark scanned the area, a sense of unease creeping in as the white mist curled around his legs, seemingly attached to the ground.\n\"Alright, Stark, focus,\" he muttered to himself, pushing forward along the stone path.\nHe could hear whispers in his ears as he advanced, but they didn't bother him that much.\nSurprisingly, even after ten minutes, Stark met absolutely no monsters, so he just kept going, hoping to reach the second zone quickly.\n\"…\" but deep inside, he knew this couldn't be it.\nTHIS was the rift of the apostle? This was the [Death Rift] card the chairman talked about?\nOf course, there was the possibility that this rift was somewhat like the [Domination] trial: making it seem FAIRLY easy, until you reach the first sublevel and realize the monsters are tougher than all others level combined, and then you reach the boss and realize that It's actually almost impossible to defeat it.\nIn this case it would be like: very easy first, second, and third zone, but then the fourth is a total nightmare, and the apostle comes to finish the work.\nYet… right as Stark was thinking about that possibility…\n~CREAK, CREAK~\nHe hurt noise behind him, and once he turned… he noticed that all the tombstones that were placed on the sides of the path close to where he was were all shaking like crazy.\nThose behind, in front of him, on the side, all of them were shaking.\nAnd then…\n~CRACK~\nWith a simple sound, all the tombstones tore apart.\n\"…\" Stark knew what this meant, and so he positioned himself.\nAnd what came out of them… was one single type of monster.\n[It's the only type in the first zone, but their sheer number is what makes it scary!]\nStark clenched his fists, the chill of the air sharpening his focus.\nThe monsters crawled from the cracked tombstones, skeletal figures clad in tattered rags, their hollow eyes glowing with a sinister light.\n\"Perception!\" they were pretty slow, so he had the time.\n…\n[Name: Hollow Skeleton]\n[Level: 125]\n[HP: 60000]\n[Strength: 5127]\n[Stamina: 9999]\n[Speed: 783]\n[Defense: 431]\n[Skills: Bone Shatter, Skeletal Barrage, Grave Bind, Wraith's Embrace, Curse of Decay, Haunting Whispers, Puppet.]\n…\nOther than the fact their stamina was abnormally high, probably since they cannot get tired, all their other stats except strength were very, very low, and their HP too, it would probably take only one strike from Stark to kill one.\nBut this was the problem: hundreds of them were coming out of each tombstone, slowly advancing toward the boy.\nSome had blades, others scythes, while the majority remained empty-handed, probably since if they ever even got close to Stark and grabbed him, then he would be fucked.\nAnd their number also meant another thing: much like the zombies in the second sublevel of the trial, they wouldn't be giving out much EXP individually.\nBut as a group, then it would surely be a lot.\nHow to kill them all was the problem, though.\nBut it was a problem Stark didn't have.\n\"…\" the boy wasn't bothered, actually, he was waiting for all of them to come out of their spot and get closer to him, \"Focus…\"\nHe closed his eyes, and sensed all of their auras as they slowly got closer, wanting to make sure that he didn't fail whatever he was trying to do.\nStark got the [Exorcist] class, and the entirety of the [Corpse Cemetery] was mostly covered by undead beings, meaning that they were weak not only to his punches since domination's aura had merged with exorcist, but that he also had two skills specially designed to wipe out both a horde of monsters, but also powerful elites.\nAnd in this case…\n\"Come on…\" sweat poured from Stark's forehead as he could sense the hundreds of presence around him, \"Don't be scared…\"\nThis was one of the most dangerous things he had done probably, as closing your eyes when surrounded by this many monsters, not even sure you could perceive them all, was basically suicide.\nLana would probably strangle him for doing that.\nBut now that he was alone…\nHe waited… and waited… and then, when the monsters were close enough, raising their arms to use their skills…\n\"I got you all,\" he opened one of his eyes as it burned with aura.\nAnd…\n\"CRIMSON PURIFICATION!\"\nThe crimson/golden aura flared to life around Stark, a brilliant halo that pulsed with energy forming around him.\n\"Feel the light!\" he shouted, thrusting his arms forward.\nThe moment his voice broke through the air, the wave of holy energy surged outward.\n~WHAM~\nA shockwave radiated from him, sending some sort of [Holy Slash] from all directions around him.\n\"Kldklkl~\"\n\"Garhh…\"\nThe range was immense, and so all the horde of [Hollow Skeletons] was hit, the moment they came in contact with the attack being the last as they all crumbled to the ground, unable to withstand the holy power.\n[Critical Hit!]\nAnd so…\n\"Phew…\" Stark wiped all that sweat from his forehead, then smiled.\nIf it wasn't for [Crimson Purification], he would have surely struggled so much more, if not died, so he could definitely thank everything that he got the [Exorcist] class.\nBut killing this many monsters could only mean one thing…\n[You have slain \"Hollow Skeleton lv125\", gaining 28391 EXP!]\n[You have slain \"Hollow Skeleton lv125\", gaining 28114 EXP!]\n.\n.\n[You have killed 274 'Hollow Skeletons'.]\n[Due to their number and natures as \"puppets of the apostle\", the experience points you will get are gonna be reduced!]\nAnd so that meant…\n[+7,703,513 experience!]\n\"Oh… shit…!\" Stark's eyes widened.\nThe harder the rifts and enemies, the more exp he was getting, and this was yet another record broken for him, as he had never received so much at once.\nAnd of course, getting this much experience could only mean one thing.\n~DING, DING, DING~\nThe familiar sound of leveling up was heard by the boy.\n\"Here we go…\"\nThis was only the beginning of the [Corpse Cemetery], but he was already happy that he came alone.",

level up was truly getting out of hand, true, but the fact he was still able to increase his level by three in such a short amount of time meant that it was still pretty balanced for now.\n~WISHHHH~\nStark sighed as he minimized all the panels and looked around.\nThe first zone was now completely silent, with the destroyed corpse of the [Hollow Skeletons] lying around, some still surrounded by the holy aura.\n\"Puppets of the apostle…\" he mumbled as he read that on one of the panel, specifically the one that told him he would be getting a decreased amount of EXP for these mobs since they were pretty weak, \"Well, doesn't matter, I'm killing it anyway.\"\nWith determination blazing in his eyes, Stark kept going along the stone path that was set for him, nothing bothering him anymore.\nAnd after ten minutes of eerie silence… he arrived in front of the cabin.\n\"…\" Stark was not stupid, if the first time was a trap (although he had been warned), but what about the cabin that was in the actual rift?\nThis is something he would have said normally, but there was really no other way to access the second zone, so without a single hint of hesitation he swung the door open, although he positioned himself if anything did happen.\nThe cabin was pretty small when he looked at it from the outside, barely able to hold more than five humans inside.\nBut once opened…\n\"Huh?\" the interior was giant, leading to a very long wooden hallway.\nHe could thankfully check it out from the outside, and the interior was completely made out of the same wood and texture, making it feel very… chilly for some reason.\n\"Oh well,\" Stark sighed before stepping inside the cabin.\nAnd then…\n~SLAM~\nThe door closed behind him, with no way for him to open it back, even if he tried to punch it with all his strength or using his skills.\n[Second Zone: Nightmare Loop Cabin]\n\"…\" Stark stared in front of him, and he could see the wooden walls of the cabin hallway for what seemed like infinity.\nNo matter how hard he tried to squint his eyes or use [Focus] to see the end, he just couldn't.\n\"How long is that hallway?\" he sighed as he began walking, at least he would be able to notice if any monsters tried to ambush him since it was a straight line.\nStark stepped cautiously down the seemingly endless hallway, the wooden floor creaking under his weight.\nThe first five minutes went normally, with Stark suspecting nothing that bad to be occurring, after all it did take him a while before meeting the [Hollow Skeletons] in the first zone, so why should he worry?\nThen ten minutes without any monsters: alright, maybe there is something.\nAnd then twenty minutes: how long is this hallway going to keep going for…?\nThirty minutes: \"…\"\nForty minutes: \"…\"\nFifty minutes: \"Alright.\"\nStark stopped walking and looked around: behind him was the endless hallway, meaning that he had indeed been walking this distance, but in front of him was literally the same scenery as well, so it didn't help.\nWhat actually frightened Stark the most was the non-presence of monsters, which until now in every rift had ALWAYS been there to stop him.\nBut in this specific zone… they just didn't exist?\n\"Either that hallway is REALLY big, and the challenge isn't about monsters,\" Stark put his hand against his chin, \"Or… the name means something.\"\n[Nightmare Look Cabin] he checked the name again, putting all his attention on the \"loop\".\n\"Loop,\" he muttered, glancing over his shoulder, \"Hm…\"\nBut there was nothing, just the same wooden walls stretching endlessly behind him.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" he summoned his three fists, then sent them toward one of the walls.\n~BOOM, BOOM, BOOM~\nBut they weren't even damaged, all it left was a giant crimson mark as the aura remained in its spot.\n\"Since when is wood this durable?\" Stark raised his eyebrows, \"Shouldn't have gone into the cabin without a plan, huh…\"\nNot knowing what to do, Stark decided there was nothing better than just keep going and figure it out as he went.\nAnd so he started walking again, each step echoing in the silence, and this time paying much more attention than before.\nEvery single centimeters of the walls he was passing was being inspected by [Focus].\nAnd after exactly fifteen minutes…\n\"…!\" Stark's eyes widened.\nNo, he didn't find the exit or any monster or whatever.\nBut…\n\"Alright, I get it now,\" he stared at one of the walls, and on it were the traces of the [Aura Smash] attack he used fifteen minutes ago, \"That hallway loops for around fifteen minutes by walking…\"\nThere is absolutely NO rift or zone that cannot be completed, meaning that even those that contained puzzles (much like this one) or traps couldn't be used to instantly kill a classifier, as it wouldn't be fair.\nWhich meant that there was a way to get out.\nHow though was the answer Stark needed to find.\n\"Between this exact spot and the entire loop is somewhere that leads to the next zone,\" he reached his conclusion.\nStark pressed his palm against the wall, tracing the faint markings left by his earlier attack.\n\"Fifteen minutes…\"\nHe turned and began pacing again, this time going in the opposite direction, his thoughts racing.\nAs he walked, he scanned for any irregularities, any sign of a shift in the wood grain or an odd texture. He kicked at the floorboards, testing their strength, but they didn't even budge.\n\"Maybe it's not about the walls,\" he muttered, \"What if it's… a monster?\"\nAfter inspecting literally everything, taking him around an hour, Stark found nothing, and was yet again back at his original spot with the marks of the [Aura Smash] available for him to see.\n\"Think… Stark Heartsouls… think…\" Stark stood up in the middle of the hallway and closed his eyes as he began to imagine the structure of the hallway in front of him, white lines forming in his mind as to draw its shape even though he closed his eyes, \"Focus… on any kind of weird aura… anything…\"\nWith his eyes closed, Stark began to look around, the white lines showing the shape of the hallway as though they were still opened: this was a way for him to look past the walls for any aura.\nBut… there was nothing.\nEven after several minutes of focusing everything he had on his vision, he didn't see anything remotely suspicious.\nOr at least… that's what he believed.\n\"It's just… not there,\" Stark sighed as he looked down in disappointment.\nBut at that moment… his eyes widened.\n\"…!\" because exactly right under his feet, in a spot he would normally never notice it in if he didn't look down… was a dark aura.\n\"I… got you,\" Stark smiled as he kept staring down at the moving aura, this time he would make sure to get out of that shitty loop, though he didn't open his eyes again, wanting to make sure that it was indeed real.",

The air thickened, a chilling weight pressing down on him.\n\"Die…\" it growled again, its voice so rusty it was actually horrible to listen to.\nWith a flick of its wrist, shadows spiraled from its hand, coiling through the air toward Stark.\nBut…\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE,\" Stark just rolled out of the attack's way, \"Good try!\"\n\"…\" the green eyes were still hollow though, showing no malice or any sort of resentment whatsoever, the monster was just… staring, no emotions in its eyes.\n\"WIELDING CROSS!\" yet again, Stark positioned his hands as if he was holding a baseball bat, then swung with full force to his left.\n~SLAM, BOOOM~\nThe monster was yet again hit.\n\"-231985!\"\n\"…\" and yet, it wasn't dead.\n\"Huh?\" this wasn't normal.\nStark had assumed that this monster should be an elite, yet their HPs shouldn't be that high at this current level… right?\n\"PERCEPTION!\" he shouted as he decided to check out the opponent before it could attack again.\nAnd what he saw… was shocking.\n…\n[Name: Darkness Ghost (BOSS)]\n[Level: 130]\n[HP: 114298/590000]\n[Strength: 9999]\n[Stamina: 15000]\n[Speed: 3492]\n[Defense: 4371]\n[Skills: Shadow Grasp, Aura Drain, Bone Shard Barrage, Raging Loop, Shroud of Darkness, Soul Blind, Necrotic Touch, Void Pulse…]\n…\nStark's eyes widened.\nNo, it wasn't because of the stats, which were kind of weird, or because of the skills.\nBut because… based on the \"ranking\" next to its name, that thing was a boss.\n\"A boss… in the middle of the rift?\" Stark was confused, this has never happened before, after all!\nAs to possibly comprehend what was happening, he reminded himself of all possible rankings monsters could have: Fodder, Weak, Normal, Strong, Elite, Boss, Calamity, Immortal, Universal, Divine.\nBut usually, in video games and in this world, then it was always the final boss of the rift that should be at the [Boss] category… right?\nBut what if he was wrong? There were four other difficulties after [Boss] after all.\nWhat if… he had been wrong, what if final bosses can actually be way WAY stronger than anything he ever imagined.\nWhat if… the apostle this time is from the [Calamity] difficulty? What if from now on, every rift would have progressively more difficult enemies and apostles?\nJust this thought sent a shiver down Stark's spine, as it meant that the next monsters could easily take down the warden…\n\"Doesn't matter,\" in the end he just decided to beat it and see for himself, he had said he would go alone after all, and he would never regret that decision.\nPlus, even if that thing was a boss, he still had the complete advantage no matter what as he had already damaged it for over 450000 health points in two attacks.\n\"Focus… Stark Heartsouls… you got this…\" but the fact that he knew that this thing was a boss even though he was only in the second zone was still omnipresent.\n\"…\" and the monster literally wasn't attacking, even though its strength stat proved that no matter what it did, it would surely one shot the human.\n\"Oh well, if you want to sit still, then I'll allow it!!\"\n\"…\" the green eyes filled with aura were unmoving, and even after the second attack had crashed, the monster only budged slightly, not even caring about the damage it received.\n\"GOOD… BYE!\" Stark swung for the third and final time toward the [Darkness Ghost], expecting it to take the hit again and die, but…\n\"Aura Drain…\" it whispered in a very calm voice as it positioned its giant skeletal hand in the spot where the cross was hitting.\nAnd then…\n\"GOT YOU-\" Stark wanted to shout this, but before he could even finish, his jaw dropped.\n~FWISH~\nThe [Darkness Ghost] actually stopped the cross with the palm of its hand as if it was the easiest thing in the world, then grabbed it from the tip and began to suck out the holy aura, making the cross essentially disappear in less than ten seconds.\n\"+100000\" and in addition to that, it healed itself.\nAnd then… as if it didn't care about anything, it went back to stare at Stark with its hollow eyes, one that were piercing his soul.\n\"…\" Stark knew that this definitely was a boss now.",

Stark lunged again, this time aiming for the creature's legs.\n\"Bone Shard Barrage…\" it whispered again, forcing Stark to back away for the second time.\n~FWISH~\nHe tried to avoid again, but not being able to use [Invincible Dodge] made it IMPOSSIBLE to avoid the attack as they were in a closed hallway.\nAnd so…\n~PIERCE, FWISH~\nTwo of the sharp bones that flew in all directions hit his shoulder and hip.\n\"-17362! -23911!\" the [Domination] aura protected him from receiving fatal damage, but he was still extremely low now.\n\"…\" then without wasting a single second, the monster its right arm, enveloping it in its dark aura.\nIt had been so quiet and calm until now that the fact it suddenly attacked took Stark by surprise.\nAnd yet…\n\"I… can't… move…\" there was a small hole in his hip, which hurt like hell.\nThe ghost loomed closer, its skeletal arm extending toward Stark, the dark aura swirling around its fingers like smoke.\n\"Shadow Grasp…\" it hissed, and the air grew heavy, oppressive. Stark felt an invisible force wrap around his limbs and body, tightening with a grip that wouldn't let go.\n\"WHAT THE FUCK,\" Panic surged through him as he struggled against the grasp, his breath quickening, there were shadows coiled around him, squeezing tighter, drawing him closer to the creature's mouth, basically transporting him to his doom.\nStark tried to struggle, but his hip was still throbbing with a sharp pain that just wouldn't go away, plus the wound was still fresh, blood seeping through his clothes.\nAnd so with the small amount of power he had left in this position…\n\"Crimson Healing!\" he shouted, forcing the words from his lips.\nAs soon as he activated the skill though, a crimson light began to surround the boy, and specifically the wounds on his hip and shoulder, both of them closing.\n\"+20000!\" and he regained his health, not all of it, but enough to be able to continue.\nBut there was one problem: this didn't change the fact that some weird shadows were still surrounding him, transporting him toward the creature, who had its mouth open, ready to devour the human.\nThere was one thing it seemed to forget, though: Stark was an exorcist too, and he had another skill in stock for such situation.\n\"CRIMSON PURIFICATION!\" he shouted again, as the mouth with sharp teeth was now only a few centimeters away from closing in on him.\n~FWISH~\nA radiant burst of holy energy erupted from him, illuminating the dark space with a fierce glow, and the shadows clutching him recoiled, disintegrating into wisps of smoke as the energy pulsed outward.\n~BOOM~\nThe explosion of holy aura slammed into the Darkness Ghost with a force that shook the air, and he felt a surge of satisfaction as the ghost staggered back, its hollow eyes actually flickering, almost as if its life essence (well not really since it's an undead) was weakening.\nThe oppressive grip that had ensnared him shattered from all of that, and he stumbled back, regaining his balance and shaking off the effects of the creature's dark grasp.\n\"Didn't see that coming, did ya?\"\nThe ghost snarled, its twisted mouth opening wider, revealing rows of jagged teeth that glistened with malice, though it still didn't seem angry.\n\"You die…\"\n\"Is that all you can say,\" Stark rolled his eyes as he positioned himself for combat, \"Anyway, let's end this!\"\n\"Spatial Inventory,\" when fighting powerful monsters he couldn't defeat using his skills, Stark always opted for the next best solution: his [Crystal Stun] potions!\nHe grabbed two of those from his void, then immediately threw them at the giant ghost, both of them exploding and spreading the mist as soon as they hit it.\nBut…\n['Stun' cannot be given to undead beings.]\n\"Fair,\" he had tried, and now it would just be hands in hands combat, two punches should be enough to kill that thing as its HP were low.\n~FWISH~\nBut for the third time (HOLY!), the darkness ghost stopped Stark's assault, but this time it decided to use everything it had in stock.\n\"Good… bye…\" it spoke in a low voice as it flicked its fingers in Stark's direction, \"Soul Blind…\"\nAnd then…\n~VIOUM~\nComplete darkness.\nAnd it wasn't that the room became extremely dark, not at all, it was just… that Stark was blinded, not even able to see his own body or even imagining them.\nAll he could do…\n~FWISH, CRACK~\nWas hearing the sounds of the monster slowly approaching.\n\"HEAVEN'S WRATH,\" he drew a circle in his palms, then pointed at where the sound was coming from.\nHe couldn't see anything, and all he could do was follow his instincts to avoid the attacks, and maybe if he could kill the beast with his legendary skill before it could do anything, then it was a massive win.\nBut…\n\"Shroud of Darkness,\" he heard it whisper.\n~BOOM~\nAnd less than a second afterward, the beam descended in the location the monster was previously in.\n\"Did… I win?\"\nNo, he couldn't have won, otherwise the skill should have gone off immediately.\nAnd so, Stark immediately decided to check the description of the skill it had used.\n…\n[Skill: Shroud of Darkness]\n[Description:] Seeps into the ground, transforming its entire figure into dark aura that it can use to lurk underneath its opponents, just out of sight, and it can reappear wherever it wants, though it is indeed possible to hit the aura and damage it.\n[Domination Tip: it's going to be behind you.]\n…\nStark tried to send one [Crimson Spear] behind him, but they hit nothing.\nAnd so just like that… two minutes passed.\nTwo minutes where Stark constantly looked around, trying to identify ANY noise that could reveal its location.\nAnd right after that…\n['Soul Blind' is deactivated as it only lasts three minutes.]\n\"…\"\nSuddenly, Stark retrieved his vision, but there was nothing in front of him.\n[BEHIND YOU! BEHIND YOU! BEHIND YOU!] yet, [Focus] warned him like crazy, summoning dozens of panels each saying the same two words.\nBut before he could even turn around…\n~FWISH, GRAB~\nHe was grabbed by the [Darkness Ghost]'s right skeletal hand.\n\"What the fuck…\" Stark gritted his teeth, \"Why didn't it just do that before?!\"\n[It cannot attack you while you are soul blinded.]\n\"…Alright,\" he opened his eyes again, and before him was… the monster's giant face, its hollow eyes looking at him, and its mouth contorted into a giant smile.\n\"I… got… you… human…\" it almost looked like it wanted to laugh, yet couldn't, \"Annoying… bug…\"\n\"…\" Stark stared at it with a neutral expression though, just wanting to see what it wanted to do now that he was caught.\n\"YOU… DIE…\" it spoke louder than before.\nAnd then…\n\"NECROTIC TOUCH!\"\nThe skeletal fingers of the ghost's other hand hovered above Stark, the air thick with impending doom.\n\"…\" Stark looked above him with the most stoic of expression though, and he saw the tendrils of dark energy slowly reaching for him from above, ready to seep into his very essence and destroy his human cells as soon as it even as much as grazed him.\nBut there was a reason Stark was so calm.\nSince…\n\"Dodge Control,\" he mumbled, and the moment the [Necrotic Touch] was about to reach him, his body quite literally teleported out of the ghost's hand, landing right on top of it.\n\"…?\" even the monster was confused.\nBut before it could even figure out what had just happened…\n~SLAM~\nStark punched it in the \"face\" while he had the opportunity to.\n~BOOM~\nThe attack quite literally cause an explosion as Stark's [Domination] aura was still merged with [Exorcist], meaning that he did slightly above average damage to the undead.\nAnd so…\n\"-168372!\"\nIt died.",

He reached for the doorknob, the cold wood biting into his palm.\nAnd with a firm twist, he pulled it open.\nBut after these two zones, he expected something horrible straight out of a horror movie.\nAnd yet… all he saw… was a garden.\n[Third Zone: Reaper's Garden]\nThe air shifted as Stark stepped into the Reaper's Garden, and the scent of flowers was overwhelming.\nHe was currently standing on yet another stone path that went in a straight line toward a massive fountain he could see in the distance, probably in the middle of the zone, which meant that it wasn't that big.\nThen Stark decided to scan the surroundings: rows upon rows of flowers were present everywhere, their petals moving to the wind, and statues of grim figures loomed, placed , faces carved with eerie expressions that watched him intently.\n\"Just a garden?\" he murmured, incredulous. \"No monsters, no traps?\"\nThere were no tombstones this time, and he could see almost the entirety of the zone thanks to [Focus], or at least up until the fountain that was around three kilometers ahead.\nBut there wasn't a zone that didn't have a single monster, so he knew something was up, much like with the first one.\nWould the monsters be waiting for him right before he reached the end? Or maybe an elite would appear the moment he reached the middle point of the garden, which was the fountain.\nOr maybe…\nStark looked at the statues, their eyes almost looking like they were following him, as he took a few steps toward the fountain.\n\"…Yeah, no.\"\nAnd so Stark immediately punched one of the statues, not wanting to risk it.",

want to take any risks: what if those statues were a trap, or what if they came back to life, and thus he would be forced to fight hundreds of them.\nThe gray statue he had punched was that of an ugly gargoyle, its eyes glowing with a green aura that seemed to following him.\n~BOOM~\nObviously, as Stark's attack was enhanced by crimson aura, the statue shattered into hundreds of pieces the moment his fist hit.\n\"Huh, nothing I guess,\" Stark titled his head, he actually really expected this to be a trap, \"Hm…\" but then he looked at the other ones, and all the small auras in their eyes who kept looking at him, \"What if it's only a few of them…\"\nThis made much more sense.\nAnd so…\n~BOOM~\nStark destroyed the statue next to the one he had already shattered, and then the one in front of it.\nAnd so on, and so on.\n~BOOM, BOOM, BOOM~\nHe kept punching as he walked, he didn't lose anything by doing that, so he just slammed every statue he saw, even going as far as going back to the entrance of the garden to destroy the ones he had left.\nJust like that, of destruction passed, making Stark believe that he might have been wrong since he was getting closer and closer to the fountain in the middle.\nApproaching it though, made Stark notice that above the stone structure of the fountain was a massive gargoyle, yes, at least thrice as big as the other ones.\n\"…\" Stark look at it with a neutral expression, \"Yeah… I'm destroying this one.\"\nIf there was a trap in this entire zone, it sure as hell was this.\n~DASH~\nAnd so he began dashing toward it, wanting to get rid of it as SOON as possible.\nThe stone gargoyle's wings were extremely big too, each of them just as big as its body, and spread, a dark green aura in its eyes as it faced Stark, who didn't stop running.\n~DASH, FWISH~\nAfter reaching an appropriate distance, he jumped in the air toward the monster's statue, confident he could destroy it with one punch, too.\nStark soared through the air, muscles coiling with energy.\n\"Let's see what you've got,\" he muttered, his fist clenched tight.\nThe gargoyle's stony gaze remained fixed on him, the dark green light flickering like a heartbeat, almost judging him.\n~FWISH, SLAM~\nAs he connected, a resounding crack echoed through the garden.\n~CRACK~\nStark's punch landed, and so he fully expected it to be destroyed like all the others.\n~BAM~\nAnd yet… instead of crumbling, the gargoyle shuddered.\n\"Huh?\" Stark dropped to the ground again, looking up: the statue was not even harmed from his attack.\nInstead…\n~CRACK, CRACK~\nSmall cracks were beginning to form on the statue's stony texture, and a green light was escaping those cracks.\n~CRACK~\nAfter only ten seconds, the crack grew bigger and spread throughout its entire body.\nAnd then…\n~BOOM~\nThe explosion sent shards of stone flying in all directions, and Stark shielded his face as fragments whizzed past him, the air filled with a sudden roar.\nHe immediately looked upward toward the top of the fountain.\nAnd…\nFrom the heart of the destruction, the gargoyle emerged, its massive wings unfurling like dark shadows, green light glimmered in its eyes, now burning with life.\n\"Great,\" Stark muttered, backing away slowly, \"I had the idea but not the right execution, huh…\"\nStark thought about the possibility of using [Heaven's Wrath], which would have made it infinitely easier, though he couldn't have known.\n\"Ksssgrak~\" with a low growl, the creature flexed its wings, the ground trembling beneath its weight as it jumped from the fountain, landing on the stone path and making cracks appear on the ground.\n\"Why do they always have to be so dramatic?\" Stark shook his head, readying himself.\nBut before he could begin attacking…\n\"KKSREAAAAAKKKKK~\" the gargoyle roared again, this time ten times louder than before, creating some sort of sonic wave around its mouth because of the sheer intensity.\nAnd right as it finished its \"incantation\"…\n\"Call of the Gargoyle,\" it cast its skill and…\n~CRACK, CRACK, CRACK~\n3 of the statues he hadn't destroyed behind him cracked open, their forms crumbling to dust as the gargoyle that had been hidden inside came back to life.\n\"Just what I needed,\" he muttered, fists tightening.\nThe newly animated statues—each resembling the gargoyle although smaller—moved with an eerie grace, their bodies glistening under the faint light.\nBut they weren't the only ones since…\n~FWISH~\nFrom the other half of the zone appeared two other gargoyles, using their wings to fly and land right in front of their \"king\".\nThey were regrouping.\nBut before they could even do anything…\n\"Domi-Chains Restrain,\" he summoned the chain, spanned it in his hands a few times, then sent it toward the three flying gargoyles above him as they attempted to go toward their friends.\nThe chain whirled through the air, slicing the space between Stark and the three flying gargoyles, chasing them as if it was a predator.\nAnd…\n~FWISH, SPIN~\nSurprisingly, these things were so dumb that they didn't even notice it, meaning that they chain wrapped around one of them, then took a turn and began to surround all of them a few times, restraining them from using their wings as the chain was much more powerful than they were.\n\"Kraik?\"\n\"Grakks!\"\nThey tried their hardest to keep flapping their wings as to not fall, but it was futile as after less than 5 seconds, the chain began to suck up their energy, all three of them rolled up as the chain forced them to stick close to one another.\nAnd after a few more seconds of struggle, none of them were able to hold the weight of the three of them, so they fell.\n~FWISH… CRASH~\nTheir bodies were crushed upon impact with the hard ground, all three dying since the chain weakened them, and thus reduced their defense.\n\"Grakkr?!\"\n\"GKrakr!!!\"\nThe two other gargoyles which had placed themselves in front of the bigger one took a step back, actually scared of the human, as it so easily eliminated three of their kind.\nBut before Stark could even begin truly fighting…\n\"Krakrkz…\" the big gargoyle shook its head, and Stark could ALMOST understand what it said: useless.\n~SMASH~\nUsing its hands with sharp claws, it immediately grabbed both of the gargoyles heads and smashed them together.\n\"Gkakra…\" it didn't seem to care though, as it pierced their bodies like they were some sort of meat kebabs, then drank their blood, \"GKRKAKAKK!!!!\"\n~FWISH~\nIt threw the bodies toward Stark, who easily dodged them by stepping to the side.\nAnd now... the gargoyle looked more powerful than before, its green aura having strands of crimson one appearing on it, probably because of the blood of the others.\n\"Alright,\" Stark got into position again, \"I don't really care if you're a cannibal, but you're not eating me.\"\n\"GROOAOKKK!\"\n[Gargoyle King - Level 140 (ELITE)]\nAnd now… it was just another 1V1.",

The wound throbbed, but adrenaline surged through him, igniting his resolve.\n\"Let's do this,\" he growled, pushing himself off the ground, \"WIELDING CROSS!\"\nThe crimson/golden cross appeared above him, and he immediately took his \"baseball\" player stance, ready to slam it if the gargoyle came to closer.\n\"CALL OF THE GARGOYLE,\" but yet again, the gargoyle roared like crazy as it stopped spinning in the air, and instead just kept flapping its wings while moving left and right, staring at Stark.\nAnd of course, the fact it used this skill meant one thing: more of 'them'.\n~CRACK, CRACK~\nThis time, only two of the gargoyle statues cracked opened, and the creatures hiding inside of them came out, both rushing toward Stark as they followed the orders of their king, who knew it was useless to wait.\nBut…\n~SLAM~\nStark used one of his 3 strikes to absolutely decimate the two monsters at the same time, killing them both as they didn't seem to have that much HP to begin with.\nThe two dead gargoyles were sent flying in the opposite, one crashing against the fountain and the other just falling to the ground.\nAnd…\n\"Bloodlust Surge,\" the king gargoyle dropped to the ground in a giant thud, then grabbed the bodies of its two minions and squeezed them out while placing them above its mouth, it was yet again drinking the blood of its companions.\nAnd so just like last that time…\n~BOOM~\nThe gargoyle's body exploded as its aura became much more powerful.\n\"The more it eats, the stronger it becomes, huh…\" Stark thought, and his stance didn't falter at all as he didn't want to be taken by surprise: if that thing comes close, he would smash it away just like its minions.\nAnd just as he expected…\n\"WINGED ASSAULT,\" feeling more powerful than ever before, the gargoyle tested its luck by flying above ground, then immediately dashing toward Stark, readying its [Stone Wings] and claws to deflect or attack.\nBut… that gargoyle was extremely dumb, and its confidence got the better of it, as even its minions should have felt the holy aura emanating from Stark, one that any undead would KNOW was deadly.\nMaybe it was just so sure of its own capabilities that it didn't believe it would affect it?\n~FWISH~\n\"GRAKKKK~\" at incredible, almost teleporting, the gargoyle was already in front of Stark.\nBut in the end… it didn't matter: it had pushed its luck.\n~SLAM~\nUsing [Focus] to follow its movements, Stark immediately swung the cross as the gargoyle came close to him, hitting it straight on.\n\"STONE WINGS!\" it of course tried to use its wings as a shield and positioned them both right in front of the cross as it was about to hit its side, turning them into hard stone that couldn't be destroyed normally.\nAnd yet…\n~SLAM, BOOOOOM~\nThe wing's stone defense shattered as it was hit by the cross, the holy aura supressing its powers and weakening them enough for it to be able to pass.\n\"-183729!\"\n\"GAKGR-\" the gargoyle's green aura flickered slightly upon being hit by the crimson cross, which clearly hurt like hell.\nBut even then… Stark wasn't done.\n\"And another one,\" while the gargoyle was still being slowly sent flying toward the other direction after being hit like a baseball, Stark immediately dashed toward it, ignoring the pain as he caught up to it.\nAnd then…\n~BOOOOOM~\nHe slammed it again using his final cross strike as he didn't want to let it get up and have a chance to attack again.\n\"-211974!\"\n~BOOM~\nIt hit the wall on one of the sides, its aura weakened and a lot of bloor pouring out from different parts of its body.\nAnd yet yet again, Stark wasn't done.\nHe had learned something: if you want to end a battle quickly as you were injured, you shouldn't let the enemy do anything, instead… just overwhelm it with attacks, and it will slowly but surely be unable to answer.\nTwo [Exorcist] attacks as powerful as [Wielding Cross] on an undead were deadly no matter how you think about it, and it was visible by the gargoyle's expression and movements: one of its eyes had stopped burning with aura, meaning that the green light that was originally there disappeared, and blood and sweat could be seen all over its ugly body.\n\"…\" Stark was hurting too, but he was still standing, staring at the gargoyle with disgusted eyes.\nAnd… as he said before… he wouldn't even let it do anything.\n\"CRIMSON PURIFICATION… HOLY CONCENTRATION,\" and so he decided to use his exorcist skill's new perk as to completely annihilate his opponent in one go, and also check out how powerful that attack truly was as the panels that had given it to him had hyped it up so much and described it as a [Legendary] perk, the first one he had ever gotten.\n\"Let's see, now,\" Stark's eyes burned with crimson and golden aura as he smiled, pointing at the gargoyle king.",

      "content": "\"CRIMSON PURIFICATION… HOLY CONCENTRATION!\"\nWhile the gargoyle king was still down from literally being smashed by two attacks that completely weakened it, it lifted its eyes, only one of them functioning as it the green aura was still lit up in it.\n\"GRAKKKQS~\" in addition to that, one of its wings was damaged as it had tried to use it to block the cross, a fatal mistake in that regard.\nBut even then, the king still believed there was a chance for it to come out victory out of this mess.\nIt took it around thirty seconds, but in the end, it was able to stand back on its feet, swaying left and right as to keep its balance, the holy aura hurting its head.\nAnd when it finally decided to look at Stark again… its eyes widened, and it finally realized something: it would have never been able to win.\nIn front of it was a giant energy ball completely created from holy aura, Stark's arms spread around it as it was roughly the size of his chest, an aura pouring out from his fingers to give power to the attack.\nThis was the legendary perk of [Crimson Purification]: Holy Concentration.\nIt did take them quite a bit of it to do it since Stark had never done it before, but he had successfully managed to complete his energy ball before the gargoyle got up.\nBasically, instead of focusing his aura to send it around his body like some sort of holy wave, he grabbed all of that aura and put it inside that energy ball, making it slowly grow with a magnificent golden color.\nAnd when he was finally done…\n\"Adios,\" he smiled as he pushed the ball out with his palm, sending it toward the gargoyle king at intense speed.\nAnd of course, in its weakened state, the monster had absolutely no chance to avoid it.\n~FWISH… BOOOOM~\nNot only did the holy energy ball touch its body perfectly, but upon impact, it immediately exploded, sending out waves of aura around it, meaning that if it potentially had enemies surrounding it, then they would have died too.\n\"-278367!\"\n\"Gahg-\" the green aura in the second eye of the gargoyle flicked for a few seconds as well before completely vanishing, a trail of smoke leaving the body of the elite upward as it had quite literally been fried by the ball.\n[Gargoyle King: 0/650000]\nAnd so it fell, dead.\n~SWISH~\nAnd its body turned back to stone instantly, before shattering completely.\n\"Damn, that's overkill, not gonna lie,\" Stark laughed.\n[You have slain 'Gargoyle King lv140', gained 3,800,000EXP!]\nHe got slightly more EXP than by the [Darkness Ghost], probably since it was level 140, 10 levels above the other monster, and there was no denying that it was an elite, only one rank below boss.\nOf course, nothing until now could ever compete with the EXP he had gotten from the warden, but soon enough the monsters would finally be able to give him 5 million exp at once, catching up to it, though it will take time.\n[You have slain 'Gargoyle Minion lv135', gained 227462EXP!]\n[You have slain 'Gargoyle Minion lv135', gained 219381EXP!]\n[You have slain 'Gargoyle Minion lv135', gained 225448EXP!]\n~DING~\n[Your level has increased to level 66, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Experience: 2359515/2850000]\nAnd worse of all: he only got one level from that.\n\"…\" Stark sighed, but he was used to it, domination was truly an unforgiving class after all.\n~TAP, TAP~\nHe slowly headed back to the stone path, and specifically the stone fountain which now missed the gargoyle statue at the top, to continue walking toward the path leading to the boss/final zone.\nThe garden was now in chaos from the battle: MOST of the small gargoyle statues were destroyed, the grass was burned because of the holy aura, and because of the shadow claws, and some walls had cracks on them because of all the damage.\n\"Battles are intense, huh,\" this was actually the first time Stark noticed such a distinct change in the atmosphere after a battle, as for some reason he had never seen such a scenery before, \"Well, doesn't matter.\"\nHe walked around the fountain and continued heading toward the end of this garden as he was now the other half, no monsters coming out as they had quite literally ALL been killed.\nBut this was a good thing, since it allowed Stark to rest: he still only had 7500 HP from the fight, so trying to fight the apostle right now would be suicide.\nIn the distance, at the very end of the garden, there was a massive red door that opened, inviting him to enter.\nOnly ten minutes after that, he reached that very same door.\nBut instead of immediately going in… Stark went to the right side of the garden and rested against the wall.\nHis side still hurt a bit from the [Shadow Claws], but surrounding it with his aura massively decreased the pain and stopped the bleeding as well.\n\"Spatial Inventory,\" he mumbled, then pulled out THIRTY, yes you heard him right, THIRTY [Regeneration Potions], then gulped them all one by one, \"Good thing I always restock my potions, heh…\"\n[Potions Available: x73 strength, x66 speed and x47 regeneration]\nThe wound on his side slowly closed up afterward, and he didn't have to put his aura there as to stop him from dying of blood loss.\nThere were several ways to regenerate your health points: potions of healing, skills and finally… just resting.\nAs long as you didn't have the [Bleed] effect and weren't amputated or had a massive/fatal injury, then simply resting and sleeping would slowly give you HP, although that's the longest method of all, and the least used since, y'know, when you're in a rift, you can't really take the time to do that.\nAnd the other reason Stark could afford to do that without fearing just a single monster come to kill him while he was resting is because…\n\"Clone Frenzy,\" he lifted his arm upward, and three clones appeared in front of him, \"Superior Clone,\" he mumbled, and the clones suddenly began to merge in a flash of beautiful crimson light.\n30 seconds later after merging, what emerged from all that light and was, obviously, the [Superior Clone]!\nHe hadn't summoned it until now because he feared that it could get taken down in one strike, and giving it HP was a terrible idea, just check the fight against the gargoyle: he had been put to under 6000 health points, which would have killed him.\nAnd if a single debris flew toward the clone and hit it, then it would have died too.\n\"=)\" and of course, that little shit had its iconic demonic smile, which never left its face no matter what happened.\n\"You know what to do,\" Stark smiled at it, and it nodded as he closed his eyes, \"I guess you can wake me up in like… huh… two hours?\" he didn't want to stay for too long in here as there was the possibility of this rift's time going much slower than in the real world, meaning that while he thought a few hours passed, it would actually be weeks outside.\nThe next zone, beyond that red ominous door with a frightening aura coming from the other side, was probably the final boss of this rift: the apostle.\nAnd so Stark needed to prepare himself with everything he had, as it would surely be a hard battle (but not his hardest since, y'know, Exorcist).",

      "content": "~SHAKE~\nStark opened his eyes as he was being shaken by the [Superior Clone].\n\"Ah?!\" he actually got startled as the first thing he saw was a crimson light in his face, then the massive mischievous smile of the clone soon after, \"Fucking hell…\"\nIt had been around three hours since he had woken up, and thanks to his injury being healed with the potions, his HP was now fully maxed again.\n\"Thanks,\" he got up and looked around, it seemed like the [Superior Clone] hadn't fought anything, though he noticed that the last few statues that had been standing after the battle were now all destroyed, \"Got bored?\"\n\"=)\" the clone shrugged.\n\"Oh well,\" Stark didn't have anything to do, and so he went back on the path, followed closely by his close as they faced the giant red door before them.\nStark stood before the ominous red door, its surface pulsing like a heartbeat, shadows dancing along its edges, flickering with an energy that sent a shiver down his spine.\nHe glanced at his clone, whose crimson aura shimmered, ready for whatever lay ahead, that carefree smile on its face: as long as the original survived, then it was good.\n\"Here goes nothing,\" Stark muttered, stepping forward, and the clone walked right next to him.\n~FWISH~\nBut right as they passed the threshold of the door, a strange sensation washed over Stark.\n\"…!\" it was weird, unlike anything he had ever felt before in a rift.\nThere was no silver fog this time, which actually quite strange, but Stark felt it in his bones that this was it… and soon enough, a panel appeared.\n[Last Zone: Reaper's and Lother's Grave]\nThe sensation Stark felt while walking past the door was something even he didn't know how to describe, though it strangely still felt familiar to him.\nDread? Fear? Anxiety?\nNo… it was none of these, Stark wouldn't be scared from that, he hadn't been even in the face of death several times after all.\n\":l\" and to prove his point, even his clone had stopped smiling.\nThe fourth zone was… special.\nAnd as he looked around, Stark noticed that he had stepped into an arena, its vastness swallowing him whole.\nThe ground beneath his feet felt cold, with a smooth stone surface and black mist reaching only up to his feet.\nSurrounding him were towering walls engraved with ancient runes and weird drawings depicting something Stark couldn't understand, each flickering with a deep glow.\nAnd even then, even with that setup and appearance, this wasn't what surprised Stark the most.\nBecause as soon as he looked up…\n\"What…\"\nAbove the circular walls that delimited the zone of the giant arena were thousands upon thousands of undead spectators looking down at him.\nTheir forms varied: skeletal warriors clad in tattered remnants of armor, rotting corpses wearing decaying robes, spectral figures, gargoyles, ghosts… and many more.\nIt was… a spectacle, and surely nobody would believe Stark if he told them what he saw at the end of the [Death Rift], not that he cared to anyway though.\n\"What the fuck…\" Stark's eyes widened.\nSome of the undead brandished rusty weapons, clattering them against one another in a frenzied rhythm, while others raised their hands in the air and clapped, while the rest just pointed their fingers toward Stark as if asking him to head toward the center of the arena.\nBut right as he was about to walk deeper inside the arena, since he had only stopped at the very edge of the entrance to observe his surroundings…\n~CLANG~\nHe heard a sudden noise, and the giant red door that was previously opened right behind him a few seconds ago closed out of nowhere, trapping him inside here.\n\"=)\" but the clone went back to smiling, which reassured Stark: it meant that it was still confident in their victory.\nStark wasn't particularly impressed except for the massive amount of undead seemingly \"spectating\" his moves, as he was worried that they would all jump down at once toward him, and there was no guarantee [Crimson Purification] would save his ass this time with this many undead.\n~TAP, TAP~\nNot seeing a reason to stop, Stark continued to walk toward the center of the arena, and the closer he got to it, the more the cheers of the undead crowd escalated.\nStark pressed forward, the sound of clattering bones and rusted metal filled the air around him, echoing like a taunting song.\nAnd the arena pulsed with a dark energy, the spectators leaning closer, their hollow eyes fixed on him, hungry for the show that was about to occur.\n\"Why the hell are you all cheering?\" he muttered, glancing around.\nAnd at that moment… he finally reached the center of the arena, where a giant incantation circle made with blood could be seen.\n\"Huh-\" it didn't take more than five seconds since he stepped inside the circle for it to suddenly begin glowing with a dark light, \"SHIT!\"\n~FWISH, THROW~\nA vortex of darkness was forming around the circle, and it was surely going to suck Stark in if he didn't escape.\nBut thankfully enough, his clone had stayed behind, and immediately grabbed the boy out of the range.\n\"Thanks,\" the clone was thankfully still alive, and Stark got up, taking dozens of steps back since the vortex in the middle of the arena grew more and more.\nAnd then, after a minute…\n~THUD~\nThe ground trembled slightly, and a hush fell over the undead as a figure emerged from the shadows at the center of the arena.\n\"…!\" Stark's eyes widened even more than before.\nAnd that's when he finally understood the emotion that had washed over him before: it was… the feeling of knowing that death was close, which is why it felt familiar to him.\n[Reaper, The Undead Puppeteer (Godless Demon Apostle)]\nThe figure was giant, at least ten meters in height, and it was wearing a dark long robe that flowed downward.\nIt seemed to be floating in the air though, as it had no feet, and the robe stopped right before the ground, meaning you could clearly see there was nothing there.\nIt was wearing a dark cloak on top of its head, but even then, you could still see its face: it had a skeleton face, emotionless and hollow, only a small white dot in its eyes showing that it was alive.\nAnd as for its weapon… as you might have guessed… it was carrying a scythe with its two skeletal hands.\n\"GAKKRKAK!\"\n\"KSKSKSKS~\"\nThe sheers of the undead crowd reached their peak as Reaper appeared, and the skeleton apostle actually seemed to enjoy the praises as he lifted one of his arms upward and nodded his head while looking at all his \"fans\".\nBut after that quick break, he immediately went back to serious mode, pointing his scythe toward the human, and a voice coming out of its skull.\n\"Let the fight begin, human, and do not disappoint them, for if you do, a fate worse than death awaits you,\" Reaper obviously couldn't change expressions since, y'know, his head was a skull, but Stark felt that in his voice was a mix of both calmness, confidence and… anger.",

      "content": "[Welcome to the 'Undead Arena']\n[Fight your opponents to escape!]\nThese two panels appeared in front of Stark right as Reaper pointed his scythe toward the human.\n\"Are you ready?\" the skeleton grim reaper spoke again, a powerful dark aura swirling around his entire body and weapon, making Stark gulp.\n\"Sure, why not,\" Stark kept smiling though: he had his anti-undead skills, so nothing to fear on a 1 on 1, and he would make sure to deliver a beautiful spectacle for those watching.\n\"=)\" but right as he took his fighting stance, ready to start… his clone tapped on his shoulder a few times.\n\"…?\" Stark looked back to see the [Superior Clone] smiling.\n\"Very well,\" Reaper's skull mouth couldn't move, but it was clear that he was smiling, \"Let ALL the fighters battle, then!\" Reaper said while Stark was busy looking at his clone.\n\"…\" the [Superior Clone] was trying to tell something to the boy.\nIt was pointing at the arena, then making massive circles with its hands: it couldn't speak, so it quite literally had to play a guessing game with Stark.\n\"The… zone…?\" he guessed after a few seconds, and the clone nodded extremely quickly.\nThen it moved to another sign.\nIt pointed at the ground, then it made a simple panel appeared in front of it.\n[Reaper, The Undead Puppeteer] this was what was written on the panel as it was the only one the clone could open since it was minimized.\nThen the clone repeated that maneuver several times, its smiling expression almost begging for Stark to understand.\n\"This zone…?\" Stark mumbled as the clone pointed at the ground, \"This zone's panel?\" he asked as the clone made the panel appear again.\nAnd suddenly…\n\"!!!!\" the clone jumped in agreement.\n'This zone's panel…?' Stark repeated, and he immediately opened up that panel again (for some reason the clone couldn't do it though).\nStark quickly glanced at Reaper, and he was actually holding his scythe horizontally with his two handles at the edge of its handle, his eyes closed, though you could only see that because, y'know, the small white dots in them had disappeared.\n~TAP, TAP~\nHe was repeatedly taping his scythe's wooden handle on the ground too, doing some sort of… ritual? Or something strange, as it was glowing with dark aura.\n'Well, doesn't matter as long as he leaves me alone for now,' Stark went back to focus on his clone, 'Anyway, so this zone's panel…'\nStark tried to open it, but he had actually closed it, probably why the clone couldn't open it at all.\n\"Third Zone panel!\" he mumbled to himself, and it reappeared again.\n[Last Zone: Reaper's and Lother's Grave]\n\"=)\" immediately, the clone pointed… at the second name.\n\"Huh…\" and just as quickly as it did, Stark's eyes widened.\nIn retrospective, this shouldn't be confusing as it is just a normal name, but when you think about it, if Reaper was the 'undead puppeteer' in front of him, the apostle he needed to kill to fill his [ApostleDex].\nThen… who the fuck is 'Lother'?\nAnd that's when Stark suddenly remembered something: right as he was about to open the cabin door, he ignored the third panel that had appeared before him, only reading the first few words.\nAnd they were…\n[There isn't just one apostle-] there was another bigger part to the sentence that he had skipped, but now…\n\"Oh… shit…\" Stark figured it out.\nAnd as soon as that happened.\n\"Give them a show they won't forget,\" Reaper lifted his scythe all the way up to his head, then taped it against the ground one last time, an extremely powerful aura coming out of it, like dark flames taking over.\nAnd suddenly…\nFwish!\n'That noise…' it came from right below Stark.\n\"I summon thee, 'Lother, The Grave Keeper', come and aid me to prevent this human from reaching our lord,\" Reaper pointed his scythe toward Stark again, its pointy edges burning now.\nAnd then...\nBoom! Fwish! Slam!\nThe ground shook violently, and the air crackled with energy.\nStark braced himself, his heart pounding as the ground rumbled beneath him.\nAnd suddenly…\nBoom!\nFour long white hands burst from the earth, each one massive and menacing, fingers curling like claws poised to strike.\n\"Holy hell!\" Stark shouted, adrenaline flooding his veins, and even the clone got ready.\nThe four hands were surrounding him completely from all directions: nord, east, south and west, meaning that they could easily reach him if he wasn't careful.\n\"=)\" the clone was also surrounded since it was right next to Stark, but it didn't look bothered that much.\nAnd then…\n\"Do not die too quickly,\" Reaper let out a trail of dark smoke leaving his skull mouth.\n~SLAM~\nThe hands slammed down toward him, each blow sending a shockwave that rattled the air.\nStark reacted instinctively, the familiar rush of power coursing through him as he activated [Invincible Dodge].\nIn a split second, he sidestepped, a blur of motion, narrowly avoiding the first hand, and the impact cratered the ground, dust and debris flying into the air.\n\"Not today!\" he yelled, pushing himself off the ground to evade a strike from the second hand.\nHe weaved through the onslaught, his movements precise and fluid, each hand crashing down where he had stood mere moments before, leaving jagged cracks in the arena floor.\nThe crowd of undead gasped, their hollow eyes wide with anticipation.\n\"Come on, Lother! Is that all you've got?\" Stark taunted, he was sure that this thing was the second apostle.\nAfter around a minute where the giant white hands repeatedly tried to slam both Stark and his clone… they all went back into the ground.\nAnd mere seconds later…\nFwish!\nLother's massive form began to emerge from the ground next to Reaper, rising to a towering height of eight meters, the giant humanoid figure had four arms, each as powerful as a train, ready to unleash fury, and a gaping mouth with what could only be described as a black hole in it.\n[Lother, The Grave Keeper - Apostle]\nIts body was COMPLETELY white except for the occasional wrinkles then and there, and it was bald, with no nose, no ears, and completely black eyes with no pupils.\nAs said before, Lother had FOUR arms (two where they normally should be, and another two coming out from his shoulders), and it was currently standing on its two legs, meaning that it could use them all to attack, making it EXTREMELY difficult to avoid it all.\nBut it did have a second form though, and not talking about when its HP depletes: Lother could use his two front arms, meaning the normal ones, to get on all fours like a dog, making him much more menacing as his face and mouth that stretched downward were actually terrifying.\n\"Oh~\" Reaper laughed, \"One of the first who actually managed to avoid it all, you might actually be able to give us a good show, then…\"\nThe \"white hands\" ambush was actually way faster than you might believe it to be, only taking a split second between the time they emerged and hit the ground where the human stood.\nAnd so, that meant that A LOT of people had died before the fight could even begin, and even Stark only reacted accordingly because he noticed that there should have been TWO monsters, not just Reaper.\n\"…\" the second apostle, Lother, couldn't speak, as his mouth was literally dislocated (or just weird, one of the two), and so only Reaper was capable of speech.\n\"Your friend's weird,\" Stark shrugged as he pointed at the white creature straight out of a monster foundation or something.\n\"He can't speak, hear or breath, and his vision is extremely reduced, to the point he can only attack people based on their vibrations and aura,\" Reaper informed while inspecting his scythe, \"And yet…\" the small white dots in Reaper's eyes grew in size, \"He is still stronger than you are.\"\n\"Hhahaha~\" Stark laughed, \"I'd love to see that.\"\n\"You will.\"\n[3…]\nThe countdown of the battle began, and all the undead spectators were cheering.\n[2…]\nReaper's aura and his body were now surrounded by dark flames of death.\n[1…]\nLother was just normal, though Stark noticed that the weird smile on his stretched mouth grew as he kept taping the ground with his arms, ready to dash at the human.\n[FIGHT!]\nBut Stark and his clone were ready too, activating both of their auras as they knew that this was going to be their hardest battle yet.\nThey were undead, sure (at least Reaper was, not sure about Lother), but they were still apostles, and the strongest ones he had fought yet (the three crimson moons are stronger, but he didn't battle them).\nBut before Stark could even begin to activate [Perception] to check out his opponent's stats, HP, and skills…\nA panel appeared in front of him: it was given by the [Undead Arena] itself.\nAnd on it was information that he feared would be true ever since he fought the [Darkness Ghost] in the second zone.\nAnd it was…\n[Lother, The Grave Keeper]\n[Rank: Boss]\nAnd… the most powerful of the two…\n[Reaper, The Undead Puppeteer]\n[Rank: Calamity]\nHe was at the rank above [Boss].",

Throw!\nAnd before Stark could even realize it, a golden ball of energy was thrown from behind him, toward Lother.\n\"Huh…\" he looked back, and saw the [Superior Clone] smiling, it had used [Crimson Purification]'s new perk while he was busy analyzing.\nAnd…\nBoooom!\nThe attack actually hit Lother, who was too dumb and thought that he could tank it.\n\"-176482!\"\n\"Holy,\" Stark was flabbergasted, \"Amazing job, clone!\" he praised it, and it just shrugged.\n\"…\" Lother was sent flying toward one of the walls of the massive arena, which gave them more than enough space to fight freely, crashing against the wall and causing dozens of undead monsters to fall inside of it, all crushed since the height from the stands to the ground was high.\nBut… was Lother did when he saw those undead fall was… surprising.\n\"Undead Sacrifice…\" the grotesque wide-mouthed creatures grabbed the bodies of all the undead with its four hands, crushing them using its sheer strength, then swallowed all the dust and remains with its mouth.\nStark watched as Lother consumed the remains of the fallen undead. A dark mist enveloped the giant, swirling around him as he fed, tendrils of shadow stretching from the remains into Lother's gaping maw.\n…\n[Skill: Undead Sacrifice]\n[Description:] Lother consumes fallen undead to gain strength. For each undead he devours, he absorbs a fraction of their power, boosting his own physical abilities. However, there's a limit. If Lother consumes too many at once, he risks overwhelming his own body, leading to a temporary (and long) stun.\n[Note: take advantage of that, Lother cannot resist the temptation of eating other undead =)]\n…\nThat note was basically telling him to allow Lother to eat a maximum amount of undead and trying to make him reach his limit.\nBut there was a problem with that: what was the limit?\n10? 100? What if it's 1000?\n'Not clear, no point in risking it,' and so that was the conclusion he reached.\nBut his clone, on the other hand… it seemed to think differently.\n\"Aura Smash… MERGE!\"\nFwish!\nReaper was currently just observing the fight, using his scythe as some sort of cane by placing its handle in the ground, \"Hm.\"\nBoom!\nThe crimson fist hit Lother's mouth as it was literally unable to avoid it since it was too fast, way faster than the holy energy ball, obviously.\nCrack!\nLother's head literally cracked upon the impact with the fist, and it actually moved a bit as its mouth stretched more.\n\"-76482!\" plus, the damage was very good.\nBut of course, it resulted in Lother's body crashing against the wall, and MORE undead falling, at least 50 of them this time, and the worst of all was that the ones who fell were actually cheering, anticipating being eaten by one of their 'gods'.\n\"Undead Sacrifice…\" Lother ate them all again, and the dark aura swirling around him increased again: this time, both Stark and his clone sensed that surprise attacks wouldn't work anymore, its mouth letting out a deadly black fog of aura.\n\"…\" yet Stark and the [Superior Clone] weren't impressed: that thing literally just took 250k points of damage in less than ten seconds, so why should they care if it started eating its 'servants'.\nBut suddenly, right as if Reaper could read their mocking thoughts, he suddenly moved, removing his scythe's handle from the ground and grabbing it again, swinging it a few times to make sure it was working as a trail of black aura with soul particles followed each of the strikes.\n\"I think I saw enough,\" he began walking toward Stark, \"I give you a 3/10 in the entertainment scale, could do better, I hope you will and your next life.\"\n\"Heh, that's pretty low,\" Stark responded, a smile as devilish as his clone's forming, \"Maybe I can make that number go up by kicking your ass?\"\n\"You are free to try,\" Reaper spanned his scythe in his hands, showing that he had perfect control over it.\nLother on the other hand got up on his two feet, increasing his size and now slightly taller than Reaper: he was a giant, and a grotesque one at that.\n\"Hey, clone,\" Stark looked at the crimson replica of himself.\n\"…\"\n\"You take care of the white guy, I'll get Reaper, and please don't die,\" Stark gave it a thumbs up as he gave it such an insane order, but it was proof that he trusted his clone.\n\"…\" the [Superior Clone] nodded, still smiling.\nAnd so both of them took their fighting stances.\nReaper and Lother were the same, though, as the calamity apostle slowly walked toward the original Stark, while Lother took huge steps in the clone's direction.",

      "content": "Lother, the grotesque white giant who was standing up on his two feet, looking down at the two Stark with his impressive 12 meters height, suddenly jumped toward the clone, and used its skill.\n\"Grave Grasp,\" his four arms all elongated toward the clone, trying to grab and crush it.\nBut…\n\"Invincible Dodge,\" it immediately rolled away every time the hands tried to grab it, sent five crimson spears toward Lother, all hitting him.\n\"-12732! -13821! -14985! -14334! -13948!\" the clone seemed to be doing good damage, so Stark immediately stopped looking and worrying about it, instead focusing on his own battle: the one against Reaper.\nTo be honest, there was no way for Stark to defeat these two things in a 2v1, so he was happy that the clone actually able to help, otherwise he would have been fucked.\nNow… one of them needed to kill their opponent, then overwhelm the second and kill it too.\nBut Reaper… seemed unbeatable.\n\"SCULK NECKLACE, ACTIVATE!\" he decided to finally use the necklace he had acquired, the sculk liquid that emerged from it slashing in Reaper's direction thrice, yet it did nothing as the apostle just moved his hands, making the sculk look like it was pure weak slime.\nHe was slowly walking toward Stark, unbothered by the sculk and the fact his ally was already fighting, the dark aura in the eye sockets of the skull glowing.\n\"Scythe Dance,\" he began to slowly pull his scythe back, as if he is charging a powerful attack, and he probably was, to be honest, \"Let's see you avoid this.\"\n~SWING~\nStark barely had time to react.\nReaper spun, a blur of motion that broke the line between the physical and the ethereal, and dark blades sliced through the air, a whirlwind of death surrounding Stark.\nHe felt the rush of wind as each sweep cut toward him, leaving no room for escape.\n\"Invincible Dodge!\" Stark ducked low, rolling to the side, barely evading the first wave, the air crackled with the energy of the attack, and he could hear the shriek of the blades as they cut through the space where he had just stood.\nReaper's movements were fluid and uncounterable, but Stark couldn't let himself be mesmerized; he focused on the rhythm, anticipating the next strike.\nThe ground trembled as the scythe cleaved through the arena floor, sending splintered debris flying, Stark leaped backward, narrowly dodging another barrage.\n\"You're faster than you look,\" he called out, forcing confidence into his voice.\nReaper merely chuckled, the sound low and chilling. \"You have no idea.\"\n\"CRIMSON SPEARS,\" he summoned his five spears, then sent them all in different directions toward his opponent.\n\"…\" but even though Reaper had no 'shield' or 'defensive' skill, he quite literally just swung his scythe five times extremely fast, deflecting the five spears with it, \"Alright, projectiles won't work…\"\n\"AURA SMASH!\" but he immediately used another skill while Reaper closed in the distance again, summoning three crimson fists as he didn't have the time to merge them.\nBut he didn't actually send them toward Reaper, not at all, instead… he sent them at Lother, who was busy fighting the clone, clearly overwhelming it but not having enough speed to touch it with its hands or skills such as [Grave Grasp], [Burial Mound] or [Bone Barrage].\n~BOOM, BOOM, BOOM~\n\"-33271! -34998! -31576!\"\n\"…\" Lother at this point was getting absolutely demolished, and it was almost pitiful how easily overwhelmed it was simply because its weakness was projectiles.\n[Lother HP: 177371/600000]\nStark was too busy fighting Reaper to check out the damage he had done, so he left the rest up to his clone, and he would try to occasionally help it.\n~SLAM~\nLother hit the wall again, then ate the 150 undead that fell from above using [Undead Sacrifice], growing stronger.\nAnd so now…\n\"Crimson Spears,\" the clone calmly sent another spear toward the white titan, expecting it to be hit again.\nAnd yet…\nFwish!\nAlmost as if teleporting, it actually avoided the projectiles, having reached the halfway point of its [Undead Sacrifice], meaning that it had gained a significant boost not only in speed, but also attack and defense.\n\"ECHOING WAIL, CURSED AURA\" it stretched its mouth wider, almost reaching the floor at the point, frankly disgusting, then activated two of its 'passive skills'.\nFirst, [Echoing Wail] was kind of weird, since from the massive stretched mouth of the monster came a very… weird sound, it sounded sad, and after a few seconds it could definitely be identified as crying.\n[The necrotic energy hit you… but it failed since the 'confusion' effect doesn't affect a clone or someone with the 'Domination' class.]\nYet it did nothing.\nAnd as for the second skill…\nFwish!\nRemember that black aura fog that came out from Lother's mouth constantly? Well this was the [Cursed Aura], it was a skill it was using constantly for a while before activating it as it was a [Condition] skill, as you might have guessed.\nAnd so… Lother opened his mouth as much as possible, and… let out an exceptional amount of [Cursed Aura] out of it, engulfing the entire arena, and even reaching the stands where all the spectators were.\n…\n[Skill: Cursed Aura (LEGENDARY)]\n[Skill: A dark mist envelops the area around Lother, increasing his own defense and weakening nearby enemies (and even allies).]\n…\n[Your defense has been reduced!]\nSuch a message appeared in front of Stark, but he didn't mind it because… it also meant that Reaper's defense was decreased.\n\"…\" and more surprising of all, Reaper was actually eyeing Lother with a gaze full of hate and disgust, \"This fool doesn't learn, does he,\" he mumbled before facing Stark again, \"Let us end this, human, I have things to take care of.\"\nAnd so, the [Scythe Dance] resumed, though before he continued, Reaper used another one of his skills: [Phantom Veil].\nA shroud of darkness enveloped Reaper, the mist swirling around him like a living thing, and he vanished into the shadows.\n'Huh? Did he teleport…?' was what Stark wanted to wonder for around two seconds, until he eventually realized that the glimmering edge of the scythe was still visible, meaning that he had quite literally just become invisible, though his scythe couldn't do that.\nStark squinted, straining to pinpoint Reaper's location amidst the swirling chaos of the battle between the [Superior Clone] and Lother, which seemed to gradually become more and more difficult for the clone since every time Lother would use a skill and miss, it would hit one of the stands, and Lother would immediately eat the undead to become stronger.\n\"Come on, you coward!\" Stark taunted Reaper, forcing himself to stay calm, anticipating the strike he knew would come, but the scythe remained, glinting ominously in the darkness of the area filled with cursed aura, which also made it a bit harder to see.\nAnd the funny thing is that two of them actually stood still for actual minutes: Reaper waiting for the opportunity to strike, and Stark expecting an attack to avoid it, and so in the meantime, both decided to observe the fight between Lother and the clone, which had only reached its middle point.\n\"Crimson Spears, Aura Smash,\" the clone would calmly send projectiles whenever it could, yet Lother would avoid them all, the white titan feeling more confident as its mouth contorted into a terrifying grin.\nOf course, Stark had his [Crimson Purification], but using it right now with the constant threat of Reaper killing him wasn't a good idea, plus what if he needed it later?\nBut right as Lother devoured another row of undead…\nThe monster finally decided to use its second most powerful skill.\n\"SHOVEL WIELDER!\"\n***\nGreat job!

The ground shook under the struggle, gravel and dirt flying in every direction.\nAfter around twenty seconds, finally, with a triumphant cry that reverberated off the walls, Lother pulled upward, arms straining as it revealed two gleaming shovels, one in each hand.\nAnd right afterward, not even mere seconds after he successfully activated the skill… the apostles attacked.\nWith a guttural cry, created from the deepest depths of the creature's soul, Lother dashed toward the clone and swung the shovels overhead, the metal cutting through the air with a wicked whistle.\nThe shovels descended, shadows casting over the clone and the arena.\n~SWING, BAM~\nBut the [Superior Clone], still smiling, just its used two last strikes from [Wielding Cross] to deflect the two shovels swings.\n\"Tremor of the Damned!\" Lother got up on his two feet, though still carrying the two shovels with the hands on his shoulders instead of the normal ones.\nAnd then… he jumped in the air and stomped the ground with his two feet.\n~FWISH, BING~\nThis created a massive shockwave that hit the [Superior Clone] as it was mostly impossible to avoid without [Invincible Dodge], and it had failed its timing since the shockwave was pretty damn long.\n~BOING~\nThe [Superior Clone] didn't receive any sort of damage though, it was just sent flying upward, precisely right in front of Lother's torso.\n\"…!\" it was literally at the perfect position to be hit, with no way to avoid it normally.\nIt was Lother's goal: send the enemy flying using the shockwave, then while they can't do anything, slam them with both shovels.\nLother's shovels descended with a thunderous whoosh, slicing through the air, a deadly arc aimed straight at the clone.\n\"SHIT!\" Stark's heart raced as he watched, certain the clone would be crushed beneath the weight of the monstrous attack, and if it died… then it would become a 2V1 with his chances of winning plummeting all the way to zero, essentially more when he was struggling to even KEEP UP with Reaper.\nBut just as the blades neared their target, the clone's aura flared bright, the devilish smile growing more, its confidence not faltering for a single second.\n\"Dodge Control!\"\nIn an instant, the clone's body shifted, bending and twisting with an almost unnatural fluidity: it ducked and rolled, then slipped beneath the shovels with a grace that seemed to defy physics.\nThe blades cleaved the air where it had been just a heartbeat before, the ground quaking as they struck nothing but each other, the force Lother put into the blow just to be avoided making him tremble a bit as the impact of the shovels against one another shook him.\nLother stumbled, his momentum carrying him forward.\nBut with a swift motion, the clone propelled itself backward, launching off the blade of one of the shovels, using the moment to spring away from danger.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" while still in midair, the crimson copy summoned three crimson fists right behind it, then without a second of hesitation sent them toward Lother's face, who still struggled to regain his balance.\nBut the funniest thing of all wasn't that Lother was struggling and still being shaken by the impact, or that it was getting overwhelmed by a simple clone.\nIt was… that the fists the [Superior Clone] had thrown were aimed at Lother's mouth, meaning that they entered through the stretched grin it had, now transformed into one of shock as it SWALLOWED THEM.\nBut of course, swallowing didn't mean they didn't hit.\nAnd so…\n~BOOM, BOOM, BOOM~\n\"-33821! -34338! -34186!\"\n[Lother HP: 15026/600000]\nThe crimson fists exploded while they were in Lother's throat, and it was actually another one of his weaknesses: the abyss that was his stretched was extremely sensitive, and anything that went inside would deal much higher damage to the white giant.\n\"…\" the explosion inside Lother almost made him lose consciousness, and the fact he was already struggling to keep his balance on his two feet didn't help as he suddenly fell backward, crashing into one of the massive stands with thousands of undead on them.\nThe arena shuddered under the impact, a cascade of undead tumbling from the seats above as the shockwave reverberated through the air.\nLother let out a guttural cry, its grotesque form crashing vertically, shovels clattering beside it.\nAnd yet…\n\"UNDEAD SACRIFICE!\"\nThe first thing Lother did as he caused such havoc was to move all four of his hands to begin devouring everything in his way.\n\"UNDEAD SACRIFICE!!!\" he was eating, and eating, and eating, eating everything that he could grasp or see, all the undead that fell, those that were crushed, and even some that were still cheering.\nThe more Lother ate, the stronger he became: better speed, greater strength, impenetrable body and defense.\nLother was actually mad he had been ALMOST defeated by such a small thing.\n\"UNDEAD SACRIFICE!!!!!!\"\n~CRUSH, NOM~\nHe crushed the bodies of dozens, hundreds, then quickly thousands of undead before eating them.\nQuickly, he became stronger than Reaper, even the calamity apostle surprised to see that his 'companion' could be pushed so far.\n\"Futile,\" but even then, Reaper didn't seem to care much.\n\"UNDEAD… SACRIFICE!!!!!\" Lother was in an absolute frenzy, and no one was safe from his gaping mouth as it absorbed everything.\nThis kept going for three minutes, with all three other participants: the clone, Stark and Reaper, just staring at Lother as it kept eating.\nBut right as the giant titan got up again, feeling as powerful as before, and ready to smash his way to victory, both Stark(s) unable to avoid his attacks or even hope of dealing damage to it…\nThe expected happened: Lother tried to move as he put ONE last undead in his mouth and…\n[You have maxed out your powers for a while now, the body isn't able to keep up]\n['Stun' has been given to Lother, The Grave Keeper]\nAnd so… the white titan stood still, unable to move as his body fidgeted, and even though he could see all those insects below him, he wasn't able to crush them in any way.\n~FWISH~\nQuickly, the [Superior Clone] drew a circle in its hand, then pointed at the dark sky above the arena, \"Heaven's Wrath.\"\nAnd so less than five seconds later, the beam charged up and…\n~BOOOOOOOM~\nIt not only destroyed Lother completely, slowly erasing his body from existence as he couldn't even move or scream, but a major chunk of the arena was taken by the blast, thousands upon thousands of undead killed.\n[You can't get EXP from those monsters.]\n\"…\"\nAnd with that…\n[Lother, The Grave Keeper has been defeated!]\n[One apostle remains!]\n\"Hm~\" Reaper was still invisible, and so both Stark and the clone stared back at the floating scythe now that one of the threats was gone, \"I mean, you destroyed half the audience, but the other half seems happy… so…\" the scythe began to spin in the air, almost as if controlled by nothing, \"I guess we can entertain them so more…\"\n\"Hey, seems like you upgraded my rating,\" Stark smiled back, and the clone took a few steps toward the calamity-level apostle as well.\n\"I was planning to kill him after that anyway,\" he responded, speaking of Lother, \"Thanks for doing the hard work.\"\nAnd so, the three figures faced one another, although one was invisible and spinning its sigh repeatedly, a dark aura coming of its edges.\n2V2 turned into a 2V1, giving Stark a good advantage in comparison to before.\nBut even then… could they defeat Reaper?\nHe was the first calamity-level monsters fought, so he could definitely have many tricks up his sleeve, as seen by his blatant confidence even though the human had eliminated the other apostle.\n\"I have eliminated five of you now, you won't be different from the rest,\" Stark pointed, an enraged expression on his face as his pupils glowed with crimson aura.\n\"Very well, let the game begin then.\"\nAnd so, the final battle began, and Reaper was stronger than Warden, there was no denying it.",

An opponent he couldn't see yet could see and attack him whenever it wanted…?\nDoes he even have a chance?\nAnd the answer to this question… nobody knew it.\n\"I can't see him…\" Stark slowed down time using [Focus]'s perk [Time Vision] for three seconds, allowing him to think as he saw the rift slowly close, Reaper's body still slightly visible as the dark cloak around him gradually disappeared, returning into his dimension, \"I can't see him… but… I think…\"\nStark's eyes widened as he realized something after using [Time Vision].\nTime Vision was one of the perks of [Focus], and what other perk did he have with this skill?\nWell…\n[Description: You can place a target on an opponent, thus allowing you to observe their movements better and have your crimson 'eyes' always following them, no matter what they do]\nHe had [Target Set].\nHe had never done it before, but there was nothing else he could do: it was this, or awaiting his inevitable death, his clone unable to do anything as well.\n'We'll see about that,' he had an enraged expression on his face as his eyes burning with a crimson fire.\n~FWISH~\nHe positioned his right arm like a gun, as if aiming with it, then pointed toward the small remaining visible parts of Reaper.\nAnd then…\n\"FOCUS… TARGET SET!\" he shot, and a small little tracker was sent toward Reaper at intense speed.\n[Time Vision] deactivated, and so the rift Reaper appeared from closed as well.\nNow Stark couldn't see him anymore, he was doomed.\nAnd yet…\n~DING~\n[Reaper has been set as a target!]\n~BLINK, BLINK, BLINK~\nAnd now… in Stark's vision… he could now see the calamity apostle: he was glowing with a bright crimson aura that constantly flickered, displaying his position to Stark.\nStark IMMEDIATELY looked at his clone, and its eyes were also glowing with the same deep color, meaning that it could see the apostle too now that he was hit by the tracker.\nBut now what?\nWhat should Stark do?\nCurrently, Reaper was constantly turning around Stark, probably wanting to scare him as he could attack whenever he wanted, and from wherever position he felt like.\nReaper didn't know that Stark could actually see him though, and the boy made EXTREMELY sure to keep acting like normal: which meant looking around with a terrified face and moving in many directions as if trying to dodge invisible attacks.\nStark couldn't be arrogant and just shout that he could see him, or immediately attempt to attack the apostle, no, this would be stupid, and dealing only 100000 points of damage is useless.\nHe had a GOLDEN opportunity to deal as much damage as he wanted if he got the timing right, and letting it pass would be suicide.\nStark's heart thundered in his chest as he feigned panic, glancing wildly around the arena. He sensed Reaper's presence flickering just out of sight, a predator stalking its prey.\nEach breath came heavy, but he steadied himself, focusing on the faint crimson glow marking Reaper's position.\n\"Where are you, you bastard?\" he shouted, his acting perfect.\nHis clone, though, just stood still as it was ignored by Reaper, as the apostle knew that killing the original would also kill the copy.\nWith a quick glance at the tracker, Stark zeroed in on Reaper's position. The figure circled closer, and Stark held his breath, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.\nThen he felt it—a slight shift in the air, a chill that whispered of danger.\nThe air grew thick with tension as Stark's pulse quickened. He sensed Reaper's presence inching closer, the flickering crimson glow barely illuminating the darkened arena.\n\"Enough of this charade,\" Reaper's voice slithered through the shadows.\n\"DEATH'S GRASP,\" with a simple wave of his hand, skeletal hands erupted from the ground, their bony fingers curling around Stark's legs, latching on like a vice.\nStark was actually taken by surprise, though his determination didn't falter, \"Get off me!\"\nBut the hands tightened, drawing him down.\nAnd as to make sure the human couldn't survive this… Reaper added another skill to finish all of it.\n\"SHADOW BIND,\" Reaper flicked his wrist, and tendrils of darkness erupted from the ground as well, wrapping around Stark's chest and stomach. The shadowy tendrils constricted, squeezing the breath from his lungs, though not enough to suffocate him as Stark resisted.\nEach pulse of the tendrils sapped his energy, tugging at his very life force and he could still feel the cold fingers of touching him below.\n\"-50! -50! -50!\" being bound by [Shadow Bind] also took some of his HP every second, and it seemed as though this was what Reaper awaited: he wanted to slowly kill Stark, especially now that he was in this state.\nBut… the human wouldn't go down like this.\n\"DODGE CONTROL,\" Stark wanted to activate his skill as it always aided him in such situations, even just a few hours ago against the [Darkness Ghost], and it also helped his clone against Lother mere minutes ago.\nStark felt the familiar sensation of his skill activating, and he fully expected to be instantly teleported away, then use the next opportunity to attack Reaper and deal the most amount of damage possible, maybe so much so that he could end the strike with that simple assault.\nAnd yet… all of Stark's plans were all crushed.\nThe reason?\nWell…\n\"Huh?\" the tendrils that had wrapped around Stark began to glow, and the feeling of power that was deep within him completely disappeared.\n\"Foolish human, just abandon, and let me see you die slowly, do cry, I enjoy seeing your struggles,\" Reaper couldn't smile, but deep inside, he definitely was.\nAnd before Stark… a panel appeared.\n~DING~\n['Dodge Control' has been absorbed by 'Shadow Bind', the skill was used, yet it didn't work, meaning that it was put back on cooldown!]\n\"Oh.\"\nStark was done for.",

Stark's heart raced as he felt the tendrils constricting him tighten further, but he focused on the moment, on the energy thrumming within him.\nAnd so… just as he was about to die from the suffocation and damage he had been dealt with…\nHe snapped his fingers.\nIn an instant, he teleported, appearing directly in front of Reaper's face as that was where the crimson ball was.\nThe darkness seemed to shudder as Stark materialized, the crimson ball hovering like a star at the peak of its arc.\n\"Time's up,\" he growled, unleashing the surge of power coursing through him, \"Staring directly at Reaper, who didn't even have the time to react because of how fast the human was.\"\n\"You…\" but even then, his eyes widened, the small dot in his eyes becoming almost invisible, not expecting for a human to be able to see him, \"Shit,\" and he knew that this was bad.\nStark, not wasting a single second of that precious opportunity he had created for himself after acting as if he couldn't see Reaper, and also taking all that damage from that mythical skill, immediately decided to attack.\n\"DOUBLE ASSAULT,\" his aura exploded outward as soon as he activated the legendary skill, doubling in intensity, radiating with a fierce light.\nReaper's hollow eyes widened even more for a fraction of a second as he noticed Stark's growing aura, surprise mingling with the darkness, and Stark's grin widened.\nThis was his moment.\n\"Say goodbye!\" he shouted, channeling all of his strength into his next assault.\nOf course, Stark could definitely try to punch Reaper repeatedly, but not only was it ineffective, it also didn't guarantee that the damage output would be high, and what if the calamity apostle can still use a defensive skill?\nNo… Stark needed something better.\nAnd so…\n\"WIELDING CROSS,\" he summoned the giant crimson cross with its strands of golden/holy aura, raising it above his head.\n[3 Cross Strikes Available!]\nThe air thickened with tension as the cross shimmered, its edges crackling with energy.\n\"Let's see how you handle this!\" he shouted, determination surging within him.\nAnd so…\n~FWISH~\nStark IMMEDIATELY swung the cross in Reaper's direction like a baseball bat, using his ENTIRE strength for that.\nIt was all or nothing now, either these next attacks succeed, or it was over.\nStark swung the crimson cross with all his might, a blur of red and gold that arced through the air. It collided with Reaper's skull face, a sickening thud echoing through the dark arena as the undead actually cheered.\nThe impact jolted through Stark's arms, but the satisfaction of hitting that little arrogant shit fueled him.\nThe moment the cross made contact, a surge of energy erupted from it, radiating the powerful essence of the [Exorcist].\n~BOOOOOOOOM~\n\"-198372!\"\nReaper staggered back, his hollow eyes wide with shock.

You will die!]\nBut even then, the apostle still wanted to use his [Mythical] skill, to at least take down the human and entire arena with him.\nHe spread his arms upward again, focusing all his power into this.\n~FWISH, FWISH, FWIIIISHHH~\nHe was concentrating like he never did before as he had actually never been so defeated by a human: he would always be the one toying with them, not the other way around.\nBut now…\n\"AS LONG AS I TAKE YOU DOWN WITH ME, IT IS MY VICTORY,\" Reaper suddenly clenched his fists, and the aura around them grew ten times in size, meaning that he was on the verge of activating his power.\n\"GKKGKGK~\"\n\"HIHIHIHI~\"\nAnd for the first time too, the cheers in the crowd weren't directed as his victory, but at his failure: they were cheering for the human.\n\"FATE'S JUDGEMENT… ACTIVATED!\" in one final ditch effort, Reaper's entire body glowed with an ethereal darkness, \"I GOT YOU NOW-\"\nThe vortex above flickered, and everything in it began to slowly come out.\n\"…\" and yet, neither did him or his clone do anything to stop that: he obviously still had [Crimson Purification], so he could have definitely stopped the apostle, yet he didn't.\nAnd for the second time, the reason why was obvious.\nTo be honest, even Reaper should know what was bound to happen to him, the only thing he didn't expect was for it to happen so FAST.\n\"MY VICTOR-\" and yet, he couldn't end his final sentence.\nBecause…\n~CRACK, CRACK~\nThe cracks that had formed from Stark's third strike were still present, making small particles of dust fall to the ground.\n~CRACK, CRACK~\nAnd the [Second Impact]'s attack only served as a way to deepen those wounds, spreading the cracks more and more as they kept advancing, soon enough taking over Reaper's entire face, who was barely holding on.\n~CRACK, CRACK~\nIn addition to that, the foolish apostle's pride didn't let him at least not use too much energy.\n~CRACK, CRACK~\nWhile trying to activate [Fate's Judgement], the small cracks on his head literally glowed with darkness aura as Reaper was charging up everything he had, and from Stark's perspective, it looked as though the apostle's head was just a ticking bomb.\n\"I… CANNOT… DISAPPOINT… LORD… GODLESS!\" Reaper shouted as hard as he could, the entire arena plunged in darkness.\nBut even then…\n~CRACK…~\n\"Goodbye,\" Stark smiled, and that was the last thing Reaper's small white pupils looked at before IT happened.\n~BOOM~\nOverwhelmed by the cracks, and the intense usage of darkness aura to power himself up, Reaper's skull head couldn't handle it and actually exploded.\nReaper's skeletal face shattered, and the dark energy he had gathered dissipating as his body crumbled. The vortex above flickered and collapsed, the shadowy entities it had birthed vanishing into nothingness.\nStark watched in stunned silence as the mighty Reaper, the Calamity Apostle, was reduced to nothing before his eyes as his skeletal body, which was only kept together thanks to aura, also turned into dust as well.\nThe arena was deathly quiet, the crowd's cheers dying in their throats.\n~THUD~\nAnd Reaper's body, now missing his head as its exploded because of the aura, fell to the ground in a thud, turning into dust while it fell.\n\"…Nice,\" Stark smiled as he fist pumped the clone, who was still alive right beside him.\nThe fact a clone at one HP survived this entire battle though was baffling to Stark.\nAnd to be honest, he couldn't deny that he felt it was stronger than before, as actually being able to take down an apostle by itself was insane.\n\"Sigh… just what are you on,\" he let out a small chuckle as he looked at it, the omnipresent smile wider than before.\n\"GIGIGKSKK!\"\n\"HIHIHIH~\"\n\"NRAAA~\"\nThe undead in the crowd were all cheering and clapping, congratulating the human for his victory against the two apostles.\n\"Weird,\" Stark didn't know why monsters wouldn't attack and actually be happy when their leader died, but as long as they didn't attack, he didn't care much.\nHe was extremely tired to begin with, as doing all of this absolutely exhausted his stamina.\nBut… in the end… it was worth it… because…\n[Lother, The Grave Keeper has been defeated!]\n[Reaper, The Undead Puppeteer has been defeated!]\nHe had actually done it, he had won the two versus two fair and square, meaning that he was officially stronger than a calamity-level monster.",

You did indeed kill all of them, and they cannot respawn again, meaning that this rift is officially 'purged'!]\nAll the monsters had been killed.\n\"Holy…\"\n\"=)\"\n[As a reward for purging an entire rift, you have been granted a 'Max out Core'!]\n[You can sell it for a massive amount of money, or use it on one of your skills to INSTANTLY max it out, no matter what its level is!]\n\"Amazing…\" Stark smiled, this would be extremely useful.\nThe item appeared in Stark's hand, it looked like a flint stone, though it was glowing with a beautiful aura.\n\"I'm keeping it until upgrading my skills again as it would be dumb to waste while the max is level 50,\" he immediately put it in his [Spatial Inventory] then got up from the ground.\nIn addition to that item though, he noticed three faint purple glows coming from Reaper's remains, yet strangely enough, none coming from Lother's? Was it because he was erased, or because Reaper was the main threat?\nHe took the items and placed the three of them in front of him, vowing to complete everything he needed to do before leaving the rift, as it was extremely peaceful right now, with nothing there to disturb him.\n[Assign your skill points?]\n[Check out the 'ApostleDex'?]\n[Check the equipment?]\n[Level 70 reached: pick a card!]\nHe had many things to do, and so the peace of this place actually allowed him to think better than if he was in the city, constantly hearing the sound of machinery and cars.\n~FWISH~\nThree completely black cards appeared in front of him, their backs showed a white skull with red dots in its eyes, resembling Reaper, but also the [Death Card] that had taken him to this rift.\n\"Clone?\" Stark smiled, and the [Superior Clone] nodded as it went behind the cards, beginning to look at them.\n\"…\" but as soon as it did, it suddenly lost its smile.\n\"Huh?\" Stark was confused.\nThey had defeated the monsters, everything was looking up for both of them.\nSo why… was its expression so grim…?\n\"…\" in the end, the clone just shrugged, then pointed at the card in the middle.\nStark trusted it, so he grabbed it, and…\n\"The fuck?\"\nOnce he saw the front for himself, he realized there was actually no front: it was completely black, the same color as the card, meaning that the only thing visible in it was the skull.\n\"Clone?\" Stark raised his eyebrows, and the clone just shrugged again, almost as if saying that the card it had picked wouldn't have mattered, \"Hm… were all the cards just… void?\" he asked.\n\"=)\" and the clone nodded again, smiling mischievously as if it retrieved its confidence.\n\"Huh…\" nonetheless, Stark decided to check out the skill.\n…\n[Skill: The Void (Passive - Part One)]\n[Rank: Mythical]\n[Description: It is the void, nothing more, nothing less, anyone sent to this void cannot be recovered, and if the host decides to jump in themselves, then their doom will be imminent]\n[Note: this skill is a passive since it is required for some other skills in the future to work, basically, it is like one of the pieces of a two part puzzle, not having it would mean the other skills don't work!]\n[Info: This skill cannot be leveled up!]\n…\n\"Two part skills…?\" Stark was immensely confused, but after reading the note a few more times, he guessed that all the cards probably all showed [The Void] since some skills would require it in the future.\nThough, he did wonder what kind of skill would require the FUCKING VOID to be used?!\n\"Sigh…\" he scratched his forehead, \"I guess that's fine, it IS mythical in rank after all…\"\nAnd so, Stark decided to move to his skill points, wanting to assign them as to give him the BEST possible outcome in terms of perks.",

During this time, any undead assaults against him are reduced by a staggering 95% in damage.]\n[Note: this can useful is you are sure to get hit by some attacks, yet don't want to take the risk of dying!]\n…\nPretty damn good perk, and Stark already pictured how useful it could be against an undead boss or in the [Devil's Abyss] rift, but he quickly moved to the next skill.\n…\n[Skill: Clone Frenzy lv25 (Silver-Tier Max)!]\n[New Perk: Clone Sacrifice]\n[Description: This perk works in two ways when using a Superior Clone. First, if you are about to be hit by an attack that could potentially one-shot you, you can activate this perk and the clone will instantly teleport to take the hit in your place, shielding you from harm.\nThe second way to use this perk is to sacrifice the clone itself. You can send the clone rushing towards an enemy and overcharge it with aura, causing it to explode and deal massive damage to the target. This allows you to use the clone as a living bomb in dire situations.]\n[Note: it ONLY works with the Superior Clone!]\n…\nThis perk was amazing as well.\nStark remembered that his clones could actually do that at some point in time as they tried to use [Aura Smash]'s new merge perk, which was too overwhelming for them, so they ended up exploding, he had used that against the [Corrupted Ghoul].\nBut now that he and his clones has mastered it, and his aura increased, he hadn't been able to do that anymore.\nAnd yet… here it was, back in business, although it was sad that he could only sacrifice the [Superior Clone], but that would indeed mean that the attack would be devastating, right?\nPlus, he could also use his clone as if he was using [Purgatory Shadows]!\nBut suddenly, right as Stark remembered that…\n'Huh…? Purgatory Shadows?' he mumbled to himself as his eyes widened.\nAnd that's when he realized something: purgatory shadow has actually not activated during the entirety of this rift, even though he had been hit many times.\nStark looked down and…\n'Oh come on…'\nNot only was the [Purgatory Shadow] ring broken, since the pulsating black shard in the middle was cracked, but his other ring, the [Crystalheart Band], which granted him a shield that absorbs 10% of damage was also destroyed.\nWhich meant that literally ALL of his equipment was destroyed except for the [Sculk Necklace], which was useless against Reaper.\n\"Sigh…\" Stark took the two rings off his fingers and threw them away out of frustration.\nThen he quickly returned to the main focus: checking out everything he needed to check.\n…\n[Skill: Wielding Cross lv10]\n[New Perk: Crushing Gravity (EPIC)]\n[Description: By grasping the handle of the Crimson Cross, the user can hurl it high into the air, throwing it very high, and when it reaches its apex, the perk can be activated to make it fall back toward the enemy like a meteor.\nIt is EXTREMELY difficult to aim and hit with it, so it only takes one of the three strikes you have available, plus you lose the cross for the moment it is in the air, so watch out!\nThough, if it does hit, then the damage will be phenomenal, and the area around the enemy that is hit will explode with aura as well!]\n…\n\"Heh… worth it,\" Stark smiled, it was indeed worth the 'EPIC' title if the damage it did when hitting was just as good as the energy ball from [Holy Concentration].\nThe perks Stark had gotten were pretty damn good this time, and he hadn't been this proud of his choice for a long time now, maybe the calm really did help, huh…\nIn the end, it didn't matter, though.\n\"…\" Stark looked at his clone, and it actually seemed upset, \"Clone Sacrifice…?\" he said out of nowhere, and the superior clone immediately began to look everywhere, ready to use the perk to defend the original.\n\"Pffftt~\" Stark couldn't help but let out a small chuckle as it is probably that new perk that made the clone panic, but oh well, \"Alright, two more.\"\nHe still needed to check out the three pieces of equipment in front of him, and finally… the [ApostleDex], since he had effectively killed 6 apostles now.\nHe wanted to leave the best for last though, so he began to crouch down to check out what he got from the two giant apostle monsters.",

He turned it over, inspecting its details.\n…\n[Item:] Shadowbinder's Cloak\n[Type] Armor\n[Class] Assassin, Magus\n[Tier:] Legendary\n[Required Level:] 150\n[Quality:] Exquisite\n[Attributes:] None.\n[Special Perk:] Veil of Shadows - Grants the wearer temporary invisibility for five minutes, though your weapon will not disappear!\n…\n\"Huh…\" this was basically equipment that mimicked Reaper's [Shadow Veil] skill, the special perk clearly indicating that the weapon couldn't become invisible either.\nNot from the [Domination] class, though, and the required level was extremely high.\nBasically… it wasn't for him.\nNext, he reached for the second piece, its surface glinting ominously.\n…\n[Equipment:] Reaper's Scythe\n[Type:] Weapon\n[Class:] Warrior, Assassin, Domination\n[Tier:] Mythical\n[Required Level:] 150 for other classes, 70 for domination\n[Quality:] Perfect\n[Attributes:] +2500 strength, +1000 speed\n[Special Perk:] Death's Touch - When touching someone with this scythe, there is a chance to inflict a curse on them, thus massively reducing their defense.\n…\n\"Oh,\" Stark rolled his eyes as he saw the weapon.\nTo be honest, he wasn't interested in it either.\nWhy?\nWell…\n~FWISH, SWING~\nEven though he grabbed the handle and tried to swing, he just literally couldn't.\nAs said before, every [Domination] has their RESPECTIVE weapons, and so you couldn't try and use another type.\nHis weapons were his fists and magic, so the only way he would be able to get a blade was if a legitimate skill gave it to him, otherwise he couldn't.\nPlus, for the first time ever, the [Required Level] was actually different, showing that any person from another class would need to be level 150 to wield it, while [Domination] only needed to be level 70.\nMaybe it was the world trying to adjust because of how difficult it was to level up with domination?\nIn the end, it didn't matter, and Stark put it inside his [Spatial Inventory] as well, moving to the third and final item.\n…\n[Equipment:] Skull Face\n[Type:] Helmet\n[Class:] Warrior, Magus, Assassin, Archer, Soul Wielder\n[Tier:] Epic\n[Required Level:] 125\n[Quality:] Bad\n[Attributes:] None.\n[Special Perk:] While wearing this skull on your head, you constantly spread out a dark aura around you, and if the enemy is weaker or easily overwhelmed, there is a chance they get the [Stun], [Fear] or [Confusion] status effects.\n…\nA fairly good item, though the quality was bad since it visibly had many cracks on it, possibly since Stark had done the same thing to Reaper.\nBut…\n\"…This is bullshit.\"\nTo be honest, Stark did expect that: all these items were related to the undead, meaning that [Exorcist] could automatically not be a class allowed to use them, since… y'know… they hate undead beings.\nAnd [Domination] was a rare class with the percentage of getting an item being extremely rare anyway, plus he had indeed gotten one for the class, but it was just useless to him.\nONLY a [Domination] user can access a [Domination] item after all, which is why none of the other classes knew about it: it just didn't drop for them no matter what.\nCould be useful for another [Domination] user though if they can wield weapons, who knows.\nBut now that his two rings were broken, he had no item except for the [Sculk Necklace], though to be honest, it didn't bother him that much, as having TOO many pieces of equipment would possibly make him forget about most of them.\nHe needed passive ones, much like [Purgatory Shadows] and [Crystalheart Band] since they didn't need for him to think about using them: they were always activated.\nAnd as for why his rings broke… the sole possible explanation was that their durability had reached their limit.\nYes, every item/equipment does have a durability, and if it gets hit too many times, it automatically breaks, which is why people constantly change them.\n\"Well… doesn't matter,\" he took the [Skull Face] and put it inside his inventory void.\nAnd then… all that was left for him to do, was to check the ApostleDex.\n[You have completed an 'ApostleDex' task! Please open it!]\nFeeling the excitement, Stark immediately opened it.\nAnd so, the crimson quest-like window appeared before him.\n[Godless Demon Apostles]\n[5 killed, 10 remain]\nIn front of him was the same panel he had checked before, with the 15 squares, each depicting one of the apostles he needed to defeat, spread between 3 lines of 5 each.\nAnd the most surprising of all was… that first line was completed!\nStark couldn't see the other apostles inside the squares as all he got was their shadows, except for the [Crimson Moons Trio], obviously, who was set up in the 5th square of the second line, an Immortal-Level entity if he remembered right.\nHe had already met them once back at the rift where he killed [Judicator], so he could see their appearance, and it still brought chills to him.\nThe first line though, as said before, was completed with the five apostles.\nAnd the order went like this: Malakar -> Judicator -> Sierra -> Lother -> Reaper.\nEach of these apostles had their appearance associated to them on the squares, visible to Stark as he had already met up and beat them, plus he could click on them to make a profil appear with all their relevant information, like rank, level and skills.\nIt would have been great to know about their stories as well since he was still confused with all that 'Godless Demon Apostle' ordeal, but maybe that is for the next time…?\n[Each of the apostles is actually placed in terms of strength, so the closer they are to the end, then the stronger they actually are as well!]\nAnother panel appeared, and this time it was actually very important information.\nThis meant that the first line, which Stark completed, actually held the five weakest apostles of the lot…\nWhen he would reach the second line, most of them would be at the [Calamity] level, or even [Immortal], as the [Crimson Moons Trio] was actually the strongest apostle of the second line.\nAnd when he reaches the third… oh boy… they would surely of the highest rank.\nBut then what?\nWould he fight the [Godless Demon]? The final boss of this world?\n\"Huh…\" Stark didn't know, so he quickly moved on.\n[Only those that defeat ALL of the apostles will have the chance to meet and fight the 'Godless Demon']\n[No one until now has ever accomplished that.]\n[Be the first, Chosen One.]\nAnd of course, to make him wanna do that, there were rewards.\n[Upon defeating 5 of the apostles, you will receive a MYTHICAL reward!]\n[Upon defeating 10 of the apostles, you will receive a GODLY reward!]\n[Upon defeating 15 of the apostles, you will receive an IMMORTAL reward!]\nHe had completed the first line, which meant…\n~DING~\n[You have completed the first task!]\n[Congratulations, you have a MYTHICAL skill!]\n\"Finally,\" Stark smiled.\nAfter everything he went through, he had finally managed to complete a third of the ApostleDex.\nThough… for some strange reason… he felt like he would meet and fight the rest of them much faster than before…\nAnyway, he already knew three apostles waiting for him inside the [Devil's Abyss], and that the [Crimson Moons Trio] could be fought as he met them in one rift before.\nMeaning that only 6 apostles remained unknown, and there was no saying if they didn't all just regroup together.\nIn the end, Stark decided to check that new [Mythical] skill he had acquired.\nIf it was as strong as EGO was, then surely he would become MUCH stronger, making Stark very excited.\n[Do you want to receive your skill now?]\n[Y/N]\n'What kind of dumbass would put no…' he sighed as he taped on yes, and suddenly, the aura around him increased.\nAnd then… a panel appeared.\n[You have received the MYTHICAL skill: \"Banish\"!]\nStark noticed it, but the more powerful a skill was, the simpler its name was.\nMaybe it was just a coincidence, but [Banish] sounded so powerful even though it was just a single word for no reason whatsoever.\nThen… Stark checked the description, and his eyes widened once he did.\n…\n[Skill: Banish]\n[Type:] Mythical\n[Level:] Cannot be leveled up\n[Description: When the user's feels that their aura surpasses that of an enemy, they can unleash Banish, as a result, both his and the opponent's auras clash in a violent surge of energy, a battlefield of ethereal power.\nIf the user's aura prevails, the enemy is instantly cast into the Void—death is certain and instant, no matter their level or remaining health.\nShould the enemy's aura prove stronger, though, the user faces a stunning backlash, leaving them vulnerable to incoming attacks.]\n[Condition: \"The Void\" skill is required.]\n[Note: it can work on ANY enemy.]\n…\n\"This is…\" Stark's heart raced as he read the panel dozens and dozens of time, until he eventually knew about every word on it.\nThis skill was… amazing.\nA high risk, high reward skill.\nIf he used it and overpowered an opponent, it could save his life as the opponent is immediately banished to the [Void], which is the skill he received mere minutes ago, but if his aura is weaker, then he is stunned, it was an incredibly fair deal.\n\"I guess that's what the void is used for, huh…\" no wonder it was [Mythical] as well, though it needed other skills to be useful.\nAnd so… Stark finished everything he needed to do.\n\"Time to get out,\" he mumbled.",

      "content": "\"I guess that's it for this rift… huh,\" Stark sighed as he got up.\nHe had done it!\nHe had beaten the [Death Rift] card that he was given by this shitty academy, and that meant he could go home to announce it to all his classmates and mock those who thought he was insane.\nBut… in comparison to what Stark believed, he actually didn't need to go outside for them to know.\nSince…\n~DING~\n[All the footage inside a rift for this first academy trial, meaning from start to finish, is recorded by the system itself as to credit the ones who do complete it, and also for personal usage!]\n[This footage is sent to ALL students (yes, not only your group) and teachers of the academy!]\n[Have fun!]\nBelow that was another panel with a video playing on it, showing how Stark got inside the rift to begin with, meaning that it was real: everyone would see his journey inside that rift from start to finish.\n\"…\" Stark looked at the panel before him for a few seconds, reading each of them at least a dozen times, \"…Alright.\"\nHe closed them, and then…\n~DING~\n[Someone has completed a trial's rift!]\n[Rift name: Corpse Cemetery (DEATH RIFT)]\n[Group Number 8 has passed!]\n[19 spots remain!]\nSo many notifications appeared in front of Stark, and it seemed as though these were actually from the 'Rift Conqueror' Academy itself.\nStark didn't know how to feel, on one hand, this easily revealed most of his abilities to the world, though he did expect that even humans that were level 200-250 wouldn't be able to take him down.\nBut on the other hand… FAME AND MONEY!!!\n\"Phew…\" Stark sighed and smiled as he began to head toward the portal that had appeared right on top of Reaper's body, or at least the dust that made it, \"Well, see you never corpse cemetery,\" he shrugged before jumping into the portal.\n…\nMeanwhile, in the outside world.\nIt had been exactly a week since Stark entered the rift, and yes, time passed differently in the [Corpse Cemetery], though only by a little as time moved slightly faster in the real world.\nMeaning that the eight-nine hours he spent inside were actually 7 days in the outside world, still better than those other times when it ended up being weeks though, right?\nAfter completing the rift and killing the second apostle, the rift was automatically considered as completed, and thus the footage was sent to everyone, meaning that the 30 minutes that Stark spent reading his panels inside ended up being around 11 hours in the real world.\nAnd oh boy… a lot can happen in 11 hours.\n…\n\"Huh, what is that?\" Lana was laying on her bed, patiently waiting for Stark to come back as it had been a week, when the panel suddenly appeared.\n[Someone has completed a trial's rift!]\n[Rift name: Corpse Cemetery (DEATH RIFT)]\n[Group Number 8 has passed!]\n\"OHMYGOD!\" she got up from her bed and shouted in excitement and happiness, \"H-HE DID IT!\"\nIt wasn't before long that she noticed the video attached to those panels.\n\"Huh…\" she began playing it, \"I-Is that Stark… wait a damn minute, 8 hours of footage?!\"\nShe decided to go back on her bed to watch it all.\n…\nThe people of his group on the other hand were also just as shocked, they didn't expect for it to be done… so fast?!\nAnd alone too!\nAll groups had tried to conquer their rifts at least once, except for them, sending a single classifier to do it.\nAnd after a week, that person had actually done it…\nMost of them were overjoyed, obviously, since it meant their group would 100% go to the next semester/trial.\nThey all watched the video as well.\n…\nThe other groups on the other hand immediately stressed over the fact that one of the rifts had been completed in under a week, a world record for the academy.\nAnd after checking the video, their despair grew as they saw THAT A SINGLE PERSON had done it, and in only EIGHT HOURS, well, that is if you count the 5 hours in which he slept of course.\n\"Holy shit…\" Karl Spikeford gritted his teeth, even he knew that whatever was happening was out of this world.\n\"Huh…\" the three rock star gangsters that tried to attack Stark and Lana at the train station also were surprised, swallowing their saliva as they recognized that black hair, even though Stark's face was hidden by some sort of red aura.\n…\n\"…Good job,\" Sora was sitting on a very comfortable chair in the library of her mansion, her surroundings dimly lit by a small candle.\nShe immediately stopped reading her book the moment the panel appeared though, prioritizing seeing what Stark was up to over anything else since he was in her group.\nAfter 4 hours (since she replayed some moments and had to skip the five hours of sleep), she finished the video, a VERY SMALL, barely visible, smile appearing on her face as she sighed in relief.\nShe was happy that he was alive and still as strong, if not stronger, than when he saved her.\n…\nAnd finally, the last people who saw it were obviously the teachers/chairman.\n\"Haha…\" Theodore, the chairman of the academy, smiled, \"Impressive…\"\nAround him were the 19 other people that were responsible for the academy: the teachers.\n\"Let's watch the video, then,\" Theodore continued, he saw the only one speaking as all the other impatiently awaited to watch, he had forbidden them to do that until they all did it together after all.\n~CLICK~\nAnd so they began watching.\nSpoilers: they were impressed by Stark's strength and by how easily he managed to dominate his enemies, somehow, it never felt as though the boy in the video was struggling, at least not until the two apostles.\n\"You said there was only one, though,\" one of the teachers spoke.\n\"Well… it might have just slipped my mind, haha~\"\nBut even then, Stark, thanks to a copy of himself, managed to defeat both Lother and Reaper in what could only be described as an extraordinary fight.\n~CLAP, CLAP~\nTheodore applauded after the video ended.\n\"Fabulous, and the fastest clearing time in this academy's history, we have a champion in our hands, folks,\" Theodore mischievously smiled, and all the others followed.\n…\nBack to Stark.\n~FWISH~\nHe emerged from the cabin, and opened the door immediately as he left the rift, finding himself in the 'crosswood cemetery' again, as if nothing had happened.\nThe sky was blue, and the sun was up there, probably because it was the morning.\nThere was no sound around him except for the one of the wind and some occasional cars, but right now, he was alone in this place.\nBut suddenly… something came to disrupt this peace.\n~BOOM~\nA sudden explosion could be heard from behind Stark, specifically where the cabin was, and once he turned back… he saw IT happening.\nThe gray portal which he just exited flickered violently, swirling with a massive amount of energy, radiating an otherworldly hum.\nThis kept going for a good minute, until with a final burst of light, the portal began to close, almost as if it was sealing itself from anyone else.\nAnd the reason was obvious: a completed rift had no reason and no way to truly exist, since all the monsters inside were dead.\nBasically, Stark had witnessed the TRUE death of a rift, something that doesn't happen often.\n\"Interesting,\" he mumbled as he turned around.\nNow… Stark would need to face the real world after everything that had happened inside that rift.\nAnd he was sure that many things would change.\nBut it didn't matter for now, so shaking off the lingering sensation of the rift closing in front of him, Stark stepped onto the stone path that passed through the cemetery.\nMinutes passed before he reached the iron gate that marked the entrance (or exit in this case) of the cemetery.\n\"Crimson Ball Transmission!\" he summoned the ball in hand and easily teleported to the other side, trespassing was no problem with that skill after all!\nOnce outside, he continued walking for a while since there was no way for him to find a taxi this close to the cemetery where a supposed nightmare rift was opened, but after twenty minutes of walking, he raised a hand and was lucky enough to find a driver close by.\n\"To the capital, please, toward the XXXXX avenue,\" he pointed at his apartment complex's location.\n\"Sure thing, kid,\" the driver nodded, \"What were you doing here at this time by the way?\"\n\"Nothing much,\" he didn't even have the strength nor motivation to boast like he always did.\n\"Alright.\"\nYet another 30 minutes passed, and… he reached the city.\nAnd what awaited him there was… phenomenal.\n\"Huh, seems like something big has happened,\" the middle-aged driver didn't seem up-to-date with all the recent stuff.\nBut basically… while Stark was looking out of the window, observing the city.\nHe noticed that… his footage was playing everywhere.\nYes, the footage where he was fighting inside the rift was there: his [Crimson Purification] against the undead in the first zone, his fight against the [Darkness Ghost] in the second, the [Gargoyle King] battle in the third, and finally, the 2V2 with the apostles in the fourth.\nMany highlights and clips were showing everywhere, each different from the last.\nEven the NEWS were speaking about him, and Stark lowered the windows to be able to hear what the reporter on the screen of the giant skyscraper was saying.\n[A new 'Rift Conqueror' academy record has been established, the supposed classifier completing a 'Nightmare' rift alone in THREE HOURS, one that had two 'Godless Demon' apostles in it!]\nIn the span of half a day… Stark had become a celebrity, though an unknown one, since he had activated [Facial Camouflage] at the start.\n\"Oh… boy…\" he let out a quick chuckle as the driver kept going.\nAnd soon enough… he reached his home, the driver stopping right in front of the apartment complex where he lived.",

      "content": "Stark took the elevator to go to the third floor.\nFrankly, Stark was immensely tired, and even those five hours he got at the rift weren't even a fraction of the sleep he wanted after doing so many actions.\n[Domination]'s stamina and power works kind of like dopamine: when the user is fighting, their supply is almost endless with stamina, able to keep going and going no matter what.\nBut after all of that… tiredness comes back, and all they want to do is sleep.\nStark left the elevator once he was at the third floor and reached for his door, his fingers fumbling for the keycard in his [Spatial Inventory].\nBut suddenly…\n~SLAM~\nThe door next to his swung open, and there stood Lana, her eyes wide with surprise.\n\"Oh,\" he squinted his eyes.\n\"STARK!\" and before he could even react, she launched herself at him, nearly knocking him off balance.\n\"Whoa, careful there,\" he sighed, steadying himself against the wall.\n\"You're back! I was worried sick!\"\n\"…\"\n\"Did you really defeat two apostles? I s-saw the footage and everything!!\"\nStark nodded, a faint and tired grin tugging at his lips.\n\"That's insane! I knew you could do it!\"\n\"Thanks, but I'm beat. Need to crash.\"\n\"Right, of course! Get some rest!\"\nStark nodded again, his body urging him toward the comfort of sleep.\nHe finally pulled out the keycard, slid it into the lock, and opened the door.\nHe jumped into his bed immediately, then fell asleep the microsecond his head touched his pillow, not even bothering to close the door behind.\n\"…\" Lana sighed before smiling, her eyes sparkling as she approached the bed, crouching to watch Stark's sleeping face, \"Cute,\" she almost wanted to touch his cheek with a single one of her fingers, but she stopped herself, thinking he would probably not like it.\nAnd so, she patted his head then went away, closing the door behind him, \"Thank you for the help,\" she bowed as he had also helped her pass the first trial after all.\n…\n\"…\" Stark already knew where he was, no need to even bother acting like he was confused.\nHe was currently in a casino, and of course, his two doppelgängers [Alchemist] and [Domination] were also there, seemingly playing blackjack around a round table.\n\"Yo,\" Domination smiled, \"Do that a seat if you want to play!\"\n\"…\" Stark didn't want to, but he still took one of three available seats, filling in the spots of the table.\nAfter all… he wanted to talk with them both.\n\"So what now?\" Stark asked, two cards magically appearing in front of him.\n\"What do you mean,\" Domination quickly checked his own before smiling.\n\"I mean… I keep thinking over and over, but what is my… no… our goal?\"\n\"Hm…\" Alchemist put his white aura hand against his chin, \"Hit by the way,\" he asked relating to the blackjack game, and another card appeared in his deck.\n\"I think I already have a few ideas,\" Stark continued, but…\n\"Oh, but we already know what's our goal, though,\" Domination lost his smile as he decided to [Hit] as well.\n\"And that is…?\"\n\"I mean, isn't it just beating all the apostles, then meeting with that 'Godless Demon' punk and beating his ass?\" Alchemist answered.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"I mean, the entirety of the things until now were all somehow related to us killing the apostles, and even the ApostleDex said that killing them all would mean meeting the Godless Demon,\" Domination finished.\n\"I… Oh,\" Stark realized it.\nHis goal was not to get all the classes, have a happy life, or whatever bullshit most people wanted.\nHis goal…was to get rid of the 'Godless Demon', no matter what.\nMaybe that was the task Rher wanted to give all the transmigrators? And why it was so hard to pass that judgement of his…?\n\"In my humble opinion, I think the 'Godless Demon' could be considered as the 'Controller of all monsters', which is why we need to get rid of him,\" Domination shrugged, \"Stand.\"\n\"If that is so, then why isn't anybody trying to kill him? Surely there are people way stronger than I am to do that?\"\n\"Well… maybe nobody knows how to do it?\" Alchemist answered, \"After all, even for us, the only way is by the ApostleDex.\"\n\"Oh…\"\nThis meant… that Stark was truly the only one.\nWas he really invited in this world after his death just to get rid of some monster.\n\"I think he is the closest thing you could consider to be a god in this world,\" Domination finished his argument while looking at Stark, \"But it is possible to win, much like all the other times, if we manage to defeat all the apostles, then the path will definitely be opened for us.\"\nAnd so that meant…\n[10 apostles left]\n\"We need to get rid of them all,\" Domination and Alchemist said at the same time as they dropped their cards on the table, Domination going over 21, and Alchemist losing to Stark who got 20.\n\"Ok,\" Stark nodded.\n\"Well, then go, we've been playing this game for two weeks after all,\" Domination smiled.\n\"Two weeks..? Oh, I get it,\" it meant that Stark had been so tired that he was sleeping for two weeks in the real world, \"Well then… goodbye, see you next time.\"\n\"Cya, host.\"\nThe casino disappeared, the doppelgängers, and Stark was back in the black void again.\nHe closed his eyes.\nAnd then…\n~FWISH~\nHe lost consciousness.\n…\n~DING~\nStark opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was the ceiling of his room.\n\"Great…\" he perfectly remembered the discussion he had with his doppelgangers, and it actually did make him a bit nervous.\nEveryone knew about the [Godless Demon] and how powerful he was, yet no one had ever fought let alone seen him, all they knew was that he controlled the apostles, who in turn controlled millions of monsters.\n\"Time to get off… I have lots of time now that the rift is complete,\" he mumbled as he tried to get up.\nBut strangely enough… his bed felt more cramped than usual.\n\"…\" he looked down to see what the hell was happening.\nAnd… of course it was cramped, since Lana was sleeping right beside.\nHe didn't know how this ended up like that, and to be honest he didn't even want the context of it all since it would probably be bullshit anyway.\n\"…Alright,\" he got up, trying not to wake her up, and then immediately went to the kitchen as he was starving.\nHe ate a full meal that he pulled from his [Spatial Inventory], feeling relieved.\nThen… he immediately went back into thinking mode.\nIf his goal was truly to kill all of those shitty monsters, then he needed two things: information of their location and… strength to fight back.\nHe was level 70, and even though with [Domination] that probably translated roughly to level 200-250, he still needed much more.\nThe [Godless Demon] was probably above level 1000 after all, being able to beat the strongest of classifiers easily.\n\"Alright… just need to focus,\" he slapped his cheeks a few times to wake himself up.\nBut right at that moment…\nSomething unimaginable happened.\n~DING~\n[It is information that you want?]\n[Then you will get your information!]\nAnd suddenly, the ApostleDex opened again.",

REALLY BIG!\nOf course, the difficulty would surely rise higher than he could even imagine for these apostles, but at least knowing where they were incredible!\n\"Hm~ mh…\" he heard Lana make some cute noises as she turned around, holding one of the pillows tight, \"Hehe~ not here Stark… hehe…\"\n\"…\" to be honest, he didn't even wanna know what she was talking about.\nAnd so, he quickly returned to reading the [ApostleDex] panel, wanting to figure out where the hell were those apostles at.\nDing!\nHe began reading from the second line, stopping his eyes on the first black box, displaying the shadowy figure of an apostle he hadn't seen yet.\n…\n[Line 2, Apostle 1]\n[Name: ???]\n[Level: ???]\n[Location: Devil's Abyss]\n…\nThen he quickly moved on to the next one.\n…\n[Line 2, Apostle 2]\n[Name: ???]\n[Level: ???]\n[Location: Devil's Abyss]\n…\n\"Huh…\" he already knew that three apostles were waiting for him in the [Devil's Abyss] rift, which he had the key of, but he didn't expect them so soon!\n…\n[Line 2, Apostle 3]\n[Name: ???]\n[Level: ???]\n[Location: Devil's Abyss]\n…\nYep, this was confirmed: the next three apostles Stark needed to find if he wanted to fight them chronologically as to give himself a chance, were those in the [Devil's Abyss].\n\"Ah…\" Stark sighed, this was bad news for him, since it meant that from now on, the apostles' level would surely be above 200 or even 250, and by the end of the second line, he already expected the [Crimson Moons Trio] to be level 500 or above.\nIt didn't matter though, so he moved to the apostle to the left from the visible picture of the moon trio, since he had already seen them once, their single eye staring at the boy as if they knew he was inspecting them.\nFwish!\n…\n[Line 2, Apostle 4]\n[Name: ???]\n[Level: ???]\n[Location: Last Floor (10) of the Colosseum]\n….\n\"Huh?\" Stark had never heard of something like a 'colosseum'.\nHe had been in this world for a while now, and although it had been less than a year since his arrival, there was no chance he would have missed it.\nWas the 'Colosseum' a rift? But then why would it talk about floors?!\n\"Well, I'll figure it out later,\" but there was one thing Stark knew: it was that at some point, he would enter that colosseum and fight the apostle.\nBecause no matter what he did, it was his fate as the 'Chosen One'.\nFighting those apostles was inevitable, and it was either he got rid of them one by one, or they killed him… and soon enough… they will take over the world.\nFor that is the true plan of the 'Godless Demon'.\nNobody, not even Stark, knew that he was one of the few ones actively trying to kill the apostles.\nBasically… he was the unknown savior of this world, though his quest was still ongoing.\nAnd as for the only visible apostle of the second line…\n…\n[Line 2, Apostle 5]\n[Name: Crimson Moons Trio]\n[Level: ???]\n[Location: Third Domination Trial]\n…\n\"…\"\n[Location: Third Domination Trial]\nStark made sure to read that several times just to make sure that he wasn't going crazy.\nAnd yet, here it was, in front of his very eyes.\n\"…\"\nNot only did this mean that there would indeed be a third domination trial, at least a hundred times harder than the previous, but also that at least ONE of the apostles would be there.\n\"Ah… fucking hell…\" Stark held his forehead with such force it actually began to hurt, \"FUCK…\"\nHe shouted that last sentence without even realizing it.\nThud!\nAnd it surprised Lana so much she jumped from the bed and fell on the ground.\n\"Ouch… what happene~d… I had the besssttt dreamm…\" Lana mumbled, half asleep.\nShe rubbed her eyes, adjusting to her surroundings.\nThe usual Lana would immediately have her face turn completely red as she had essentially slept with Stark, because she got worried after seeing him sleep for two weeks straight.\nShe would also think something like 'h-he probably thinks I'm a pervert!!!', and almost die of shame.\nBut… right now… she wasn't feeling any of that.\nBecause as she was watching Stark, all she could sense was fear.\nStark didn't look normal: he was angry, so angry in fact that his crimson aura didn't only take over his face as usual, but his entire body too.\n\"Trial… trial…\" he kept mumbling those words, deep in thought.\nLana had seen Stark get mad, obviously, but never this much.\n\"S-Stark…?\" she truly couldn't comprehend what he was thinking, and why this happened the moment he woke up.\nDid something bad happen in the outside world? Did he receive horrible news?\nNo… Stark wouldn't be bothered by what happened to others, and he didn't have anyone close to him besides her and Sora…\n\"Apostle… trial… domination…\" he mumbled, his thoughts trying to arrange everything into something comprehensible.\n\"STARK!\" Lana shouted again.\nFwish!\nAnd this time, Stark turned his head toward her, not losing the aura around him, the vortex in his eyes not disappearing as it inspected the girl before him.\nWoosh!\nThis made her legs tremble: she was scared.\nShe knew Stark wouldn't do anything to her, but seeing him like this was… hard.\nBut after only thirty seconds… the aura around Stark disappeared, and he retrieved his usual neutral expression.\n\"Alright, I get it now,\" he mumbled low enough for her not to hear, \"I'll get rid of those bastards myself.\"\nHis determination had grown much more than before.\nHe didn't know why he got so mad after seeing the word apostle and domination trial next to one another, but it just… annoyed him.\nOnce he was back to normal though, he noticed that Lana was on the ground, her legs trembling, \"What's wrong, did you see a demon,\" he smiled mischievously, back to normal.\n\"I-I guess you can say so…\" she got up and smiled, happy that the Stark she liked was back.\n\"Heh~ I guess sneaking into my bed wasn't good enough for you, was it?\" he added.\n\"…\" and this time, she didn't have anything to say, \"Sorry, just felt… comfortable doing so.\"\nShe didn't tell him, but she had been doing that for the past week.\nWell… not that he would have cared, anyway.",

      "content": "Another week passed since Stark woke up from his sleep, which lasted two weeks, and since he had learned about the location of the apostles from the [ApostleDex].\nWhich means that 3 weeks passed since he left the [Corpse Cemetery], and one month since this entire trial started.\n[Three months left before second semester/trial]\nHe still had time to do whatever he wanted until then.\nBut to be honest, after everything that happened... he didn't feel like it, and it meant that he didn't feel like staying around doing nothing.\nAfter his talk with [Domination] and [Alchemist], after realizing that killing the apostles was basically a path that he quite literally couldn't avoid, after knowing that a third domination trial was coming…\nStark could only do one thing: become stronger.\nHe had already sold all the items he didn't need too, gaining him roughly 11.3 million rher coins, an incredible amount of cash since the items he had gotten this time were next level even among the usual standard.ù\nMuch like Fellarburg, the capital also regrouped different districts, well, basically the same ones to be honest, meaning that there wasn't much difference other than the location, and that the people here were much stronger.\n\"Thank you for the equipment,\" Violette smiled at him.\nYes, the very same appraiser he had always been using back there was also in this location for some reason.\n\"Are you… following me?\" he asked, raising his eyebrows.\n\"I got transferred here because apparently the student batch of this year of the 'rift conqueror' academy is the strongest, which attracts thousands of awakeners, haha~\" she giggled, seemingly so professional and well-known among appraisers that she was hired to go in different locations to appraise items.\n\"Oh, alright,\" she didn't seem to know Stark was in it, but it was fine for him.\nPlus… Violette when he first met her was around level 194 and from the 'Magus' class, meaning that she had been stronger than he was.\nAnd yet… in less than a few months, even though he was only level 70, he was already confident he could easily beat her if it came down to it, though it most likely would never happen as she was a very nice woman.\nBut if you want a rough estimate for the [Domination] class against all the others, you could take the domination user's level and multiply it by around 4 to 5 times their level to make it fair.\nMeaning that the current Stark could take down people at around level 250 if he managed to take them by surprise using his skills, and with enough determination he could do it even in a one on one.\nAnd that wasn't considering the fact Stark was a prodigy among prodigies, and that he had two lives, plus the [Superior Clone].\nSurely, no one in this academy, not even Sora who struggled against the warden and participated in the second domination trial with him, could even try to hurt him: they would all lose.\nBut in the end, it didn't matter.\nFwish!\nHe was currently eating lunch with Lana, which was a steak that he himself had prepared for them both.\n\"That's… amazing!\" Lana's eyes sparkled.\nShe had recently been spending her entire time in Stark apartment (he kicked her out when night came, though she was reluctant), and there wasn't much for him to do other than hangout since he wanted to take a little break from everything.\nSince his appearance in this world, it had only been fighting, fighting, and keep fighting, so maybe a small break wouldn't kill him.\nAfterward, though, he would try everything in his power to reach level 75 if not 80 if he could.\nUnlocking his next class was a priority after all!\nPlus, he needed to reach level 75 to be able to use a [Breakthrough stone] and climb all the way to [Gold] rank.\nAs said before, Domination works completely differently than any other class in that regard too.\nThere are 10 categories for rank: Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Ascendant, Prodigy, Immortal and Classified.\nAnd even though it only took Stark 25 levels between each rank, it was completely different for the others: it took them 100.\nYes, you heard that right, someone at the Iron-rank at the beginning could only reach Bronze upon hitting level 100, then silver would only be at level 200, and so on.\nMeaning that they would have to reach level 900 to be at the peak, a feat only a few people could do, and you could count them on your hands.\nBut for Stark, it would take him reaching level 225 to be at the top, and though it seemed smaller, the amount of experience needed surely would be unimaginable even to the current him.\n\"Are you okay?\" Lana asked as she noticed Stark deep in thought, scared he would go on a crazy rampage again.\n\"Hm… yeah,\" he took another bite of his steak, \"By the way, I think I'll be gone from two weeks to a month after tomorrow, I need to train.\"\n\"Oh…\" Lana looked sad once he said that, after all they had only just started hanging out recently for real, \"It's fine I guess, my father said that you have to be strong enough to protect me, after all!\"\nEven she didn't believe in that 'protection' bullshit since she could defend herself using her abilities, but right now… she just felt that it was right.\nWhat was her relationship with Stark, she wondered.\nThere was no denying it at this point: she had feelings for him, but what about him?\nIt was always fight, fight, fight… and he probably didn't think about her for a single instant while doing so, while on the contrary, she would keep thinking of him every day until he came back.\nDeath was never too far in this world, after all.\nBasically… she knew that her feelings were one-sided.\nAnd she wasn't wrong: Stark wasn't dense, he could sense it in the air, but he just refused to acknowledge it, as for him, it was all about the apostles and getting stronger now, especially not knowing when the next domination trial would happen.\nHe couldn't enjoy himself until he was confident that he was safe.\nAnd for now, the looming danger was still there, so getting close to anyone was a bad solution.\n\"Well, thanks for the meal,\" he nodded his head after finishing and took the plates.\nBut right as he did that…\nDing! Dong!\nStark froze for a moment, eyeing the entrance door.\nWho could this be?\nHe certainly had no friends at all, and no one should be visiting him.\nSomeone for Lana, maybe?\nHe walked toward the door.\nDing! Dong!\nAnd as he pulled it open, a familiar figure stood on the other side: Sora, the white-haired and emotionless beauty.\n\"Oh?\" Stark blinked in surprise, \"Hello?\"\nSora's expression remained neutral as she spoke, \"Hi, I just felt like visiting since I'm free for today.\"\n\"Sure,\" Stark replied with the same tone, both of them seemed as neutral as ever, making the conversation look robotic, \"Consider yourself home.\"\nIf Sora was here, it meant that she wanted to speak to him about something important alone, otherwise there was no other reason to come.\nAnd just as expected…\n\"I have something to talk about, I received it recently but didn't have the time to speak to you because I was busy,\" she looked at Stark while entering the apartment, making sure to remove her expensive shoes.\n\"Oh?\" Stark wanted to know, \"Just sit on the table then.\"\n\"Thanks,\" she bowed out of respect, then entered the living room.\nAnd what she saw there almost made her emotionless expression falter: she saw Lana sitting on the couch, looking at her.\n\"Oh! Sora!\" Lana beamed, genuinely happy to see her friend.\nBut Sora on the other hand… was annoyed.\n\"What are you doing here?\" she asked.\n\"Huh…\" Lana was taken aback by the question as you normally wouldn't ask that, \"Well… I just hang out with Stark since it's our break… you know?\"\n\"…Alright,\" that's all Sora answered before turning her back to her and sitting on the table, trying her hardest to shake off that annoying feeling she had in her mind.\nShe still didn't know what it was, but seeing Lana alone with Stark while she wasn't there angered her more than anything else.\nAnd after two minutes…\n\"Thanks for waiting,\" Stark placed a cup of grape juice in front of him and Sora, \"We can talk now, tell me.\"\nLana stayed on the couch, though, sensing that she didn't really have the power needed to sit on the table beside these two… monsters.\nSora didn't waste any time in going directly to the point though: she had come here for that, and although Lana's presence annoyed her for some reason, she still needed to inform Stark of 'THAT'.\n\"As the year president and member of the group that completed this semester's trial first, I got some kind of 'information',\" she spoke, emotionless as ever, and looked into Stark's eyes.\n\"Hm?\" Stark sipped into his juice.\n\"Well… I got a single piece of information about the next trial, apparently the chairman rewards those who complete the trial first with that as to help them.\"\n\"Oh?\" Stark was surprised, but it could definitely help, \"What is it?\"\n\"Well, I have received a panel around a week ago, it seemed as though I was the only one to get it for some reason though,\" Sora taped something in the air, probably at her screen.\nStark hadn't received anything, so it made sense.\nAnd so…\n\"Here, I'm transferring the information, read it for yourself,\" she taped a few more times then slid her finger toward Stark.\nDing!\nAnd so a new panel opened in front of him.\n[As the group that completed the trial first, you have received a few pieces of information concerning the next one!]\nThis made sense for now.\nBut… what came right after… almost made Stark spit out all his juice.\n[Second Semester Trial: The Colosseum.]",

      "content": "\"What… did you just say?\" Stark mumbled while deeply into Sora's eyes, taking her aback slightly as she didn't expect her friend to be this serious over a piece of information.\n\"I mean… the panel is right in front of you…\" Sora shrugged.\n\"…Right,\" Stark looked back at it, and immediately his eyes widened again.\n…\n[Second Semester Trial: The Colosseum.]\n[Basic Information: This will be an INDIVIDUAL task, meaning that you will be alone while completing it, get ready.]\n…\nThese were all the informations they got, nothing more, nothing less.\nBut if what was written here was true.\nThen…\nThe location of the fourth apostle from the second of the [ApostleDex] was just revealed to him.\n.\n[Line 2, Apostle 4]\n[Name: ???]\n[Level: ???]\n[Location: Last Floor (10) of the Colosseum]\n….\nThe apostle was at the last floor, maybe he was the final boss actually? Who knows!\n\"Alright,\" he nodded, \"Thank you, Sora, I can prepare something for you if you want?\"\nIt didn't look like it, but Stark was actually very good with his hands, and as he was an accountant who lived alone in his past life, cooking wasn't that strange to him.\n\"It's fine,\" but she shook her head, \"That is all that I wanted to say, I have to go back to business matters.\"\nSora was only 18, but she was already vice-president of several guilds under direct order of her father, and her strength was extremely useful to the family.\nOf course, her family didn't know about Stark or the domination trials, but if they found out their only daughter, who always acted emotionless and never approached anyone, was getting 'infatuated' to a random boy, then it would be a disaster.\n\"I'll be taking my leave,\" Sora got up from her seat, not touching her grape juice, then began heading toward the exit door.\n\"…\" Stark couldn't and didn't want to stop her, so he just followed.\nBut right as Sora was about to leave…\n\"Don't worry, Sora, we'll think you while we're having fun!\" Lana peeked out of the hall, a genuine smile on her face.\n'Thinking of me while you're having fun…' Sora looked down, a fire burning within her: she was annoyed, so annoyed in fact she almost wanted to stay here just to stop them from having 'fun'.\nYes, Sora misunderstood what Lana said, thinking they were having… um… the other kind of private fun.\nLana on the other hand never had such intentions to mock Sora, as she was her friend, but in the end it did sound like she was nagging her.\n\"Alright,\" Sora nodded with an emotionless expression as she opened the door and closed it behind her, \"You two have fun, then.\"\n\"Huh?\" Stark felt irritation in her voice, but it was Sora he was listening to, so he simply thought it was his imagination.\nClang!\nHe closed the door behind Sora, then went back inside his apartment.\n'Need to get stronger…' he thought, walking past Lana who was speaking to him, her voice muffled as his brain completely ignored it.\nHe now had the location of ALL the apostles from the second line of the [ApostleDex].\nThe first three were in the [Devil's Abyss], the fourth was in the [Colosseum] somewhere, and the crimson moons trio were in the domination trial.\nIf he ever wanted to know the location of the apostles at the third line, who should be the strongest of all, he would need to kill all those on the second.\nLana watched him intently, her eyes filled with confusion, as Stark sat on one of the chairs around the table and started thinking about something she didn't know.\nThis had happened several times these past few days, and each time it would take around an hour for Stark to go back to his normal self, any attempt to distract him didn't work.\nBut surprisingly, this time it didn't take more than ten minutes for Stark to come back.\nAnd once he did, he asked a simple question to Lana.\n\"Is there a 'Rift Storer Association' in the capital? Or at least somewhere where I could get stronger?\" he asked while looking at Lana.\n\"…?\" the blonde-haired girl was confused, \"Huh… yeah?\"\n\"NICE!\" Stark immediately got up from his seat, a wide smile on his face, \"Very nice!\"\n\"???\" Lana raised her eyebrows, then immediately she realized, \"Stark… wait a damn minute…\"\n\"What?\" Stark was already beginning to check out his [Spatial Inventory] to see if he had everything he needed.\n\"Don't tell me…\" Lana's eyes widened more, her pupils shaking.\n\"Hahahah!\" Stark could already see it, he could sense the feeling of growing stronger.\nOnly 5 levels until level 75 after all, which meant another class AND the possibility to break through to gold-tier!\nWith three months of break before the next academy semester, he had MORE than enough time to do whatever he wanted!\n\"You're planning to go inside a rift even in vacation?!\" Lana was flabbergasted, \"Even though we're having fun?!\"\n\"…\"\nAnd suddenly, Stark stopped everything he was doing to look at Lana with the most neutral of expressions.\n\"Lana, I like spending time with you, no denying it,\" that first sentence made her blush, \"But… no matter what, I need to get stronger.\"\n\"Why?! Why risk your life even though we're on break?!\"\n\"You wouldn't understand, but right now, it's either I risk my life and get stronger, or I die later anyway for being too weak.\"\n\"With your current strength y-you could definitely earn more than enough money! And I can help you too!\"\n\"Wouldn't work, I am forced to keep going no matter what, for I am the…\" Stark didn't finish his sentence.\nBut…\n[Talent: Chosen One].\n\"…Alright,\" Lana didn't want that, but she understood, she can't force him to stay either.\nShe was already happy she spent time with him, as he was always busy.\nAnd deep down, she knew, that no matter how many months or years, her mind would still force her to wait for Stark.\n\"I'm leaving tomorrow,\" he told her while approaching her and patting her head, \"Don't worry, I won't die, at least I hope.\"\n\"…\" Lana looked down, she really wanted to cry, but somehow she couldn't, the tears wouldn't pour out.\nMaybe because she didn't know about Stark's circumstances? Or because she knew that he was right in trying to become stronger, essentially because the academy year wasn't over and that it would become much harder later on.\nSo in the end…\n\"Okay,\" she smiled bitter sweetly, \"Do whatever you want!\"\n\"Thanks,\" he didn't need her approval, but it still was good she understood.\nAnd just like that, the day passed quickly, Stark spending the most amount of time possible with Lana, and even allowing her to lay beside him on his bed.\nTomorrow came, and so D-Day arrived.\n…\n\"Goodbye,\" she smiled as she waved at Stark, who was currently leaving the apartment, \"Please come back no matter what!\"\n\"I will, so even if a long time passes, know that I wouldn't die,\" he nodded, and she hugged him.\nAfter that quick embrace, he left his apartment and closed the door behind.\n\"…\" Stark didn't feel much, to be honest.\nTo him, all that mattered is to get stronger.\nIf he was sure to meet the apostles at some point, and if the third domination trial was looming over him, then he had no other choice.\nFor being the [Chosen One] is both a blessing, but also a curse.",

      "content": "Stark checked the location before hand, and so he hailed for a taxi to drive him to the [Training] district of the capital, a district much more popular and powerful than the one in the city he was in before.\n'Maybe I should buy a car…' he had more than enough money to do so, and he already knew how to do that from his past life.\nWho cares about driving licenses anyway?!\nIn the end though, it didn't matter, and he left the car after paying, the [Training] district before him.\nIn all regards it was pretty familiar to the one he went to before, though it was more populated, and you could sense it that the people in here weren't kidding.\nAnd you could clearly see it by the fact there weren't this many fights/dramas: why would strong people even bother with that?\nOnly a weak person would let their ego get to them after all, and that is why Stark never respected these other people, openly mocking them and beating them if they tried something.\nAfter passing the street with all the shops and people trying to form teams, Stark reached the building for the [Rift Storer Association], who seemed to be present everywhere in this world actually.\nThe building was bigger than the other one, which already as giant as three mansions, and so he went up to the lobby.\nThe general structure didn't change, and Stark headed toward the [Rifts] section, reaching the massive hall with all the different rifts in it.\n[Please choose the rift you want to enter!]\n[Warning! Those below recommended level won't be admitted inside a rift!]\nInside of the [Rift] section's giant room were many other halls, each leading to another place further inside the 'Rift Storer Association'.\nThe hall all the way to the right had the title [Level 10-25 Rift] above, the one next to it was [Level 25-50 Rift] and it continued like this until reaching [Level 225-250 Rift].\nWhich meant that there were 10 halls/rifts inside the [Rift] section, which people could access to hope to level up.\nAnd as for Stark… well…\n~FWISH~\nHe slowly began heading to the rift, meaning toward the rifts that are actually of higher level and more difficult.\nAt this point anything below level 175-200 wouldn't help, he needed more.\nBut in opposition to before, the further he went, then the more people there were.\nIt was obvious why: the capital ACTUALLY had strong people in it, since they needed to be strong to begin with to survive.\nMeaning that the most popular rifts in this place were the ones between level 175 and 225.\nOnce Stark reached the hall with the [Level 200-225] sign over it, it became increasingly difficult to navigate.\nBut even then he kept going.\nToo many people were present, meaning a harder time to level up or find monsters.\nHe needed something else, and so he moved to the last one.\nAnd… surprisingly…\n\"Huh?\" once he passed the [Level 200-225] section… there weren't any people at all, or at least a very small amount of them.\n\"What the?\"\nYes, once he reached the hall with the [Level 225-250] rift, there was almost no one there.\nWhy? You might ask, well…\n[Warning! Please do not take this rift if not prepared!]\n[This is a mistake, you WILL die! Do not take this rift!]\nThe barrier was half sealed with planks of wood and such, as if to give the feeling that no one should enter it. But the association had left an opening big enough for anyone who wanted to still go inside to pass.\n\"…\" literally no one was taking this rift.\nAnd so, that meant that Stark would be alone inside.\n'YEEPIE!' he was happy, since it meant more experience for himself, and in addition to that, taking on monsters above level 225 would mean enhancing his power.\nTo be honest, this was probably the BIGGEST jump in difficulty Stark would ever make until now.\nThe last rift he went through had monsters at a maximum level of 150.\nBut now… he would need to face some that had levels up to 250!\nWas it recklessness? Or just the urgency and need to get stronger fast.\nBecause to be honest, Stark had only ever struggled against the calamity apostle: even Lother, the boss one, was destroyed by Stark's clone alone, so there was no need to worry.\nBut it didn't matter, so Stark began to walk toward the hallway, trying to pass through the small opening the association left.\nAnd yet…\n~ZAP! BOOM!~\nThe crimson barrier that was set up around each of the halls activated again.\n'Oh yeah… that thing…' he sighed.\n[You are level 70, please do not attempt to enter this rift again!]\nAnyone below level 225 wasn't allowed in.\nBut Stark had already managed to pass the barrier twice before in his previous city, so why should he care?\nHe got up from the ground and headed toward it again, this time activating his aura as to push through it.\nHe could sense the judgmental stares from the people who tried to head to the hall right next to his, or were just speaking: they were all thinking if that kid was crazy, some even mocking him.\nA mere level 70 trying to enter a rift higher than the one they were entering? HELL NO!\nStark didn't mind though, and right as he was about to push through the barrier using his aura like he always did… he was suddenly stopped, a hand landing on his shoulder.\n\"…\"\n\"You shouldn't do this, kid,\" a middle-aged man spoke, but Stark didn't bother to turn around to see his appearance.\n\"Y-Yeah, are you crazy?! Didn't you read the signs, plus you're level 70!\" a woman spoke beside him.\n\"Wait… maybe he's trying to commit suicide?\" a third theorized.\n\"…\" Stark didn't respond, \"Am I free to go now?\"\nHe surrounded his body with aura, and instinctively, the man that held his shoulder removed his hand.\n\"What the…\" he mumbled as for a split second, a zap went through his body, as if his aura was toxic to the touch.\n~FWISH~\nStark continued walking, positioning himself in front of the barrier, then pushing through.\n[WARNING! WARNING! YOU AREN'T ALLOWED!]\nThe sounds were becoming so loud that most people began looking at Stark, and even those on the other side of the [Rift] section came to check it out.\n[WARNING…]\nThe barrier resisted, but Stark pushed through, surrounding his entire body with aura.\n[WAR…NING… DANG…EROUS… RIFT…]\n~SNAP, CRACK~\nThe barrier gave in as even with all these attempts, and Stark's arms were still beginning to go through it, essentially deciding fighting this human wasn't worth it.\nIf he died, then so be it.\n~FWISH~\nHe phased through, then looked back at all the people, who's jaws quite literally dropped to the ground.\nLevel 70 allowed to enter this rift?! The most dangerous one in this association, too?! Was this a joke?!\n\"Oh wow, looks like I'm allowed to pass,\" he sarcastically said as he shrugged his arms, then turned around again.\n~ZAP~\nSeveral people after him tried to repeat what he had done, believing there was something faulty in the barrier, but alas, none of those below level 225 were allowed in.\nMeaning… that this kid was different, and that he was hiding lots of things.",

DO NOT GO!]\n[EVEN CLASSIFIERS THAT ARE LEVEL 250 AREN'T ADVISED TO ENTER]\n[This rift was placed here but wasn't supposed to be this difficult, the difficulty is \"Determination\"!]\n[CALAMITY BOSS INSIDE!]\nDozens of signs were placed all around the portal, instructing anyone foolish to have gotten here to back away.\nAnd to be honest, after remembering Lana's words about not needing to risk your life for no reason, he did indeed feel like it was futile to go this far even though none of the other classifiers did that.\nBut… once he closed his eyes…\nThe image of the [Crimson Moons Trio] appeared before him, all looking at him with their single pupil, their giants body judging him.\nThis sent a shiver down his spine but also… determination!\n\"If I can't beat that rift, these things are going to absolutely destroy me,\" this was what he thought at that moment, remembering the overwhelming despair he felt when seeing them for the first time.\nAnd so he jumped inside, not caring about anything else.\n…\nFwish!\nStark traveled through dimensions, after a few seconds landed on solid ground.\nFwish! Thud!\nIt had become a habit, so he immediately lifted his gaze to look around.\nAnd the first thing he noticed was…\nSnow, there was snow everywhere.\nIt was even pouring down from above, the grey sky filled with clouds, the small snowflakes visible.\nThe floor was made of dirt, but it was white in color because of the snowy texture.\nThough it wasn't actually thick enough to make a difference.\nBasically, the snow in itself wouldn't disturb him because there was only a small amount of it, only enough to cover the surface.\nAnd so, soon enough he received the panel he had been waiting for.\nDing!\n….\n[Welcome to the \"Sunken Valley\"!]\n[Difficulty: Determination]\n[Number of classifiers: 1]\n[You are in the first zone: \"The Descent\"!]\n[Good Luck!]\n[Tip because of low level: watch out for the snake and ape, you won't win against them.]\n…\nThis was all the information he would get.\nThe name of the rift was 'Sunken Valley', and once Stark actually took the time to observe more, he noticed that behind here were walls blocking his escape: the only path was forward.\nAnd what was forward you might ask…\nWell…\n[First Zone: The Descent]\nIn front of was a massive ravine delimited by two giant mountains that were impossible to climb, so all he could was go down.\nThus the title \"The Descent\" for the first zone: he needed to go all the way down, and just by looking from his current position, he couldn't see the bottom.\n[Rift Zone Number: 4]\nThis was a small amount of them, but if every zone was as big and time-consuming as this one, then it would take him hours upon hours for each.\nWas this why this rift was locked up?\nOr was the worst to come?\nIn the end, it didn't matter.\nStark peeked at the void below from above, and he noticed several rocky platforms set along the edges of the ravine, making it possible to go down slowly by parkouring.\n\"…Alright,\" he didn't know what awaited for him down below, but going into the unknown abyss made him anxious.\nThough not enough to stop him.\nBut, even if the wanted to leave…\n\"Hm…\" the exit portal was gone.\n[Rift Type: No Return]\nJust like a [Normal] rift or [One-Classifier] one like [Sierra's Death Path], this rift was one where you couldn't go back once you entered, which is why it had been locked by the association for being too dangerous.\nBut there were many other reasons why, and Stark would soon find out about them.\n\"Let's go, I guess,\" he mumbled as he jumped from the top of the valley into a platform attached to the rocky wall of the ravine.\nDebris fell once he hit the ground, and Stark made a mental note to be careful as any of these things could fall at any point.\nNothing much happened afterward as Stark made his way down the ravine, parkouring his way from one rocky platform to the next. He had to be careful not to slip, as the fall would be fatal.\nAs he descended, he noticed that the snow was getting thicker, and the wind was picking up.\nThe visibility was getting worse, and he could barely see the platforms in front of him as the darkness of the abyss was slowly taking over: the only thing aiding him was the white color of the snow.\nBut even with that, Stark didn't see how this was difficult, as any classifier above level 200 should be able to manage this much.\nBut the moment he thought about that, he received an answer.\n~FWISH~\nHe heard a sound behind him.\nAnd when he quickly turned around…\n\"…!\"\nA dozen arrows were in front of him.\n\"SHIT!\"\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" he rolled away, but was hit by one of the arrows in his shoulder, \"Argh…\"\n\"-17621!\"\nNot that much damage, but it still hurt.\n~FWOOSH~\nHe removed the arrow from his shoulder quickly, hurting him a bit more, but it didn't matter.\n[+2 EGO]\nOh and yeah, the one week cooldown for EGO had ended, so he was now able to use it again!\n[EGO Meter: 2/100]\n~FWISH~\nMore arrows rushed toward him, and Stark activated [Time Vision] to pinpoint where all his enemies were since the arrows came from different directions.\n~CLICK, CLICK, CLICK~\nHe darted his eyes everywhere, taking notes of where all the monsters were, and after he saw them all, he deactivated the skill, taking him less than a second to do that.\n~FWISH~\nHe avoided all the arrows easily now that he knew where they came from, then he looked at the different locations.\nWhat was shooting him were a bunch of human-sized monkeys with bows in their hands, each standing on a different platform, either above him or below.\nYes, this was pretty much all, they didn't look that strong to begin with, and they didn't have any clothes, only their brown fur.\nThough by looking at their faces, it seemed as though they were incredibly intelligent, easily wielding their bows and throwing two arrows at the same time.\nOne of them even had glasses!\n~FWISH~\nThey launched another barrage of arrows, but Stark this time began to run.\nThe platforms were actually abundant at this part of the 'descent' zone, and so that meant he could parkour to the monsters easily if he managed not to fall.\nSince falling = death.\n\"PERCEPTION,\" he decided to check them out while running though.\n…\n[Name: Sniper Monkeys]\n[Level: 220]\n[HP: 260000]\n[Strength: 4631]\n[Stamina: 14628]\n[Speed: 8790]\n[Defense: 3725!]\n[Skills: Arrow Shot, Bow Strike, Ultimate Arrow…]\n…\nThese were the first monsters that were over level 200 he fought, but there didn't seem to be that much difference.\nSure, they had double the HP of a common monster, even though they were common too, and their stats were comparable to those of an elite from before, but they only had three skills!\n'So they can only shoot when far, and attack with their bows from close-range, huh…'\nThe main difficulty with these things was the fact that they ALWAYS kept running away no matter what, and that if the classifier in question didn't have good agility or speed, he would be fucked as he would never be able to catch up.\nBasically, the monkeys' strategy was to play like cowards.\nThey were just hoping for one good strike to end the classifier in question.\nBut…\n[Spatial Inventory!]\nHe pulled two speed potions and drank them, as well as three [Crystal Stun Potions], keeping them in one of his hands.\n\"Crimson Spears!

He knew that he couldn't afford to lose focus now.\nHe quickly jumped from platform to platform, trying to continue this momentum by heading toward one of the remaining monkeys.\nHe found his next target, and began following it, gaining distance on it slowly.\n\"HRIISK-!\" it seemed to be the slowest monkey as Stark was actually faster than it.\nAs he got closer, he tightened the grip around the three vials in his hands, ready to throw them.\nBut…\n\"HIKHIKHIK!\" the monkey, sensing that its life was in danger, used everything it had and began running against one of the stone walls of the valley, toward a platform way farther.\n'Shit,' Stark knew he couldn't jump all the way there, and stopping would mean losing his momentum and some of his adrenaline.\nAnd so… he did the unthinkable: he copied it.\nWhen he reached the very edge of the platform he was in, he looked ahead, and ALSO began running against the wall, doing a flawless wall run while following the monster.\nAnd so, when the monkey dropped on the ground of the next rock platform, thinking it was safe, it looked behind it and…\nIt saw Stark in the air, who had used the wall as a jumping pad to get above the sniper.\n\"Hik-\"\n~FWISH, SPLASH~\nHe threw all three [Crystal Stun Potions] at it, its speed not allowing it to avoid them from such short distance.\nThe vials shattered upon impact, releasing a cloud of white fog that enveloped the monkey.\n['Sniper Monkey' has been stunned!]\nStark adjusted quickly to take advantage of this opportunity.\nWhile still in the air, he positioned his two legs and using the momentum of his jump smashed his feet against the stunned monkey's face and slammed its head into the hard ground below.\n~SPLASH~\nIts head literally exploded until Stark's feet, leaving a puddle of blood under them.\n\"Argh… my shoes…\" Stark was disgusted.\n~FWISH, FWISH~\nWith a single movement of his head he avoided 6 arrows that came at him, and noticed that the other two were together at the very opposite of where he was.\nThey were probably thinking that Stark couldn't reach them, and that he would grow tired at some point, right?\nBut… that would not knowing him.\n\"Crimson Ball Transmission!\" he summoned the ball in his hand and threw it with all his might toward the platform the monkeys stood on as they had the high ground.\nBut he wasn't the only one planning something.\n\"ULTIMATE ARROW!\" the monkeys used their [Legendary] skill, and yes, these monsters actually had one.\nThe arrow they were holding on their bow began to glow with silver aura, its tip glinting ominously, as if ready to track Stark.\nAnd deep down…\n[Warning! Warning! Warning!] he knew that these arrows were bad news, especially with TWO of them coming.\nHe didn't know if his shot with the crimson ball would work, but if it didn't, he would need to be ready to sacrifice one of his lives.\nHe kept focusing on the [Crimson Ball] though, paying no mind to the ultimate arrows coming.\nAnd once he felt that the moment was right…\n~SNAP, FWISH, FWISH~\nHe snapped his fingers, immediately teleporting out of his spot.\nAnd at the same time, the monkeys released their bows, the arrows they launched quite literally exploding, and in less than a fraction of a second hit the platform Stark had been in mere moments ago, exploding it as well.\n\"Hihihihi!\"\n\"Kakaka!\"\nThe monkeys cheered, thinking they had eliminated the human.\nBut…\n\"Very bad aim,\" they heard a voice behind them, and saw the human in the air above them as he teleported, \"Good bye.\"\n~SLAM~\nHe kicked both monkeys out into the abyss, killing them both since, y'know, he wasn't the only one that risked death by falling from this height.\nAnd so he managed to finish his first (and only encounter) in the first zone.\nThe main goal of this zone was actually to quite literally just ignore the monkeys: the challenge was to keep going while avoiding the arrows that were relentlesly sent toward you.\nThe system didn't expect there to be anyone crazy enough to try and follow the monkeys, especially with their speed who was higher than an average level 225-250.\nYou could say Stark found his OWN way of doing it, since for him defeating monsters was always the right choice.\nThat is actually one of the reasons why they only had three skills: they weren't meant to be fought.\n\"Phew…\" he sighed as he looked around, making sure there weren't any more surprises.\nAnd then.\n~DING, DING, DING~\n[You have slain \"Sniper Monkey lv220\", gained 340,000 EXP!]\n[You have slain \"Sniper Monkey lv220\", gained 342,000 EXP!]\n.\n.\n[You have slain \"Sniper Monkey lv220\", gained 341,000 EXP!]\nAnd so…\n[+2,043,000 experience!]\nHe got over 2 million EXP from that simple fight.\nMonsters above level 200 were truly a blessing when it came to helping you level up, though you needed to defeat them for that to happen.\nUnfortunately though, Stark didn't level up.\n[Experience: 3,603,000/3,690,000]\nSo close, yet so far.\nAnd so he needed to keep going if he wanted to get to level 75, which was the goal of this entire 'operation'.\nAfter the monkeys died, nothing came disturbing him as he parkoured from platform to platform, slowly going down the valley.\nIt took him thirty minutes, sure, but they were pretty peaceful and without any issues as the monkeys were the ONLY monsters and challenge of this zone.\nAnd so… in the end…\n~THUD~\nHe managed to end on the ground at the very bottom of the ravine, able to see the corpses of the three monkeys he had sent away, all crushed.\nAnd then…\n~FWISH, DING~\n[Second Zone: Path to the Bridge]",

Immolation?!\"\nHe truly didn't know how these things could do that, but oh well.\nStark got into position, making sure to keep the energy ball close to him as it floated in the air to be able to see.\nBut as if to confirm his previous question…\n\"STUN SALIVA!

CRIMSON SPEARS!\"\nAll this happened in less than half of a second, but basically: Stark summoned his five spears, then immediately threw one at the group of three monsters in front of him, momentarily stopping them as they were pierced.\n\"-98371! -102371! -97483!\"\nThe three crimson fists on the other hand were sent at the back, hitting the monster's tongue as they were the ones that used [Tongue Lash], burning it.\n\"-300000! -300000!\" and most interesting of all: they received the entirety of their health in one go the moment Stark hit their tongues.\nMeaning… that it was their weakness.\nIt was rare for monsters to have such an obvious weakness, and even more when the simple action of hitting that weakness was enough to instantly one shot them, but oh well, maybe it was to adjust the difficulty.\nAfter all, the cave would be totally dark under normal circumstances.\n\"SPATIAL INVENTORY,\" and to fight the last remaining group, meaning the two above that were currently dropping, their mouths opened, revealing their disgusting tongues, and their claws ready to slash…\n~FWISH~\nStark put his hand inside his inventory and with lightning speed pulled two [Crystal Stun Potions], instantly launching them above without even looking.\n~BAM, BAM~\nThe potions hit the monster's mouth, and precisely their tongue.\n[Weakness hit with 'Crystal Stun Potion'!]\n~DING~\nAnd yet again, the monsters fell to the ground, exploding their hands against the rock as stunning their tongue was literally just as bad as hitting it, meaning instant death.\n\"Huh…\" and so, knowing that, Stark didn't hesitate a single second to pull out four more potions, throwing three of them at the monsters above, killing them as well.\nAnd as for the last one… he just looked down.\n\"KRAAA!\" the final [Tongue-Claw Ambush] finally emerged, thinking that its friends were doing a good job distracting the human.\nAnd yet…\n\"Kra?\" as it lifted its head, it just saw Stark look down at it, its friend's corpses all around, \"…\"\n~BAM~\nHe dropped the last potion on it, and it died instantly too.\n\"Phew…\" the small golden ball beside him was still working, and so he could see around him.\nBut before that…\n~DING! DING! DING!~\n[You have slain \"Tongue-Claw Ambush\", gained 376,200 EXP!]\n[You have slain \"Tongue-Claw Ambush\", gained 374,500 EXP!]\n.\n.\n[You have slain \"Tongue-Claw Ambush\", gained 377,600 EXP!]\n~DING~\n[Your level has increased to level 71, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Experience: 2,929,300/3,750,000]\nOnly one level, but thankfully enough he got enough experience to almost reach the next one too, meaning that it was worth it.\nAt this point, monsters below level 150, or even 200, wouldn't cut it anymore in terms of experience.\nStark REALLY needed stronger monsters, especially ones that would grant him tons of EXP, and that were actually possible to defeat.\nBut in the end it didn't matter much as he continued his journey through the small cave, easily following the path and not bumping into any walls thanks to the golden ball that emitted light.\nAnd after around five minutes, where he yet again didn't meet any more monsters (just like the sniper monkeys, these 8 monsters were actually the sole monsters of this zone since it was small to begin with).\nBut yet again, the simple fact that it was this \"EASY\" made Stark even more suspicious.\n~FWISH~\nHe saw the exit of the cave, and successfully managed to leave, the sky now visible again as he was back at the ravine.\nThis was the entire second zone, yes.\nFirst zone had 6 [Sniper Monkeys], second zone had 8 [Tongue-Claw Ambushes].\nLiterally what was the catch with this rift?\nHe was currently at the third zone, meaning more than halfway through the rift, yet he didn't see anything worthy of restraining and blocking its access to anyone.\nTo be honest, he didn't even see why it would be from the [Determination] difficulty.\nWas he too strong? Or were all the others too weak?\nHe didn't know, but surely… there would be something.\nAnd Stark was right!\n~FWISH~\nHe emerged from the cave and took a look at where he was.\nAnd…\n[Third Zone: The Sunken Bridge]\nIn front of him was a massive wooden bridge in extremely bad shape, though still full, allowing anyone to pass through if they dared.\nBelow was the void, complete void, and anyone who fell would immediately die.\nStark didn't know if it was the same void from his [Void] skill, but even if it wasn't, it was still terrifying to think about the fact that a single wrong step could lead to… whatever awaits below.\nFor no one knows what is inside the void.\nIt is death, true, but what causes this death?\n\"Hm…\" Stark kept looking for a few minutes before slapping both his cheeks and deciding to not pussy out right now, \"Maybe it's because too many people fell for no reason?\"\nHe theorized of a reason as to why this rift who closed, but even then, it didn't make sense.\nIn the end, it didn't matter, and he guessed that it would probably be the boss that was the issue.\nAt least he tried to reassure himself, because if it wasn't the boss… then…\n\"Hm…\" he slapped himself for a second time.\nFor some reason he kept having that bad feeling inside of him, that bad feeling he always got when something was amiss, that sense of dread he got when he knew that something horrifying was about to happen.\nBut even when he looked around him for five more minutes, nothing happened.\nWhat could be that feeling…\n[Just go, damn it]\n\"Alright, alright,\" Stark arrived in front of the bridge.\nIt was creaking and constantly moving because of the wind, making it seem as though it would all fall apart at ANY point.\nBut even then.\n~CREAK~\nStark took a first step, and immediately…\n~DING~\n[Do not run, whatever you do, don't try, you will not reach the end.]\n\"I mean… that bridge is giant, so it would take me around 10 to 15 seconds to reach the end even for me…\" this was just how big it was, at least two or three kilometers in size.\nSo running wasn't an option, as it would immediately collapse under the weight and impact.\n~THUD, THUD~\nInstead, Stark needed to walk carefully and slowly, calculating each of his steps as to not pass through one of the holes in the planks.\nTwo minutes passed like that, minutes where Stark just carefully made sure to find the safest way to get to the end.\nAnd.\nWhen he reached the end, when he reached the middle point of the bridge…\nIT happened.\n~BOOM~\nIt wasn't the bridge exploding, or anything in the environment, but Stark's aura itself.\nAt this point, the alarms in his head were ringing so loudly that they were hurting his head.\n[WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!]\n[GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!]\nStark's heart was pounding so hard that he could feel it in his throat.\nThe alarms in his head were still going off, and he couldn't shake the feeling that something was very, very wrong.\nHe tried to calm himself down, taking deep breaths and focusing on the present moment.\nBut it was no use: the feeling was too great, and he couldn't help but feel like something terrible was about to happen.\nSensing that staying still wouldn't do anything, Stark decided to continue to walk across the bridge, as it was better than just waiting for whatever horror was awaiting him.\nYet even then, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.\nHe turned his head, scanning the darkness below him, but saw nothing.\nHe shook it off and continued on his way.\nA mere fifteen seconds passed between that.\nAnd right afterward… the true horrors of this world revealed themselves to Stark.\nOut of the corner of his eye, he saw something moving.\nIt was faint at first, just a shadow against the darkness of the void below him. But as he looked closer, he realized that it wasn't just a shadow – it was something massive and terrifying rising from the depths of the abyss.\nHis heart skipped a beat as he realized what it was – a creature unlike anything he had ever seen before.\nIt was at least fifty times his size, with scales as white as snow and eyes that glowed with an otherworldly light. It seemed to be made of shadows themselves, flickering in and out of existence as it rose higher and higher into the air.\nAnd when it fulled revealed itself… Stark realized that it was a giant snake, and it was looking directly at Stark, knowing of his presence.\nA snake… that directly came from the void…?",

still have leftovers.\n\"What… the… fuck…\" Stark wanted to back away, but he was stuck on the bridge, and the creature was directly looking at him anyway, its red pupils on him.\n\"Oh…\"\nIT SPOKE?!\n\"If it isssn't our little friend… chosssen one…\" it seemed to mock him too.\nBut the simple fact it knew about his [Domination] code name terrified him.\nIts aura was out of this world, and Stark's couldn't even compete, even if he doubled or even tripled his.\n\"Well… it ssseems that you are quite ssschoked,\" it said, its forked tongue whistling for each S.\n\"What… are you…\"\nBut even then, Stark's determination was still there, though just a bit.\nAnyone else while seeing that thing would piss themselves, or even think that jumping out into the void was the best solution (though the snake would probably just go down to devour them), but not Stark.\nHe truly wanted to hold his ground, but he knew it wasn't possible against that thing, not at this current level at least.\n\"Do not worry… chosssen…\" the snake spoke.\n\"…\" does it mean that it wouldn't kill him?\n\"I will try to make your death asss painful asss possssible…\" what could only be considered as a smile appeared on its face while it opened its mouth, revealing its fangs.\nThat thing could probably swallow him by mistake and not even realize it, based on how big its throat was.\n'Focus… Stark… calm down…' Stark kept looking at the snake directly while it seemed amused of the human's fear.\nAnd so, at this moment of calm, while he still had the time, he decided to use a skill.\n\"PERCEPTION!\" he used it on the white snake before him.\nBut…\n~DING~\n[Not high enough level, most information: HP, attributes and skills will be hidden]\n…\n[Name: The Great Serpent (Godless Demon Apostle)]\n[Level: 820]\n[Rank: Universal]\n[Note: you will die, don't even try to fight or look at it, run.]\n…\n\"U-Universal…!?\"\nThis is two ranks above the strongest monster Stark ever fought, who was Reaper, a calamity-level apostle.\nAnd in addition to that… the [Great Serpent] was also an apostle as well.\nHow did that thing end up in here was the real question.\nA level 800 in a level 225 rift is pure insanity, and it should definitely be categorized as [Death] instead of [Determination]!\n\"Why are you ssscared, chosssen?\" the great serpent asked.\n\"I… I'm not scared of you,\" this was technically true: Stark was just overwhelmed by his aura.\n\"Oh?\" the snake's eyes widened a bit, but he quickly retrieved his confidence, \"Then die, chosssen.\"\nThe serpent slowly approached Stark, stopping right in front of the boy, its mouth wide open, \"You've causssed enough issssues asss it isss, godlesssss wantssss you gone.\"\n\"What the-\"\nStark didn't have the time to understand anything that was happening.\nA level 800 [Universal] apostle stood in front of him while he was supposed to be in a level 225 rift, coming out of the void, and now it was speaking about killing him because the 'godless demon' wanted him dead?\nDid the [Godless Demon] know of Stark's existence already?!\nThis was all his line of thought could reach as with speed impossible to reach by the boy, the serpent backed away, then rushed toward him, its mouth opened.\n\"GRAND BITE!\" it used one of its most basic skills, and yet it was enough to crush Stark's hopes to retaliate.\n\"TOO FAST-\" it was like a blur even with Stark's incredible [Perception], which surpassed even the other domination users'.\nAnd so, he was forced to use one of his skills.\n\"DODGE CONTROL!\"\n~CRUNCH~\nThe great serpent's mouth closed in on him (and the bridge), and the apostle laughed out loud as it believed to have gotten rid of the human that had been killing its companions one after the other.\n\"Thisss wasss easssy…\"\nBut… of course it wouldn't work, Stark had activated [Dodge Control] after all!\n~FWISH~\nRight as the mouth closed in on him and the part of the bridge he stood on, he quite literally teleported away from the attack's range, saved by his skill, then began rushing at intense speed toward the exit, not caring about the warning to not run.\n\"…!\" it took the serpent a single second to realize that the human was still alive, and so it began following him at lightning speed, catching up to him almost instantly.\n~BOOM, CRASH~\nThe bridge was falling apart behind him, and every step he took resulted in more of the planks that were holding it all together to fall into the void.\n~FWISH, BOOM~\nIn addition to that, the [Great Serpent] kept trying to crash into the bridge over and over, trying to destroy Stark's way of getting to the other side, yet he would always somehow teleport out of any attack's range, and then land perfectly at a safety spot.\n\"WHAT?\" even the serpent was confused, this shouldn't be possible, no matter how high Stark's level is!\nHe had been given a simple order by his lord Godless: kill the human known as the chosen one, as he poses an actual threat to him since he was the only one seeking to kill all the apostles to reach him.\nAnd yet… that human was avoiding all his attacks easily? Almost as if the serpent wasn't even a threat to him?!\n\"GET BACK HERE, YOU LITTLE SSSHIT!\"\n'Fuck fuck fuck fuck,' on the other hand, in comparison to what the serpent believed, Stark's thoughts were filled with anxiety and fear of falling or getting killed.\nHe would manage to avoid everything thanks to [Dodge Control], but it was still terrifying since even though his body instantly adjusted to avoid the attacks, his eyes and mind couldn't even follow them.\nAnd so, 15 seconds passed just like that.\n'Only 100 meters left…' he was this close to passing the bridge, a small opening in the wall ahead available for him to pass through: it was his safety net, for if he managed to pass that, then the apostle wouldn't be able to follow.\n~DING~\n[15 seconds have passed, 'Dodge Control' has been deactivated!]\n'SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT,' he had forgotten about that.\nBut thankfully enough, the serpent was thinking of something else: \"If the human is going to avoid all my attacksss, then I might assss well make him fall into the void…\"\nAnd with that thinking in its head, the apostle immediately headed toward the end of the bridge, its giant body peeking out from the darkness of the void, giving Stark no idea just how big that thing truly was.\n~CRUNCH~\nIt bit the end of the bridge, then watched in joy as it saw the ENTIRE bridge collapse, resulting in the human falling.\nAnd yet… Stark didn't give up this time either.\n\"CRIMSON BALL TRANSMISSION,\" while falling into the void, Stark focused his entire energy into the crimson ball in his hand then threw it toward the ending platform of the third zone.\nAt this point it was all or nothing, and to add to the pressure, the serpent immediately dashed under the falling Stark, opening its mouth wide, ready to swallow him once he entered its domain (the void below).\n\"COME ON, PLEASE,\" Stark begged as he observed the crimson ball, hoping that he had calculated the trajectory right.\nEither he succeeds, or he enters the void and gets devoured.\nFailure wasn't an option at this point.\n-----------------------------------\nThe code can be redeemed by 10 different users with 10 FPs/user.

He knew that this was his last chance, his only hope of survival.\nThe ball seemed to hang in the air for an eternity before finally connecting with the platform.\nAs stated before, the crimson ball doesn't bounce at all, so the moment it hit the ground…\n~DING~\n[Target set, teleportation is safe!]\n\"GOT YOU!\" Stark at this point was within range from the serpent's mouth, beginning to enter it.\nAnd so…\n~SLAM~\nIt closed its mouth on Stark.\nFor a moment, all the boy could see was darkness, and the laugher echoing from inside the serpent terrified him.\nBut…\n~SNAP~\nInstantly, faster than ever the giant snake could act, Stark teleported out of its mouth and materialized on the platform at the end of the bridge.\nHe didn't even take the microsecond it took him to usually adjust to his new surroundings this time: he immediately dashed toward the small hole below, and slid down.\nYet again, it didn't even take more than a single second for the apostle to realize it had been fucked for the second time, and so using all of its speed, moving instantly, almost as fast as the crimson ball, it opened its mouth and rushed toward Stark as he slid down under the hole.\n\"…\" the timing was so close that even a delay of a tenth of a second would have resulted in Stark's body to be cut in half, or at least crushed.\nBut thankfully enough…\n~FWISH~\nHe managed to slide down, and the serpent hit the wall instead.\n\"NO, NOT POSSSSIBLE-\" the serpent was absolutely enraged, and so it assaulted the wall that protected Stark as he emerged on the other side several times.\n~BAM, BAM, BAM~\nNormally its sheer size and strength would be able to take out any walls, yet this one was SPECIFICALLY designed so that the apostle couldn't get out if a human ever passed the third zone.\nMeaning… that Stark had won.\n\"You… ah, forget about it,\" the serpent growled as it backed away, then its body slowly descended back into the void, its piercing crimson pupils staring intently at the human, \"You will die, chosssen, do not forget.\"\nAnd so it disappeared from view.\n~FWISH~\nSilence.\nThere was complete silence now that the apostle was gone.\n'Fuck…' Stark dropped to the ground on one knee, breathing in and out repeatedly.\nThis was, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the worst experience he had EVER gotten during his time in this world.\nThat thing was probably why this rift was ranked [Determination].\nBut it still didn't make sense: if the serpent was always there to begin with, then why did he speak about getting orders to eliminate him?\nMaybe… all the apostles knew about him?\nUp until now, the ones he fought and killed probably all believed he was just one of the many humans trying to challenge them.\nBut now… if all of them knew that he was an [Apostle Slayer], then…\n\"Hm, doesn't matter,\" Stark rested five minutes before getting back up.\nAt this point he just wanted to go home, and seeing how badly shaped he was, Lana would surely scold him while saying that she was in the right and that he should have listened to her, which was kind of true.\nBut how could he know he would meet such a… thing?!\n~DING~\n[Congratulations, you have survived an encounter against the 'Great Serpent', one of the most powerful apostles of all, you should be happy!]\n\"Happy…?\"\nStark didn't see how he could feel that way at this very moment.\nFor him, all of this was bad: the serpent was too fast, so fast in fact his eyes couldn't follow it even though its body was giant, and let's not talk about its strength and aura, easily overwhelming him.\nHe had fought the monsters and apostles gradually up until now, but now that he saw that difference in level, he knew that getting stronger was the only way to keep going.\nBecause… at some point… he would have to fight that thing again, at least if he wanted to complete his [ApostleDex].\nOh! And talking about [ApostleDex], Stark decided to open it to check it out.\n5x3 again, first line fully completed, the second line's figures completely dark except for the [Crimson Moons Trio], and he knew of their locations anyway.\nBut now that he met with the [Great Serpent]… Stark looked at the third line.\nAnd just as expected, the third square of the third line revealed itself to be the [Great Serpent], its figure now visible to him as he saw it in real life.\n\"Hm…\" this meant that before it were two apostles who were weaker.\nBut also… that there were two that are stronger.\nStark felt utter despair: how long would it take for him to finally be able to reach the necessary level to win?\nMonths? Years? Never?\nWho knows.\nBut right as he got up… another notification appeared before him.\n[Despair level is very high, let us change that!]\n~DING~\n[Please do check the \"Great Serpent's\" square.]\n\"Huh?\" Stark, while now standing up, clicked on the third square of the third line, which revealed the white snake.\nAnd suddenly…\n~FWISH~\n….\n[Name: The Great Serpent (Godless Demon Apostle)]\n[Level: 820]\n[Rank: Universal]\n…\n\"Yeah…?\" this seemed normal, as it was the information he had already gotten.\nBut… Stark noticed a new line below it all.\nAnd it was…\n[The Great Serpent has a special weakness that can kill it almost instantly, look for that.]\n\"Oh?\"\nTo be honest, Stark wouldn't usually believe that such a giant and powerful thing could have a hidden weakness, a weakness so powerful against it that it could kill it instantly.\nBut… after remembering about the many times monsters or even bosses were overwhelmed by their weaknesses… then maybe it was possible.\nLet's take example of this rift and the previous one Stark went through!\nThe [Sniper Monkey]'s weakness was their head and close combat, killing them really fast if they were hit, the [Tongue-Claw Ambushes] on the other hand would INSTANTLY die if their tongues were hit too.\nAnd as for the previous rift, the [Corpse Cemetery], well the weakness was obvious: all the undead in it would instantly if Stark used his [Exorcist] attack, and even [Reaper] and [Lother] were easily defeated once by an attack.\nEvery monster has a weakness, all you needed to do was to find and exploit it.\n\"…Oh well,\" now that Stark knew this, he put it at the back of his mind to remember and try to look for it when possible.\nBut now… he needed to go forward, as resting in this place forever wouldn't do anything, though it did seem to be like some kind of safe zone as no monster spawned or could reach him here.\nAround him were stone walls, and all he could see what the sky above him.\nAnd right in front of him… at the place he needed to go to… was a black fog.\nYes, this was the entrance to the boss zone, which was the fourth.\nHe had survived the first two zones easily, and the third almost killed him, but he couldn't forget that he still needed to beat the boss to leave.\nAnd now you might ask, what kind of boss could be waiting in a [Determination] rift, right?\nWell… only one way to find out.",

10 remain]\nAnd what actually confirmed what he feared the most… was that two of the figures were actually visible.\nThe first was… three giant moons in the sky with a single massive eye on them.\n\"Ohoh~\"\n\"Heh~\"\n\"He's back!\"\nIt was the [Crimson Moons Trio].\nAnd the second…\n\"You got away human, but now, you shall die before our eyesss,\" it was the [Great Serpent] he made less than ten minutes ago.\nThe other 8 figures didn't speak, or move, or do anything, they just stared at the human, their eyes visible.\nBut suddenly…\n~FWISH~\nA pair of massive eyes, one oddly familiar, appeared above all of the apostles, a crimson vortex of aura spinning in them.\nIt was…\n\"Oh… Chosen…\"\nIt was…\n'HOLY FUCK!'\n\"=(\"\nIt was…\n\"Aren't you the one that wanted this?\" the massive figure, the boss of the apostles, asked, \"Then… why are you scared?\"\nIt was the [Godless Demon] himself.\nHis sole presence was enough to stun Stark, who couldn't even imagine how he could defeat that thing, let alone ANY of the apostles in front of him.\nThe [Great Serpent] was emerging from beyond the mountains, yet still reaching them, meaning that its length was phenomenal, and the [Crimson Moons Trio] stared at Stark from above, in the now crimson sky.\nBut suddenly…\nStark was fucked, this was a trap, he had been set up!\nMaybe they would make it fair by giving him a one on one, but any of the apostles beyond the fourth square of the second line was surely going to murder him in less than a second.\nStark's journey… was over.\n\"Ohoh~\" the godless demon laughed again, his demonic voice echoing.\nBut suddenly… right as Stark was about to despair…\n\"=)\" the [Superior Clone] smiled again.\nImmediately, Stark diverted his attentions from the godless demon and his apostles to his close, who had suddenly regained his confidence.\nAnd seeing act like this, Stark retrieved some of his determination, because if his clone was smiling, then it meant that there was a way out of this.\nStark went back to seeing the monsters and… that's when he realized it as well.\n\"…\"\nHe realized…\n\"Hahahaha!\" he laughed as loud as possible, taking some of the apostles aback, who immediately turned their heads toward [Godless], as they knew anyone who mocked their lord would suffer.\nAnd yet… the [Godless Demon] couldn't do anything.\n\"You may be real,\" Stark pointed at them, \"But you can't hurt me, can't you? NONE OF YOU CAN!\" he smiled devilishly, actually defying the beings he knew could kill him.\nEven the [Great Serpent] couldn't hurt him even though he had been seen less than ten minutes ago.\nThe reason? Quite simple.\nIf the [Great Serpent] went back into the void less than ten minutes ago, then how is he back here?\nThe answer is also just as obvious: these things were only manifestations.\nYes, they were the real deal, and they could summon some of their auras, but other than there was nothing else they could do beside speaking to him and trying to intimidate him.\n\"Fantastic,\" the [Godless] demon smiled, revealing a sharp row of teeth from beyond the darkness, \"But you still need to fight something, don't you?\"\n~CLAP, CLAP~\nHe heard clapping in the distance, and suddenly…\n\"GROOAOKKKS-!\"\n~BAM~\nA giant white monkey emerged from beyond the mountains and rushed toward Stark's location, smashing the ground.\n~FWISH~\nStark backed away; and his clone did too, avoiding the attack.\nAnd so…\n\"GROOOAZKKKK!!!\"\n\"Let us see you fight, chosen,\" Godless continued smiling as he and his apostles stood there, watching.\nYes, they were going to watch him fight the calamity-level boss of this rift.\nMaybe they wanted to see how strong he was? Or check out his abilities for later?\nOr maybe… they just wanted to put pressure on him.\nEven though he wasn't looking at them directly right now, he could sense their stares on him.\nJudgmental, insulting, mocking, it was all of that.\nAnd yet…\n\"=)\" now that he knew they couldn't hurt him, his confidence reached its peak, \"Watch this, assholes,\" he smiled at them.\n\"GROOAOSKK!\"\n[The Guardian Ape - Level 250]\n[Rank: Calamity]\nAs expected, it was above [Boss] level.\nBut now that he had all the information he needed, he put ALL of his attention of the monster ahead, who kept moving around, sometimes on his two legs, becoming twice as large, and other times crawling on all four limbs.\nAnd so…\n\"Come at me, monkey,\" Stark smiled, the clone beside him already charging up a merged [Aura Smash] to send.\nHaving a clone as competent as Stark's would be a blessing to anyone, as every time, even when Stark forgot because he was overwhelmed, then it would already be thinking about the battle that would occur, making it insanely reliable.\n\"GROOAKRKK-!\" the guardian ape got up again, completing towering over Stark as it was more than seven meters in height, and weighted more than ten thousands kilograms, and yes you heard that right.\nA single smash from its long arms would be enough to crush Stark, or any human at its level to be honest.\nAnd yet…\n\"Let's have fun in front of your masters, ape,\" Stark positioned himself, ready to give it his all, and even though knowing these things were watching him, he had to remind himself that they weren't real.",

      "content": "[Second Experiment!]\nThe ape was slow, much slower than Stark, so any attacks he would send at it would probably hit it straight on, meaning that he only had a limited amount of moves before the ape grew too fast and durable for that.\nIt was a disadvantageous battle against time for Stark (well not really but he can't keep going forever).\nAnd being watched by all the apostles as well as the [Godless Demon] did in fact add to the pressure.\nBut oh well…\n\"AURA SMASH! CRIMSON SPEARS,\" Stark summoned the eight projectiles, and his clone did the same too with 5 spears and 1 merged crimson fist.\nAnd then….\n\"CLAW COMBO,\" after Stark avoided his first combo with [Invincible Dodge], the ape lunged toward the boy again, fully knowing a single hit from his claws would be enough to absolutely destroy him.\nStark wasn't the same to feel the pressure after all: the ape did as well.\nHe was a calamity-level monster, of course, but in the face of the other apostles he was nothing, and trying to please its masters was its biggest priority.\n~FWISH~\nStark kept moving to the side to avoid the giant claws, carefully watching each of the ape's movements, and activating [Time Vision] for a microsecond each time in case he needed it.\nHe wanted to do something very precise with that monster for his second experiment.\nAnd so once he saw the opportunity…\n\"GOT YOU!\" he smiled.\nThe guardian ape swung its massive claws, but Stark was ready.\nHe met the hand with his own strength, blocking the attack after sliding on the surface for a moment.\nHe planted his feet firmly in the watery ground, using his body weight to restrain the ape guardian.\n\"Oh?\" some of the apostles were surprised.\n\"-43613!\" because even though he had blocked the attack, there was still an impact, meaning that the human did receive a significant amount of damage from that, no matter how confident he tried to act.\n\"=)\" the clone kept watching, ready to unleash everything at any point now.\nBut Stark didn't back down from the pain and damage.\nAnd so, using all of his strength, though lower than the ape's, he swiftly moved in a way to hold the guardian's arm on his back. And then, with a powerful thrust, he pierced the ground with the arm he was holding, forcing it to do the same.\nHe didn't know if it would work, but if it did, it would be huge.\n\"This kid might be smart.\"\n\"Nothing better than to just beat its ass though!\"\n\"Weak people need to use strategies to win.\"\nAs expected, the apostles were analyzing the battle, but now that he was locked in, Stark didn't even pay attention to them, and if he felt their gazes on his back, he didn't care much to begin with.\nThe guardian ape tried to lift its arm from the ground, but it just couldn't.\nThe claws were put in too deeply, and the hard ground made it even harder to get out: it tried to repeatedly slam the ground with its other hand, but nothing.\nThen it tried to use all its force to pull it out, but still, nothing either.\nAnd when it felt desperate, its used its other hand to hold the arm that was stuck and began to pull.\n\"GROOAKKKK!\"\n\"Groak?\"\nThe guardian ape began to panic.\nIt tried everything it could think of, but it was trapped. Its massive strength was no match for the unyielding ground and Stark's clever strategy.\n\"GROAKKS?! GAORKA!\" the guardian ape roared in frustration, but its efforts were futile, it was stuck, and Stark had now the complete advantage against an enemy that couldn't even move or defend itself.\nThe guardian ape struggled to break free from Stark's strategy, and once it knew that it was stuck in place, it immediately went back to looking at the human, trying to at least see what it was trying to do.\nBut once it did, its eyes widened as it saw 10 crimson spears, 3 crimson fists, and another massive merged one ready to strike.\nStark had been prepared for the ape's increased speed and stats, thus making it possible for it to either block or avoid his attacks, and so he decided to increase his chances of success to 100% by forcing the monster to stay in place.\n\"Groa-\" the ape didn't have time to finish its noise, that all the projectiles were right in front of it.\nStark's crimson spears and fists flew in a tight formation, while his clone's merged crimson fist and five spears followed closely behind.\nThe projectiles slammed into the ape's body with tremendous force, causing it to shudder and roar in pain.\nDespite being restrained, the ape was still incredibly powerful. Its muscles bulged as it strained against Stark's assault, trying its hardest to escape, but all attacks hit their mark.\nBOOM, BOOM, BOOM\nExplosions echoed through the sunken valley as the guardian ape kept roaring,\nits body battered and bruised from the relentless onslaught, Stark's strategy had paid off, and now the ape was at his mercy.\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\n\"-44362! -47445! -45649!\" first it was the ten spears that hit, dealing around 40000 damage each.\n\"-64262! -65821! -63487!\" then it was the three crimson fists.\nAnd finally…\nBOOOOOM!\n\"148531!\" the one that had the biggest impact of all, the merged crimson fist.\nAnd so with all of that…\n[-778,331 damage to 'Guardian Ape'!]\n[Guardian Ape HP: 179,041/1,100,000]\nNot only was this thing's body obliterated by all the attacks, one of its arms visibly pierced and most likely unusable, and his chest also having holes in it, but it was also down to its final portion of HP.\nSurely it couldn't do anything now, right?\nSurely Stark had won after such a devastating attack… right!?\nBut of course, reality wasn't as bright.\n\"This guy is an idiot.\"\n\"Right.\"\n\"He's dead, not that impressive, I don't know how Reaper lost against him.\"\nAll the apostles spoke, mocking the human for doing something so reckless.\nAnd of course, there were many reasons why.\nBut the most obvious of all…\nDing! Ding! Ding!\n['Overtime Damage' has been activated… 14 times!]\n\"WHAT?!\" Stark was absolutely crushed as he saw this.\nThis had been the topic of his second experiment: to see if dealing damage at the same time would count as a single activation, but it looked like he was wrong, meaning that he went all in for seemingly no reason.\nOf course, he had done massive damage, so it wasn't really ineffective, but now… what could he possibly do?\n[\"Guardian Ape\" passive skill \"Overtime Damage\" activated]\n[+500 speed! +500 strength!]\n[+750 speed! +400 defense!]\n[+800 strength! +500 strength!]\n.\n.\n.\n[+1000 speed! +1000 strength! +1000 defense!]\nAnd so in the end… that thing was…\n\"FUCK…\" Stark took a step back as the ape's aura was now so powerful it felt nauseating, especially from so close.\nThe guardian stood up on its two feet, looking down on the human as it easily removed its arm from the ground with its strength.\n\"Groak,\" it now didn't exude any emotions, it was just… neutral, as if looking at a bug.\nAnd then…\n\"Rapid Slamming.\"\nIt moved its arm so fast that Stark didn't have the time to react.\n~SLAM~\n\"-75000!\"\nStark received the entirety of his health from that attack.\nAnd so…\nDing!\n[You have died.]",

every single cell in your body was reduced to nothing: you would revive regardless, your body back to its normal state, though with one HP only.\n~FWISH~\nStark got up, he was still bleeding a bit, and his body hurt like hell since, well, he had been crushed, but as long as he could still move around… he was fine.\n\"=)\" something taped his shoulder, and he noticed that the [Superior Clone] was still there: it had disappeared once he died, but came back as his aura revived him, which is why the apostles and [Godless Demon] weren't suspicious.\nBut surprisingly… the ape didn't notice him.\nIt actually didn't as it was too busy trying to make its masters happy, or try to get a reward for its achievement.\nAnd so… Stark decided to take advantage of that.\n\"WIELDING CROSS,\" both he and his clone summoned the cross above them.\nBut they didn't plan to just rush and swing at the monster: first of all there was no saying it would do enough damage, and it would probably notice them.\nAnd so… they both decided to use the new ability of [Wielding Cross].\n[New Perk: Crushing Gravity (EPIC)]\n[Description: By grasping the handle of the Crimson Cross, the user can hurl it high into the air, throwing it very high, and when it reaches its apex, the perk can be activated to make it fall back toward the enemy like a meteor.\nIt is EXTREMELY difficult to aim and hit with it, so it only takes one of the three strikes you have available, plus you lose the cross for the moment it is in the air, so watch out!\nThough, if it does hit, then the damage will be phenomenal, and the area around the enemy that is hit will explode with aura as well!]\nIt was the best moment, not only to test it out since the ape wasn't moving that much, but also to finally get this over with.\nThe surprise effect of reviving from [Chosen One] had ALWAYS helped Stark, and this time would be no different.\n~FWISH~\nBoth he and his clone activated the skill, and the giant crimson/golden crosses slowly fell on their two hands as they joined them together, and so with a swift and powerful motion they swung upward, sending the two crosses very high in the sky.\nAs the crosses reached their apex, Stark and his clone activated the Crushing Gravity perk again.\n~BOOM~\nAnd so the two crimson/golden crosses descended like meteors, their trajectory perfectly aimed at the guardian ape's head as it wasn't moving at all, making it infinitely easier to aim.\nThe monster was still cheering while looking at the apostles (who were actually staring at the crosses above, yet not willing to say anything to the ape), but once it sensed the attack, it roared in surprise as it noticed the giant objects falling toward it, yet it was too late to dodge or avoid them.\nWith an earth-shattering impact, the crosses slammed into the ape's head, causing its body to be thrown back violently.\nThe explosion of aura that followed was immense, and Stark and his clone felt their bodies tremble from the force of it.\nBOOOOOOOM!\n\"-437461!\" and the perk didn't lie, because even with the ape's enhanced defense, the impact of both crosses was enough to deal all of its remaining life.\nFor a moment, everything went silent as dust and debris filled the air.\nAnd…\n[Guardian Ape HP: 0/1,100,000]\nAs the dust went away, the corpse of the guardian ape was now on the ground.\n\"Oh?\"\n\"Hm…\"\nThe apostles were surprised: the human did come back to life after all, and also somehow used yet another skill to end this battle in one attack.\nNormally, this would be Stark's victory without a shroud of doubt.\nBut…\n\"Chosen,\" the [Godless Demon] himself spoke while smiling, \"Do you believe you are the only one who can revive himself?\"\n\"Huh?\" Stark was confused.\nBut right as he was about to question it about what it just said…\n~FWISH~\nThe [Guardian Ape] got up again even though its HP were at 0.\n\"Immortal Berserker,\" and its [Godly] skill activated automatically.\n\"This is…\" Stark took a few steps back, \"What the fuck?\" his eyes widened.\nHe had believed that he was the only one who could revive himself, yet was proven wrong.\nBut now… what should he do now? Now that this thing got up, seemingly unharmed, and its stats still just as high as before, if not higher.\nPlus… what was the ability of the [Immortal Berserker] skill?\n\"…\" Stark gulped as he felt that something really bad was bound to happen to him now.",

Or was it only that its HP became infinite?\nHe couldn't take damage, thus nothing could harm it, that was true.\nBut in the case of monsters, and even humans, no matter how strong you are, there is one simple action that could INSTANTLY kill you: your weakness.\nIf your body was crushed to oblivion, or if you were cut in half, it doesn't matter that you have 1, 1000, or even a trillion health point, you would still be dead, or incapacitated enough to not be able to do anything.\nAnd that was exactly what Stark was aiming: kill it instantly, in a way as to not allow it to strike back.\n~FWISH~\n\"DOUBLE ASSAULT!\"\n[Double Assault activated, 20 seconds remaining.]\n~FWISH~\nHe jumped out of the attack's way almost instantly thanks to his speed, avoiding it at the last microsecond, then dashing toward the ape.\nHe had 20 seconds to complete the plan, or else it was game over.\nDo or die.\n\"GROAKKSK!\" the guardian ape at this point was actually beginning to find this human unbearable, he was like a mosquito, you see him, you know where he is, yet still avoiding all your attacks no matter.\nThough the boss did keep some of its confidence because of its [Immortal] status, so no need to worry.\nAnd yet… it was its biggest mistake.\n\"IMMORTAL SMASH!\" the ape smashed the ground, with two times as much force as before, but the [Double Assault] skill allowed Stark to see it coming from a mile and thus turn around the ape in a flash.\nAnd… he saw his opportunity then and there.\n[13 seconds of 'Double Assault' remaining!]\nHe needed all his strength and speed he could find for that, but… he needed to do it.\n~FWISH~\nWhile the ape smashed the ground, Stark had gone behind the monster and began to climb on its back, heading toward its head and reaching it in less than a second.\n\"WRAAAAAHHH-\" the ape roared.\nBut… it was too late for it now.\n[Execute it.]\nStark was about to do an [Execution].\nExecutions are completely different from normal takedowns, since the usual ones just end up being draining the monster's health to 0 without any SIGNIFICANT event happening.\nBut [Executions] on the other hand were the opposite.\nYou only considered a kill as an execution when the way you kill the boss/monster is incredibly skillful, being ALWAYS visually incredible to watch, a reason why they are popular across the entire world.\nAnd what was about to follow was one of those executions.\n\"COME ON! COME ON!\" Stark jumped on the [Guardian Ape's] back, then ran up to the back of its head.\n\"GROAOKK-\" the ape's first instinct was to try and stop the human.\nBut… it couldn't do it as it was suddenly stunned, a shock suddenly being sent all over its body.\nStark had only noticed it because he took some time to analyze the ape, but its weakness was there since the beginning: the large nodachi-style weapon (basically it's a giant katana) running from the back of its head to its left side.\nIt was so perfectly placed that Stark even believed it was a trap in the beginning.\nBut now that it came to it… he would make use of it.\nThe sword was actually almost twice as big as Stark, but even then…\n\"DIE! IMMORTAL!\"\nWhile using all his determination and strength, as well as [Double Assault], he grabbed the handle of the massive sword and began to pull it to the side.\nThis was one of the weakness Stark sought: decapitation.\nEven if the ape was currently immortal, decapitating it would be an instant game over, even with an infinite amount of health.\nStark's muscles strained as he pulled the massive sword with all his might, feeling the weight of it trying to resist the human's attempt.\nThe guardian ape roared in pain and confusion, its tiny eyes widening in shock as it realized what was happening, yet unable to do anything: all it could do was hope that the human wasn't strong enough to push the sword all the way to do a full rotation.\n\"DIE!\" Stark shouted as he placed his legs against the ape's neck and put more force, his voice echoing through the valley as he continued to pull the sword.\nThe ape thrashed and struggled, trying to shake him off, but Stark held on tight, his determination unwavering.\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\nNone of the apostles were saying anything, but even they knew something was impressive when they saw it.\nAnd… as to prove Stark's determination and efforts, the sword actually began to move.\nSlowly at first, then faster and faster as its blade, which was going through the ape's neck, began to slice its neck more and more.\nThe guardian ape's screams grew louder as it realized that its immortality wouldn't save it from this fate.\n[5 seconds remaining for 'Double Assault'!]\n[EXECUTE IT NOW!]\nAnd so… with one final pull, which put all the efforts he went through in this rift, and his future determination in defeating all the apostles…\n~FWISH~\nHe pulled, and the sword swiftly made a full rotation, meaning that it severed the ape's neck and decapitated it, spinning twice before landing its blade on the ground, standing perfectly vertically.\nThe ape on the other hand suddenly jolted as its head was cut, and so it fell to the ground too.\n~BOOM~\nThe impact was strong, and its head rolled away, its mouth opened and eyes widened as that was its final expression before death.\nStark jumped out of the ape's back as it was falling and landed on the watery ground of the sunken valley, his face full of determination and excitement as he had done it.\n[EXECUTION SUCCESSFUL!]\n[Execution highlight has been sent all over the world!]\nExecutions are so rare and well-liked by everyone, in fact, that once one happens, it is IMMEDIATELY broadcasted for everyone to see.\nAnd to put it into retrospective, there was at best only one [Execution] every two to three months, just how to show how difficult it was for humans to do something so skillful and finish off a monster in such a way that even the system considered it as a legitimate [Execution].\nAfter all, even Stark had his cool moments when killing monsters, yet none of those were considered executions!\nAnd oh boy were they brutal, you could simply say by how Stark's execution was after all: decapitation of an immortal being, blood spilling everywhere and tainting the water in a crimson color.\n~DING~\n[You have defeated the \"Guardian Ape lvl250\" by executing it!]\n[EXP bonus will be given.]",

Ding! Ding! Ding!\n[Your level has increased to level 72, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Your level has increased to level 73, granting you three skill points and a boost in stats]\n.\n.\n[Your level has increased to level 77, granting you four skill points and a boost in stats]\n[Experience: 4,029,300/4,400,000]\n[Skill Points: 24 Available!]\nYet again, not that it was surprising, the amount of skill points per level increased to four instead of three once he passed the level 75 threshold.\nFor the first time ever though, Stark wasn't given any skill for his struggles, since, you know, it was one skill every 10 level now.\nHe did receive other panels, though.\nDing!\n[Level 75 reached, you can now break through to 'Gold-Tier' to increase your skill level limit!]\nVery good, this meant he would yet again increase in rank, something needed if he wanted to be able to assign his skill points more efficiently and thus increase his important skills to fight the apostles and domination trial.\n[Level 75 reached: you can now spin the class wheel again!]\nAnd of course, the most important perk of all was also there.\nBut first, he wanted to use his skills points.\nYes, you shouldn't usually do this when you were bounded to get a new skill from your next class or even the fact that the limit would increase, but right now this was only 24 skill points, meaning that it wasn't much.\n'Maybe I should think of buying some skill stones…' they are used to increase your skill limit without leveling up.\nAnd now you might say: pfft~, then it just means that people can use them infinitely to level up over and over, becoming overpowered.\nBut there are two penalties when doing that a lot: first of all you wouldn't be used to all your skills, meaning that you wouldn't be ready for battle in comparison to someone who repeatedly used the skills for months.\nAnd second… every [Skill Stone], even those at the highest of quality, have a small chance to break and cause a skill to go back to level 1, resetting all its perks, so yeah.\nIn the end, it didn't matter, though, and so Stark checked out his skill list to decide.\n[Skills:] Spatial Inventory; Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv25; Focus lv25; Aura Smash lv10; Clone Frenzy lv25; Invincible Dodge lv10; Double Assault lv10; Crimson Spears lv5; Heaven's Wrath lv5; Alchemist lv5; Potion Crafting lv5; Target Manipulation lv1; Dodge Control lv5; Crimson Ball Transmission lv1; EGO lv5; Crimson Purification lv25; Wielding Cross lv10; Crimson Healing lv1; The Void; Banish\nSo many possibilities, yet so little skill points to distribute.\n\"Alright,\" he nodded.\nDing! Ding!\n[You have upgraded 'Aura Smash' to level 25!]\n[You have upgraded 'Crimson Spears' to level 10!]\n[You have upgraded 'Crimson Ball Transmission' to level 5!]\nHe decided to use the skills he used the most, as what was the point of leveling up those that he hadn't used at all?\nTo be honest, Stark already a few skills that he now called the \"BIG ONES\": they were the skills that he NEEDED to upgrade and use at every rift, no matter what.\nAnd as you might already guess, they were the following: Domination and Focus, though these are passive, Aura Smash, Clone Frenzy, Invincible Dodge, Crimson Spears, Crimson Ball Transmission, Crimson Purification and Wielding Cross.\nThese were the skills he would always use in rifts, or the \"BIG ONES\" in that regard.\n'New perks,' Stark excitedly thought as he looked at the panels that appeared before him.\n…\n[Skill: Crimson Spears lv10]\n[New Perk: Spear Block]\n[Description: Essentially, these spears could only be used as attacks and projectiles to enemies, dealing good and piercing damage to them, but now, you can order up to three spears to spin around, and with the right timing they can block one attack each, though remember that if the attack is too powerful, the spears will break and you will still be hit!]\n…\n'Oh…' so it served as some other kind of shield, interesting.\n…\n[Skill: Crimson Ball Transmission lv5]\n[New Perk: More balls]\n[Description: You get two crimson balls instead of one, that's all, you can throw both at the same time, and when you snap your fingers think about the one you want to teleport at, making it easier to trick enemies.]\n…\nAn even better perk!\nHe hadn't believed it at first, but crimson ball transmission quickly became a favorite because of all its different usages, and getting another ball could only be good.\nAnd so, Stark moved on to the final perk, the one he had been waiting for the most.\n[You now have a choice, Host.]\nBefore him appeared the same panel that did when he upgraded [Crimson Purification], when he got the legendary perk that helped him, or when he got the choice for an [EPIC] perk for [Crimson Purification].\n[Since you used 10 stat points on 'Aura Smash', you can choose to either: get two normal perks, or get an EPIC one!]\n[So, which do you choose?]\nAnd below it appeared two panels.\n[Two normal perks] or [One EPIC Perk]\nStark understood how this system worked by now: one upgrade is equal to a normal perk, two upgrades at once was an epic perk and three was a legendary perk.\nWas there the possibility to get a mythical or godly perk if he upgraded a skill from 1 to its max instantly, though?\n\"Epic,\" he made his choice, since these perks were always so much better than normal ones.\n…\n[Skill: Aura Smash lv25]\n[New Perk: Aura Storm (EPIC)]\n[Description: The amount of crimson fists you can use went up to 5, and so now, by merging all 5 of them around you, you create a small storm of energy around you, which will pull in nearby enemies and slam them into the ground, dealing massive damage to them. The storm will also slow down enemies caught within it, making it easier for you to follow up with other attacks.]\n…\n\"!!!!\" Stark's eyes actually widened.\nThis might not seem much, but if he could now summon five fists, and it took all five to cast [Aura Storm], then doesn't that essentially mean that it's a straight-up much better version than [Aura Smash Merge], which used up three fists to create a giant one?\n\"Oh well, that's… great,\" though this almost meant that he would need to master it, as trying to use it without trying could result in it exploding in his face.\nAnd so, Stark finally moved on to the final and most important panel of all.\n[Class Wheel available!]\n\"Class Wheel!\" he mumbled, and the colorful wheel appeared before him.\n\"Alright, let's do this,\" it was time to get a new class, one he had been waiting for after realizing how powerful the merge between exorcist and domination was, and surely this class could only be a bonus to his stats and skills, even if he used it less, much like [Alchemist].",

      "content": "\"Class Wheel,\" Stark activated his skill, and the giant colorful wheel appeared before him, now only 7 sections on it.\n[Pull me!]\nThe lever was still beside it, its aura ordering him to pull it and discover what he would be getting.\nThis was like gambling, but a next level one though, as it determined life and death.\nWhat would have had happened to Stark if he didn't get the [Domination] class instantly? He didn't know, but surely he wouldn't be as strong as right now.\nYou need to suffer to become stronger, heh?\nBut, right as Stark was about to pull down the lever…\n[Wait!]\nA crimson panel appeared in front of him.\n\"???\"\n[Aren't you tired of the same stuff happening over and over: you reach the designated level, you can only spin the wheel once and hope for the better, rince and repeat!]\n\"What?\" Stark was confused, he had only done that thrice until now, so it wasn't that repetitive.\nThough when something like this happened, it was just like with the [Legendary] perk: it was his class trying to help him out and make things easier.\n[Introducing a new perk of the class wheel: Class Removal! Woohoo!\n\"Ah shit… here we go again,\" he knew where this was going, but still waited to see what it was about.\n[You can now decided to remove up to three classes from the wheel… PERMANENTLY!]\n[Meaning that you can remove one, two or three classes that you believe you wouldn't want to get no matter what, either because they would be useless in accordance to your current ones, or because you just don't like them at all!]\n\"Oh!\" and Stark actually LOVED this perk.\nOf course, as the holder of the class wheel, he had thought for hours about all the different classes and which ones he wanted to get and those he didn't, so this was a good thing.\nAnd so…\n[Select the classes you wish to remove from the class wheel, all choices are permanent and cannot go back!]\nThis perk was mainly here to do one thing: completely remove the classes Stark didn't want, thus meaning that his chances of getting those he wanted increased tremendously.\n[7 classes available: Magus, Beast Tamer, Warrior, Assassin, Archer, Soul Wielder, Incubus.]\nAnd I'll be honest with you: Stark didn't like most of them.\nYes, that's right, the only classes he actually wanted were Soul Wielder and Incubus, all others served zero purpose.\nWhy would he be a magus if [Domination] already allows him to use magic, why would he be a warrior or assassin when his fists deal much more damage than a weapon, why would he be an archer as it meant staying at the back, and last of all, why would he be a beast tamer, when he already struggled so much to keep up with [Alchemist], only using it for the basic potions!\nIf he had the choice, he would remove all those classes, only keeping those he wanted.\nBut as his choice was limited to three, he needed to make a choice.\nAnd he made one within thirty seconds.\nDing!\n[Are you sure you want to permanantly remove \"Warrior\", \"Assassin\" and \"Archer\"?]\nThese were the only classes that required a weapon to be used, meaning useless, beast tamer and magus on the other hand could still be useful as it just meant additional skills and help.\n\"Sure,\" he sighed.\nDing!\n[You have PERMANANTLY removed \"Warrior\", \"Assassin\" and \"Archer\" from the class wheel, meaning you will NOT be able to get them.]\nYou would usually maybe think that you could have made a bad decision at such times, especially with one this big, but right now, Stark didn't feel anything but relief.\nBoom! Boom! Boom\nThe three sections he chose were instantly erased from the wheel in front of him, only keeping four: Magus, Beast Teamer, Soul Wielder and Incubus.\nStark couldn't help but feel a bit of excitement as he stared at the class wheel.\nHe had finally removed the classes he didn't want, meaning that his chances of getting the ones he did want were much higher.\nAnd now, all that was left was to spin it and see what fate had in store for him.\nDing!\n[Spin the wheel!]\nStark took a deep breath before grabbing onto the lever next to the wheel with both hands and pulling it down.\nThe wheel spun around and around, its segments flashing by in a blur of colors.\nAnd then… after a thirty seconds, it stopped.\nStark held his breath as he looked at the segment that pointed directly at him.\nAnd it was…\n[You have obtained \"Soul Wielder\"! Congratulations!]\n[You can spin the wheel again at level 100!]\nHe let out a sigh of relief, feeling incredibly happy that he had managed to get one of the classes he actually wanted.\nThis meant that he could now focus on improving his skills in this area, which would undoubtedly help him in his fight against the apostles and domination trial.\nBut there was still one more class left on the wheel… Incubus. Would he be able to get it? Only time would tell.\nBut for now, Stark was content with what he had already achieved.\nAnother reason why he wanted [Soul Wielder] was because… of his family.\nHe clearly remembered how they treated him, they were a [Soul Wielder] family, and Stark not having that class was a shame to them, treating him like a dog.\nBut now, what could happen if he suddenly came back with the [Soul Wielder] class?\nThe image of their shocked expressions excited Stark so much he had to stop himself from laughing out loud.\nBut it didn't matter for now, and so he moved on to checking out his new class.\n…\n[Class: Soul Wielder]\n[Description:] Your soul/heart powers you up, summon it before you to allow yourself to use your abilities, you can use weapons, magics or even have a beast companion, it all depends on the heart you get, which mostly changes depending on your personality and attributes.\n[Class Effect:] Summons your very own unique heart to help you in battle.\n[Class Flaw:] None, it is one of the best.\n[Basic Skills:] You do not need any, Domination has already absorbed it.\n…\nStark's smile grew wider the more he kept reading the panel.\nAnd at the end, once he reached [Basic Skills], it disappeared.\n\"…Of course,\" he sighed.\nOf course, this wasn't a bad thing at ALL, [Exorcist] being the proof of that as [Domination] actually enhanced it with his aura.\nBut what about [Soul Wielder], would it also be enhanced with his aura? Would it become much stronger that it already is?\n\"Didn't you say that you absorbed Exorcist because it was 'weak' and that it would be a 'burden?'\" Stark raised his eyebrows, talking to [Domination] itself, as it overtook all others, \"But Soul Wielder is the second strongest class, it just doesn't make sense.\"\n[Domination will make it stronger.]\n[Domination is currently absorbing the 'Soul Wielder' class…]\nStark had already experienced it once, so he didn't say anything, instead just looking at the small bar that formed and that was slowly filling up.\nAnd after a minute.\nDing!\n[100/100]\n[Absorption complete!]\n[The 'Domination' class has absorbed the 'Soul Wielder' class, thus inheriting its aura and powers!]\n\"Status Window,\" Stark mumbled.\n….\n[Level:] 77\n[Health:] 87000\n[Bloodline:] Human\n[Classes:] Domination; Alchemist; Exorcist (Absorbed by Domination); Soul Wielder (Absorbed by Domination).\n[Talent:] Chosen one\n[Attributes:] Strength 8361; Speed 9837; Mind/Soul 10348; Stamina 7421; Defense 10245\n[Skill Points: 0 Available!]\n[Current Tier: Silver, upgrade to 'Gold' available!]\n[Skills:] Spatial Inventory; Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv25; Focus lv25; Aura Smash lv25; Clone Frenzy lv25; Invincible Dodge lv10; Double Assault lv10; Crimson Spears lv10; Heaven's Wrath lv5; Alchemist lv5; Potion Crafting lv5; Target Manipulation lv1; Dodge Control lv5; Crimson Ball Transmission lv5; EGO lv5; Crimson Purification lv25; Wielding Cross lv10; Crimson Healing lv1; The Void; Banish…\n…\nYep, it was now confirmed, Soul Wielder had been absorbed by [Domination].\n[As Soul Wielder has been absorbed, you have been granted one skill!]\nAnd of course, absorption still granted Stark a new skill.\n…\n[Skill: Domination Soul]\n[Tier: Godly]\n[Description: Every Soul Wielder has their own soul, and this soul has its own unique, in your regard, your soul is called the [Domination Soul], you can use it to slam your heart into the enemies (yes, literally), and control it as you like, the more you use it, the more possibilities.]\n[Note: your soul CANNOT be leveled up, meaning that it is only up to you to see how you want to use it, since 'Soul Wielders' actually do not get these many skills!]\n[Double Note: Basically, being creative is the most important part, and you can even merge it with your already existing attacks!]\n…\nThe panel already said all the information, but to resume it quickly: soul wielders each have a unique soul, and they can use it however they like, only restricted by the power of their soul and their imagination, and that also means that they don't get as many skills as other classes.\nPlus, much like skills like [The Void] and [Banish], it couldn't be leveled up.\nBasically… Stark got a weird new class.",

      "content": "'Domination Soul,' plus, his new basic godly skill didn't have ANY kind of cooldown, so he immediately decided to use it.\nFwish! Ding!\n[Your soul is being designed, please wait…]\n\"Oh?\"\nAs stated before, every soul is different from the other, meaning much like talents or domination weapons, each was unique and based on the host's feeling and intentions.\nIf he could remember right: his mother's in this world was pink, with hearts surrounding it, while his father's was black, with occasional zaps of lightning.\nHis brother's was yellow with a lasso around it, and his sister's was red with pulsating veins.\nBasically: all hearts were indeed different.\n[…]\n[…]\n[….\n[Creation of 'Soul Heart' is complete! You can now summon it!]\n\"Alright!\"\n\"Domination Soul,\" he used his skill again, and something materialized in front of him, or more like in front of the exact spot his normal human heart should be.\nIt was obviously crimson in color, was beating strongly, the sound echoing in Stark's ears.\nBut… what made it so different from the others… was the face at the front.\nAll his heart had was a white mouth and eyes that kept smiling like this: =) but vertically.\nIt was basically acting like his clone, and now that Stark thought about it, the face was so similar it was weird and also couldn't be a coincidence either.\nIn the end though, what his soul heart looked like didn't matter.\nDing!\n[You soul heart laughs, ready to smash his enemies!]\nAnd just as this appeared, and crimson stringe appeared in each of the heart's sides, going directly into Stark's hands, meaning he was able to grab them.\n\"This is…\" he could move his heart using those almost invisible strings.\nInstinctively though, Stark ready the panel again.\n'Smash his enemies…?'\nOf course, soul hearts are all different, and it meant their abilities were as well: because while how you used your heart can be decided by you, there was still a limit based on it could or couldn't do from its basic perks.\nAnd Stark's heart…\nFwish! BOOOOOOOM!\nStark's used the strings to spin around smash his heart on the ground three meters away from him, which seemed to be the limit, and unexpectecly, not only did it create a small crater, but the domination aura followed to create a small crimson explosion too.\n'HOLY!' that thing was powerful, Stark could see it!\nBut wait a minute… doesn't that mean that he just got a weapon?\nI mean, if [Domination Soul] is directly from [Domination]'s aura, then it meant his attacks and this skill used the same amount of aura to be cast, and so this also meant that he could use it as a weapon without any drawbacks, RIGHT?!\nHe had only been using his fists until now, so the idea of actually being able to fight with something else was terrifying.\nYes, this was a short-ranged weapon that couldn't even go beyond the three meters mark because of the size of the strings, meaning that it was essentially fists but upgraded and did more damage, but who cares!\nHe would also need to adapt his control over it, since using fists meant he was able to do whatever he wanted, but with his soul heart he still needed to control it and the strings to move it around meaning the chance to be hit.\n[If your soul heart is hit, it will disintegrate to protect itself, and only will be usable after three minutes!]\nThis was surprising: this usually doesn't happen at all to not a single one of the other soul wielders!\nOther [Soul Wielders] all have hearts obviously, and they also fight with them, but there wasn't anything as restrictive as their heart disappearing every time it was hit: otherwise, opponents could just aim at it to make it disappear and thus render their users weak.\nNot at all, this wasn't what happened, instead, Soul Hearts actually have way more HP than their users, taking several dozens of hits to begin to corrupt, and then if it receives too much damage then it disintegrates, which is why their host's themselves decide to remove them and think about strategies to survive.\nIf a [Soul Wielder]'s heart doesn't disintegrate even after receiving too much damage, and it is hit, then there is a chance that it can be destroyed = literal instant death of the soul for its host.\nI mean, [Soul Hearts] are basically your hfearts, so it made sense.\nMaybe it was to put an EXTRA layer of protection on Stark that it disappeared after one hit? After all he still had other classes, so risking it for [Soul Wielder] wasn't a good idea at all!\nSmash! Boom! Smash! Boom:\nStark tried several times to attack in different ways, either smashing directly to ground, an explosion following, or trying to do some sort of combo with it, but not having a clear target didn't help, meaning that using the [Memories Museum] would be useful in this case.\n'Alright, time to go,' Stark nodded as he took a step forward.\nBut right at that moment…\n'Heh?' his head began to hurt like hell, and so in single vibration of pain that was sent through his entire body, he fell unconscious.\nYes, he couldn't even find it: vibration of pain, then instant knockdown as his body fell, hitting the ground with the water, his face half submerged under the water., though thankfully his nose was out of it.\n'What the hell?'\nIt was like all his exhaustions from before had actually finally kicked in once he saw his class and relaced, the domination adrenaline that was constantlty pumping through his body catching up to him.\nHe had just met the [The Great Serpent], a universal level 800 apostle, his aura overwhelming Stark to the point all he thought about was to run, and then he met the rest of the apostles and the [Godless Demon], which would already made most people go unconscious.\nThen he was forced to fight some insane monster with immortal abilities and berserker strength, even killing him once and coming back to life, forcing Stark to literally [Execute] it to kill it for good.\nOh, and by the way, that [Execution] of Stark, the one where he jumped on the ape's neck and used its own sword piercing the back of its head to decapitate it, had already been sent to people in the ouside world, screens all over the world now playing the start of fight between Stark and the ape as it displayed everything.\n[Classifier S vs Guardian Ape] was the name, and they were currently at the halfway point, even Lana and Sora watching right now, both already recognizing who the boy in the video was simply by his hair and figure.\nSurely the world would go on a frenzy when the [Execution] actually happened, because even he knew that what he did was probably insanely cool.\nBut until then…\nThud!\nStark fell, sleeping.\n…\nThis time, there wasn't any particular setting for when he woke up in the black void, [Alchemist] and [Domination], who now had a small beating heart in front of his chest in addition to his crimson aura body with golden strands and the golden halo above his head.\nHe had indeed merged with [Soul Wielder].\n\"Almost makes me feel left out,\" but it was indeed that alchemist was the only one who couldn't be absorbed.",

Ding! Ding!\n\"Alright, time to get up, host,\" Alchemist and Domination smiled, \"Be sure to destroy those apostles.\"\n\"…\" Stark didn't answer.\nDomination and Alchemist faded, and soon enough Stark lost consciousness.\n…\nStark opened his eyes, for him it had been only three hours, so he remembered perfectly, but in the outside world it had been three months, and he immediately noticed it by the smell and color of the water.\nThe massive amount of blood coming out of the guardian ape tained the water in weird redish color, and the smell from the decaying corpse was overwhelming.\nSurprisingly no items had dropped from the boss, and he was thankful since he really didn't want to look for them, immediately leaving by going through the portal at the end of the sunken valley.\nThe aura from the apostles and godless demon should have disappeared, that's what domination said as it was overtaken by his own aura, yet Stark could still feel this feeling around him: a chilling one, the feeling of death.\nHe didn't know why or what, but something inside of him had snapped.\nHis face darkened, and his eyes looked more tired, and it was't even from tiredness: this was just his new look from now.\nWas it because he saw the power of those he needed to fight? Or was he just fed up?\nIn the end, none of it mattered, because something was certain: Stark was tired of this shit, and from now on he would kill all of them without a hint of hesitation, and much faster than before.\n\"…\" be it human, monster or apostles, he wasn't going to play anymore.\nDid he lose emotions? No, otherwise this feeling of excitement of going back to meet Lana wouldn't be there, but strangely, he didn't have any feelings towards the concept of fighting.\nFwish!\nStark passed the portal, and found his way back to his apartment complex.\nThe excitement of battling was almost gone, and now all he wanted was to end all of these battles quickly.\nFighting the apostles? He would absolutely obliterate them before they even realized.\nThe academy? Not even a challenge at this point, anyone who tried to get in his way was dead.\nDomination trial? Didn't matter, he just needed to survive, just like before.\nStark felt such a strange calmness it was scary.\nBut one thing was for certain: Stark would remain normal on the outside, but the moment he entered a rift/battle, he would completely change, displaying a ruthless version of him no one would want to meet, not even the godless demon.\nClick! Clack!\nHe opened his apartment's door using his keycard, and immediately was greeted by the sight of a cooking Lana.\n\"S…S-…STARK?!\" she dropped everything in her hands and rushed toward him, hugging him tightly, \"ITS YOU, RIGHT! RIGHT? I'M NOT IMAGINING IT?!\"\n\"…\" Stark didn't say anything for a few seconds as he looked down at Lana, who was crying, then he breathed in and out and changed his expression to a more \"Stark-like\" one, \"Yeah, It's me,\" he smiled.\n\"OH MY GOD, I-IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS!\"\n\"Yeah, my bad.\"\n\"A-And that execution three months ago was insane, even now people are talking about it, where in the hell did you go?!\"\nHe couldn't tell her he met with the apostles of the godless demon, and the big boss himself, so he invented, \"You know… huh… just fighting and leveling up, I got stronger!\"\nThis was technically not a lie!\nAnd Lana could definitely sense it in Stark's aura: he was much stronger than before for some strange reason, and also… more handsome.\nHer emotions got the better of her, and so she rushed in for a kiss.\n\"…?!\" Stark was taken aback, but after going through everything, he still kissed her back.\nAfter around a minute of intertwining their tongues, Stark pulled himself out as Lana would have probably kept going, \"What about… the food?\"\n\"O-Oh yeah,\" she blushed, \"Let me finish dinner then we can… um… continue.\"\n'…?'\nWhat the hell does she mean by continue, wasn't this all?\nOr maybe she wanted to… Oh!?",

      "content": "Stark and Lana ate dinner, and as soon as they were finished… well… they did the deed as Lana immediately pounced on the boy who just wanted to rest even though he had slept for 3 months, somehow still tired.\nLana at first wanted to lead and prove to Stark that she could make him feel good, but in the end the roles were totally reversed.\nYou cannot dominate a [Domination] user after all! Only another one can match with them!\nSo in the end, she was the one that ended up feeling the best from Stark's… techniques?\nHe didn't even restrain himself, because the moment she declared she was ready, then he abandoned all his restraints and went full on hard mode, going faster and faster with not a second to rest.\nAnd so like this, they kept going for the entire night, Lana experiencing a feeling she had never felt before since it was both their first times.\nShe collapsed by the time the sun came up, and all Stark did was sigh as he looked at her stunning figure, now lying on the bed.\n\"…\"\nHis body was filled with hickeys and kissing marks, but oh well, he couldn't have expected Lana to like this so much when she was in 'submissive' mode.\n\"What the fuck am I even doing...\"\nMorning came, and Stark slept like a baby, waking up a few hours later and preparing breakfast.\nLana then woke up, remembered everything that happened last night, and her face flushed with embarrassment.\nShe couldn't believe she had actually done it with Stark, and why the hell was he so good at it?\n'Maybe he… did it a lot before…?' she thought to herself, but decided not to ask him as it would be embarrassing.\n\"Come on, eat,\" Stark appeared out of nowhere suddenly, pointing at the toasts and eggs on the table, \"Tomorrow is the big day.\"\nYes, as stated before, tomorrow was the start of the second semester for the academy, meaning they would receive their second 'trial'.\nOh; and by the way; his [Execution] of the guardian ape went viral all over the world, so pretty much everyone saw it.\nBut Stark didn't care that much: he simply did it because he was forced to, anything else wouldn't have even scratched the ape.\nAnd so just like that, the day passed quickly.\nThey didn't do anything that night though, Lana feeling a bit overwhelmed and Stark a bit tired, so they just slept in the same bed as a compromise.\nWhen did they become so close? Even Stark didn't know, but being… loved, didn't feel that bad when he knew what was coming.\nHe needed to be as serious as ever before, but he also just made sure to enjoy it a bit, because at least now they couldn't say he died a virgin!\nHe lived his life to the fullest, or at least he thought so!\n…\nBeep! Beep! Beep!\nThe alarm rang, and both Stark and Lana prepared, leaving their apartment complex and heading toward the academy.\nJust like during their entrance ceremony though, the roads were COMPLETELY packed with people, making it impossible to take a ride as it would take too long, and so as Stark was way faster, he carried Lana and did the same thing as before: run through the roofs and jump into the academy from above.\nIt was currently 7:53 am, and the 'second semester' ceremony was happening at exactly 8 am.\nThere had actually been only 23 groups out of the 50 that completed their rift, meaning that even though 30 groups could have completed it, it hadn't been the case at all.\nStark couldn't imagine the amount of deaths, but oh well, he completed his rift alone, so who cares.\nHe and Lana entered the academy, arriving yet again in the lobby.\n\"Squares again,\" the blonde-haired girl mumbled as she looked at the ground.\nThis time there were 3000 squares set up because, well, 30 groups could win with 100 classifiers per group, so the academy put them all even though they knew a situation where everyone survived is impossible.\n7:57… 7:58… 7:59…\nEveryone had arrived by now, and yet again Lana and Stark placed themselves in squares right beside one another.\nThese squares were also slightly bigger than the previous ones since they had more space thanks to the decrease in the amount of people.\nAnd suddenly…\nFwish! Ding!\n8:00 am!\nThe door of the academy closed in a thud, and all students who had survived and completed their respective rifts quieted down.\nStark just noticed it, but only some of the strongest-looking ones remained now, and all of them looked more serious than before, experiencing a rift at such a difficulty probably making them realize how bad this was.\nAnd so…\nBOOM!\nAn explosion happened on the stage at the very end of the room, and Theodore, as well as the teachers of the academy, appeared, a wide smile on his face and wearing his uniform.\n\"Did you all enjoy yourselves?\" he asked while laughing, but no one answered, \"Alright,\" Theodore snapped his fingers, and the giant holographic screen that was so iconic appeared.\nIt was the thing that had explained the rules to them and showed constant images to make it clear what they needed to do.\n[Students Who Pass to Second Stage… 1763 out of 5000!]\nOf course, 23 groups surviving didn't mean every member of the group survived, as there were bound to be some casualties.\n[This is way more than the previous years, congratulations to this batch of students!]\nYet surprisingly, even though the number was already low, it seemed that was usually even lower!\n\"All thanks to you,\" Lana smiled at Stark, and he found her adorable, though he quickly looked back at the screen.\n[Here is the 'Group Ranking' for fastest rift completion!]\n[Group 8, Leader: Stark Heartsouls]\n[Group 13, Leader: Karl Spikeford]\n[Group 27, Leaders: Punkz Brothers]\n.\n.\n.\nThis kept going, showing all the groups, but Stark was actually surprised: the three punks that had tried to hit on Lana back at the stations were actually strong, managing to finish third.\nOf course, they couldn't compete with him though, no one could in this room, not even Sora now that he knew about what awaited him.\nSoon enough, the ranking disappeared, the holographic screen displaying something else.\n[Well, there isn't anything to explain, is there? You all know how this work from now on, right?]\nPeople nodded, knowing they still had two trials to go through before finishing the FIRST year of this academy, remember that there are two.\n[Very well, then let us introduce the second trial, and oh boy I pray you all manage because it is much harder than the first!]\nSome classifiers gulped as they saw and heard that, but the vast majority remained calm, neutral expressions on their faces as they fully expected it.\nStark was actually the only one smiling.\nAfter all, he perfectly knew what this second trial would be: Sora had come to his apartment specially to tell him, and he also read about it in the [ApostleDex].\nAnd it was…\n[Second Trial: The Colosseum]\nThe image of a massive circular ancient-looking tower appeared, it was in the middle of the desert.\n[The colosseum is not a rift, but a tower, the academy has found and taken this one for the sole purpose of giving it to their students for this year!]\nIt really seemed they went all in on this!\n[Towers differ from rifts simply by the fact that instead of going from zone to zone to find the boss, you will need to go up from floor to floor, this tower having 10 floors!]\n[This is an new group trial, by the way, meaning that all groups are disbanded!]\nTheodore's voice continued, \"Now, I'm sure most of you are familiar with towers as some may have even entered some, but if you don't know, each floor holds at least one elite THAT needs to be defeated to go to the next one, at floor 5 is a mini-boss, and at the tenth floor is the boss!\"\nImages appeared on the screen as Theodore spoke.\n[Your objective is simple: reach floor 10 with your party and defeat the boss!]\n[All those that do not defeat the boss of the tenth floor will be considered as expelled!]\nIn retrospective, this should be pretty damn easy, shouldn't it, after all, they could just form massive teams and the weakest of the lot can follow the pack and climb up!\n[The colosseum is, as stated in the name, a colosseum, meaning that there aren't any monsters in the tower beside the elites, mini-boss and boss!]\nYes, this meant that the moment you entered, it was only strong monster after strong monster.\nFloor 1 = Elite.\nFloor 2-4 = Elite.\nFloor 5 = Mini-Boss.\nFloor 6-9 = Elite\nFloor 10 = Boss\nWith nothing in between you and these monsters.\n[Though note that after each monster is a safe-zone you can use to go back to the real world and rest, entering the colosseum again will resume you at the floor you were previously at!]\n[You can form parties of up to three classifiers to aid you, which means the three of you will be alone to defeat all the monsters of the colosseum, so choose wisely!]\n[The Colosseum is a level 200-250 tower!]\n[This is all.]\nThis was all the information they would be getting, and it was a lot to process.\n\"Oh, and here,\" Theodore snapped his fingers, and in every student's hands appeared a small golden token, \"Use this to enter and leave the colosseum whenever you feel like it!\"\nAnd so just like this, the principal and the teachers, as well as the holographic screen, disappeared, and the door of the academy opened.\nThis was a rather quick introduction to the second semester, almost seeming like the chairman really wanted to see them fight quickly, or that defeating all the elites would take a long time.",

      "content": "Stark, Lana, and Sora stood among the thinning crowd in the academy's lobby, the tension in the air almost palpable after Theodore's announcement\nAnd although this announcement was much quicker than the first since they had already introduced most of the rules already, only needed to inform the students of their task, its difficulty, how to get to it, and the penalty of failure.\nBut basically, they had just learned about the second trial: The Colosseum, a tower of ten floors where survival depended on defeating increasingly powerful enemies.\nStark stood tall, his eyes scanning the group, and soon enough he found the person he was looking for: Sora!\nThe white-haired girl spotted him at the same time, and he could swear she ALMOST let out a small smile before going back to her original expression.\nSora was the first to break the silence as she approached them.\n\"We should create our group now, right?\" Her tone was level, but there was an eagerness in her voice.\nShe rarely showed such initiative, but this trial had clearly sparked something in her.\nStark nodded, pulling up the system prompt with a flick of his wrist. \"Yeah, let's form the group.\"\nDing!\n[Do you want to accept party invitation from 'Stark Heartsouls'?]\nThey accepted the invite as the system prompt flashed before the three of them.\n[Party: Stark Heartsouls, Sora Gardenis, Lana Moonless]\n[Party: 3/3]\nLana and Sora joined simultaneously, the shimmering text confirming their team. Stark let out a satisfied breath. They were ready.\nImmediately, some of the students around them began to activate their Colosseum tokens, teleporting away in flashes of golden smoke.\nThe suddenness of it caught Lana off guard, and she nearly stumbled.\n\"Holy!\" Lana exclaimed, eyes wide as she saw the golden mist vanish. \"Looks like we can teleport at any point, huh, even now!\"\nPeople weren't wasting any time, and if they knew that they could handle the first few elites, then no reason to sit back and do nothing, the last trial did inform them that even though they had 4 months, their time was counted!\n\"Yeah, seems so,\" Stark replied, folding his arms over his chest.\nHis gaze flickered between Lana and Sora, considering their options.\n\"Want to go...?\" Sora proposed unexpectedly. It was rare for her to be the one to speak first, yet she had done it for the second time in a row, taking both of them by surprise.\nStark grinned, his usual confidence shining through, \"Of course, let's test it out, and don't worry, Lana, with me and Sora here, no chance in hell anything happens. Sit back and relax!\"\nLana's smile faltered for a split second.\nShe knew she wasn't as strong as Stark or Sora, but hearing it so casually from Stark stung a little.\nSure, she wasn't at their level, but she wasn't weak either. But what hurt more was the dynamic between Stark and Sora.\nEven though Stark hadn't meant it, his comment left Lana feeling overshadowed, as if her presence was less significant now that Sora was with them.\nShe had always enjoyed Stark's protective nature of her, actually, she loved it, but now that Sora was in the picture, she couldn't deny she was jealous of her strength.\n\"…Sure,\" Lana finally replied, her voice quieter than usual.\nSo basically: Sora was jealous of Lana's carefree attitude and how close she was to Stark, and the other was jealous of how mysterious and strong she was, since she thought this would attract Stark to her.\nWhat a weird duo.\n\"Well, I think it's better to go immediately,\" Stark mumbled.\nBut before he could do that, the three heard a voice from behind, and once they turned, they saw that it was the \"Punkz Brothers\", the three brothers who ended up as the top 3 in the first trial.\n\"Hey there,\" their colorful (and absolutely horrible) hair stood out from the rest, and they advanced toward the trio, and their leader didn't waste any time in asking the question he wanted, \"How about it, Lana? Join us instead of these two. We could use someone like you.\"\nLana crossed her arms, raising an eyebrow in disbelief. \"Thanks, but no thanks.\"\nThe Punkz Brothers weren't deterred, \"Heh… even though we're stronger?\" The leader smirked, leaning in slightly as if he was confident he was speaking the truth.\nBut Stark couldn't hold back his laugh, it was too ridiculous.\n\"Stronger? You've got to be kidding me. Didn't you see the video of the Death Rift? You do know it was me who took out those undead alone, right?\"\n\"Doesn't matter,\" one of the brothers scoffed, his tone dismissive, \"Those monsters were weak. We'd have destroyed them too.\"\nStark's amusement grew more as he heard them speak about their powers: these guys were delusional, and they had no idea the sheer difficulty of what he had faced.\nEven if they multiplied their strength five times, they wouldn't have lasted a minute against the monsters he had fought.\nBut arguing with them was pointless.\nWithout another word, Stark activated his Colosseum token, Lana and Sora following suit.\n[Do you wish to enter the Colosseum?]\n[You will not be able to leave until you defeat the first floor elite at least.]\nStark selected yes without hesitation, and within seconds, the golden light enveloped the trio, whisking them away from the academy as the Punkz Brothers cursed behind them.\n\"THESE LITTLE—\"\n\"Calm down, brother. We'll get them!\"\n….\nIn an instant, the world shifted around Stark, Lana, and Sora, and they found themselves standing inside the Colosseum.\nThe ancient structure was imposing—massive stone walls surrounded them on all sides, towering high into the sky.\nThe room they stood in was dimly lit, the air heavy with the scent of age and dust, as though no one had stepped foot in this place for centuries.\nIn front of them was a large stone door, and above the door, written in thick crimson letters, was the text: \"Floor 1.\"\n\"Well,\" Stark said, his voice steady and confident. \"Let's go.\"\nLana, wanting to feel included, nodded quietly. She glanced at the towering door ahead of them, her fingers tracing her bow's form to reassure her.\nSora, on the other hand, was composed, her eyes focused and sharp as ever. She hadn't said much since arriving, but it was visible that she was ready.\nThe trio approached the massive door together, their footsteps echoing off the floor.\n[Welcome to the Colosseum!]\nWithout another word, they stepped forward, prepared to face whatever the Colosseum had in store for them.\nBased on what the chairman and holographic screen at the academy lobby said, less than twenty minutes ago, there were ten floors, and each of them had no monsters except for an elite, and at floor 5 would be a mini-boss, then at floor 10 would be the boss.\nBut based on what the information he got thanks to the [ApostleDex], Stark knew that in the floor 10 was a second boss, and it was a godless demon apostle.\nHis goal was to find and kill that thing, otherwise all of this would be useless.\n\"Let's go,\" Stark looked at the two girls as he began to push the door open, his strength enough to slowly push the ancient door.",

      "content": "Stark, Sora, and Lana stood before the ancient door marked with \"Floor 1,\" its towering frame making it obvious that what lay beyond was powerful.\nStark took a deep breath before pushing it open, the heavy stone door groaning as it revealed a sprawling arena.\nSand covered the ground, and towering stone walls surrounded the area, leaving no room for escape.\nThe silence was eerie, and in opposition to when he fought Lother and Reaper, there were no spectators in the stands, it was just the party.\nThen, suddenly, with a loud thud, a massive shadow dropped from above, landing in the center of the arena.\nDust and sand flew into the air, obscuring the figure, but as it cleared, they saw it: a towering level 200 [Minotaur] elite, around eight meters tall.\nIts muscular frame glistened in the dim light of the arena, thick black fur covering its hulking body.\nThe beast held a massive, battleaxe in its hands, easily twice as tall as all of them, blood visible on the blade, maybe from killing other awakeners?\nIts eyes glowed red with fury, and its nostrils flared as it snorted, the ground beneath it trembling with each breath.\n\"Level 200, huh?\" Stark muttered under his breath, eyeing the creature's health bar.\n500,000 HP, and he didn't even bother checking its stats.\nAt this point, anything below level 225 was nothing but child's play to Stark.\nHe wasn't worried about himself or Sora; both of them were more than capable of handling this brute.\nBut his eyes flicked to Lana.\nShe had a bow and some skills, but this kind of direct combat would be a challenge for her.\nLana, however, wasn't about to back down.\nDetermined to prove herself, she quickly notched several arrows onto her bowstring, her fingers glowing with energy as she activated her skill.\n\"Moon Arrow!\" she called out, sending a dozen shining arrows flying toward the Minotaur in quick succession.\nClang!\nThe beast reacted faster than expected, planting its massive axe into the ground and ducking behind it.\nThe arrows bounced harmlessly off the axe's thick metal surface, not a single one hitting its target.\n\"…\" Lana stared in disbelief at the Minotaur's effortless defense, \"That thing cheated, just wait until I hit it for real.\"\nBut Lana wouldn't get another chance to attack—Sora had already begun to take action.\nWith a graceful wave of her hand, she summoned her skill, [Evergreen Resilience].\nThe entire arena floor shifted and rumbled as lush green grass suddenly sprouted beneath their feet, stretching out to cover the entire battlefield.\nVines grew rapidly from the ground, twisting and writhing as they encircled the Minotaur's legs.\nStark raised an eyebrow, impressed.\n\"Your skill's improved,\" he commented, watching the vines' rapid growth, \"I remember it wasn't this strong before.\"\nSurely with those, Sora would have easily won against Warden, locking him in place.\nBut to be honest, Sora didn't seem that affected by her defeat against Warden, she probably moved on already.\nThe Minotaur roared in frustration, its red eyes glowing brighter as it attempted to charge forward.\nBut the [Evergreen Resilience] domain had already taken hold, thick vines wrapped around the beast's legs, restraining its movements as it struggled to break free.\nThe more it fought, the tighter the vines held.\nSora gave Stark a brief nod, her silent way of telling him to finish the job.\nHe smirked, raising his hand as crimson energy flickered around him.\n\"AURA SMASH!\" three crimson fists materialized beside him.\nAnd without hesitation, he began merging the three fists into one, the minotaur could sense the deadly power, but nothing he could do about it, as he was restrained, and he could only watch as Stark powered up his fists.\n\"RAWWWRRR!\" The Minotaur roared again, swinging its axe wildly, but the vines continued to hold strong.\nSora's plants had evolved to the point where they could restrain even the most powerful enemies at her level, and the Minotaur was no exception.\n~FWISH, BOOM~\nAnd so, after finishing to power up his attack, Stark sent the enormous crimson fist flying toward the Minotaur.\nIt collided with the beast's chest, the force of the impact reverberating through the arena.\n-504381!\nThe damage number flashed above the Minotaur's head, and in an instant, its HP bar dropped to zero.\n\"HOLY SHIT!\" Lana exclaimed, her eyes wide.\nShe'd seen Stark fight before with all the videos about him that were constantly being uploaded, but witnessing his raw power in person was something else entirely.\nThe Minotaur's body exploded into a cloud of crimson energy, its remains disintegrating into the sand.\n[You have slain 'Floor 1 Minotaur Elite', gained 750,000 experience points!]\nDing!\n[Your level has increased to level 78, granting you four skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Experience: 379,300/4,500,000.]\nStark barely reacted to the notification.\nHe glanced over at Lana, who was still processing the fight.\nOh, and by the way, even though she had done no damage, she still gained experience as well since they were in a party.\n\"Don't worry,\" Stark said with a grin, \"You'll get your chance to shine,\" though even he didn't believe that.\nLana only nodded, though a small part of her felt frustrated. She wanted to help, to prove that she could contribute to the team beyond being carried.\nThe group continued forward, pushing through the second door.\n…\nOn the second floor, they encountered another elite monster—this time a [Stone Golem], its hulking frame made of boulders and rocks.\nStark didn't even bother checking its HP.\nThe moment it stepped into the arena, he activated [Crimson Spear], summoning five glowing red spears of energy that hovered around him.\nSora also acted immediately, her [Evergreen Resilience] once again covering the battlefield. Vines shot up from the ground, winding their way around the golem's massive legs.\nAnd unlike the Minotaur, the golem's heavy, rocky body couldn't even attempt to fight back, too slow to counter, as it mainly focused all of its energy in its strength.\nYet, now that its high strength wasn't useful, it was pretty much dead.\nWith a simple motion, Stark sent his crimson spears flying, each one striking the golem with precision.\nBOOM!\n\"-112482! -128491! -117363!\"\nThe golem's HP bar plummeted, and just like that, it crumbled into a pile of rubble.\n…\nThey moved on to the third floor, where they faced a [Fire Elemental]. The creature, made entirely of swirling flames, floated above the ground, its molten body radiating intense heat.\nLana took her chance this time, attempting to shoot her arrows at it, but they phased right through the monster.\n\"Elements of Nature,\" and Sora was the one to finish it off with her skill, each of the energy balls she summoned hit the monster like a truck before Stark could even act.\nHe and Sora were making an incredible team, and Lana was an amazing cheerleader too!\n…\nThe fourth floor brought a [Frost Ogre], its massive body covered in thick ice.\nSora took control again, her vines proving even more effective against the ice-covered monster, slowly strangling it until it fell. Stark barely had to intervene, sending only a single crimson spear to finish the job.\nAfter defeating the Frost Ogre, the trio finally reached the fifth safe zone, the tension easing as they came to a halt in front of another massive black door.\nAbove it, in large crimson letters, read:\n[Floor 5: Mini-Boss]\n\"Well, here goes nothing,\" he nor Sora had broken a single drop of sweat, so they would probably be able to keep going until the last floor.\n\"You're planning to beat the mini-boss today too?!\" Lana asked in shock.\nIt had been less than thirty minutes since they had entered, and already they were standing before the fifth-floor door, nearly halfway through the trial.\nStark stretched casually, his confidence unwavering. \"I mean, duh. The quicker we clear this, the better. Who knows? Maybe we'll get some information about the next trial if we finish early.\"\nLana looked skeptical, but Sora simply nodded in agreement.\nShe, like Stark, had a calm confidence that suggested they could take on anything.\n\"Alright…\" Lana sighed, readying her bow, though she almost wanted to just drop it on the crowd.\nWith a determined grin, Stark stepped forward, placing his hand on the black door, and then pushed it without hesitation just like all the others, ready to easily defeat the mini-boss too.",

      "content": "Before anyone else too, since it had been less than two hours since this entire second semester trial started.\nEveryone would surely cry when they realized half the colosseum was beaten in such a short amount of time, heh.\nThe door shut behind them with a thunderous boom, sealing them inside the massive arena.\nIt was much larger than the previous floors, the stone walls towering higher, the air colder.\nThe ground beneath them was no longer simple dirt or sand; it was black, like polished obsidian, reflecting the faint light that flickered from the walls.\nThe air was thick with an oppressive energy, and they could all feel it, the presence of the mini-boss.\n\"Maybe it's finally gonna be a challenge,\" he mainly spoke to Sora, and Lana gulped as she feared for her life.\nA low rumble echoed through the room, the sound growing louder as something massive stirred in the darkness at the far end of the arena.\nStark's took his usual stance, with his fists in front of his face, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the room, looking for the source of the noise.\nSora stood beside him, her hands already glowing with the energy of her plant abilities, ready to act at a moment's notice.\nLana, bow at the ready, drew a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves, though she knew her arrows wouldn't do much.\nMaybe putting on a cheerleader outfit and dancing would be more useful than what she was currently doing, heh?\nSuddenly, the ground beneath them trembled violently.\nThe obsidian floor cracked, and from the cracks, glowing red fissures spread like spider webs.\nA massive figure slowly emerged from the shadows.\n\"…\" so much presentation for a floor 5 mini-boss?\nAt least, that is what Sora and Lana believed after the former demolished all the bosses that came before.\nEveryone believed that… except for Stark, who's eyes widened in shock.\n\"Hey there… Chosen…\"\nBecause if the creature at the end of the room was the mini-boss, then what the fuck was that thing?\nAnd that's when Stark realized something else as he focused, because the mini-boss wasn't actually hiding to make some sick entrance or whatever: that thing was trembling fear.\nIts figure was hidden from him, impossible to see what it looked like, but Stark knew it, deep inside.\n[Olikar, The Colosseum Warrior (GODLESS DEMON APOSTLE)]\n[Level 400]\n\"HOLY SHIT, GET THE FUCK OUT,\" he shouted to Lana and Sora, but mainly Lana.\n\"If you want to fight me,\" Olikar pointed upward, \"At the top of the tower is where you need to go, have fun.\"\nOlikar was looking at him, as if judging him, \"Hey, you,\" he pointed at the mini-boss, \"Get rid of the other two.\"\nAnd once Olikar snapped his fingers, the mini-boss suddenly went crazy.\n[Wrought Iron Gargantua has received the 'Berserk' effect from 'Olikar's Colosseum Authority', it will last until the end of the battle!]\n\"Hahaha…\" the apostle laughed as he disappeared into the darkness, leaving the three classifiers and the mini-boss, which now had the power of a boss, alone.\nAnd now, they needed to face what was left: the floor 5 mini-boss.\nIt was a [Wrought Iron Gargantua], a hulking monstrosity that stood over ten meters tall, its entire body encased in dark metal, polished and jagged.\nThick iron plates covered its body like armor, and its head was adorned with a twisted crown of rusted metal.\nIts eyes glowed with an ominous red light, and its entire body radiated an aura of ancient power.\nThe massive creature's arms were unnaturally long, ending in enormous hands with spiked, clawed fingers.\nIt carried a colossal iron hammer in one hand, its head almost as large as a boulder.\nStark quickly checked its stats.\n[Name: Wrought Iron Gargantua]\n[Level: 225]\n[HP: 700,000]\n[Strength: 4847 (+3000 from berserk state)]\n[Stamina: 4365 (+3000 from berserk state)]\n[Speed: 2371 (+3000 from berserk state)]\n[Defense: 18371 (=3000 from berserk state)]\n[Skills: Ironclad Skin, Earthquake Hammer, Shockwave, Metallic Regeneration, Magnetic Pull, Iron Spikes, Tremor, Steel Rampage, Crushing Strike, Titan's Will…]\n\"This one's no joke,\" Stark muttered, already calculating their approach, \"And fucking hell… 21000 defense…\"\nThat thing's armor was pretty much impenetrable, abandoning all of its other stats in exchange for a defense that would take them hours to break through.\nSora clenched her fists, her plants blooming under her feet, \"Doesn't matter, just kill it.\"\nWithout warning, the [Wrought Iron Gargantua] let out a deafening roar, raising its hammer high.\nThe ground beneath them trembled as it brought the massive weapon down with a devastating force, unleashing its first skill: [Earthquake Hammer].\nBOOM!\nThe impact sent shockwaves rippling through the arena, cracking the ground and sending debris flying into the air.\nStark immediately activated [Invincible Dodge], rolling out of the way just in time as a massive chunk of stone flew past where he had stood.\nSora, too, managed to sidestep the attack, her agility enhanced from countless battles.\nBut Lana, less experienced in direct combat, wasn't as fast. She stumbled, losing her footing as the shockwave knocked her to the ground.\n\"Lana!\" Stark sighed, a bit concerned.\nBut before he could move, the Gargantua activated its second skill: [Magnetic Pull].\nThe iron spikes jutting from its body began to glow, and an invisible force yanked Lana toward the monster, her metal-tipped arrows and gear dragging her closer to the beast.\nThe Gargantua raised its massive hammer again, preparing to crush her beneath its weight.\nSora acted quickly.\nWith a flick of her wrist, she summoned a flower from the ground—the delicate bloom of [Flower Analysis]. The petals shimmered, and the flower whispered to her, revealing the creature's stats as well.\nBut that wasn't all that small flower said.\n\"Shoot for the joints! Its iron armor is weakest at the elbows and knees!\" Sora called out just as calmly as before, almost making it seem like they weren't in a life or death situation.\nLana scrambled to her feet, narrowly dodging the hammer's descent as it slammed into the ground where she had been.\nShe nocked an arrow and aimed for the creature's knee.\n\"Got it!\" she shouted, releasing the arrow.\nThe arrow flew through the air, striking the Gargantua at the joint of its knee. It clanged against the iron but didn't pierce through.\n-371!\n\"Dammit, it's still too tough!\" Lana growled, frustration bubbling up.\nStark, seeing the opportunity too, summoned the five spears of [Crimson Spears], each glowing with a fierce red energy as they span around him.\nHe launched them at the Gargantua's exposed knee, aiming to break through the weaker joint.\nThe spears slammed into the monster's leg with a thunderous impact, shattering the armor slightly but not breaking it.\n-4727! -5481! -4938!\n\"…\" he didn't say anything, but they just need to keep going.\nThe Gargantua roared in anger, lifting its leg and activating another skill.\n\"IRON SPIKES!\"\nDozens of long, jagged iron spikes shot out from its body, aimed at the trio.\n\"Get down!\" Stark shouted, rolling to the side as the spikes embedded themselves into the ground. Sora managed to dodge in time, the spikes grazing past her, but Stark was forced to take a hit to protect Lana.\n-7361!\nThankfully enough the damage was low, and if Lana had been hit, she would have probably bleed out, making it worth it.\n\"This isn't working,\" Sora said calmly, because even though she tried to use [Evergreen Resilience] and [Vine Surge], the vines couldn't hold down or hurt the massive beast.\nWhich meant that they couldn't use their usual 'strategy' to beat it.\nStark nodded grimly, \"It's built for defense, just keep hitting it in the same spot.\"\nSora's eyes narrowed as she summoned her next ability, [Elements of Nature].\nThe ground beneath them rumbled as five massive flowers erupted from the earth: a sunflower, a tulip, an iris, a poppy, and a lily.\nEach flower bloomed to an enormous size, their petals glowing with energy.\n\"…\" Sora was focused, not speaking at all.\nAfter a few seconds, the flowers began to generate energy balls, powered by the petals. The energy pulsed, growing larger and more potent.\nWith a simple gesture from Sora, the flowers fired their energy balls in unison.\nThe glowing orbs of energy shot through the air like meteors, slamming into the Gargantua's iron body with explosive force.\nBOOM!\nThe impact caused the Gargantua to stumble, its iron armor dented and cracked in places. Its HP bar dropped significantly, but it wasn't enough.\n-73781!\n\"Nice job,\" he was happy Sora managed to do damage, because it meant he could as well!\nThe Gargantua roared in fury.\n\"STEEL RAMPAGE!\"\nThe iron spikes on its body began to spin, turning it into a whirling mass of metal and destruction.\nIt charged forward, the spikes tearing through everything in its path.\nStark quickly activated Invincible Dodge, rolling out of the way just as the Gargantua barreled past him. But as the monster turned, one of its spikes grazed Lana's side, sending her flying across the arena.\n\"Lana!\" Stark's heart dropped as he saw her crumple to the ground, blood trickling from her side.\nShe wasn't dead, but she was hurt—badly.\nA cold rage surged through Stark as he saw her lying there.\nHis usual calm demeanor gone.\nHis hands clenched into fists, and the crimson energy around him flared brighter than ever.\n\"That's it…\" Stark growled, his voice low and dangerous.\nHe could feel the power of his new ability surging through him—the ability he hadn't fully tapped into yet.\n[Crimson Soul].",

      "content": "\"CRIMSON SOUL!\"\nStark's body glowed with a crimson light as his soul manifested in front of him: a pulsating crimson heart with a smiley face on it.\nWithout hesitation, he took the two chains that controlled the heart, and from his single rage determination slammed it into the mini-boss's body twice.\nThe Gargantua screeched, its iron body shuddering as Stark's soul heart hurt it badly.\n-124714! -132379!\nEven with its defense, the damage was insane.\nThe creature roared, struggling against Stark's control, but it was too late.\n\"ITS OVER!\" Stark gritted his teeth and activated [Aura Storm], summoning the five crimson fists, which instant merged into a violent whirlwind of energy.\nThe storm pulled the Gargantua in, its massive iron body slamming into the ground as the crimson energy tore through its defenses.\nThe iron plates cracked and shattered under the relentless assault, the Gargantua's HP plummeting.\nFWISH…\nAnd when it was almost at the heart of the [Aura Storm]… it exploded.\nBOOOOOM!\n-543713!\nIts defenses were already most shattered from the hits of his soul, so its defense had plummeted.\nThe Gargantua let out one final, pained roar before the storm crushed it completely.\nIts body collapsed to the ground, its once-impenetrable armor shattered into pieces.\n[You have slain 'Wrought Iron Gargantua'. You have gained 2,200,000 experience points!]\nDing!\n[Your level has increased to level 79, granting you four skill points and a boost in stats.]\nStark stood over the defeated creature, his chest heaving as the last remnants of his soul heat gradually seeped back into his body.\nHis heart returned to his body, and the crimson aura around him disappearing.\nHe turned, his eyes immediately searching for Lana. She was conscious, but clutching her side in pain.\nSora was already beside her, healing her wounds with [Regenerative Drop].\nAfter thirty seconds, a single golden drop emerged from a giant flower above Lana's head, the drop hitting her forehead and fully healing her.\n\"+70000!\"\nLana got up almost immediately, the healing abilities of the flowers working wonders!\n[You have beaten the fifth floor!]\n[You are the first team to reach complete the first half of the colosseum!]\n…\nAcross the Capital\nThe sudden notification that appeared in front of all the students—and even the teachers—sent shockwaves through the capital. Every student stopped in their tracks as the message flashed in front of them.\nThey were getting ready to final enter to attempt to beat the first floor with their teammates, some others wanting to relax before risking their lives.\nAnd some crazy fuckers were already halfway done?!\nThe entire academy fell into chaos as students stared at their status screens in disbelief.\nThe Colosseum Trial, a grueling test of endurance and skill, was designed to be a challenge that would push students to their absolute limits.\nA challenge where most teams would take weeks to reach even the third or fourth floors.\nHow in the world had someone managed to complete five floors so fast?\nInside the faculty lounge, the teachers and staff looked at one another, stunned.\nThe chairman, Theodore, sat silently at his desk, his fingers joined as he stared at the notification hovering before him.\n\"This is... outstanding,\" one of the senior instructors muttered, shaking his head in disbelief, \"No team has ever done this so quickly not in… ever…?\"\nTheodore's expression remained neutral, but his mind was racing. Deep inside, he knew.\nOnly two people could have possibly done this.\n\"Stark and Sora,\" he muttered to himself, his eyes narrowing in contemplation, \"It has to be them.\"\nBack to the Trio, inside the safe zone after the fifth floor.\nAs the notification disappeared, Stark, Sora, and Lana were suddenly teleported away from the battlefield.\nThe familiar golden light of the system wrapped around them, pulling them to their next destination: the safe zone at the halfway point.\nThey blinked, finding themselves standing inside a luxurious room.\nIt was vastly different from the others, which all mimicked the harsh environments of the previous floors.\nA table in the center of the room was filled with an assortment of food, drinks, and healing items. Plush couches lined the walls, inviting them to rest.\n\"Wow...\" Lana whispered, her eyes wide with amazement. \"This is... amazing.\"\nWithout hesitation, she plopped down onto one of the couches, sinking into the soft cushions with a sigh of relief. S\ntark, on the other hand, was more focused.\nHe glanced at the healing items scattered across the room, grabbing a few potions and downing them quickly.\n\"We deserve a break,\" he muttered, collapsing into a nearby chair and leaning back, his head resting against the cushions.\nHe didn't even bother questioning why there was such a place in a colosseum.\n[This place only appears to users who complete the first five floor in a row, otherwise it will be a normal room.]\n'Makes sense,' he sighed.\nSora, the quiet one, simply sat on the floor near the table, sipping from a glass of water.\nShe didn't say much, but she didn't need to. Her presence alone was enough.\nFor thirty minutes, they rested in comfortable chatter: Lana and Stark chatted lightly about the trials they'd faced so far, and though Sora didn't contribute much to the conversation, she listened intently.\nDespite her usual stoicism, there was something comforting about being here with Stark and Lana, hearing them speak.\nShe didn't express it outwardly, but deep down, she realized that this was the first time in a long while that she felt truly… at ease.\nSora, who had once felt a bit of jealousy towards Lana for being so close to Stark even though she was 'weak', felt relieved now: that jealousy inside of her disappeared.\nThirty Minutes Later.\nStark suddenly stood up from his seat, cracking his neck.\nHis eyes burned with a deep crimson color, the aura around him sparking to life once again.\n\"Let's go,\" he said, his voice filled with determination. \"I want to get this over with.\"\nSora was already on her feet, her expression as calm and composed as always. She nodded silently, ready to follow him to whatever awaited them beyond the sixth-floor door.\nBut as they moved towards the door, Lana stayed back, hesitating.\nShe fidgeted with her fingers, biting her lip.\n\"Um...\" she mumbled. \"I think I'll just stay here...\"\nStark stopped, turning back to her with a confused expression.\n\"I... I'm just not good enough to be fighting with you two,\" Lana admitted, her voice trembling slightly, \"I feel like I'm holding you both back... and... I wouldn't even be here without your protection, Stark. I'm already grateful for that.\"\nShe looked down at the floor, her face flushed with embarrassment.\nFor a moment, Stark didn't say anything: he didn't know what to say.\nHe tried to open his mouth, but before he could speak, Sora quietly stepped forward.\nSora's hand reached out, gently stroking Lana's hair.\n\"It's fine,\" Sora said softly, her voice lacking its usual coldness, \"You can just wait here. We'll complete the tower before you even realize it.\"\nShe offered Lana a small, reassuring smile, something most people would call an actual miracle, it was faint, but it was enough to make Lana's eyes well up with tears.\n\"...Thank you,\" Lana whispered, her voice cracking.\nAnd at that moment, she too, realized that Sora wasn't a rival, not at all, and so she also lost that jealousy she had with her.\nNow, maybe they could find a middle ground concerning Stark?\nAfterward, Lana gave Stark a quick hug, which he returned, and then she went back to sit on the couch.\nWith that done, Stark turned and pushed open the door labeled with the sign [Sixth Floor].\nThe heavy door creaked as it swung open, revealing the next arena.\nLana stood back, watching as the two disappeared into the arena, the door slowly closing behind them with a heavy thud.\n…\nThe air was thick with tension as Stark and Sora stepped into the massive, circular arena.\nBefore them stood their next opponent: a hulking figure clad in dark armor. Its face was hidden behind a helmet with glowing red eyes, and its body radiated an aura of pure malice.\nThe elite let out a low growl, its hands tightening around a massive sword.\nStark and Sora exchanged a glance, their respective auras flaring to life around them: Stark's crimson and frenzied, while Sora's remained calm and green.\nThe elite shifted its stance, and it almost seemed like it was… trembling.\n\"Gulp,\" it audibly gulped, clearly aware of the overwhelming power in front of it.\nEven though it was an elite, it knew itself that facing these two awakeners was a battle it couldn't win.\nAnd so, the fight began.",

WIELDING CROSS!\"\nHe sent five spears, five crimson fists, and swung his cross three times at the elite.\nLet's just say that it didn't survive even half of these attacks, the wielding cross was just overkill at this point.\nDing!\n[You have beaten the 'Elite Phantom Warrior' from the sixth floor!]\n[Gained 870,000 experience!]\nThe arena was quiet after the quick destruction of the elite phantom warrior.\nThe system notifications flashed before them, but they paid little attention.\n[You can now access the seventh floor.]\n\"Let's go,\" Sora stretched her neck slightly, her expression unchanging, as if taking down a powerful enemy was nothing more than a daily routine.\nStark, however, cracked his knuckles, the crimson glow in his eyes slowly fading as the energy from the fight disappeared, he wasn't bothered either.\nAt this point, level 225 monsters were becoming nothing to them, might as well reach level 300 monsters to make a difference.\n\"We're getting close,\" Stark muttered, his eyes narrowing at the distant door that led to the seventh floor. \"I can feel it.\"\nSora simply nodded, her green aura shimmering faintly around her.\nWithout a word, they both walked forward, heading toward the next challenge.\nKilling the seventh, eight and ninth elites was also a piece of cake to them, all bosses trembling once they noticed who they were facing, and unable to launch a single attack before dying;\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\n[You have defeated the ninth floor elite, \"Pilgrim Swordmaster\", gained 1,200,000]\n[Experience: 4,377,200/4,600,000]\nHe was close to leveling up too, and him being at level 79 meant that he would be able to get a new skill!\nThey reached the FINAL safe zone, which was even more luxurious than the last.\n[Completed all floors (except boss) in a row, incredible achievement!]\nYet again, there were potions and items everywhere to heal them, though they couldn't take them out in the real world.\nBut this time, Stark and Sora didn't even bother to wait around, they just headed straight to the final door, which was black with a skull on it.\nAs they approached the door, the ground beneath their feet began to tremble slightly.\nStark paused, his eyes flicking toward the floor in confusion.\nHe could feel something, an unsettling presence.\nIt was different from the creatures they'd faced before, this was colder, more malicious, yet strangely familiar.\nSuddenly, the air in the room grew thick with darkness, and the temperature plummeted.\nA low chuckle echoed through the safe-zone.\n\"He's back,\" Stark informed Sora as he pointed at the middle of the room, and there was some kind of dark portal on the ground, from it appearing a weird figure.\n\"Well, well, well,\" a voice sneered from that hole, \"Looks like you lots just don't give up, do you?\"\n\"In a safe zone?\" Sora titled her head, even she was confused, weren't safe zones supposed to be… you know… safe?\nBut this time, Stark was able to see the apostle's appearance a little better thanks to the light.\nHovering above the floor, encased in dark, swirling energy, was a red-skinned man clad in tattered, battle-worn armor, with horns on his head, one of them broken.\nHis eyes were black voids, swirling with chaotic energy, and his mouth twisted into a mocking grin.\nIn his hand, he held a jagged spear that crackled with dark energy.\n\"Olikar…\" Stark spoke calmly, not even scared of that thing.\nWhy would he be scared of the apostle he would soon enough kill, anyway.\nThe Colosseum Warrior, Olikar, an apostle of the godless demon.\nHis mere presence was enough to make lesser beings fall to their knees, driven mad by his chaotic energy, and he was one of the commanders of the godless demon, meaning that he controlled one of the larger amount of monsters.\nI'm flattered that you're so excited to see me, really. But you should be more concerned about what's about to happen next.\"\nHis dark eyes flicked toward the tenth-floor door, as if sensing what lay beyond.\n\"The final boss, huh? You two have been quite the amusing show, but do you really think you can defeat what's waiting for you without a little… assistance?\"\nWith a casual wave of his hand, dark energy exploded from Olikar's palm, shooting toward the tenth-floor door.\nStark and Sora watched, helpless to intervene, as the energy seeped through the cracks and disappeared into the depths of the arena beyond.\nThe air shifted again, and for a moment, the oppressive feeling seemed to lessen.\nThen, Olikar turned back toward Stark, his grin widening as if enjoying some private joke.\n\"I've just boosted the power of your final opponent,\" he said with a chuckle, \"You'll find him… much less forgiving than the others. I do hope you survive long enough to at least entertain me a little longer.\"\n\"…You know I'm still gonna win, right?\" Stark raised his eyebrows, \"Just like against all your previous friends, just like against the ape, and just like against all the future ones.\"\nOlikar merely shrugged, unimpressed by Stark's talk, \"Haha… I'd love to see you try, I saw the power you had, there is no chance you can defeat me if you struggled against the ape.\"\nWithout another word, Olikar vanished, his body dissolving into a swirl of shadows that disappeared into the dark hole.\n\"You seem… to know a lot about these things,\" Sora questioned, her face emotionless.\n\"Just look time enemies stuff, you know,\" Stark smiled, unbothered, \"Let's go, shall we?\"\nThey stood in front of the tenth-floor door, knowing that beyond it awaited their final trial: the culmination of everything they'd faced so far.\nStark could feel the intensity of the boss's energy even through the door, it was probably stronger than all other elites combined.\nBut he wasn't scared.\nWith a firm push, Stark opened the door, and they stepped into the final arena.\n…\nThe tenth-floor arena was vast, much larger than the previous ones.\nThe ground beneath their feet was made of dark stone, cracked and scorched as if countless battles had taken place here.\nIn the center of the arena stood the final boss: a towering figure clad in thick, obsidian armor.\nIts face was hidden behind a monstrous helmet, and its hands gripped a colossal sword that crackled with dark energy, the same energy Olikar had used.\n[Colosseum Final Boss: Abyssal Warbringer]\n[Difficulty: Calamity]\n[Level: 250 + 50 (shadow boost)]\n[HP: 1,200,000]\nStark could feel that this thing was powerful, maybe even more powerful than the ape, but he remained focused, his crimson energy swirling around him.\nThe Abyssal Warbringer wasn't scared like all the others though, he just stared at the human, then positioned his bloodied sword sideways, as if ready to attack.\nSora remained calm beside him, her green aura swirling gently around her, though she could sense that this thing was strong.\nThe Warbringer let out a deafening roar, shaking the very foundations of the arena.\nAnd then his sword slammed into the ground, sending shockwaves of dark energy spiraling toward them.\nWithout missing a beat, Stark summoned his [Crimson Soul], the familiar pulsating heart with the eerie smiley face appearing beside him.\nHe gripped the chains attached to it, preparing to attack.\n\"Let's do this.\"",

1,200,000]\n[Strength: 13532 + 5000]\n[Stamina: 12182 + 5000]\n[Speed: 13281 + 5000]\n[Defense: 10462+ 5000]\n[Skills: Warblade of Dread, Abyssal Surge, Colossus Shield, Crushing Despair, Shadow Wave, Calamity Storm, Deathcall Frenzy, Shadow Phase, Malice Burst, Phantasmal Barrage, Ruinous Leap, Armor of the Abyss]\nThe stats alone were terrifying, but with the level boost from Olikar's interference, the Warbringer was effectively level 300.\nBut more importantly: that thing was a tank, a fighter, fast and had stamina, it was extremely balanced across all its stats!\nSora's green aura flared around her, calm and steady as always, \"…\"\nThe Warbringer didn't give them time to gather themselves.\nWith a roar that shook the arena, he used [Shadow Wave], slamming his sword onto the ground to send shockwaves of energy toward them.\n\"Vine Barrier,\" but Sora was prepared, using a new skill Stark had never seen before to summon HUNDREDS of vines, blocking the attack easily.\n'…Oh yeah, I'm not the only one that gets new skills, I'm dumb,' Stark mocked his stupidity as he got ready to continue.\nBut then the monster charged forward, faster than anything that size should be able to move.\nIts massive sword, [Warblade of Dread], was already swinging downward, a blur of obsidian steel aimed directly at Stark.\nStark barely had time to react, his body moving on instinct.\nHis [Crimson Soul] activated instantly, the pulsating crimson heart appearing before him, and he grabbed its chains, swinging it up to meet the incoming strike.\nThe collision sent a shockwave through the arena, forcing Stark's feet to dig into the ground as the sheer power of the Warbringer's attack pushed him back several feet.\n[Your crimson soul has been damaged slightly.]\nIt seems that because the enemy was stronger and dealt more damage, even though he was countering his soul would still receive damage.\n\"Too strong!\" Stark grunted, his arms trembling from the force of the impact.\nBut before he could recover, the Warbringer's free hand thrust forward, activating [Malice Burst].\nA blast of dark energy erupted from its palm, slamming into Stark and sending him flying across the arena, crashing into the stone wall with a sickening thud.\n\"-28471!\"\n\"Stark!\" Sora's voice cut through the air, though still emotionless, but she couldn't afford to help him.\nThe Warbringer was already on her, its [Abyssal Surge] skill flaring to life.\nDark tendrils of energy shot from its body, expanding outward in all directions.\nSora leapt into the air, her green aura flickering as she narrowly avoided the tendrils.\nBut the Warbringer was relentless.\nHe activated [Crushing Despair], and an invisible wave of oppressive energy swept over the battlefield.\nSora felt it immediately—her movements slowed, her body feeling heavier with every step.\nHer green aura flickered, struggling to maintain its strength under the weight of the attack.\nThis attack used one simple power: despair, and to make that happen, he basically made Sora remember the crushing fight she had against the warden.\nShe barely had time to react as the Warbringer's massive sword swung toward her again, the blade moving faster than her sluggish body could manage.\nBut at the last second, Stark appeared in front of her, grabbing two of his [Crimson Spears] in his hands while using the [Spear Block] perk he got at level 10 and meeting the Warblade with a resounding clash.\nThe force of the collision sent another shockwave through the arena, and his two spears broke, but Stark didn't falter, punching the Warbringer away.\n\"-74261!\"\n\"Be careful, we don't want another warden incident!\" Stark barked, breathing heavily as he got in position again after punching the boss.\nSora nodded, her face calm but serious. \"I underestimated it.\"\nThe Warbringer, seeing its attacks blocked, let out another deafening roar and activated [Colossus Shield], summoning a massive, dark shield of energy that enveloped its body.\nIt charged forward, using the shield to ram into Stark and Sora like a living battering ram.\nBut this time, Stark was ready.\nStark activated [Crimson Spears], sending his three remaining spears to intercept the Warbringer, but the shield was too strong.\nThe spears slammed into the shield, but the Warbringer didn't even flinch, continuing its charge.\n\"Move!\" Stark yelled, grabbing Sora by the arm and pulling her out of the way just as the Warbringer's shield smashed into the ground where they had been standing.\nThe impact sent chunks of stone flying in all directions, creating a crater in the floor.\nStark and Sora regrouped, breathing hard.\nThe Warbringer's speed and strength were overwhelming, and its defenses were impenetrable.\nThey needed a new strategy.\n\"I'll distract it,\" Stark said, his crimson aura flaring to life again, \"You go for its weak points.\"\nSora nodded, her green aura pulsing in agreement.\nShe dashed forward, her movements precise and calculated.\nStark followed, his [Wielding Cross] skill activating as the massive crimson cross appeared in the air above him, and with a roar, he swung it down, crashing into the Warbringer's shield.\nThe force of the attack cracked the shield, but it didn't break.\nThe Warbringer retaliated immediately, activating [Void Maelstrom].\nA swirling vortex of dark energy erupted from its body, expanding outward and pulling everything toward it.\nStark and Sora were caught in the pull, their bodies struggling to fight against the vortex's gravitational force.\n\"Damn it!\" Stark growled, digging his heels into the ground as he fought to stay upright.\nThe vortex was too strong, pulling them closer and closer to the Warbringer's deadly reach.\nBut then, he had a sudden idea.\nDidn't he also have a skill similar to this one already…?\nOf course, he did.\n\"AURA SMASH… AURA STORM!\" he summoned his five crimson fists and began to merge them to activate the latest perk.\nAfter a few seconds of being pulled, the attack was ready to be activated.\nFwish! Bang!\nBut before, he grabbed Sora from behind as she was closer and launched her away from the attack's range since [Aura Storm] didn't differentiate between ally and enemy.\n\"AURA STORM!\"\nBoom!\nA storm of energy surrounded both him and the warbringer, surprising him as he was suddenly being pulled toward Stark as well, his body struggling to resist the powerful pull.\nAnd so now that the monster was also struggling, Stark summoned his [Crimson Soul] again, swinging the pulsating heart toward the Warbringer.\nThe heart slammed into the Warbringer's shield, and this time, it shattered.\nThe Warbringer roared in rage, its red eyes burning brighter as it tried to swing its sword at him, but Stark used [Invincible Dodge] several times to get out of the pull's way, returning to safety.\nBoom! Slam!\nOnce the warbringer reached the center of the [Aura Storm], he was suddenly slammed onto the ground, as if the gravitational pull had been massively increased around that area.\n-244813!\nThe Warbringer quickly got up, though, more enraged than ever.\n\"DEATHCALL FRENZY!\"\nThe Warbringer's movements became a blur, his sword swinging wildly in a flurry of deadly strikes.\nStark barely managed to block the first few, but the speed of the Warbringer's attacks was too much: one of the strikes slipped through his defenses, cutting across his chest and sending him stumbling backward.\nAnd then… another attack came rushing at him, reaching his neck.\n\"SHIT!\" Stark's pupil shook: that thing was too fast, impossible to dodge!\nWould this be the end?",

      "content": "Stark couldn't avoid the upcoming attack, but before the Warbringer could land it, Sora darted in from the side, her fists surrounded by spiky vines.\n\"VINE SMASH!\" She struck the Warbringer's exposed side, sending a burst of green energy into his body, and essentially saving Stark.\n-173162!\nThe Warbringer staggered, but it wasn't enough to stop him.\nThe Warbringer turned his attention to Sora, his eyes burning with fury, then he activated [Ruinous Leap], jumping high into the air before crashing down toward Sora with his massive sword.\nThe ground beneath him shattered from the impact, but Sora was already gone, her speed saving her from the deadly strike.\nWhat she didn't expect, though, was the aftermath of the attack as the Warbringer anticipated her movement, and with lightning speed, activated [Phantasmal Barrage], sending a flurry of shadowy blades in all directions.\nSora tried to dodge, but one of the blades hit her, sending her crashing to the ground.\n\"Sora!\" Stark shouted, his heart pounding as he saw her fall.\nWithout thinking, he rushed forward, his crimson aura flaring as he leapt into the air, intercepting the Warbringer's next strike before it could finish her off.\n\"Get away from her!\" Stark roared, slamming a crimson fist into the Warbringer's chest, then slammed his soul downward, hitting him in the head.\nThe crimson fist exploded on impact, then the heart added to the damage, sending the Warbringer stumbling back as he fell to his knees on the ground, clearly wounded from all these attacks.\nSora, bruised but alive, staggered to her feet, her eyes filled with determination. \"I'm not done yet.\"\nBut before she could do anything.\n\"This is it,\" Stark growled, his mind racing as he thought of the one move that could end this.\nHe traced a circle in his palm, his fingers glowing with a soft crimson light.\nThen, he pointed to the sky.\n\"Heaven's Wrath.\"\nThe sky split open.\nFor a moment, everything seemed to stop, the storm, the Warbringer, even time itself.\nThen, with a blinding flash, a beam of pure, crimson energy shot down from the heavens.\nIt slammed into the Warbringer, engulfing the colossus in a blinding explosion of light and energy.\nThe Warbringer let out a final, deafening roar as the beam tore through his body, obliterating him completely, along with his armor and sword.\nThe ground beneath it cracked and shattered as the Warbringer's HP plummeted to zero.\n-472811! -538219!\nThe damage was out of this world.\nBOOM.\nThe beam faded, leaving nothing but a massive crater where the Warbringer once stood.\nDing!\n[You have defeated Abyssal Warbringer, The Colosseum's Strongest (CALAMITY)]\n[You have gained 18,500,000 experience points!]\nStark stood on his legs, firm and calm, as he received the notification.\nThis wasn't as much experience as the [Guardian Ape], but it was still a lot!\n\"We did it,\" he muttered, a tired smile creeping across his face as he fell to his knees, the blow to his side clearly hurt.\nSora, still standing, looked down at him and offered a rare, small smile, \"Yes. We did.\"\n\"Wow,\" she was beaming, and the light from her small, however small it was, almost blinded him.\nDing! Ding! Ding!\n[Your level has increased to level 80, granting you four skill points and a boost in stats.]\n.\n.\n[Your level has increased to level 83, granting you four skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Experience: 877,200/5,000,000]\n\"Phew…\"\nAnd so of course, he got a new skill, which he picked from one of the cards!\nDing!\n[Skill: Revenant's Fury]\n[Tier: Mythical]\n[Description: Only activates after three deaths, have fun!]\n[Description will be revealed the third time the user dies!]\n'Damn,' that skill was talking about death as if it was a game!\nIf it wasn't for his talent that brought him back to life, then anyone would riot over such a useless skill.\nA skill that only activates after death? Seriously!\nSora glanced over at him, sensing the sudden change in his aura. \"New skill?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Stark nodded, his tired grin widening, \"And it's a weird one.\"\nBefore they could celebrate further, a voice boomed from above.\n[Congratulations!]\n[You have completed the colosseum in… the first position!]\nA deep, powerful voice echoed through the arena.\nBut not only: it was broadcasted to everyone in the academy.\n\"DUDE, WHAT?!\"\n\"ARE THEY SPEEDRUNNING?\"\nOther normal students were flabbergasted that the colosseum was completed 3 hours after its announcement, even though they were given 4 months to do so!\n\"Huh…\" even the teachers and principal were surprised, \"Maybe it was too easy?\"\n\"No, sir,\" Breach, the vice-chairman shook his head, \"This is actually one of the most difficult trials in this academy's history, each elite able to stop a group of students by itself, and the mini-boss and boss almost impossible to defeat.\nPlus, taking into account the breaks from wounds, 4 months would not even be enough for most.\"\n\"Then how?\"\n\"…Don't know,\" he shook his head again.\n\"Damn.\"\nIn comparison to the other trial, they wouldn't receive a recording of the fights of the students, meaning that all they knew was that Stark's group had done it.\n…\nThe announcement echoed through the entire tower, obviously, reaching even those that had gone inside after seeing the mini-boss announcement an hour ago.\nIn the safe zone, where Lana waited, the booming voice reverberated in the small luxurious room. Her eyes widened in disbelief, and she stood up suddenly.\n\"Already?\" she muttered, a mix of shock and relief on her face.\nLess than an hour had passed since Stark and Sora had left for the final floor, yet the announcement confirmed it—they had won.\n\"Those two…\" Lana sighed, shaking her head with a relieved smile, \"Of course they would,\" she mumbled as she began climbing the floors now that it was fully safe.\n…\nHowever, as the celebration built, the air around Stark and Sora changed in the last arena, and a familiar, menacing presence descended upon them.\nA slow clap echoed through the arena, \"Impressive... Very impressive.\"\nStark's blood froze at the voice.\nHe had already it twice already.\nTurning around, his eyes narrowed as he saw Olikar, the apostle of the tower, standing before them once again.\nHis black cloak billowed as he stepped forward, his cold eyes gleaming with amusement.\n\"Well done,\" Olikar said mockingly, his lips twisting into a cruel smile, \"You actually managed to defeat the Abyssal Warbringer, I'm almost impressed.\"\nStark's fingers tightened as he summoned his [Soul Heart], his crimson aura reigniting as he stood up, ready for another battle.\n\"If you're here for another fight, I'll take you down right here,\" he spoke.\nOlikar chuckled darkly, \"Fight you here? Oh no, Chosen. You misunderstand.\"\nBefore Stark could react, Olikar raised his hand, and with a swift, terrifying motion, he sent a blast of energy toward Stark.\nThe force of the attack was overwhelming.\nStark barely had time to block before it slammed into him, sending him flying across the arena, his back hit the stone wall with a sickening crack, and he fell to the ground, gasping for air, blood dripping from his mouth.\n\"-59271!\"\n[Stark HP: 5258/93000]\nIt wasn't just an attack—it was a near-fatal blow.\n\"This is all I can do for now,\" Olikar said calmly, as though the near-deadly strike was a trivial matter, \"I can't fight here because of the Colosseum rules, but that doesn't mean I can't teach you a lesson,\" His eyes shifted to Sora, who had already stepped forward, her fists clenched and her green aura flaring.\n\"If you want to fight me,\" Olikar continued, his voice dripping with malice, \"you'll have to find me in my domain: the top of the tower, I'll even give you a hint—it's somewhere within the tower, but you'll need to find the hidden path.\"\nSora moved protectively in front of Stark, her body tense and ready for a fight, but Olikar simply smirked.\n\"Oh, and one more thing,\" he added. \"Whether you reach me or not is irrelevant. You're already too late.\nMaster Godless will soon emerge, and this world will plunge into chaos, so now, it's either you witness the world falling within the next year, or you come to me and I kill you myself.\"\nWith a final laugh, Olikar vanished, leaving only his chilling words behind.\nStark, barely conscious, struggled to get up, but his strength failed him.\nThe blow from Olikar had been too much.\n\"Stark, stay still,\" Sora said softly, kneeling beside him.\nHer green aura wrapped around him, beginning the process of healing, but Stark was already slipping into unconsciousness.\nAs Sora began to transport him back to the safe zone, she couldn't help but feel a rising unease.\nOlikar's words… Godless appearing… what did it all mean?\nWhy were these things even after Stark to begin with?!",

      "content": "Sora carried Stark carefully, her pace steady but urgent, as she made her way back to the safe zone, she didn't know what happened, but it didn't matter for now!\nThe weight of his unconscious body wasn't a challenge for her strength, but she was worried: the usual Stark wouldn't pass out from this, no matter how small his HP pool was!\nHe had survived TWO deaths to save her from Warden after all!\nShe pushed open the large double doors to the safe zone, greeted by the luxurious room.\nBut surprisingly, there was someone inside!\nLana stood just inside, having just arrived from climbing the tower herself.\nHer eyes widened the moment she saw Stark slumped over Sora's shoulder.\n\"What happened?\" Lana asked, her voice filled with worry.\nShe rushed forward, she was always the more emotional one.\n\"We fought a thing that shouldn't be here… or at least, a monster showed up right after we defeated the Colosseum boss,\" Sora explained, her voice firm, \"He attacked Stark. Badly. I had to get him out before… well, you can see.\"\nLana gasped, her hands hovering over Stark's face.\nWithout wasting another second, she grabbed a few potions from the table with the sofas around and sat on one of them as she placed his head gently on her lap, supporting him as she carefully poured the potions into his mouth.\n\"Come on, Stark,\" Lana muttered softly, running her fingers through his disheveled hair as she applied the healing potions, \"Wake up. Please wake up.\"\n[Stark's HP is fully maxed out!]\n\"Sigh…\" she sighed in relief, because if his HP were maxed out it meant that he didn't die, just asleep.\nThe atmosphere quickly recovered afterward, as both girls knew that he wasn't in danger.\nSora knelt down beside them, watching Stark's peaceful face, \"I wonder what he's dreaming about,\" she murmured, her gaze intently fixed on him.\nFor someone who was constantly fighting, constantly on edge, his expression now was serene, almost peaceful, \"So... peaceful, compared to his normal face.\"\nShe extended a finger and gently touched his cheek repeatedly.\nLana giggled, \"Heh~ he's probably thinking about us. Or maybe he's just happy he completed the Colosseum!\"\nBoth of them agreed with their theories, believing them to be true.\nThey couldn't have been more wrong.\n…\nInside Stark's Mind...\nStark opened his eyes, expecting to see the usual dream world: the dimly lit void, the doppelgängers of himself playing or doing whatever to pass the time.\nBut… the space around him was completely black, darker than usual, almost suffocating.\nAnd for the first time, there were no doppelgängers.\nNo sign of the Domination or Alchemist, who usually toyed with the environment.\nHe called out, his voice echoing in the void.\n\"Domination? Alchemist?\"\nBut no answer.\nIt was unsettling.\nWorse, when Stark tried to move, he found himself bound by iron chains, thick and cold, wrapped tightly around his arms, legs, and torso.\n\"What the fuck?\" he sweat a bit, his eyes widening.\nHe struggled against them, but they didn't budge.\nThere were ten chains in total, and they stretched out into the darkness, disappearing beyond his line of sight.\nBut there was more: five additional chains, unlike the ones binding him, lay flat on the ground, pointing in different directions into the void too.\nStark watched them intently, his mind racing to figure out what was happening.\nAn hour after that, an entire hour where Stark was just… sitting idle, waiting for something to happen, anything.\nBut right as he was about to give up, maybe bite his tongue to forcefully wake up… slowly, he began to notice shapes emerging from the darkness, where the chains led.\nTen figures stepped forward, each one holding one of the chains that restrained him, some with their hands, others legs, and some with their mouths.\nHis blood ran cold as he recognized the first few shapes.\n\"The apostles...!\" Stark's eyes widened in shock.\nHe only recognized them because the [Crimson Moon Trio], [Olikar, The Colosseum Warrior], and [The Great Serpent]'s figures weren't covered in darkness, meaning that the other apostles were those he didn't and couldn't see.\nBut for the first time, he could actually make out what they looked like: one of them looked like a giant wolf, another was normal-sized with pointy ears, yet another had giants wings, as big as a dragon.\nThey were all here, and he could see their white eyes looking at him.\nThe five chains that weren't around Stark on the other hand went toward apostles who were currently on the ground, dead: Malakar, Judicator, Sierra, Lother and Reaper.\nWhy were they here? Why were the apostles holding him in place?\nIt didn't take him much more to figure it out.\nBecause then, the ground beneath him shook and the chains rattled as a massive figure emerged from the darkness.\nIts towering form, covered in an impenetrable black mist, loomed over Stark.\nCrimson eyes glowed through the void, piercing him with their gaze.\n\"GODLESS DEMON,\" he immediately shouted, he could recognize him from anywhere.\n\"Oh, wow, you're a fan?\" Godless mocked him.\nWithout thinking, Stark tried to rush forward, his crimson aura flaring, his rage surging.\nBecause if this was his mind, he should still be able to control it, to attack and to hurt that monster!\nBut the moment he moved… the chains pulled tight, stopping him in his tracks.\nThud!\nThe apostles tightened their grip on the chains, holding him back, preventing him from reaching the demon.\n\"You're weak,\" one of the apostles sneered, their voice echoing in his mind, \"You don't even understand the power we wield, do you?\"\nAnother apostle, one with massive wings, leaned forward, a cruel smile playing on their lips, \"Pathetic. You think you can challenge Godless? You're not even close to ready.\"\nGodless took a step forward, his immense presence pressing down on Stark, suffocating him.\n\"You can't fight me, Chosen,\" he said, his voice filled with contempt, \"You're nothing more than a puppet, dancing on the strings I control. And your friends? Your world? All of it will crumble before me.\"\nStark clenched his teeth, his fury building with every word.\nHe strained against the chains, but they held him fast.\nThe apostles continued to mock him, their laughter ringing in his ears, amplifying his frustration.\nGodless reached out a massive hand, its shadowy fingers stretching toward Stark.\n\"You can't escape this. You can't stop what's coming,\" the demon growled, his hand drawing closer and closer.\n\"I'M GOING TO FUCKING DESTROY YOU-\" Stark's aura was about to break everything in this void.\nBut just as Godless's hand was about to reach him, a familiar voice echoed through the void.\n\"Malfunction.\"\nThe world around Stark flickered. The apostles, the chains, Godless—everything began to dissolve into nothingness.\n\"Wake up.\"\nThe voice belonged to Domination.\nHe appeared beside Stark, nodding once before snapping his fingers.\nInstantly, the entire scene vanished, erasing the apostles and Godless from Stark's mind like a bad dream.\n\"Malfunction,\" the doppelganger repeated calmly, \"My bad.\"\nBefore Stark could respond, his vision blurred, and he felt himself slipping back into unconsciousness.\n\"W-What the-?\" He tried to speak, but his mind went blank as he fell, the last image he saw being his doppelganger smiling.\n*****************\nThe code can be redeemed by 10 different users with 10 FPs/user.

      "content": "When Stark woke up again, he was in his apartment.\nThe familiar smell of warm food and the soft light filtering through the windows welcomed him back to consciousness.\nBut before he could fully take in his surroundings, he felt something, or rather, someone, cling to him tightly.\n\"YOU'VE BEEN OUT FOR TWO WEEKS AGAIN!\" Lana's voice rang in his ears as she practically tackled him into a hug.\nSora followed right behind, though not as bold as she just gently grabbed his arm, \"It is nice to know you aren't… gone.\"\nStark blinked, trying to process the sudden rush of emotions, 'Oh yeah, I've been stuck in that void for a while, haven't I…'\n\"Two weeks, heh…\"\nLana nodded, her expression a mix of relief and annoyance, \"Yes! Two weeks, Stark! We've been taking turns watching over you every single day.\"\n\"That's… okay,\" Stark didn't need it, as his aura itself preserved him from dying of hunger or thirst, he had passed out for 3 months at one point after all!\nStark scratched the back of his head, trying to recall the dream he'd had.\nThe apostles, Godless… it all seemed so real.\nBut looking at Lana and Sora now, he couldn't help but feel a strange sense of peace, \"I guess I should thank you both,\" he muttered awkwardly.\nLana smiled warmly, brushing her hair behind her ear, \"Just… try not to scare us like that again, alright?\"\nStark shrugged as he knew this wasn't possible, but inside, his mind was already racing.\nThe void… the chains that stopped him from kicking Godless's ass… the apostles… it wasn't over yet.\nHe could feel it in his bones. And now, there was something he had to do.\nSomething urgent.\nWithout a word, Stark reached into his inventory and pulled out the [Colosseum Token].\n\"H-Hey, what are you doing?!\" Lana suddenly shouted while pulling out from the embrace, and even Sora seemed surprised.\n\"Need… to… do something…\" he mumbled, more to himself than them as he stared at the token, a vortex of aura forming in his eyes.\nThe atmosphere of the room suddenly darkened as Stark woke up, his aura spreading everywhere.\nAfter such a dream, after sensing the power of the Godless Demon, after knowing that he would soon descend, he couldn't stay idle.\nThe quicker he got rid of those things, the quicker he would be able to get rid of Godless, for in the end, only one of them can live.\nThe air shimmered around him as the token's magic began to work, pulling him back into the Colosseum's tower.\n\"You…\" Sora's eyes widened slightly, \"You're going to find 'him'?\"\n\"HUH?!\" Lana was terrified, \"Where is Stark going?!\"\nStark gave her a serious look, \"I have to find the apostle,\" he said firmly and extremely fast, \"If I don't kill him before the second trial ends, I'll never complete the ApostleDex.\"\nAnd with that, he vanished, leaving behind a room filled with the faint glow of magic.\n\"What the fuck?\" Lana was flabbergasted, \"Kill the apostle? The ApostleDex? Did he finally go crazy??!\"\n\"…\" Sora didn't say anything, maybe she understood a bit of it with the information she got until then, but she still couldn't get the full picture yet.\n\":(\" Lana was sad that he left as soon as he got up, \"This s-stupid idiot!\"\n\"It's fine,\" but Sora patted her head, \"I am sure that Stark thinks fondly of you, he will be back.\"\nThese were all the reassuring words she could give, or rather the only ones she could find in herself, as she usually wouldn't say stuff like that.\n…\nStark materialized in the Colosseum Tower's ninth-floor safe zone, his shoes touching the familiar stone ground as the token's magic dissipated.\nThe safe zone was quiet, and it looked just as luxurious as two weeks ago.\nWithout wasting a second, he set off.\nHis goal was clear: find the secret area where the last apostle was hiding, and teach that asshole a lesson by making him eat the ground.\nThe Colosseum Tower was vast, but each floor consisted of one safe-zone and one arena, whether it was big or decent-sized depended on the elite/boss though.\n[No secret areas in safe-zones, by the way,] he was informed, which was good.\nHours passed after that.\nHours where Stark searched meticulously through all ten of the arena zones, but found absolutely nothing.\n\"Maybe… I didn't search hard enough?\" he had mostly just looked around and searched the walls.\nSurely, he would need to look deeper if he wanted to find it.\n[3 months and 2 weeks left!]\nThe secret area was well-hidden, as expected.\nStark gritted his teeth, frustration gnawing at him as the clock ticked down without finding anything meaningful.\n\"Dammit…\" Stark muttered to himself, wiping the sweat from his brow as he stood in the center of yet another empty arena.\nHis crimson aura flickered faintly, reacting to his growing frustration. \"Where the hell is it?\"\nDespite his best efforts, the secret area remained hidden.\nStark paused, staring into the distance, his mind racing.\nWith ten floors to explore, he realized this would take much longer than he had anticipated.\nEven with his speed and determination, the task felt monumental.\nFinally, after six hours of fruitless searching, Stark sighed heavily.\nHe needed to reassess his approach.\nHe had more than three months, so he needed to think about his strategy better, maybe spend one week searching every floor?\nIn the end, he decided to think about it later, and so he reached for the token once more, activating it with a quick thought.\n…\n\"This is annoying…\" he bit into his nail while remembering the structure of all ten floors.\n\"STARK!\" but then he heard a shout beside him, and arms wrapping tightly around him. \"You came back quickly! Did you miss me, perhaps?\"\nStark blinked, momentarily caught off guard by Lana's enthusiasm.\nHe opened his mouth to explain why he had returned so soon but quickly decided against it.\nInstead, he gave a half-smile. \"Yes, I missed you both.\"\nLana beamed, clearly pleased with his response, though Sora, who was sitting at the kitchen table sipping on a cup of coffee, wasn't so easily fooled, \"It is great to see you think so highly of us.\"\nStill, it didn't matter, Stark was back, and for the moment, that was enough.\n\"Of course, anything for my friends.\"\nHe hadn't found any clues for the secret zone, but this sight appeased him slightly.\n'Yeah, be positive, Stark, still more than three months remain!'\nFor now, they had completed the second trial.\nWith more than three months remaining before the next one began, there was literally nothing for them to do except wait.\nNot a single other group had managed to complete the trial yet, and so the trio had time to rest.\nTime began to pass like that.\n…\nEvery day, Stark returned to the Colosseum Tower, spending up to five hours searching for the elusive secret area.\nEach day, he combed through different floors, testing every possible theory, every hint of a hidden passage.\nBut it was slow-going, and after each day of searching, he would return to the apartment empty-handed.\nLana would often ask him what he was doing, her curiosity piqued by his mysterious outings.\n\"Where do you go every day?\" she asked one morning over breakfast, her eyes narrowing slightly, \"You've been vanishing for hours everyday inside the tower!\"\n\"Secret thing,\" Stark replied, his tone casual as he took a bite of his food.\nAnd it wasn't even a lie, he was quite literally searching for something secret.\nMeanwhile, Sora had started visiting more frequently, often staying overnight at Lana's apartment.\nThe two women had grown closer, becoming good friends, tt was a strange but comforting dynamic, and Stark appreciated the calm that came with it.\nEvery night, before sleeping, he would close his eyes and think of the floors, imagining anything he could have possibly missed.\nJust like that, the trio had fallen into an easy rhythm.\nStark continued his daily searches, while Lana and Sora spent their time relaxing or doing their own hobbies.\nOccasionally, Sora would help with cooking, though Stark or Lana usually took over, their culinary skills better suited to the task.\nThe days turned into weeks, the weeks into months.\nAnd then, three months and a week passed in what felt like the blink of an eye.\nThere was now only one week before the trial ended.\n\"Holy shit…\" and Stark hadn't found anything.",

      "content": "Stark stood in his apartment's iving room, his hand resting on the [Colosseum Token] once again.\nHe had searched for months, and while he now knew the structure of each of the floors PERFECTLY, the secret area still eluded him.\nBut now, with only a week left, he had no choice but to give it everything he had.\n\"I'm going inside the Colosseum for a week,\" Stark said, his voice calm but resolute, \"See ya.\"\nLana, who had been lounging on the couch, shot up in alarm. \"Wait what? You're going for a week?!\" she asked, her eyes wide with surprise.\nStark simply nodded, not bothering to explain further.\nHe couldn't afford to waste any more time.\nThe next seven days would be crucial if he wanted to find the entrance to the top of the tower, where Olikar waited.\nSora, who had been leaning against the kitchen counter, sipped her coffee quietly.\nShe could sense the seriousness in Stark's tone and knew better than to question him, \"Good luck,\" she said simply\nWith a final nod, Stark activated the token, his body disappearing into the shimmering light as he teleported back into the Colosseum Tower.\nThis time, he wouldn't leave until he found what he was looking for.\nThe final week had begun.\n[7 days left]\nStark's body materialized in the familiar setting of the Colosseum Tower's ninth-floor safe zone.\nThe dim lighting and cold stone walls greeted him once more as he immediately set off, wasting no time in resuming his search for the secret area.\nFor three days straight, Stark scoured the tower with single-minded determination.\nEach floor, each arena zone, every single one of them was scrutinized, but the secret area remained hidden.\nHe had memorized the structure of each floor perfectly by now, down to the cracks in the stone walls and the patterns of dust on the floor.\nBut none of it helped him find what he was looking for.\n\"What the fuck am I doing wrong…\" Stark thought, it just wasn't working.\nThe pressure mounted as time kept going, and his frustration grew just as much.\nEach passing hour was a reminder of how little progress he had made, and the deadline was getting closer.\nOn the third night, Stark found himself on the ninth floor yet again, his energy more powerful: Stark was so enraged over time about his inability to find the secret area that his aura grew much more powerful.\nHe leaned against a wall, catching his breath, the exhaustion from days of relentless searching finally starting to take its toll as he hadn't rested at ALL.\n\"Dammit…\" he cursed.\nHis body wanted to rest, his muscles sore and his mind filled with bad thoughts.\nBut just as he was about to take a well-deserved break, a mocking voice echoed through the arena.\n\"Haha… not so smart, are we now, Chosen?\"\nStark's eyes narrowed, immediately recognizing the voice.\nOlikar.\nThe apostle emerged from the shadows, his sharp grin yet again visible.\nHis aura was menacing, a heavy pressure that weighed down on Stark's already tired body.\nOlikar then walked toward him, his golden eyes gleaming with malice.\n\"Fuck off,\" Stark said, not even bothering to acknowledge him fully.\nHe was too tired to engage in useless talking to this guy.\nInstead, he turned and started walking toward the tenth floor's safe zone, where he knew there were some sofas he could crash on for a while.\nBut Olikar wasn't done. He kept pace as he followed Stark, his voice mocking.\n\"Thank god you're stupid. But even if you do find me, I'll still kill you, y'know?\"\nStark rolled his eyes.\nOlikar was level 400, a terrifyingly strong opponent, far beyond Stark's current level of 88 (he had leveled up a bit in the mean time, duh).\nStark had focused too much on finding the secret area and not enough on leveling up.\nAnd even after using the [Breakthrough Stone] to reach Gold Rank (which Lana bought for him), raising his skill level limit to 30, he knew that Olikar was a formidable enemy.\n\"Keep talking,\" Stark muttered, more to himself than Olikar, as he continued his walk to the safe zone.\n\"Haha... you idiot,\" Olikar circled him, delighting in tormenting Stark as he walked, \"In less than a year, the preparations will all be complete, and the Godless Demon assault will begin. Your world is doomed.\"\nStark didn't react at first, but Olikar's words made him pause.\nWithout turning around, he raised an eyebrow.,\"Oh? How so?\" he asked, almost sounding bored.\nOlikar looked at him, happy that he fell for the bait, then grinned, \"What do you mean, how? Isn't it obvious, or are you really this stupid?\"\nStark smirked back.\n\"No... How are you going to take over the world when I'm going to kill you before you do that?\"\nThat threw Olikar off, his grin faltering for a moment.\nHe hadn't expected such confidence from someone so far beneath him in power.\nBut he quickly recovered, his sneer returning, \"I'd love to see that. Not that it matters, since you won't ever know where to find me.\"\nOlikar began to sink into the shadows of the ground, his body phasing through the stone floor as if it were liquid.\nBut Stark clenched his fist.\nThis was his chance, he wasn't about to let Olikar get away again.\n\"FOCUS… TARGET SET!\" Stark shouted, thrusting his right arm forward like a gun.\n[Description: You can place a target on an opponent, thus allowing you to observe their movements better and have your crimson 'eyes' always following them, no matter what they do]\nHis aura flared, and a crimson light shot from his fingertips, hitting Olikar just as his body was about to fully disappear into the floor.\n~DING~\n[Olikar has been set as a target!]\nA sharp ping sounded in Stark's mind as his skill activated.\nNow, no matter where Olikar went, Stark would be able to track him, as long as he wasn't out of range.\n~BEEP, BEEP, BEEP~\nThrough his crimson eyes, Stark could see the faint red outline of Olikar's figure as he went deeper underground.\nWithout wasting a second, Stark bolted after him.\nHe followed Olikar's red silhouette down… one floor… then two… four floors… nine floors!\nStark's heart raced as he realized just how deep Olikar was going.\nHe wasn't just retreating, he was heading somewhere specific.\nStark's eyes never left the crimson outline, even as Olikar passed through walls and floors like a ghost.\nFinally, Olikar's figure reached the first floor, darting toward a seemingly random wall before disappearing entirely.\nStark's chest heaved as he reached the first floor, eyes scanning the area.\nThe wall Olikar had vanished through looked unremarkable at first glance, and he was absolutely sure he had searched everywhere in this place, but Stark's senses suddenly told him otherwise.\nFor some reason he didn't know, he could actually feel something coming from that wall.\nHe decided not to take his break anymore, instead searching for the secret area for the next few hours.\nHe knew it was here now.\nAnd suddenly, right as he turned around, right as he finished searching one of the other walls of this place, unsuccessful…\nHe looked back at the wall Olikar went through, and for a split second, no… even less than that, his crimson eyes caught a faint shimmer, a distortion in the air.\n\"…!\" it was so quick in fact that he wouldn't be surprised that nobody noticed it, only doing so thanks to his perception, and even then he himself wasn't sure.\nIt happened for 0.001 seconds, but Stark was so desperate that he saw it.",

Ding! Ding!\n[You have upgraded 'Domination' to level 30 (Gold-Tier Max)!]\n[You have upgraded 'Focus' to level 30 (Gold-Tier Max)!]\n[You have upgraded 'Aura Smash' to level 30 (Gold-Tier Max)!]\n[You have upgraded 'Crimson Spears' to level 30 (Gold-Tier Max)!]\n[You have upgraded 'Clone Frenzy' to level 30 (Gold-Tier Max)!]\nUpgrading these skills weren't even his personal choice, he was just kind of forced, since they were the ones he upgraded the most among all of them!\nAnd with the remaining 4 he had, well, he couldn't do much, so he decided to keep them for later.\n'Well… time to check those new perks,' he smiled.\nDing! Ding! Ding!\n…\n[Skill: Domination]\n[New Perk: Aura]\n[Description: You just get more aura ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯, be happy with it.]\n…\n\"Wow,\" Stark wasn't impressed, but to be honest, Domination's perks were never really that important to begin with, and neither were Focus'.\n…\n[Skill: Focus]\n[New Perk: Flow (Legendary Perk)]\n[Description: Your focus is unwavering, and by focusing on an enemy for 10 seconds, grasping their movements and flow of aura, you are able to see their attacks coming at least a second before they come, though if they attack you while you 'focus', then the 'link' is disrupted.]\n…\n\"Oh,\" looks like Focus didn't let him down after all, this should be useful, but if he wanted to use it he would need to spare time at the start of the battle, since otherwise it is impossible to use.\n…\n[Skill: Aura Smash]\n[New Perk: Fist Spam]\n[Description: Instead of summoning 5 fists to either send them at your enemies or merging them to do immense damage, you can instead decide to separate these fists into five distinct ones too, meaning 25 crimson fists.\nThey do MUCH, MUCH, less damage, but if facing an opponent that requires hits instead of damage, then it is useful to overwhelm them, though do note that these fists cannot stun.]\n…\nPretty good, could have its use, and so he moved on to [Crimson Spears], eager to see what new power awaited him.\nHe had the choice between a LEGENDARY perk or three rare ones this time, but he obviously selected the former.\n[Skill: Crimson Spears]\n[New Perk: Spear of Judgement (LEGENDARY)]\n[Description: You can now summon a singular, colossal crimson spear infused with pure energy (uses up your cooldown, though).\nWhen thrown, the spear locks onto a target's aura and follows them until it hits or is destroyed, regardless of distance or barriers.\nThe spear also pierces through any known defense or shield.\nUpon impact, the spear detonates, unleashing a wave of destruction around the point of contact.]\n…\n\"Wow,\" Stark muttered, clearly impressed.\nA homing spear that could pierce any defense was a game-changer, and even he could feel that this thing would be useful…\nThe Spear of Judgement wasn't just powerful—it was practically unstoppable depending on the amount of aura he had.\nOlikar and the others wouldn't know what hit them, though it did use up all of his cooldown and took a few seconds to charge up, so it had its downsides.\n\"Well, one more and its over for upgrading my skills with skill points,\" he mumbled to himself as he stared at the panel displaying [Clone Frenzy].\nBut when he read it… his eyes widened with shock.\n…\n[Skill: Clone Frenzy]\n[New Perk: The Ultimate Clone]\n[Description: By merging five clones instead of the previous three, the Superior Clone transforms into the Ultimate Clone, which possesses the same strength, abilities, and skills as the original. This clone has the ability to act independently, thinking and fighting as if it were the true Stark.]\n…\nA system notification followed after Stark read the description:\n[Clone Frenzy has reached its ultimate form. This skill can no longer be upgraded.]\nIt was then that the meaning of the [Max Out Core] dawned on him.\nA skill's \"ultimate form\" didn't refer to reaching level 30, 40, or 50—it was simply the point at which no further improvements could be made, regardless of the current level.\nClone Frenzy had hit its cap at level 30, but other skills could go much higher depending on them.\nStark's eyes widened as he realized the power behind the Ultimate Clone.\nEssentially, he could have another \"himself\" fighting alongside him.\nAnd with the new revelation about the ultimate form, he felt a renewed sense of urgency to use the [Max Out Core].\nWithout wasting any time, he put the [Max Out Core] on his palm, activating its powers.\n[Which skill do you want to upgrade to the max?]\n\"Alright… let's see what you can do,\" Stark muttered.\nHe had several skills to consider, but after a quick mental debate, he made his decision.\nHe chose [Crimson Healing], knowing he needed strong support skills if he were to get better later, plus it was the only skill beside [Target Manipulation] that was level 1, making it very cost-effective!\n[You have used the [Max Out Core] on 'Crimson Healing'!]\n[Crimson Healing has reached level 70 (Ultimate Form)!]",

      "content": "[You have used the [Max Out Core] on 'Crimson Healing'!]\n[Crimson Healing has reached level 70 (Ultimate Form)!]\nStark stared at the notification, his eyebrows shooting up. \"Level 70?! What the…?\"\nHe hadn't expected it to jump all the way to 70, but apparently, the [Max Out Core] was more powerful than he'd realized.\nWhat's more, it hadn't just upgraded the skill to its current rank's maximum—it had taken it all the way to the skill's true, ultimate limit.\n\"DAMN IT!\" Stark shouted in frustration. He hadn't realized the core could push a skill to such a high level, \"I could've used it on Domination or Focus!\"\nBut before his frustration grew, the system came to the rescue again.\n[No, you wouldn't have been able to use the core on most of your powerful skills. The core would have broken.]\n\"Oh,\" Stark grumbled.\nHe didn't fully understand how the system worked, but if it said so, then maybe there was more going on than he realized.\nStill, he was curious about the new perk for his maxed-out [Crimson Healing].\nAs a reminder, the levels for classifiers went like this: Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Ascendant, Prodigy, Immortal and Classified.\nLevel 70 would mean having to upgrade your level to [Prodigy] or [Immortal] at least, you can already imagine how long this would take, don't you?\nAnd so, you can also imagine just how powerful the ultimate perk of such a skill would be, right?\n…\n[Skill: Crimson Healing]\n[New Perk: Second Chance (Immortal-Level)]\n[Description: When the host's health reaches zero, Crimson Healing activates automatically, restoring the user to full health instantly.\nThis effect can only be triggered once per day.]\n…\n\"WHAT THE FUCK?\" Stark blurted out, eyes wide with disbelief.\nSecond Chance was essentially a free revival, meaning that with his current talent, he could basically revive himself twice in battle!\nHe couldn't believe his luck.\nThis perk was insanely powerful, even being at the max level a perk/skill can ever be, even above [Godly]: Immortal.\nThis perk meant that even if Olikar or any monster managed to bring him down after being revive his talent, Stark would get a full reset.\nIn a fight against such powerful opponents, that could be the difference between life and death.\nWith his new skills upgraded and his perks unleashed, Stark took a deep breath, feeling his power surge within him.\nHis aura had never felt stronger, his abilities sharper.\nHe was ready—truly ready—to face Olikar.\n\"This is going to be fun,\" he said with a mischievous grin.\nTaking one last glance at the portal ahead of him, Stark stepped through, the swirling energy engulfing him as he teleported to the top of the Colosseum Tower.\n…\nA rush of cold air hit Stark's face as he materialized at the top of the Colosseum Tower.\nHe stumbled slightly, the sudden change in environment disorienting him for a moment.\nThe top of the tower wasn't enclosed like the other floors. Instead, it was open to the sky, the dark clouds above swirling ominously.\nStark looked around, taking in the vast, open arena-like structure.\nThe stone platform stretched out before him, surrounded by towering pillars that reached up very high in the sky.\n\"What the?!\"\nBut his attention quickly shifted when he heard a familiar voice.\nOlikar stood at the far end of the platform, his eyes wide with shock.\nHe hadn't expected Stark to find the secret area, let alone teleport to the top of the tower so quickly.\nOnly minutes ago, he had mocked Stark for being too slow, too dumb to figure it out.\nAnd yet here he was.\n\"COME ON, APOSTLE,\" Stark called out instantly, his voice echoing across the platform.\nHis aura flared around him, crimson light flickering as it surged from his body. He clenched his fists, his confidence renewed, \"LET'S SEE WHO CAN WIN, YOU'VE BEEN ACTING REAL CONFIDENT ALL THIS TIME!\"\nAnd this time… Olikar actually felt nervous, just a little bit.\n\"Flow…\" Stark INSTANTLY activated the new perk of [Focus], focusing on his enemy as the air around him became colder, his eyes zooming on Olikar.\nBut while this was happening, he needed to waste the boss's time, since he could see he was already ready to attack, sensing something was wrong.\n\"Looks like you aren't as smart as you thought you were, heh~\" Stark mocked, though inside he was nervous.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I mean, I just followed you, don't you see the target on your shoulder?\" Stark smiled.\n\"…!\" Olikar looked at his shoulder, thinking the human was lying, but he wasn't, there was actually a target on his shoulder, displaying his position.\nAnd he, the great 'Colosseum Warrior' hadn't even noticed it!\n\"YOU LITTLE-\" Olikar instantly dashed toward Stark, summoning his [Colosseum Sword], which was gifted to him by Godless himself after his victories in the [Demon Colosseum], transforming him into one of the apostles.\nBut it was already a done deal for Stark.\n['Flow' has been activated, now able to see monster's attacks better, keep up with his speed!]\n\"INSTANT STRIKE!\" Olikar used the attack that had won him several battles in the [Demon Colosseum], as his instant strike allowed him to close the distance and attack instantly.\nBut it wouldn't work on Stark, as he saw it coming with [Flow].\nIf he hadn't used it, he would have surely lost instantly, because of Olikar's overwhemingly high speed, which was his strongest feature, but now… they were at equal level.\n\"=)\" Stark moved to the side, avoiding the attack.\n\"Huh?\" and Olikar was so shocked by that, that he actually stopped moving for a split second, allowing Stark to punch him in the head, sending him flying in the other direction.\nBOOM!\n-74628!\n\"…\" Olikar instantly got up, abandoning his confident attitude, instead focusing on getting rid of the human.\nHe was so confident in his speed that he hadn't actually believed for a single second that the human could actually keep up with him.\nBut… he wasn't even at the start of his surprises.\n[Ultimate Clone] was there, and he was ready to use it whenever he felt like it, protecting the clone with his life if needed now that he had two of them.\nPlus… he had [EGO].\n[EGO Meter: 100/100]\nHe hadn't used it all this time because he was waiting for this very moment, and the meter was already full, so if the boss went into a second phase-like transformation, he would use it to destroy it.\n\"How does it feel, apostle?\" Stark asked, the crimson around that came out of him overwhelming even the level 400 apostle.\nNormally, a level 88 fighting a level 400 was IMPOSSIBLE, like actually, even for someone with the [Domination] class.\nBut Stark had four classes, not just one, and his determination and anger level pushed past anything the others could do.\n\"You're getting cocky, human,\" Olikar mumbled, his eyes set on him, \"My shadows will reign supreme.\"\nOlikar was red-skinned demon clad in tattered, battle-worn armor, with horns on his head, one of them broken, his eyes were black voids, swirling with chaotic energy, and his sword was made of that very same aura.\n\"I have fought too many opponents stronger than you to be scared, Godless and the others won't have to think of you anymore once I get rid of you,\" he positioned his sword sideways, meaning that he was now taking this battle seriously.\n\"I'll collect your head and EXP just like all the others, you won't be different,\" but Stark responded by giving an almost impossibly wide smile, making him look terrifying even to the apostle.\nThe battle could now begin.",

You've only caught a glimpse of what I'm capable of.\"\n\"SHADOW CLOAK!\"\nWithout warning, Olikar disappeared.\nStark barely had time to register the shift in the air before the apostle reappeared right in front of him, his sword already slicing down with terrifying speed.\n\"VOID SLASH!\"\n'Flow!'\nBut Stark's mind had already calculated the movement.\nThanks to the [Focus] perk, he anticipated the attack just in time and dodged to the side, but Olikar's sword still grazed his arm, the dark energy searing his skin.\n\"You're fast, but I'm faster!\" Olikar snarled, already following up with a spinning strike that Stark barely avoided by ducking.\nThe air screamed as the blade passed inches from his head.\nBut for the first time, Stark decided to retaliate.\n\"Crimson Spears!\" He summoned a set of spears made from condensed crimson energy and hurled them toward Olikar.\nThe apostle grinned, raising his sword to block.\nBut instead of colliding, the spears vanished just before impact.\nOlikar's eyes widened in surprise.\n\"Spear of Judgement!\" Stark commanded, and a single, massive crimson spear reappeared behind Olikar, locking onto his aura and shooting forward with deadly precision.\nThis was something he had just tried to do: summons his spears, send them toward an enemy, cancel them right before they hit, and right as the opponent is confused, summon the spear of judgement behind them!\nOlikar turned just in time, throwing up a shield of black aura.\n\"TITAN'S GUARD!\"\nThe spear collided with the barrier, but instead of shattering on impact, it drilled through, piercing Olikar's defense and sending him staggering back.\n\"RAAGH!\" Olikar roared, his eyes blazing with fury as the spear detonated, a wave of destructive energy sweeping across the arena.\n\"-342372!\"\nStark barely had time to shield himself with his aura as the force hit him like a freight train, though it did no damage since, well, it was his own aura.\nFor a moment, Stark thought he had the upper hand—until the dust cleared.\nOlikar stood, battered but far from beaten, his red skin glowing with renewed rage, \"Impressive. But you're nothing more than a minor inconvenience.\"\nBefore Stark could react, Olikar slammed his sword into the ground, and dark shadows erupted from beneath him.\n\"Abyssal Chains!\" Black tendrils shot out from the ground, snaking toward Stark with lightning speed.\nStark leaped back, trying to avoid the chains, but one wrapped around his ankle, pulling him toward the ground.\nHe cursed under his breath, quickly summoning his [Clone Frenzy].\nThree clones materialized beside him, each grabbing the tendrils and cutting them off before they could drag Stark to the apostle.\n\"Come back clones, I need you all safe,\" he snapped his fingers, and the clones disappeared as they had done their job.\n\"You're not the only one with tricks, demon!\"\n\"Aura Smash!\" Stark unleashed a torrent of energy, five massive crimson fists materializing around him, then he sent them toward the apostle.\n\"Heh… interesting…\"\n\"FOOL!\" Olikar roared, activating Phantom Blade.\nGhostly blades appeared around him, cutting through Stark's fists with ease.\nThe five were destroyed instantly, their forms dissipating into crimson mist before the remaining blades dashed toward him.\n\"Spear Block,\" he had regained one of his spears from the cooldown and used it to deflect all blades before it crumbled.\nBut as Stark advanced, ready to follow up, he felt the ground beneath him tremble.\nAs if reading his thoughts, Olikar disappeared into the shadows again, using Shadow Cloak to blend into the darkness.\nStark's senses were on high alert, his heart pounding as he tried to track Olikar's movements.\nThe apostle was toying with him, circling like a predator waiting for the right moment to strike.\n\"Where are you?\" Stark muttered under his breath, but before he could react, Olikar reappeared right in front of him, using Spectral Dash to close the distance in an instant.\n\"BLACK HOLE EDGE!\" Olikar swung his sword instantly, a vortex of gravitational energy forming at the tip.\nThe force pulled Stark forward, dragging him into the path of the attack.\n\"NO!\" Stark tried to activate Invincible Dodge at the last possible second, phasing out of the attack's trajectory.\nBut the vortex exploded, sending chunks of the stone platform flying in every direction.\nAnd he was hit.\n-103826!\nHe received the entirety of his health from that explosion, even while protected with aura.\nEven though he had dodged, the shockwave still caught him as he was way too close, sending Stark skidding across the arena.\nStark's vision blurred as his health plummeted. He could feel his consciousness fading, the overwhelming power of Olikar too much to handle.\nIn that moment, everything went dark.\nAnd then… it didn't.\n[Crimson Healing activated, Full Health restored.]\nStark gasped, his eyes snapping open as the system reset his health.\nOlikar's eyes widened slightly as Stark's wounds closed instantly, his body surging with renewed life.\n\"What?\" he spoke, though not scared, just surprised.\n\"Surprise, asshole!\" Stark grinned, his fist already flying toward Olikar's face.\nThe punch connected with a sickening crack, sending Olikar reeling back.\n-164731\nBut Stark didn't stop there as he backed away.\nHe called upon his trump card.\n\"Ultimate Clone!\" he summoned his five clones, then ordered them to stay at the back of the arena to merge while he occupied the apostle.\n\"YOU THINK THIS IS GONNA SCARE ME?\" Olikar shouted, not even bothering to acknowledge the clones, \"FEAR ME, HUMAN!\"\n\"TERROR GAZE!\"\nFwish… Plop.\n[Sorry, Olikar, but fear doesn't work on a \"Domination\" user, at least, not this one.]\n\"FUCK!\" Olikar shouted in anger, \"WELL, THEN…\"\nFwish! FWISH!\nThe air around Stark changed as Olikar closed his eyes.\n'Yeah… keep wasting time,' Stark glanced at his clones, only five more seconds and the ultimate clone would appear.\nBut… who said Stark was the only one that could charge attacks?\n\"COLOSSEUM SWORD!\" he summoned his sword from the shadows, throwing the one he was currently wielding back into the shadow realm and grabbing the new one, far stronger.\nAnd then, without wasting any time.\n\"ECLIPSE BLAST!\" he used one of his godly skills, charging up a beam of darkness that could kill both Stark and his clone instantly.\n[The Ultimate Clone is ready!]\nStark looked beside him, and it was already there, taking up a fighting stance while smiling.\n\"…!\" the clone didn't look that different, though it was smiling.\n\"=)\"\n\"What do we do?\" Stark asked it while pointing at Olikar, who was charging up his attack, even if they rushed at him to try and cancel the attack, it wouldn't work.\nThey were pretty much fucked for sure.\n\"FACE THE WRATH OF THE BEAM OF DARKNESS, NO ONE HAS EVER SURVIVED IT,\" Olikar laughed as he got ready to unleash it.\nBut, suddenly… the clone opened its mouth.\n[Use…. E…G…O…]\nIt was capable of speech!\nThough only a few words, already struggling with those two, but it was able to speak to Stark in battle!\n[EGO Meter: 100/100]\nAnd Stark decided to follow its advice, perfectly knowing why it asked him to summon it.\n\"COME FORTH, EGO, THE DEMON!\"\nAnd so, the giant demon above Stark appeared, staring down at Olikar, who wasn't fazed.\nWith one opponent having a Godly skill charging up and the other a Mythical, just what could happen!",

      "content": "Stark stood firm, facing the apostle, Olikar, whose form seemed to darken the very sky, crimson clouds appearing above.\nThe wind howled between them, but Stark's focus never wavered as the battle between human and apostle reached its critical point.\nHovering above Stark was the manifestation of his inner power: [EGO], a demon formed from his aura and raw will.\nIts giant form loomed like a dark guardian, ready to strike at Stark's command.\nThe [EGO] demon's eyes glowed with the same crimson intensity as Stark's, and the anticipation for what was to come filled the air with a near-electric charge.\nOlikar, in contrast, was unyielding.\nHis [Eclipse] Blast continued to charge, a godly skill capable of erasing anything in its path.\nThe apostle's eyes gleamed with malicious confidence as the dark energy swirled around him, growing stronger with each passing second.\n\"Do you think your demon will make a difference, human?\" Olikar's voice boomed, taunting Stark with arrogance, \"This Eclipse Blast will obliterate everything, demon, clones, and you along with them!\"\nYet Stark remained unfazed.\nHis grin, wide and audacious, only grew more intense.\nOlikar didn't know what was coming.\n~FWISH, DASH!~\nAnd he did something crazy: instead of trying to escape the blast, he rushed toward it.\nOlikar almost believed that he wanted to commit suicide of desperation at this point.\n\"HAHA, THINK THAT THING CAN HURT ME?\" he noticed that giant demon above Stark ready to swing, \"DOESN'T MATTER, MY ECLIPSE BLAST WILL TAKE YOU ALL!\"\nMeanwhile, the [Ultimate Clone] wasn't doing nothing.\nActually, it was preparing the terrain for what was bound to come in the next thirty seconds.\nFirst of all, it summoned the crimson [Wielding Cross] above it, then used [Crushing Gravity] to send the cross in the air, and as Olikar wasn't moving, it was much easier to aim directly aim.\nThen the clone charged up [Aura Smash Merge] to send a giant crimson fist made out of three fists toward the apostle, and finally, it summoned the [Spear Judgement] from the [Crimson Spears], sending it at the apostle.\nAnd to finish all of it, it sent a [Crimson Transmissino Ball] too, creating the small crimson ball in its hands and throwing it.\nThe ball landed behind Olikar, unnoticed by the apostle, whose focus was solely on charging his godly attack.\n[Teleport point set]\nBut Olikar, too consumed with the power of his Eclipse Blast, merely laughed as he saw all the attacks.\n\"Futile! Send everything you have! It's all meaningless! My Eclipse Blast will erase it all!\" His voice boomed with certainty, dark energy swirling faster around his colossal form.\nThe apostle was no stranger to overwhelming power.\nThis skill had been the ace up his sleeve in countless battles within the Colosseum, a place where even the most hardened warriors had fallen to its devastating force.\nIt was a godly-tier ability, one that had earned him the title of the strongest within this tower, and to be acknowledged by the Godless Demon.\nHe knew it wouldn't let him down.\n[Eclypse Blast is fully charged!]\nWith a maniacal grin, Olikar prepared to unleash the destructive force.\n\"GOODBYE, HUMAN!\" he roared, his voice echoing across the tower's top.\nThe beam of utter darkness started to form in his hands, pulsating with raw, lethal energy.\nBut Stark remained undeterred.\nHis grin didn't falter. In fact, it widened.\n\"Goodbye? No… Goodbye to you.\"\nIn an instant, the [EGO] demon that hovered above Stark acted.\nThe massive being clasped its hands together, mirroring its master's intention.\nBoth Stark and the [EGO] demon's eyes flared with an ominous, crimson aura as they prepared to unleash something truly catastrophic.\n\"NEGATE EXPLOSION!\" Stark shouted, his voice cutting through the wind.\n[Description: By using the user's will, he can make his own body errupt and thus negate any ability surrounding him in a close radius thanks to the EGO demon.]\nA shockwave erupted from Stark's body as his aura flared, surging outward in a violent eruption.\nThe small explosion hit Olikar directly, that is one of the reasons Stark got closer after all.\n\"Wha—?!\"\nBefore Olikar could react, his Eclipse Blast flickered, then faltered.\nHis expression twisted into disbelief as the beam of dark energy he had painstakingly charged was abruptly canceled, shattered by Stark's perk.\n[Eclipse Blast has been negated by EGO.]\nOlikar's mouth opened, shock plastered across his face, \"What the fuck—\"\nBOOM! BOOM! BAM!\nBefore he could recover, Olikar was bombarded by every attack the Ultimate Clone had prepared.\nThe [Crushing Gravity] cross smashed down from above, the aura fists pounded against him relentlessly, and the [Spear of Judgment] impaled him with devastating force.\n\"-1,058,213!\"\nThe damage was staggering, and for the first time, the apostle was genuinely hurt.\n[Olikar HP: 434,684/2,000,000]\nHis powerful body, built through centuries of battle, trembled as cracks began to appear on his armor.\nOlikar roared in agony, his massive frame momentarily buckling under the combined assault.\nBut the assault wasn't over yet.\n~SNAP~\nWith a swift motion, the clone snapped its fingers, activating the teleportation it had set up moments before.\nIn an instant, the clone materialized behind Olikar, grabbing the apostle's head in a death grip.\n\"YOU LITTLE—\" Olikar snarled, but before he could even swing his sword to kill both humans…\nFWISH! PUNCH!\nStark's fist came crashing into Olikar's face, the force sending the apostle flying across the arena.\n-125271!\n[Olikar HP: 309,413/2,000,000]\nOlikar's massive form slammed into one of the tower's walls, the impact spreading cracks across the stone surface.\nHe nearly toppled over the edge, his body barely clinging to the crumbling platform.\nThe very ground beneath their feet trembled, unable to withstand the intensity of the fight.\nThe fissures widened, threatening to shatter the arena entirely.\n[Warning: The Colosseum Tower may collapse if you continue.]\nBut Stark didn't care, he was far from done.\nHis aura surged as he charged toward Olikar, ready to deliver the finishing blow.\nThe apostle was battered, bleeding, and for the first time, truly cornered.\nThis was it. Victory was within reach.\nBut as Stark closed in, something changed.\nOlikar's eyes snapped open, blazing with an intensity Stark hadn't seen before.\nThe apostle's lips curled into a savage grin, blood running down his face.\n\"You think… this is the end, human?\" he growled, rising to his feet despite the damage.\n\"Let me show you… why they call me the Colosseum's Strongest.\"\nWithout warning, Olikar's body began to radiate a godly, overwhelming energy.\nHis injured form straightened as the air around him shifted, thick with the weight of pure chaos power.\nThe dark aura surrounding him multiplied, swirling with chaotic fury as his muscles bulged.\nOlikar lifted his sword high into the air, and the atmosphere itself seemed to bow under the weight of his transformation.\n\"BEHOLD!\" Olikar roared, his voice echoing across the battlefield; \"THE COLOSSEUM'S STRONGEST!\"\nWith a blinding flash, his form shifted, growing even larger, his red skin now a deep, glowing crimson, veins of shadow energy coursing through his entire body.\nHis sword, now twice as large, crackled with godly energy, ready to decimate anything in its path.\nStark skidded to a halt, his eyes narrowing as he gazed at Olikar's new form.\nThe apostle's transformation was complete, his aura now nearly suffocating in its intensity.\nThis was Olikar's true power, a form that had earned him the title of the Colosseum's Strongest.\nFor a moment, the two warriors stood still, their auras clashing in the storm of energy that now engulfed the tower.\nStark clenched his fists, feeling the weight of the challenge before him.\nThis was it—the final test. A true battle between a human who had defied fate and a godlike apostle who ruled the Colosseum.\nAnd neither was ready to back down.",

      "content": "Olikar stood in his ultimate form, towering over the ruins of the Colosseum Tower, his colossal sword humming with chaotic energy.\nThe transformation had made him unstoppable.\nHis once red skin now glowed a deep, sinister crimson, veins of dark energy pulsing beneath the surface like the lifeblood of a god.\nHis eyes burned with fury, and his confidence was palpable.\n\"You think you can stand before me, human?\" Olikar's voice was a deep, \"I'll show you the true power of a god.\"\n\"Damn, so many of these apostles consider themselves as gods, it's insane,\" Stark laughed, \"Yet… all of them die in the end.\"\nBefore Stark could even react, Olikar moved.\nHis speed was blinding, far faster than any awakener at even level 500 could hope to match.\nThe apostle closed the distance between them in a heartbeat, his blade raised high, shimmering with a deadly aura.\n\"Die.\"\nThe blade sliced through the air with a sharp whoosh, and before Stark could even process the attack, he felt it.\nAn immense, searing pain flooded his body as Olikar's blade cut through him, splitting his form into thousands of tiny, shimmering pieces.\nHis body shattered like glass, fragments scattering in all directions.\nStark's world went black.\nThe sensation of pain vanished as quickly as it had arrived, replaced by an overwhelming stillness.\nHe was dead.\nIn the endless void, Stark floated, suspended in nothingness.\nNo sound, no sight, no sensation.\nJust darkness.\nBut suddenly, a prompt materialized in front of him, glowing in the abyss.\n[Do you want to be revived?]\n\"Damn…\" Stark exhaled, his voice echoing in the nothingness.\nOlikar had killed him.\nInstantly.\nEffortlessly.\nThe realization hit him hard.\nOn the screen before him, he saw his clone, his [Ultimate Clone], still standing in the ruined tower.\nThe clone was taking a defensive stance, its fists clenched and its form ready, even as Olikar slowly advanced with his Colosseum Sword raised.\nThe clone was buying time, holding its ground, but even Stark knew it wouldn't last long.\nStark clenched his fists, frustration flooding his mind.\nThere was no way to win this.\nOlikar was beyond powerful now, his strength, speed, and aura far surpassing anything Stark had faced before, his current stats matching those of a level 500 monster.\nThe apostle's transformation had made him nearly invincible.\nStark's revival wouldn't change the fact that he was no match for this monstrous foe.\nHis mind raced, thoughts spinning through his head like a whirlwind.\n\"I can't win…\" Stark muttered, his voice heavy with defeat, \"He's too strong. Even if I come back, he'll just kill me again. There's no point…\"\nBut then, something caught his eye.\nHe looked at the screen again, watching the clone try to dodge Olikar's slow, menacing approach.\nThe clone was still alive.\nStill fighting.\nAnd below it was the cracked ground of the tower.\n\"Wait…\" Stark's brow furrowed, realization dawning on him, \"The cracked… ground?\"\nA grin crept across Stark's face.\nAn idea began to form, something wild, something absolutely reckless.\nBut that's what Stark was best at.\n\"I think… I got an idea,\" Stark whispered to himself, \"It's definitely gonna be an 'Execution' if it works though… haha…\"\nThe prompt appeared again, glowing brighter now.\n[Do you want to be revived?]\n[Final attempt, not answering will result in game over.]\nStark's grin widened.\nHe had no other choice. No other chances. It was all or nothing.\n\"YES!\" he declared.\nReality snapped back into place.\n…\nOlikar advanced slowly, his towering form dominating the clone's.\nThe apostle's sword was raised high, ready to deliver the killing blow.\n\"This ends now, human,\" Olikar rumbled, his voice filled with finality.\nThe blade crackled with chaotic energy, its edge glowing as it neared the clone's neck.\nBut then, suddenly, Olikar stopped, remembering something important.\nWhy was the clone still alive if Stark was dead, it should have disappeared if the host is truly dead… right?\nAnd more importantly, hadn't he seen Stark revive himself during the battle with the ape? He had witnessed it with his own eyes!\n\"...!\" A realization dawned on Olikar, and his eyes widened.\nHe turned, his massive frame pivoting just in time to see it happen again.\nStark's body reformed before his very eyes.\nThe thousands of pieces of his shattered form slowly reassembled themselves, each fragment drawn back to the main body.\nHis body knit itself back until finally, Stark stood there, whole and very much alive.\nAnd he was smiling.\n\"You think returning will save you?\" Olikar spat, swinging his sword in a wide arc, the chaotic energy bursting from it, \"You cannot win in this space, human. This is my domain!\"\nStark's smile didn't falter.\nIn fact, it only grew wider.\n\"That's true,\" Stark said, his voice calm, yet filled with confidence. \"I can't win here.\"\nOlikar's expression twisted in confusion, but before he could question further, Stark pointed down.\n\"Let's change the scenery, shall we?\"\nOlikar's eyes widened as he stared at the ground, almost fully destroyed from their battle.\n\"?!\" His mind raced, but he was too slow to react, \"WAIT, DON'T YOU EVEN DARE—\"\nBut it was too late.\nBoth Stark and his clone slammed their fists into the ground beneath them with all their might.\nCRACK!\nThe floor beneath them shattered with a deafening crash, and the Colosseum Tower's topmost platform gave way, crumbling under the force of their combined strength.\nThe ground beneath Olikar vanished, and the entire battlefield changed now.\n…\nFwish!\nBoth combatants fell through the air, hurtling toward the next floor below.\nStark twisted in mid-air, eyes locked on Olikar as the two descended together.\nBAM!\nThey crashed into the tenth floor of the tower, landing hard amidst a storm of rubble.\nStark barely had time to catch his breath before Olikar was on him again, swinging his Colosseum Sword with deadly precision.\n\"VOID SLASH… ULTIMATE!\"\nEvery single one of Olikar's had gained the 'Ultimate' perk once he transformed, making them much more deadly.\nStark dodged, narrowly avoiding the blow.\nOne hit would be fatal, he only had one HP left after reviving, he couldn't afford to make a single mistake.\nThe fight continued, intense and brutal.\nEvery clash sent shockwaves through the tower, the structure groaning beneath their fury.\nWith each exchange, Stark ducked and weaved, landing blows when he could (though they did less than 1000 damage), but always careful to avoid Olikar's deadly strikes.\n[WARNING! WARNING! THE TOWER WILL CRUMBLE!]\nFor some strange reason, one he didn't know, Olikar's movements seemed so much slower than before.\nHe knew the apostle was going at full speed, but maybe thanks to [Flow], or something else he didn't know of, he could now avoid more easily than before.\nAgain and again, they smashed through the floors, descending deeper into the tower, either by the floor finally giving after Olikar's attacks, or by Stark smashing the apostle through the ground.\nBy the time they reached the fifth floor, both were exhausted, their auras flickering with the intensity of the battle.\nIf anyone saw him right now, they surely wouldn't be able to know who was the monster and who wasn't, the [EGO] demon and his clone still behind Stark, both assisting him.\nStark's breathing was ragged, sweat dripping from his brow, but he knew he couldn't stop.\nHe had to push through.\nHe had to win.\nFinally, after a few minutes they crashed into the first floor of the Colosseum Tower, the ground beneath them cracking from the impact.\nStark could feel it: the end was near.\nHis entire body screamed in pain, but he pushed forward.\nHe had one final move, one final chance.\nHis eyes locked on Olikar, who was equally battered, his form flickering as the toll of his transformation weighed heavy on him.\n\"This is it…\" Stark muttered to himself, gathering every last ounce of his strength.\nOlikar raised his sword one last time, his massive frame trembling with exhaustion, but still unrelenting in his fury.\n\"You… can't win…\" Olikar panted, his voice strained but filled with defiance, \"Lord… Godless… will reign.\"\nStark clenched his fists, his aura flaring around him.\n\"You're right…\" Stark said, his voice low but steady, \"But I don't need to win fairly.\"\nStark couldn't do real damage to that thing in its current form, he would surely die before it did.\nAnd so he chose the next best solution.\nStark's aura surged, filling the entire space with a blinding light.\nHis eyes glowed with a deep crimson color as he raised his hand high, preparing to unleash his final skill, a vortex of aura forming in his eyes.\nAll of his power, all of his remaining strength, focused into one moment.\nInto a skill he had never used until now.\nA skill that could either save him, or kill him.\nAnd so… he shouted its name.\n\"BANISH!\" he screamed at the apostle while pointing at him.\nThe word echoed through the tower as the light exploded outward, consuming everything in its path.\nDing!\n[The Banish Game shall start!]\n[Whoever's aura gets consumed by the other will be cast into the void!]\n[Good luck!]\nBoth opponents read that panel, and suddenly… their auras surged from their bodies, clashing against one another.",

I've never seen something like this!\"\nHe tried to dash toward Stark, but his movements were blocked by the strange force of the Banish Game.\nHis body, despite its immense strength, wouldn't respond.\n[Hey! The Banish Game has started. You cannot leave or attack. Use your aura to defend and attack the opponent's!]\n\"HUMANNNNNN!\" Olikar roared, but no amount of shouting would change the rules of this strange game.\nHe glared at Stark, realizing the stakes.\nWhatever trick Stark had pulled, he had to play along now.\nSuddenly, with an earth-shaking BOOM, both their auras collided.\nStark's crimson aura, crackling with raw, destructive energy, surged forward like a tidal wave, crashing against Olikar's dark, malevolent force.\nThe two stood, locked in this battle of wills, neither able to physically attack, but their auras now the tools of combat.\n[You can form shapes related to your skills with your aura in the Banish Game!]\nAs soon as that notification flashed, the battle shifted.\nStark's mind raced.\nHe was the first to figure it out, and so with a determined look, he concentrated hard, imagining a form for his aura.\nThe crimson energy surrounding him suddenly twisted and swirled, shaping itself into a rough doppelgänger of Stark himself.\nThe aura clone clenched its fist and, with a booming impact, slammed it into Olikar's dark aura.\nBAM! BAM!\nThe blows reverberated through the battlefield, pushing Olikar's aura back, causing it to shrink slightly.\nOlikar's lips curled into a snarl. \"YOU THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DO THIS?!\"\nFwish!\nHis dark aura responded instantly, twisting and forming into the shape of a massive blade, mirroring the Colosseum Sword he wielded in battle.\nThe dark energy blade slashed at Stark's aura doppelgänger, cutting through it and regaining lost ground.\nThis was how [Banish Battles] went, a truly… phenomenal thing, you need to gain space by attacking the opponent's aura.\nA whole new type of battles!\nAnd so the battle unfolded, their auras transforming into shapes, representations of their power.\nStark formed his aura into fists, spears, and even tried to mimic a [Heaven's Wrath] to clash with Olikar's dark aura.\nBut Olikar actually fought back, their auras at a fairly same level.\nBut Stark wasn't giving up.\nOlikar was relentless, his dark aura pressing forward with terrifying force, pushing Stark's crimson energy back inch by inch.\nThe apostle's face twisted with rage, \"I AM A TRUE GOD OF BATTLE! YOU CANNOT WIN!\"\nStark gritted his teeth, sweat running down his face as he focused harder, pouring everything into his aura, \"I don't have to be a god to beat you.\"\nHe pushed back with a surge of crimson energy, forcing Olikar's dark aura to halt its advance.\nThe battlefield of auras fluctuated, the balance constantly shifting, but Stark wasn't done yet.\n[WARNING! WARNING! ONE MORE PUSH AND THE TOWER WILL CRUMBLE!]\nTheir auras were destroying the tower, the very foundations succumbing.\nBut Stark didn't care, He had one last trick up his sleeve.\n\"You're nothing but a false warrior who follows orders!\" Stark shouted, his eyes blazing with determination.\nHis crimson aura shifted once more, forming a massive demon-like figure, an embodiment of [EGO], larger than any form he had created yet.\nThe aura demon roared and slammed into the dark aura Olikar had crafted into a grotesque, twisted version of himself.\nThe impact was thunderous.\nBOOM!\nThe clash sent shockwaves through the space around them, and Stark's aura surged forward, overpowering Olikar's defenses.\nThe crimson energy washed over Olikar, consuming him piece by piece.\nAnd then… what had to happen happened: Stark's aura engulfed the apostle, locking him in place.\nOlikar's eyes widened in horror as his dark aura was completely overtaken, \"Huh? W-What?!\" He tried to resist, but it was already over the moment the aura reached him.\n[You have lost the Banish Game!]\n[Winner: Stark Heartsouls]\nOlikar's face twisted in disbelief, \"WHAT? HOW? I CANNOT LOSE! THIS IS STUPID!\"\nOn the other side, Stark was smiling, his face radiating with triumph and malice.\nHe knew it was over.\n\"Adios, idiot,\" he laughed.\nFwish... FWISH...\nCrimson tentacles of Stark's aura tightened their grip on Olikar, dragging him down toward the ground.\nBelow him, a swirling portal of darkness appeared, the gateway to the void.\nOlikar struggled, clawing at the air, trying to resist the pull, but it was futile.\nHe couldn't fight against the overwhelming force of Stark's aura.\n\"No! This cannot be!\" Olikar shouted as the portal consumed him, piece by piece, dragging him down into its infinite depths.\nAnd then, just like that, Olikar was gone, erased, cast into the void.\nDing!\n[You have 'Executed' Olikar, The Colosseum Warrior!]\nStark's eyes widened in surprise.\nAn execution. That meant…\n['Execution' broadcast has been sent throughout the world!]\nThis would surely cause an uproar, but it had been more than 6 months since his last execution, so who cares.\nDing!\n[You have slain 'Olikar, The Colosseum Warrior,' gaining 47,600,000 experience points!]\n[+20,000,000 Execution Bonus!]\nStark blinked in disbelief.\nA total of 67,600,000 experience points from this single fight.\nIt was an astronomical amount, far more than he had ever earned in one battle, and he could hardly process it.\nIt didn't take much more time for him to hear the level up notifications.\nDING! DING! DING! DING!\n[Your level has increased to level 89, granting you four skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Your level has increased to level 90, granting you four skill points and a boost in stats.]\n.\n.\n[Your level has increased to level 99, granting you four skill points and a boost in stats.]\nStark's mind went into 'what the fuck' mode.\nHe had jumped eleven levels in one battle, nearly reaching level 100.\nIt was unheard of.\n\"I-Incredible…\" Stark muttered, his body still buzzing from the aftermath of the battle.\nA level 400 monster (or 500 in this case because of the stat boost, you know) like Olikar had been beyond powerful, but now Stark had gotten everything.\nIt was sooo worth it!\n\"Skill!\" Stark's eyes immediately sparkled as he expected to see the cards appear before him.\nBut…\n[From now only, you will get skills every 20 levels!]\nHe was put on yet another restriction…\n\"Oh well, can't have it all,\" he shrugged.\nBut as Stark caught his breath, he noticed something glowing near the spot where Olikar had been dragged into the void.\nThree shimmering lights floated where Olikar's body had been.\n\"Items!\" Stark smiled as he approached them, he thought that he wouldn't get anything because Olikar's body was dragged into the void, but looks like he was wrong!\nThe glowing objects solidified, revealing three pieces of equipment left behind by the fallen apostle:\nColosseum Champion's Blade: A massive greatsword imbued with Olikar's dark energy. It boosts the wielder's strength by 50% when used in combat arenas or colosseums and grants the passive skill \"Aura Slash,\" allowing energy-based ranged attacks.\nAegis of the Fallen: A legendary-grade shield that generates a powerful aura-based barrier around the user, deflecting incoming attacks. It passively increases defense by 30% and regenerates 0.2% of maximum health every 10 seconds during combat.\nGladiator's Chainmail: An enchanted piece of armor that boosts agility and endurance by 20%. When taking a hit, it has a chance to temporarily increase the user's speed, making them harder to strike.\nPretty good, heh?\nWell, the world said \"FUCK YOU\" to Stark.\n[Class: Warrior]\nBecause only the warrior class could use these three legendary or above items, and guess what, Stark had decided to remove the [Warrior] class from his [Class Wheel] option PERMANANTLY!\nWho's the real clown now, heh?\n\"There's nothing we can do,\" Stark sat on the ground while looking above at the destroyed floors, breathing in and out and able to see the sky from his current position.\nBut these weren't all of the announcements, there was still one as Stark could still see a panel floating in front of him.\nHe decided to open it, and what he saw was quite… shocking.\nDing!\n[As a reward for purging an entire tower, you have been granted a 'Max out Core'!]\nEliminating Olikar meant killing EVERY monster in the tower, so he was rewarded with another [Max Out Core]!\nThe reason no one else was able to get it was because, well, Olikar counted as one of the monsters, and Stark was the only one able to kill him.\n\"Very good,\" the boy smiled mischievously, \"I'll use it later,\" he put it into his [Spatial Inventory] for now.\nThen he sat down and waited, wanting to recover some of his stamina.\nBut of course, the universe wouldn't let him rest.\n[The tower is crumbling, you should really get out!]\n\"Oh.\"",

The next moment, she rushed toward him, hugging him.\n\"You... you're okay!\" she cried, clutching him tightly. \"I thought- I thought you-\"\n\"Did you expect me to stay inside and take it?\" Stark raised his eyebrows.\n\"N-No...\" Lana sniffled, slowly pulling back from the hug, trying to compose herself, \"B-But we saw the whole battle live on TV! We thought you were trapped in there!\"\nStark's eyes widened in surprise. \"Wait, what? The battle was... live on TV?\"\n\"Yes,\" Sora confirmed as she stood from the couch, approaching them with her usual calm demeanor, but there was a glint of relief in her eyes.\nShe smiled softly and extended her arms, as if expecting a hug as well.\nStark didn't know what this gesture meant, as it was Sora we were talking about, and so he put the [Colosseum Token] in her hands.\nSora blinked in confusion, her very small smile faltering slightly, \"You hugged Lana, aren't you going to do the same for me?\"\n\"Oh...\" Stark scratched the back of his head, \"I just... didn't expect it from you, my bad.\"\nHe awkwardly opened his arms, and Sora stepped into the hug.\nUnlike Lana's emotional embrace, Sora's was way calmer and less excited.\nAs they hugged, Sora's cheeks flushed slightly, and she realized how strange this sensation was to her.\nHuman contact... that didn't repulse her, that didn't fill her with disgust.\n'No... disgust...' Sora thought, her mind racing as the hug lingered longer than she expected.\nIt felt... comforting.\nShe had never touched anyone like this before without feeling the urge to pull away immediately.\nThis feeling was intoxicating to her, and if she didn't watch out she could definitely become a 'Stark Addict'.\nStark stepped back, looking between the two girls, \"So... does that mean the whole world saw the battle?\"\n\"Yes,\" Lana and Sora replied in unison.\n\"The TV literally turned itself on,\" Lana explained, \"and your fight was being broadcast everywhere. We checked the forums, and it was the same for everyone. People were forced to watch your battle.\"\n\"Oh, wow,\" Stark muttered, running a hand through his hair, \"That's... special.\"\nHe was thankful that his face had been hidden by his aura for most of the fight, but it was still strange to think that the entire world had been watching him take down Olikar.\nCurious, Stark pulled out his phone and quickly navigated to the forums. Sure enough, the discussions were ablaze with his name.\n[WarriorKing98]: Yo, did anyone else see that dude rip through the tower?! What the heck was that battle?!\n[ArcaneMaster10]: Bro, it was INSANE. That crimson aura was unreal. I can't believe that guy took down an apostle like that.\n[OlikarFanatic]: Nah man, Olikar was supposed to win! This guy came outta nowhere. This isn't over!\n[JustAnotherSpectator]: Did anyone notice how the entire tower just... exploded? If it happened in a city it would soooo over!\nStark smirked, shaking his head, \"Damn.\"\n…\nThe next two days passed quietly, a stark contrast to the chaos of the battle. Stark spent most of his time resting and recovering, though Lana seemed intent on... other activities.\nOne night, Lana made her move, slipping into Stark's bed while Sora was sleeping nearby.\nShe nudged him gently, her eyes gleaming mischievously in the dark.\n\"Hey... want to... have some fun?\" she whispered, her lips brushing against his ear.\nStark turned to her, half-asleep, and frowned, \"You make too much noise,\" he said, rolling over and pulling the blanket over his head.\nBut surprisingly, Lana didn't feel rejected, instead she chuckled, \"If Sora's going to stay here for a while, how are we supposed to have any alone time?\" she teased, poking him in the side.\n\"I don't know,\" Stark muttered, his voice muffled by the blanket, \"Just... not when she's around.\"\nLana chuckled quietly, though she couldn't hide her disappointment, \"Fine, fine. But don't think you can keep dodging me forever.\"\n\"Don't plan to, you're submissive as hell anyway.\"\n\"…\" her face turned red.\nWhat they didn't know was that Sora, who they assumed was asleep, had her eyes wide open, listening to every word.\nHer face was flushed as she lay there, her heart pounding, 'They've already gone this far...?' she thought, feeling a mix of emotions she couldn't quite place.\nJealousy? Curiosity?\nIf Stark had already been with Lana, what chance did she have to... win him over?\nLana was her friend, and yet... the thought of Stark being out of her reach made her think that the possibility of 'stealing' him wasn't far-fetched.\nShe scolded herself for even thinking that way.\n…\nTwo days later...\n[The third semester/trial of the academy starts today!]\nStark, Lana, and Sora hurried to get ready, tension in the air as they prepared for the new semester.\nA new semester in this academy wasn't filled with excitement, just dread.\nAs usual, Stark carried both girls, jumping from a building and landing smoothly past the academy gate.\nThey entered the academy lobby, where a large assembly of students was gathered.\nBut this time, things were different.\nThere were only 2,000 squares set up on the floor, much fewer than the previous trials.\nAnd of those squares, not even half were filled with students: the rest were empty.\nStark, Lana, and Sora stood together on three squares close to one another.\nThe atmosphere heavier than before.\nThe remaining students seemed stronger, more focused, and far more dangerous.\nAt precisely 8:00, the academy doors closed with a loud THUD, and the chairman, Theodore, appeared on stage alongside the instructors.\n\"Beautiful day, ain't it, folks?\" Theodore grinned, his eyes scanning the room, \"You can imagine my surprise when I saw the Colosseum Tower was destroyed by one of you, a true... shocking event.\"\nHis gaze locked onto Stark, the knowing glint in his eyes impossible to miss.\nIt didn't take a genius to figure out who had caused this at this point anyway.\n\"Well, it doesn't matter,\" Theodore continued, clapping his hands together, \"Let's get on with the third and final trial announcement, shall we?\"\nA holographic screen descended from the ceiling, casting a glow across the room as the details of the next trial began to display.",

      "content": "Theodore's voice boomed over the hall.\n\"Congratulations on surviving,\" he began, his eyes scanning the room, \"All of those currently in this room are truly the one deserving of being called Rift Conqueror Students!\"\nThe holographic screen lit up.\n[837 students remain out 1763!]\n\"Holy shit!\" one voice echoed from somewhere in the back.\n\"Less than a thousand...\"\n\"Well, we survived, didn't we?\" another student answer, trying to sound cheerful, though the undertone of anxiety was unmistakable.\nStark glanced around the room, taking it all in.\nThe chatter around him was incessant, but to him, all of these people were just coping.\nDespite the noise, the weight of those numbers wasn't anything special to him.\nNearly 4000 students had fallen between the first and second trials.\nAnd there was still one more trial to go.\n\"Calm down, people,\" Theodore's voice cut through the noise like a blade, his aura spiking to silence the room, \"I know it's scary, but as said before, only the strongest shall survive this academy.\"\n\"…\" no one dared to say anything.\nBut Stark clenched his jaw, biting back a curse.\n'Fuck off,' he thought.\nHe didn't care about the death's either as Lana and Sora were alive, but Theodore's indifferent attitude toward all of this infuriated him.\nIt was as though the deaths and failures were nothing more than a side effect of the academy's grand plan to create the ultimate fighters for the second year.\nThe silence deepened as the holographic screen behind Theodore flickered to life again, displaying a massive leaderboard.\nStark's group, unsurprisingly, was ranked first.\nThe names of the Punkz Brothers appeared second, their obnoxious grins from a few months back playing on his mind.\nAnd third place belonged to Karl Spikeford's group, also expected.\nThe rest of the rankings blurred out in Stark's mind, irrelevant to him.\nTheodore's grin widened as he watched the students absorb the information.\n\"Well… just as before, I guess it's time to introduce your next and final trial for this first year,\" he said, practically buzzing with excitement, more excited than the students themselves for what was about to come.\nThe screen began to change.\n\"But before any of that...\" Theodore's smile twisted into something more devious, \"We shall introduce a transfer student!\"\nAnd just like that, the room erupted.\n\"WHAT?!\"\n\"TRANSFER STUDENT AT THE END OF THE YEAR?\"\n\"YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING!\"\nOutrage spread like wildfire across the hall.\nStudents began shouting over each other, disbelief evident on their faces.\nIt was unheard of for someone to be brought in this late, after the trials had already claimed so many lives.\nHow was that even fair?\nTheodore, however, seemed completely unbothered by the uproar, \"Calm down, my fellow students, you will understand why once you see him,\" the chairman smiled, not caring about any of their opinions, after all he ruled this place.\n\"Never!\"\n\"Let's beat up that guy!\"\n\"He must think sooo highly of himself.\"\nTheodore turned to the screen, and with a wide grin, he finally spoke the name that silenced the room completely.\n\"Welcome… Daniel Pridel!\"\nThe exact moment his name was uttered, the moment the last syllab escaped Theodore's mouth,, the entire room went quiet, all of them, even the Punkz Brother, turning cold and fearful.\n\"???\" Stark was confused.\nOf course, Stark remembered Daniel vividly.\nHe was the first real opponent Stark had faced after reincarnating into this world, a memory etched into his mind.\nDaniel was the one who pushed Stark to spin the [Class Wheel] to unlock his [Domination] class, setting off everything that had happened since.\nBut as far as Stark knew, Daniel had been nothing more than a minor nuisance at best.\nYet the atmosphere in the room told a different story now.\n\"Holy shit…\"\n\"Don't piss him off…\"\n\"Fuck, I didn't think it would be him…\"\nThe whispers of fear spread like wildfire through the remaining students.\nStark was puzzled, turning to Lana for clarification.\n\"Is he that famous?\" he asked, genuinely confused.\nThe Daniel he remembered had been a stepping stone, nothing more.\nLana's expression was serious, her eyes flicking toward the screen, \"Are you serious? Daniel Pridel is… different now. You need to see what he's been doing the past year or so since you beat him,\" she said, her voice low.\n\"What's he been up to?\" Stark asked.\nBefore Lana could explain, the lights in the room dimmed, and the stage was illuminated.\nDaniel stepped into the light, and Stark's eyes widened in shock, his aura almost instinctively making him take his fighting stance.\nThe Daniel standing before them was unrecognizable from the boy Stark had once fought.\nDaniel was muscular before, but now he was a legitimate beast, standing at around 190cm tall.\nHis chest was bare, littered with scars, and his aura was suffocating, while wearing pants that clearly didn't fit his size.\nStark noted the dried blood still clinging to his torso, his unkempt appearance making him look more like a savage beast than a person.\nHis gaze was murderous, and his aura was overwhelming.\n\"Heh.\" Stark couldn't help but let out a small laugh, though he hid it better than back at the first announcement.\nHow the hell did he transform this much? No one really knew.\n\"D-Don't laugh,\" Lana pleaded Stark, \"I've seen articles and even the news refering him as the 'warrior prodigy of today's society'!!\"\n\"And why is that?\"\n\"Well... its just rumors since we aren't sure... but from what I heard all this guy did was fight over and over in rifts, risking his life, yet always coming back stronger, and experts have guessed that he is... at least level 500,\" she sighed, \"At this level, I don't even know if you can take him Stark...\"\n\"Nah, I'd win,\" Stark smiled, confident, though this guy indeed looked strong.\nLana shot him a skeptical look but said nothing. She knew better than to argue with Stark when he got like this.\nOn stage, Theodore continued, \"No need for further introductions. Daniel, take your place on a square and prepare for the third trial.\"\nDaniel nodded once, his eyes cold and focused as he moved to the front of the room, his presence commanding.\nNo one dared speak as he walked past, his very aura sending waves of unease through the crowd.\n\"Well, then let's get to the reall good part!\" Theodore clapped his hands.\nThe screen flickered once more, and the image of a massive dark and crimson hole in the ground appeared\n\"!!!\" Stark's eyes widened in shock, could this be...\n[The academy has worked hard.]\n[They have found this rift called the 'Devil's Abyss,' an extremely dangerous rift they've been trying to unlock for over a year. And now, they've found one of the only two keys in the world to open it.]\nThe screen zoomed in, showing the colossal entrance to the rift, an ominous black wall with a glowing keyhole.\n[Third Trial: The Devil's Abyss.]\n[The Devil's Abyss is a level 250-400 rift from the 'DETERMINATION' difficulty, and yes that might sound crazy, but do not fret, we will NOT be asking you to clear it.]\n[Your mission is simple: retrieve three 'Devil Flowers' located in the second zone of the rift. Retrieve them, and you will successfully graduate your first year.]\n[That is all, couldn't be easier!]\nBut Stark didn't believe them: this seemed... WAY too easy.\nAnd the other students knew it\n\"What's the catch?!\"\n\"Not falling for that, old man!\"\n[The catch is that the rift is difficult and filled with demons to brim, it was detected as one of the rifts with the highest demonic energy ever.]\n[The 'opening' of the rift will happen right after these announcements, you will be teleported to the location where it will happen before your eyes!]\n[Of course, you can choose to leave now, as you will be granted a 'Devil Abyss' token to be able to teleport to the location whenever you want, but you won't be able to witness the opening!]\n[Have fun!]\nAnd then the holographic screen disappeared, leaving the students baffled.\nEspecially Stark though, who's jaw almost dropped to the ground.\n\"That is all,\" Theodore smiled, \"And as our little holo-friend said, we will begin the opening in exactly twenty minutes from now,\" he snapped his fingers, and suddenly the entrance of the school opened, \"Those who want to leave may do so to prepare.\"\nAnd just like that... the third trial could now start",

      "content": "Stark leaned back against one of the walls of the massive auditorium, arms crossed, his gaze flicking between the countdown timer on the holographic screen and his two companions, Lana and Sora.\nThe remaining twenty minutes before the third trial felt like an eternity, especially with the tension hanging heavy in the air.\n\"Seems like they're giving us time to think it over,\" Lana commented, her arms folded over her chest.\nSora, always the quieter one of the group, just nodded.\n\"Doesn't matter,\" Stark muttered, \"We're not backing down.\"\nAnd it seemed that none of the students felt like it either: they had survived two deadly trials, and of course it wasn't a [Domination Trial] level, but it was still difficult!\n\"…\"\nNothing much happened for the first fifteen minutes, and everyone just waited.\nBut suddenly, the atmosphere in the room shifted out of nowhere as Daniel, the one everyone was scared of, suddenly moved, arriving right behind Stark, looking down at the boy.\n\"Holy shit!\"\n\"...What did he do to Daniel.\"\n\"I would piss myself to be honest...\"\nBut of course, he wasn't dumb: Stark could feel it, a presence, like a surge of pressure pushing against the back of his neck.\nHis crimson eyes flickered with a sharp, instinctual awareness.\nWithout even looking, he knew who it was.\nThe room seemed to grow colder, and the chatter of the other students abruptly died down as they all looked at the event unfolding before their eyes.\nLana stiffened beside Stark, her eyes widening as she stared over his shoulder.\n\"Stark, watch out!\" she warned, her voice trembling with urgency.\nEven Sora's usual calm demeanor faltered a bit as she dropped into a defensive stance, her hand positioned as if to use [Vine Smash].\nStark, however, remained completely calm.\nHe slowly turned around, as if the intimidating presence behind him was nothing more than a mild inconvenience.\nHis eyebrows raised slightly, and his gaze locked onto the man towering over him.\nIt was Daniel Pridel.\n\"Problem?\" Stark asked casually, his voice filled with confidence, and his pupils glowing with a burning crimson aura, stronger than anything Daniel was putting out.\nStark could feel Daniel's violent energy trying to dominate the space, but it felt insignificant to him.\n\"...!\" Daniel didn't speak much anymore, but his eyes did widen a bit once seeing that Stark also got just as powerful as he did even though he fought relentlessly in rifts this entire year.\nCould he really lose to Stark, the one that had humiliated him?\nNo, no he couldn't, he would surely destroy that boy.\nAnd yet, when he looked into Stark's eyes, all he could see was chaos, determination and power, as if he had fought and seen opponents a thousands times stronger than he was.\nThe last time they had fought, Stark had been far weaker, yet now, despite Daniel's own terrifying growth, Stark stood before him as though he was an equal… no… as though he was stronger.\n\"You will suffer,\" that is all Daniel muttered, his voice low and filled with venom.\nHis grip on the hilt of his small blade tightened, yet despite his threatening words, there was hesitation in his eyes\nStark's gaze remained steady, unfazed.\nIn Daniel's eyes, he could see a mix of rage, pride, and... doubt.\nIt was almost amusing.\nAfter all the battles Daniel had fought, after all the power he had gained, he was still unsure if he could truly defeat Stark.\nWith a frustrated grunt, Daniel stepped back, abandoning whatever plan he had to provoke Stark into a fight.\nHe turned his gaze away, glancing over Stark's shoulder, and for a moment, his eyes softened into something darker: something personal.\nStark followed Daniel's gaze and noticed Lana standing beside him.\nHer expression was calm, but the way she looked at Daniel carried no fear, just indifference.\nTo Daniel, though, that look must have been a slap in the face.\nStark knew the stories about Daniel's obsession with Lana back in their school days, and it seemed that obsession hadn't faded.\nHe could see how he was looking at him and Lana, and took add a cut to the wound, Stark reached for Lana's waist and got her closer to him.\nThe girl's face turned bright red, but she didn't retaliate.\nDaniel clenched his fists, his jaw tightening, but he said nothing.\nWith a sharp turn, he marched away, moving to the front of the auditorium, his shoulders tense with barely-contained rage.\n\"He's still a psycho,\" Stark muttered under his breath, shaking his head.\n*\nLana exhaled in relief. \"That guy's worse than I remembered,\" she admitted, her voice low, \"He's been in those rifts for a year straight, fighting who-knows-what, and yet... you didn't even flinch.\"\n\"Why would I?\" Stark replied with a grin, \"He's strong, sure, but nothing we haven't faced before.\"\nEven Sora seemed to relax, though she kept one eye on Daniel.\n\"We'll deal with him later,\" Stark added, \"Simple as that.\"\nThe tension seemed to ease as the minutes continued to tick down.\nAnd finally, the timer on the holographic screen hit zero.\nTheodore's voice filled the room again, commanding attention as he stepped forward with a pleased smile.\n\"I guess no one wants to leave,\" he said with a chuckle, \"Very well then. Let us begin.\"\nWith a snap of his fingers, a brilliant light enveloped the entire auditorium, and the room vanished from around them.\nThe next moment, Stark, Lana, Sora, and the rest of the students found themselves standing in the open air, a vast landscape stretching out before them.\nThe ground was completely red, and they could see fire all around them, the trees and even rocks burnt.\nIt almost looked like they were in hell.\nDirectly ahead was a massive hole in the ground, the entrance to the Devil's Abyss.\nIt radiated an ominous energy, a swirling, dark aura that seemed to pulse like a living thing.\nSurrounding the hole was a towering aura wall, etched with intricate symbols and runes, and at the center of the wall was a glowing key symbol: this is where you need to place the [Devil Abyss's Key] if you had it.\n\"Holy...\" Stark whispered, his eyes wide as he took in the sight of the rift.\nThe size of the portal was monstrous, large enough to swallow an entire city block.\nWould they need to jump from here to the bottom of the hole to reach the rift? Because it sure did look like it…\nTheodore's voice echoed through the air, as one of the instructors stepped forward, holding a small, ancient-looking key, the same one Stark had in his inventory.\n\"As promised, you will now witness the opening of the Devil's Abyss,\" Theodore announced.\nThe instructor raised the key, and with a single, fluid motion, he inserted it into the glowing symbol on the wall.\nThere was a loud, echoing click, followed by a deep rumble that shook the ground beneath their feet.\nThe aura wall shimmered, and the key symbol pulsed with light before dissolving completely.\nThe barrier around the rift collapsed, and the swirling vortex within the hole grew even more intense.\nThe portal was now fully open.\nDing! Ding! Ding!\n[The Devil's Abyss Rift has been opened!]\n\"Go on,\" Theodore said with a wicked smile, \"jump inside.\"\nWithout hesitation, students began leaping into the rift, their bodies disappearing into the dark void below.\nStark exchanged a quick glance with Lana and Sora.\n\"Here we go,\" he said, his voice steady as he stepped forward.\nWith a deep breath, Stark jumped into the abyss too, the darkness swallowing him whole.\nThe sensation of falling lasted only a moment before his feet hit solid ground.\n[Welcome to the Devil's Abyss]\n[Level: 250-400]\n[Difficulty: Determination]\nThis is the before last difficulty, right before \"Death\".\nThe final trial could now begin, though for Stark, he planned to reach the very end of that rift and kill the apostles.",

      "content": "The usual rush of adrenaline that followed any jump into a rift was there, but something else lingered in the air, something darker, heavier.\nHis crimson eyes flickered as he took in his surroundings.\nThe red stone ground beneath his feet was jagged and uneven, and in the distance, lava rivers could be seen flowing.\n'Devil's Abyss, heh~' Stark smirked, 'I guess I'm in hell.'\nStark stood up straight, scanning the area for Lana and Sora.\nThey had jumped into the rift right before him, yet now there was nothing, actually, there was no one.\nHe waited a few moments, expecting to hear their familiar voices, or at the very least, the sound of other students landing around him.\nBut the silence stretched on, filling the air with an eerie emptiness.\n\"...Where is everyone?\" Stark muttered to himself, his senses sharpened as a cold chill ran down his spine.\nSuddenly, a holographic message flashed in front of his eyes.\n[Welcome to your doom, chosen one.]\n\"…\" Stark's focus increased by a hundred the moment he saw the words 'chosen one'.\nThe next set of words hit him harder.\n[You cannot leave.]\n[You are stuck here with us.]\n[Come and try to challenge us, chosen.]\nThe gravity of the situation set in, and Stark's smirk faded.\nAnd then it hit him.\n\"The apostles...\" Stark whispered, his hand instinctively clenching into a fist, the three apostles of this rift were here, they were waiting for him.\nThe apostles must have sensed his presence.\nAnd knowing that he would eventually come to kill them here, they must have crafted this trap just for him.\nMeaning that while the other students teleported to the beginning areas with their other peers, passing through its normal challenges, he was in a separate reality—a realm designed by the apostles themselves, much harder.\nHis crimson eyes gleamed with excitement, even as his situation became more dangerous \"Stuck in here?\" he laughed, \"No… you're stuck here with me, idiots.\"\nMeanwhile, in the regular section of the Devil's Abyss, Lana stood up from her landing.\nDozens of students were already scattered across the open zone, preparing for the trial.\nShe looked around, her brow furrowing.\n\"Huh? Where is Stark?\" she asked, her voice concerned.\nSora appeared beside her, her sharp eyes scanning the surroundings,\"He should've landed right after us…\" she muttered, equally perplexed.\nThe two exchanged glances, but neither could see any sign of their teammate.\nBack in Stark's personal nightmare, he couldn't help but laugh more, \"Incredible! Thank you for making the job easier!\" he shouted into the air while spreading his arms, hoping it would reach the apostles from their safe little zones.\nHe had come to the Devil's Abyss prepared to fight alongside his team, but if the apostles wanted to give him this kind of special treatment, then so be it.\nWithout wasting any more time, he took his first step forward, the ground cracking beneath his feet as if even the earth itself trembled at his approach.\nHis crimson aura surrounded him completely, lighting up the dark, desolate landscape around him.\n[Devil's Abyss has 5 zones.]\nThe message appeared briefly, but Stark barely paid it any mind.\nHe was already moving.\nFive zones were more than what a normal rift would have, but that didn't matter to him. He would tear through them, one by one.\n[First Zone: Beginning of Hell]\nThe landscape shifted as he moved deeper into the rift.\nRed, jagged rocks jutted from the ground, and the air grew hotter as he approached the rivers of lava that were spread through the zone.\nIt was exactly what you'd expect from a place named \"Devil's Abyss,\" but Stark didn't care about the scenery.\nHis focus was on the creatures that lurked ahead, each between level 250-300.\nIn the distance, he spotted them: devils and demons, grotesque figures with twisted horns, leathery wings, and glowing eyes filled with malice.\nThey sensed him as well, their guttural roars shaking the air as they charged toward him in a wave of fury.\nStark's smirk returned, \"Come on, then.\"\nAround twenty of these things rushed at him all at once, wanting to get rid of him at the same time.\nWithout hesitation, Stark raised his hand, his [Crimson Purification] ability activating in a flash of light.\nA surge of holy energy exploded outward from him, crashing into the demonic horde like a wave.\nThe demons didn't even have a chance to react.\nThe moment the purifying light touched them, their bodies disintegrated into ash, their screams of agony barely reaching Stark's ears before they were snuffed out entirely.\n-764293! -832717! -743612!\nThe damage was phenomenal, and the shockwave of energy swept through the area, annihilating every demon in its path.\nStark walked forward calmly, the light fading behind him as he advanced deeper into the zone.\n\"Too easy,\" he muttered, shaking his head.\nThe apostles clearly underestimated him if they thought these basic demons would slow him down.\n[Exorcist] was a masterclass of a skill inside such a rift after all.\nAs Stark pressed on, more demons appeared, crawling from the shadows, emerging from fiery portals that opened up around him.\nBut none of them lasted more than a few seconds.\nHis [Crimson Purification] wiped them out with ease, and if it was on cooldown, he would easily use his other skills or fists to get rid of them.\nHe swept through the demons with minimal effort, not even needing the full extent of his power to kill them all.\nMinutes passed, and Stark found himself nearing the end of the first zone.\nAnd eventually, what had to happen happened.\nDing!\n[Your level has increased to level 100, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\nHe had reached level 100, but before he could even celebrate, he heard a loud roar.\nAnd that's when he felt it: a presence far more powerful than the low-level demons he had been fighting.\nSomething big.\nStark stopped in his tracks, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the area ahead of him.\nFrom the shadows, a massive figure emerged.\n\"Oh come on…\" Stark just wanted to check his panels at this point.\nIts hulking form towered over the landscape, standing at least thirty times the height of a normal man.\nIts skin was jet-black, its muscles rippling with raw power, and its eyes burned with an intense red glow.\nTwo enormous horns curled from the sides of its head, and in its hand, it carried a massive, jagged blade that radiated dark energy.\nA message appeared in front of Stark's eyes as the creature roared, the ground shaking beneath its feet.\n[The First Elite Demon Commander: Bel'zar the Ravager]\n[Level: 300]\n[Defeat the zone's commanders to advance to the next!]\nStark's smirk widened, \"Finally, something interesting.\"\nBel'zar the Ravager let out another earth-shattering roar, its bloodthirsty eyes locked onto Stark as it raised its weapon, ready to strike.\nBut Stark didn't flinch, he just took his fighting stance, ready to attack as well.\n\"Let's see what you've got,\" Stark muttered, stepping forward to meet the elite head-on.\nThe real beginning of the [Devil's Abyss] could now start, and from the shadows, the apostles watched Stark's every move.",

      "content": "The battle between Stark and Bel'zar the Ravager began with an earth-shattering roar from the massive demon.\nTowering over Stark, Bel'zar swung his colossal blade, the sheer force of the strike causing the ground to tremble.\nHis demonic energy crackled in the air, and the heat from his presence was almost suffocating.\n\"Perception…\" Stark checked calmly while avoided the attack.\n[Name: Bel'zar the Ravager (Elite)]\n[Level: 300]\n[HP: 1,000,000]\n[Strength: 15,573]\n[Stamina: 8,371]\n[Speed: 19,384]\n[Defense: 14,385]\n[Skills: Demon Cleave; Hellfire Barrage; Infernal Charge; Ravager's Fury; Bloodlust Surge; Shadowstep; Chaos Shield]\nThe battle seemed intimidating at first glance, but Stark stood calm, even as the hulking figure lunged toward him.\nStark had fought tougher monsters, and he knew Bel'zar wouldn't stand a chance against his power.\nFighting [Olikar] had made him so much stronger that even a level 450 monster wouldn't stand a chance, so why do these demons even think they could win?\nUnfortunately, his most powerful ability, [Crimson Purification], was still on cooldown from his earlier encounter with the demons.\nBel'zar roared once more, his blade slashing down toward Stark, but the crimson-eyed fighter was quick.\n\"Let's end this quickly,\" Stark muttered under his breath as he activated [Wielding Cross], summoning a massive, radiant crimson cross that hovered above him, blazing with holy light.\nWith a single motion, Stark swung the cross downward.\nThe impact was cataclysmic, a shockwave of light erupted from the strike, slamming into Bel'zar with such force that the elite demon's health bar dropped nearly to zero.\n[700,000 damage dealt!]\nBel'zar staggered back, his once overwhelming presence now faltering.\nStark gave him no time to recover.\nWith another swing of the [Wielding Cross], the holy energy crashed into Bel'zar, shattering his defenses completely.\n[You have slain \"Bel'zar the Ravager\" and gained 750,000 experience!]\nBel'zar's monstrous form crumbled to the ground, disappearing into ash as his essence was absorbed by the abyss itself.\nThe battle, while seemingly intense, had lasted only seconds in reality.\nStark smirked, satisfied but slightly disappointed, \"I expected more,\" he said, looking at the fading ashes of Bel'zar.\nNone of these things were even a challenge, and the normal demons had only given him about 175,000 experience each, a surprisingly low number considering the rift's difficulty.\nBut in the end, experience was experience. He was growing stronger, and that's what mattered most.\n[You have fully cleared the first zone!]\nThe system notification confirmed what Stark already knew: the first zone was done, and he was temporarily safe.\nNo more monsters could attack him here, allowing him to finally focus on the real prize: his skills and growth.\n[Skill Points: 53]\n\"Nice,\" Stark murmured to himself, a grin spreading across his face.\nAfter clearing the zone and with his recent level gains, especially from killing Olikar, he had earned a significant amount of skill points.\nNot to mention the 11 levels Olikar had granted him, those alone had been a massive boost.\nBut there was something even more exciting.\n[Class Wheel unlocked!]\nIt had felt like only a few days since he had unlocked the [Soul Wielder] class, but in reality, it had already been seven months.\nTime was flying by, and his power was growing exponentially.\nBefore diving into his skill points, he noticed another message pop up.\n[Level 100 Reached: Pick a Card!]\nThis was something he had been waiting for.\nThe opportunity to pick a new skill after being locked in by the twenty-level restriction was a huge milestone.\nIt felt like an eternity since he had gained a new ability that actually worked as 'Revenant's Fury' was… well… you know, it could only be used after he died three times.\n[Revenant's Fury: 1/3]\n\"Five?\" Stark raised an eyebrow as five glowing cards appeared in front of him.\nNormally, there were only three cards.\nEach card glowed with a golden aura, and a holy cross was engraved on their backs.\nStark could feel the divine power radiating from them, like they were calling out to him.\n\"Well, let's see what fate has in store,\" Stark muttered as he reached out and selected one of the cards at random.\nThe moment he touched the card, a sound echoed in his mind.\nDing!\n[New Skill: Holy Infusion]\n[Tier: Godly]\n[Level: Cannot be leveled up, what more could there even be?]\n[Description: The user can infuse their attacks with the power of holy energy, increasing the effectiveness of all offensive abilities on undead being. The holy aura will enhance both physical and magical attacks, causing additional damage to demonic and cursed entities.]\nStark's eyes widened in surprise, then quickly turned into a grin of satisfaction.\n\"A godly tier skill?\" he said in awe, his excitement growing, \"This is my second godly tier skill!\"\nThe first had been [Crimson Soul], which had already served him well in countless battles.\nAnd now, with [Holy Infusion], his strength would only skyrocket further against undeads!\nWith his new skill acquired, Stark moved on to his skill points.\nThe panel appeared before him, filled with his existing skills.\n[Skills: Spatial Inventory; Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv30; Focus lv30; Aura Smash lv30; Clone Frenzy lv30 (MAX); Invincible Dodge lv10; Double Assault lv10; Crimson Spears lv30; Heaven's Wrath lv5; Alchemist lv5; Potion Crafting lv5; Target Manipulation lv1; Dodge Control lv5; Crimson Ball Transmission lv5; EGO lv5; Crimson Purification lv25; Wielding Cross lv10; Crimson Healing lv70 (MAX); The Void; Banish; Domination Soul; Revenant's Fury; Holy Infusion]\nIt was a long list of powerful skills, and with 53 skill points, Stark could upgrade a few of them significantly.\nBut the decision wasn't easy.\nHe could either max out a few of his favorite abilities or spread the points across several skills to get more perks.\nAfter a few moments of hesitation, Stark made his choice.\n[You have upgraded 'Wielding Cross' to level 30 (Gold-Tier Max)!]\n[You have upgraded 'Crimson Purification' to level 30 (Gold-Tier Max)!]\n[You have upgraded 'Invincible Dodge' to level 30 (Gold-Tier Max)!]\nHe decided to focus on his most critical skills.\nBoth [Crimson Purification] and [Wielding Cross] had proven invaluable in battle, so maxing them out to their gold-tier limits was a no-brainer.\nAnd as for [Invincible Dodge], then it could definitely use some enhancement!\nImmediately, Stark felt the surge of power from the upgrades.\n[Skill: Crimson Purification]\n[New Perk: Divine Retribution (Legendary)]\n[Description: When activating your crimson purification, there is a 20% chance that the purification now unleashes a secondary burst of holy energy!]\n…\n[Skill: Wielding Cross]\n[New Perk: Holy Combo (Legendary)]\n[Description: If you swing your strike twice in a row, the third strike will light up the cross with so much crimson aura that it will deal 200% damage and without fail stun enemies for five seconds!]\n…\n[Skill: Invincible Dodge]\n[New Perk: The Ultimate Phantom]\n[Description: When dodging, the user now creates three afterimages that confuse enemies, granting invulnerability for an additional 0.5 seconds, your dodges manoeuver are also enhanced, and you are granted a bigger timeframe to do.]\n[You have truly become the greatest dodger]\n…\nThe perks were nothing short of legendary, as expected.\nStark couldn't help but grin wider as he admired the results. These were the kinds of upgrades that made a real difference in the heat of battle.\nPlus, [Invincible Dodge] reached its ultimate form too, meaning it couldn't be upgraded anymore, much like [Clone Frenzy].\nIt almost… felt sad, knowing that these skills that accompanied him since the beginning had reached their very limit.\nWith eight skill points left, Stark decided to save them for later.\nHe had made enough progress for now, and there would undoubtedly be more opportunities to invest in other skills.\nBut there was one more thing left to do.\n[Level 100 reached: You can now spin the Class Wheel again!]\n\"Class Wheel!\" Stark called out.\nThe wheel appeared before him, just as it always did. But this time, there were only three sections remaining.\n[3 classes available: Magus, Beast Tamer, Incubus.]\nThe wheel had started with ten classes, but now, only three remained.\nStark had already acquired four classes and removed three, so the odds were more straightforward now.\nEach section of the wheel was larger than before, and it seemed like fate was closing in on his next path.\n\"Alright... here goes nothing,\" Stark said as he reached for the lever labeled \"Pull Me\" and yanked it down.\nThe class wheel began to spin, the colors of each section flashing before his eyes.\n\"…\"\nWould it be the magic-infused path of the Magus? The wild, primal power of the Beast Tamer? Or the seductive and dark power of the Incubus?\nThe wheel slowed down, ticking with every moment, as Stark watched with anticipation...",

      "content": "Stark stood before the Class Wheel as it spun, the giant sections of Magus, Beast Tamer, and Incubus rotating before his eyes.\nThe anticipation built as the wheel slowed down, each passing second dragging on like an eternity.\nHis heart raced, though his face remained calm.\nThis was always a critical moment; choosing a class wasn't just about adding new skills or perks, it was about the power gained.\nThe wheel began to slow down further, first hovering over Beast Tamer, then nudging towards Magus. Stark's eyes narrowed, but there was nothing he could do to influence the outcome.\nAnd then... it clicked.\n[You have obtained the \"Incubus\" class! Congratulations!]\nStark blinked, unsure of what to think at first.\nIncubus?\n[You can spin the wheel again at level 150!]\nThat part was new. Before, he had been allowed to spin the wheel every 25 levels, but now the gap was 50 levels. Stark couldn't help but smirk.\n\"Guess the challenges are getting harder,\" he muttered, \"Well, let's check this out.\"\nStark accessed his newly acquired class.\n…\n[Class: Incubus]\n[Description: Control the desires and emotions of others through your allure. You can drain energy from your victims through physical contact, often in combat situations to weaken foes and strengthen yourself. While many of this class use their charm for manipulation or luxury, the true power lies in turning desires into a weapon.]\n[Class Effect: Heightened charisma and emotional manipulation.]\n[Class Flaw: Your power depends on how much influence you have over others. In some cases, strength isn't enough to control a situation.]\nStark raised an eyebrow. It wasn't a class built for pure combat!\nHe could see how that might be useful in certain situations, but his fighting style didn't exactly line up with 'charm'.\nBut then the system interrupted.\n[Domination won't bother absorbing a class that isn't combat-oriented. Just use it for something else, host, if you know what I mean.]\nStark couldn't help but laugh, \"Yeah, not really my thing.\"\nAfter all, Stark gets absolutely ZERO play other than Lana, so yeah.\n[You have been granted a basic skill!]\nStark read the new ability.\n…\n[Skill: Enrapture]\n[Tier: Legendary]\n[Description: Only works on female foes, but you can use that skill to increase your charm and make them lose focus for a bit. Outside of combat, it enhances the user's charm and allure, making interactions more favorable.]\n…\n\"Well, that's... something,\" Stark said, scratching the back of his head.\nHe could weaken opponents just by making them lose focus, which could be useful in larger fights, but overall… it was… mid.\nIt was mainly for 'outside' use anyway…\nSatisfied for now, he pulled up his status window to check his stats:\n….\n[Level:] 100\n[Health:] 103500/103500\n[Bloodline:] Human; Incubus\n[Classes:] Domination; Alchemist; Exorcist (Absorbed by Domination); Soul Wielder (Absorbed); Incubus\n[Talent:] Chosen One\n[Attributes:] Strength 16471; Speed 17362; Mind/Soul 15362; Stamina 11382; Defense 18374\n[Skills:] Spatial Inventory; Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv30; Focus lv30; Aura Smash lv30; Clone Frenzy lv30 (MAX); Invincible Dodge lv30 (MAX); Double Assault lv10; Crimson Spears lv30; Heaven's Wrath lv5; Alchemist lv5; Potion Crafting lv5; Target Manipulation lv1; Dodge Control lv5; Crimson Ball Transmission lv5; Domi-Chains Restrain lvl1; EGO lv5; Crimson Purification lv30; Wielding Cross lv30; Crimson Healing lv70 (MAX); The Void; Banish; Domination Soul; Revenant's Fury; Holy Infusion; Enrapture lv1…\n…\nWith his stats in place and no further distractions, it was time to move forward.\n[Welcome to Zone 2: The Abyssal Caverns]\nStark stepped into the second zone of the Devil's Abyss.\nThe ground was made of black, jagged rocks, and the air was thick with demonic aura.\nThe entire place seemed to pulsate with dark energy, and eerie red eyes glowed in the distance, much more in number than in the first zone.\n\"Damn, going deeper in hell…\" Stark laughed.\nDemons of varying sizes and forms wandered the landscape.\nMost had grotesque, hulking bodies, and their eyes were locked onto Stark the moment he entered the zone; without hesitation, they charged.\n\"Alright, let's see what you've got,\" Stark said, his eyes glowing crimson as he activated Holy Infusion to test the skill out.\nWith a surge of energy, his fists were wrapped in a divine, radiant light that mixed with his crimson aura.\nAll his skills were now infused with the holy aura!\n\"Aura Smash… SPAM!\"\n[Description: Instead of summoning 5 fists to either send them at your enemies or merging them to do immense damage, you can instead decide to separate these fists into five distinct ones too, meaning 25 crimson fists.]\nHe sent dozens of fists toward the monsters, killing many thanks to the explosion that followed every impact.\n\"They're weaker than I thought,\" Stark muttered, watching the demons fall one after the other. He barely needed to exert himself.\nAs he charged through the Abyssal Caverns, more demons appeared, but none of them posed a real threat.\nStark moved like a whirlwind, using Crimson Spears too infused with holy energy, piercing through multiple enemies with each throw.\nThe demons tried to swarm him, but he was too fast, his strength far superior to theirs.\nAnd even when fifty of them all dashed at him, he just exorcised them all with [Crimson Purification].\nExorcist was truly the greatest skill in such a situation, and Stark felt happy he got it early enough to be able to get all those skills with it now.\nBefore long, he received the notification.\n[Your level has increased to level 101, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\nHe pushed forward, hunting down every last demon in his path.\nThe ease with which he smashed them down was almost disappointing.\nHe had expected more from a Determination difficulty rift.\nThen, as he approached the edge of the second zone, he felt it: a powerful aura. This was different from the lesser demons.\nStark slowed down, his instincts kicking in as he prepared for a real fight now.\nIt was the second elite!\nA hulking figure stepped out from the shadows. Its massive horns scraped the ceiling of the cavern, and its eyes burned with malice. Its body was covered in obsidian armor, and the ground trembled beneath its feet.\n[Name: Mal'gor the Obliterator (Elite)]\n[Level: 325]\n[HP: 1,800,000]\n[Strength: 18452]\n[Stamina: 15450]\n[Speed: 20532]\n[Defense: 17024]\n[Skills: Obliteration Strike, Hellstorm, Crushing Wave, Demon Rage, Blood Vortex, Dark Barrier, Void Step]\nStark's eyes narrowed as he read the stats.\nThis was going to be an interesting fight.\nWithout hesitation, Mal'gor roared, charging at him with terrifying speed for a creature of its size. Stark sidestepped the initial attack, his body moving with precision, and he countered with Wielding Cross. The giant crimson-and-holy cross appeared above him, and Stark swung it down with both hands.\nThe impact was devastating. Mal'gor's armor shattered, and his health bar dropped by a third from the first strike alone.\nRoaring in pain, Mal'gor tried to retaliate with Obliteration Strike, a dark energy-infused attack.\nBut Stark was faster, using Invincible Dodge to avoid the blow and land another hit with the Wielding Cross, almost completely draining the elite demon's health.\n\"RAAGRHHH!\"\nMal'gor tried to smash Stark down, but surprisingly, the boy was more focused on something else: his cross was now glowing.\n[Holy Combo is now activated, hit your enemy to cause 200% damage and without fail stun enemies for five seconds!]\nThe demon tried to attack, but Stark swung his cross upward, absolutely destroying the demon's hand and reaching its head.\nBOOM!\n-1,448,482!\nIt was the first time his damage output had gone over 1 million!\n[You have slain \"Mal'gor the Obliterator\" and gained 900,000 experience!]\n[Your level has increased to level 102, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\nFighting hundreds of demons, no matter how little experience they gave, still allowed you to level up!\n[You have full cleared the second zone!]\nWith the second zone now behind him, Stark felt the power surging through him as he grew stronger.\nThe next zones would be even more challenging, but for now, he was ready for whatever came next.\nHe looked toward the path ahead, the entrance to the third zone looming in the distance.\n\"Let's see what's waiting for me in there,\" Stark muttered, a smirk forming on his face as he took his first step toward the deeper levels of the Devil's Abyss, \"Oh wait!\"\nBut before doing any of that, Stark returned inside the second zone.\n\"Ah… there it is,\" he smiled.\nIn front of him were the [Devil Flowers] the chairman had asked him and the students to take.\nHe took 9 of them just in case Lana and Sora struggled, though he was the latter would have no problem, then put them inside his [Spatial Inventory].\nAfter that small break though, he immediately returned to what he was doing.",

      "content": "The third zone of the Devil's Abyss unfolded before Stark like a vast underworld wasteland as now there were even volcanos in the distance, each of them letting out a ton of lava.\n\"Damn,\" it became difficult to even breathe as the smoke and scent hit the boy's nose, but Stark still kept going.\nFrom a distance, Stark could see the new breed of demons awaiting him. Their forms were more grotesque and intimidating, their presence exuding an aura of impending death.\nStark cracked his knuckles, his eyes gleaming with excitement, \"Let's see what you've got.\"\nThe first wave of demons rushed him almost immediately.\nThese creatures were known as Hellfang Brutes, towering figures with thick, armor-like skin and jagged claws that dripped with dark energy.\nTheir eyes glowed a sinister red, and they moved with surprising agility, locking in onto Stark the moment he appeared before them.\nHe was basically intruding hell, after all, wasn't he?\nBut Stark barely blinked as they closed in, their snarls filling the air.\nHe didn't hesitate.\nSummoning his crimson energy, Stark infused his fists with Holy Infusion, combining his own overwhelming aura with divine power.\nAs the first brute lunged, he sidestepped and delivered a single, explosive Aura Smash to its chest.\nThe holy energy coursed through the demon, shattering its defenses and causing it to explode in a burst of light.\nOne down, but more were on their way.\nNot gonna lie, they were taken care of in under three minutes.\nThe next wave consisted of Voidshriekers, winged demons that hovered in the air and spat corrosive black energy from their mouths.\nThey were faster than the brutes, their attacks more ranged, but Stark didn't falter.\nHe summoned Crimson Spears and used \"Spam\" from Aura Smash to aim at the flying Voidshrekers, enhancing each one with Holy Infusion and launching them into the air.\nThe spears and fists tore through the Voidshriekers like divine lightning, burning through their wings and sending them crashing into the ground.\n\"Too easy,\" Stark muttered, his smirk growing.\nAs Stark pressed deeper into the zone, the demons began to grow stronger, and their forms more twisted.\n\"I am the legitimate doom slay-\" Stark tried to laugh, but he was struck by lightning.\n-100!\n\"Damn.\"\nThe next set of enemies was a terrifying hybrid of the previous ones: Hellshriek Berserkers.\nThese demons were both large and fast, their bodies covered in thick plates of armor, while wings allowed them to dash across the battlefield in quick bursts.\nThey wielded massive, molten swords, each swing powerful enough to split the ground.\nStark darted between them, his movements a blur as he dodged their attacks with ease, using Invincible Dodge to weave in and out of their strikes.\nWhen the opportunity presented itself, he would land a devastating blow ismply by using his fists, two to three punches enough to kill them.\nDespite their increased strength and speed, they were no match for him.\n[Your level has increased to level 103, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\nThe sound of his leveling up didn't surprise Stark anymore as, well, he was killing hundreds of demons at this point.\nThe third zone was actually the one that introduced the highest amount of demon types, advancing one after the other toward him.\nWhen he reached the edge, there was a massive horde of them, at least 500, from each and every type waiting for him.\n\"Kill… human…\"\n\"KILL! KILL! KILL!\"\n\"We got the human!\"\nAll of them looked like they were waiting to ambush him, but Stark wasn't scared.\nHe wiped some of the blood on his face with his finger and looked at them with a smile.\n\"Alright, let's see who's going to go.\"\n10 minutes later, all of the demons were dead.\n[Your level has increased to level 104, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Your level has increased to level 105, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\nBut as he defeated the last of the demons, the ground trembled beneath him, signaling the approach of something much larger.\nStark braced himself, eyes scanning the horizon as the final creature of the zone appeared—an enormous, fire-spewing Dread Infernal.\nThe Dread Infernal stood at least twenty feet tall, its body wreathed in hellfire, and its hands crackling with molten energy.\nIt stomped forward with thunderous steps, its gaze locking onto Stark with an intensity that sent ripples through the air.\nDespite its terrifying appearance, Stark was unfazed.\n\"Not gonna lie, dude, if you were smart you would have come while your teammates were ambushing me,\" Stark spoke, though he didn't know if that thing could understand him.\nWith a surge of energy, Stark charged at the Dread Infernal, dodging its initial barrage of fireballs.\nHe closed the distance and summoned his [Wielding Cross] AGAIN, and slammed the massive crimson-and-holy cross down on the demon's fiery body.\nThe blow caused the Dread Infernal to stagger, chunks of molten rock breaking off its form as it roared in pain.\nThe battle was fierce, with the Dread Infernal launching wave after wave of projectiles and energy at Stark, forcing him to dodge with precision.\nBut Stark with a single movement of his hands summoned the [Spear of Judgement], which followed the elite around and drilled into its body, killing it instantly.\n-938,372!\n[You have slain the Dread Infernal! You gained 1,200,000 experience!]\n[You have full cleared the third zone!]\n[Zone 4: The Hellforge Plateau]\nThis zone wasn't even that hard compared to the last one to be honest, it was pretty much the same demons except for the introduction of another type: the Hellforge Guardians.\nThey were monstrous golems made of molten metal, with burning swords the size of a small building.\nTheir bodies glowed with the heat of a forge, and each step they took left behind a trail of molten lava. The heat in the air was intense, but Stark didn't flinch.\nHe dodged their swings with Invincible Dodge and retaliated with Aura Smash, each strike infused with his holy energy, cracking through their defenses.\nAt this point, there wasn't even a point of using any skills beside [Aura Smash] and [Crimson Spears] (infused with Holy Infusion), as well as [Crimson Purification] and [Wielding Cross].\nThe battle was longer, but Stark's skills and power were overwhelming.\nOne by one, the Hellforge Guardians fell, their bodies crumbling into molten debris.\n[Your level has increased to level 106, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\nDespite the ever-growing strength of the demons, Stark continued pushing through.\nThe fourth zone was challenging, but Stark cleared it with relentless efficiency.\nCrimson Purification was still his most effective weapon, but even when the demons resisted, he adapted, combining his skills to break through their defenses.\nThe elite wasn't even a challenge to be honest, as he just used [Holy Combo] from [Wielding Cross] to kill it on the third strike.\nAnd so, he moved to the fifth and final zone.\n[Zone 5: The Abyssal Core]\nAs he entered the fifth zone, Stark could feel the energy shift.\n\"Blah blah whatever,\" Stark sighed as he killed a demon after the other.\nHe even encountered a new type of demons! Woohoo!\nThe Abyssal Fiends were huge, hulking demons with glowing red veins all over their bodies.\nThey were also fodder to his holy attacks, though, not that different from the others in that regard.\nAnd then, as he reached the heart of the zone, he came face to face with the final boss\n[Name: First Abyss Commander, Vorak the Destroyer (Calamity)]\n[Level: 400]\n[HP: 2,300,000]\n\"Foolish human, don't you realize that even defeating all these demons is nothing?\" Vorak laughed, \"For I am the strongest of the abyss!\"\nVorak stood towering above Stark, his body covered in jagged spikes and molten armor.\nHis eyes glowed with a deep, crimson light, and he let out a thunderous roar as he swung his massive, lava-forged axe toward Stark.\nThe battle was brutal, Vorak's hits causing shockwaves with every swing.\nStark dodged most of them, but when he tried to dash toward him to the boss to take it down with his fists, an axe swing took him off guard.\n\"Flash Axe,\" Vorak used his skill, launching an INSTANTANEOUS attack.\n\"Damn, you're tougher than the others,\" Stark muttered, but his smile didn't fade.\nCrimson Purification… PROTECTION BURST!\n[Upon activating this perk, a powerful aura of holy energy envelops the user, shielding him from the attacks of undead creatures for a brief 10-second window. During this time, any undead assaults against him are reduced by a staggering 95% in damage.]\nBOOM!\nHe was slammed by the axe, but received only 743point of damage, which was quite literally nothing.\n\"Huh,\" Vorak was confused, but before he could even say something else, the crimson cross already hit him.\n[You have slain \"Vorak the Destroyer\"! You gained 3,800,000 experience!]\nAs the giant demon crumbled, Stark stood victorious, unharmed.\n[Congratulations, you have completed the 'Devil's Abyss!']\nAnd as Vorak was technically the final boss of the rift, then the panel appeared.\n\"Yeah, no,\" but Stark wasn't convinced.\nIt was just like the colosseum: surely there was somewhere where he could find the apostles, the three probably looking and laughing at him right now.\nBut as the giant demon crumbled, Stark stood victorious, his body bruised but his spirit unbroken.\nIn front of him, a path revealed itself, but it was locked, a glowing symbol of a key hovering over it.\n\"...\" Stark smiled, realizing that this was where he needed to go.",

It seemed to represent death itself, the aura cold and foreboding, sending a chill down Stark's spine.\n\"Hm…\" Stark muttered to himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.\nThe whole setup reminded him of the first Domination trial, where he had to defeat the guardians before battling the Mirror Master.\nBut there was a difference now: he had grown far stronger, had faced down an apostle stronger than they are, and even crushed Olikar.\n\"If it's like that trial, this should be a piece of cake,\" Stark said confidently, cracking his knuckles, \"I mean, Olikar was level 400 and in his final form was more like a level 500, so—\"\nHe didn't get to finish his thought.\nIn an instant, the three doors glowed fiercely, and three figures materialized in front of him, each resembling the carvings on the doors.\nThe first one was the demonic figure, tall and imposing, his skin a charred black, horns curling back from his skull.\nHis burning eyes narrowed as he looked at Stark, exuding an aura of immense power.\n\"Hm…\" the demon rumbled, his deep voice reverberating in the chamber, \"It seems he's really here.\"\nBeside him stood Cerberus, or at least a monstrous, fiery manifestation of it.\nThe three-headed beast growled, its massive form bristling with demonic energy, each of its heads snarling in unison as its eyes locked onto Stark.\nAnd finally, the skeletal figure, draped in tattered robes, floated silently.\nHis glowing eyes flickered with an eerie light as he gave Stark a chilling smile.\n\"Heh,\" the skeletal figure chuckled, \"The chosen one himself.\"\nStark sized them up quickly, his confidence unwavering, \"Alright,\" he said, taking a fighting stance, \"I'll take you all one by one. Let's get this over with.\"\nThe apostles exchanged glances before they all burst into laughter, their voices echoing in the vast chamber.\n\"Foolish mortal,\" the demon said with a grin, \"Do you really think we'll fight you one by one?\"\nWith a single snap of his fingers, the entire chamber rumbled, and the three doors that Stark had assumed were individual entrances began to merge.\nThe stone groaned and cracked as they fused into one massive, towering gateway, with all three apostles' faces now carved into its frame, their malevolent visages glaring down at him.\nStark cursed under his breath, \"Damn.\"\nFighting them one-on-one had been his plan, and he had been certain he could handle each apostle separately.\nBut if they were joining forces, this was going to be much more difficult.\nThree apostles fighting together meant their combined power would exceed even that of Olikar.\nFor a moment, Stark considered retreating, maybe waiting to grow stronger.\nBut then he remembered something important: there was no way out. as he was stuck in the apostles' trap.\nAll the monsters in the previous zones were dead, and this was the only path forward.\n\"Oh, well,\" Stark sighed, rolling his shoulders, \"Guess I'm going through.\"\nHe stepped toward the door, the energy around it thick and oppressive.\nThe three apostles, their spectral forms still standing before him, watched with twisted smiles as he approached.\nThe air crackled with dark energy, and as Stark placed his hand on the door, a series of system panels appeared around him, flashing ominous messages.\n[The Apostles of Hell have been awakened.]\n[Proceed at your own risk.]\n[Do you still wish to continue?]\nStark grinned at the last message, \"Like I have a choice.\"\nHe pressed forward, and the door slowly began to open, grinding against the stone with a deafening sound.\nFlames erupted from the edges as the entrance to Hell revealed itself.\nA massive chamber lay beyond, its size immeasurable, filled with rivers of lava and jagged mountains of black stone.\nAnd in the distance, he could see them.\n[Final Destination: Hell]\n[Good luck!]\nThe three apostles—now in their true forms—stood at the far end of the chamber, their eyes locked onto Stark as he approached.\nThe demon from the first door, now revealed as Valgorth the Desolator, cracked his knuckles, his charred skin smoldering with embers.\nHis presence alone seemed to distort the space around him, making the air heavy and hard to breathe.\nBeside him, Cerberus, the massive three-headed beast, growled low, each head snapping and snarling with anticipation.\nIts body was covered in molten chains, each link glowing red-hot, and lava dripped from its jaws, sizzling as it hit the ground.\nAnd finally, the skeletal figure, now revealed as Malthus the Death Devil, hovered silently, his tattered robes billowing in a non-existent wind.\nHe gripped a massive scythe, its blade glowing with a sickly green light that radiated death and decay.\nStark paused for a moment, taking in the sight before him.\nHe had fought through countless demons, defeated apostles, and now, the culmination of his journey in the Devil's Abyss was right in front of him.\n\"Well,\" Stark said, cracking his neck, \"time to show you guys why I'm not to be messed with.\"\nWithout another word, he surged forward, his aura flaring as he activated Holy Infusion.\nHis body lit up with divine energy, and he summoned Crimson Spears and Aura Smash.\nValgorth was the first to move, lunging forward with terrifying speed, his massive fist aimed directly at Stark's head.\nStark dodged, barely avoiding the strike, and retaliated with a flurry of Crimson Spears, each one enhanced with holy energy.\nThe spears struck Valgorth's chest, but the apostle shrugged them off, his smoldering skin absorbing the blows.\n\"Nice try, but my body adapted to receiving divine attacks!\"\n\"The fuck?\" Stark raised his eyebrows.\nAs Valgorth backed away, Cerberus charged in, its three heads snapping at Stark with deadly precision.\nStark leapt into the air, dodging the beast's massive jaws, and summoned Wielding Cross, the enormous, glowing cross appearing above him.\nHe swung it down with all his might, smashing it into Cerberus's back, causing the beast to howl in pain as its molten chains shattered.\n-457,374!\nBut before he could land another blow, Malthus joined the party, his scythe cutting through the air with a bone-chilling sound.\nStark barely managed to block the strike, the force of the blow sending him skidding across the ground.\n-7361!\n\"Damn,\" Stark grunted, his arms shaking from the impact as he used them to do a back flip and recover.\nThe apostles began to close in on him at the same time, their combined power overwhelming.\nBut Stark wasn't done yet. Summoning all his strength, he began to charge a, [Energy Ball] between his two hands, readying it for the impact.\nFor a moment, the chamber was filled with light, but the apostles didn't stagger as they kept marching, their forms flickering because of his aura, yet their determination just as strong as his.\n\"This is gonna be fun,\" he muttered to himself, \"I've been waiting to clear this stupid for a year now.\"\n\"Judicator had the key didn't he?\" Valgorth spoke to his companions, but mainly Matlhus since, well, Cerberus couldn't really talk.\n\"Yeah, wouldn't have trusted him with that if I knew he would die so easily, but at least a year later it brings the human to us so that we can kill him.\"\n\"Lord Godless will surely reward us…\"\nAnd so, all the apostles smiled.",

      "content": "The battle inside the hellish chamber continued with unrelenting intensity.\nThe air was thick with raw energy as the three apostles closed in on Stark.\nHe stood at the center, breathing heavily, his body faintly glowing from the aftereffects of Crimson Healing.\nThe Ultimate Clone was beside him, ready to act at any moment, but the apostles showed no signs of letting up. Stark knew they were only moments away from victory if he faltered.\nCerberus growled, the sound vibrating through the ground like deep thunder.\nEach of its three heads snapped aggressively, molten saliva dripping from its snarling mouths.\nStark's gaze shifted to the giant beast.\nHe could feel it—Cerberus was weakening as he was the one Stark focused the most on. Its defenses had taken a beating, and if Stark was going to finish this, now was the time.\n[Cerberus HP: 290,487/1,750,000]\nWith a swift motion, Stark summoned another barrage of Crimson Spears, sending the glowing projectiles flying toward the colossal hound. The air crackled as the spears closed in.\n-45,000! -46,500! -47,300!\nThe spears pierced through Cerberus's tough, leathery hide, making the beast stagger back with a howl of pain.\nIts health was dropping fast, but it still wasn't out of the fight.\n\"Flame Whip!\" roared the central head of Cerberus, summoning a blazing chain of fire that lashed out toward Stark with terrifying speed.\nStark barely managed to dodge the first strike, rolling to the side with Invincible Dodge. His clone also shifted out of harm's way.\n\"Is that all,\" Stark audibly laughed as he saw the three apostles still walking toward him, confidence visible on their faces, as if they knew victory was close.\nAnd Stark knew that reviving wouldn't work on them, as they had seen him do it against the guardian ape, meaning that even if two forgot, another wouldn't.\n\"Crimson Ball Transmission!\" he commanded, teleporting himself behind Cerberus in an instant.\nWith a roar of determination, Stark summoned his Domination Soul, the glowing crimson heart appearing in his hand, a familiar =] face etched into its surface.\nChains shot out from it, which Stark grabbed to wield the soul perfectly.\n[You can use your chains to bind enemies, but this is risky]\nSuddenly, a panel appeared in front of Stark.\n\"So... basically like Domi-Chain Restrain...?\" his chain broke since he had tried to use on Cerberus.\n[Yeah.]\n\"Heh... let's try then.\"\nChains shot out from the crimson heart, wrapping tightly around Cerberus's legs and necks, binding the monstrous hound in place.\nCerberus roared and thrashed violently, trying to break free, but Stark refused to give in. \"Not this time!\" he shouted, pulling the chains even tighter.\n\"Spear of Judgement!\" Stark summoned a massive, glowing crimson spear, crackling with divine energy.\nHe aimed it directly at Cerberus, who struggled helplessly in its bindings.\nThe spear shot forward like lightning, impaling the center head of the beast.\n-123,384!\nThat thing only had around 20000 HP left!\nCerberus let out an ear-splitting cry as the spear erupted within its skull. Blood and molten fire spewed from the wound, and the middle head went limp, lifeless.\nThe two remaining heads growled and snapped, but their strength was fading fast.\nSuddenly, Valgorth charged at Stark from behind, his enormous fist glowing with a fiery aura.\n\"Inferno Crush!\" The ground trembled as Valgorth's massive fist slammed down, barely missing Stark as he dodged at the last second.\nEven so, the impact sent a shockwave that hurled him across the chamber.\n-42,372!\nStark hit the wall hard, grunting as he felt the sharp pain in his ribs. He tasted blood in his mouth but pushed himself back to his feet. Cerberus was almost done for—he couldn't afford to stop now.\nIn a flash, Malthus appeared before him, swinging his deadly scythe in a wide arc. \"Soul Cleaver!\"\nStark raised his fists to block, but the scythe cut through his defenses with terrifying ease. The cold steel grazed his arm, leaving a deep cut that sapped his strength.\n-31,231!\nHe hissed in pain, but as the scythe came for another deadly strike, he immediately activated [Crimson Purification]'s [Protection Burst], which reduced 95% of damage received by undead beings for 10 seconds!\n-1547!\nHe received no damage.\n\"???\" and so while the reaper was taken aback, he immediately took his chance.\n\"Crimson Purification!\" he shouted, focusing divine energy which shot out from his body.\n\"Foolish,\" Malthus used his scythe's special power which cut the divine energy.\nBut... Stark had never aimed for him at all: he was aiming at Cerberus!\n-175,376!\nThe blast shattered through the remaining two heads of the hellish beast.\nWith a final, anguished howl, Cerberus collapsed. Its enormous body slumped against the molten ground, its once fearsome flames flickering out.\n[Cerberus, The Protector of Hell: Defeated!]\nStark exhaled heavily, relief washing over him for just a moment.\nBut right as Malthus was about to attack, he was surprised by a second shockwave of holy aura from Stark!\n[Ding! Divine Retribution activated!]\n[Description: When activating your crimson purification, there is a 20% chance that the purification now unleashes a secondary burst of holy energy!]\nMalthus was immediately hit, unable to counter with his scythe again to cut the divine energy, and so he received it, sending him flying!\nBOOM!\n-231,388!\nBut there was no time to rest. Valgorth and Malthus still stood back, both almost full health, not seeming weakened again at all.\nHe glanced at his clone, and it just smiled at him.\n\"Not bad, human,\" Valgorth growled, his voice rumbling with menace. \"But killing the hound won't save you.\"\n\"We'll see about that,\" Stark retorted, wiping the blood from his mouth.\nValgorth charged once more, his fists glowing with dark, pulsating energy. He swung with all his might.\n\"Titan's Rampage!\"\nStark braced himself, using [Double Assault] to increase his stats for 20 seconds and thus deflecting the blows from the calamity apostle.\n-7426! -7847\nThe hits still hurt a little bit, but Stark held his ground. Then hurled a Crimson Spear with [Holy Infusion] directly at Valgorth's chest.\n-114,832!\n[Valgorth HP: 1,601,429/1,820,000]\nValgorth howled in agony as the spear tore through his body, his health plummeting, but not enough for him to be in danger.\nMalthus lunged toward Stark, his scythe glowing with deadly black energy. Stark dodged the first swing, but the second strike cut across his shoulder.\n-22,833!\n[Stark HP: 11744/125000]\nStark winced, rolling away to avoid another attack, he was on the verge of dying, another blow and it was over.\n\"Do not think you can revive yourself or take us by surprise, fool,\" Malthus laughed, \"We will be standing right next to you, and the moment you move, it's over.\"\n\"Damn.\"\nStark knew he was cornered.\nBut before he could launch a desperate counterattack, something strange happened.\nThe Ultimate Clone, who was close to Valgorth, suddenly staggered.\nThe clone hadn't done anything to help Stark for some reason all this time.\nStark frowned in confusion—the clone hadn't been hit.\n\"What the hell?\" he muttered.\nBut before he could react, a dark, oppressive aura filled the chamber.\nThe clone began to twitch violently, its body contorting as dark energy coiled around it.\n[EGO!]\nA system notification appeared before Stark's eyes.\n[Ultimate Clone has summoned EGO, The Hatred Demon!]\nStark blinked in disbelief. \"What the fuck?\"\nHe had seen this before, but it didn't make sense—why and how would the clone…?\nThe clone's body exploded in a storm of dark crimson flames, and above it, a massive demonic figure materialized, just as it had once done over Stark.\nThe demon was enormous, its form twisted and horrific, its eyes blazing with unbridled hatred.\nThe creature's massive wings stretched out wide, casting an ominous shadow over the entire chamber as it hovered above the clone.\nStark took a step back, his heart racing. \"Even I'm confused now,\" he muttered, staring up at the monstrous figure.\nBoth apostles, Valgorth and Malthus, stood frozen, their eyes wide with fear—a reaction Stark had never expected to see from them.\nThe EGO demon let out a terrifying roar, shaking the chamber's very foundations. The air hummed with malevolent energy as the demon's oppressive presence grew stronger by the second.\nStark could feel the hatred radiating from the creature—an intense, overwhelming force. This wasn't just any ordinary summon. It was far more dangerous.\nThe demon's fiery eyes locked onto Stark, and at that moment, Stark felt a cold sweat trickle down his spine.\n\"Perfect,\" Stark muttered, clenching his fists, \"Now we're on equal footing,\" he smiled.\nHe didn't know how the clone could now a mythical skill like EGO, as it wasn't able to before, but was it because the ultimate clone now had the entirety of Stark's aura at disposition? Meaning it could use anything he did?\nHe didn't know, but seeing EGO the demon above the smiling clone was already good enough to increase his determination.\n\"Fool, this will not stop us.\"\n\"Kill the original, and the other is dead,\" Malthus pointed at the original Stark.\nAnd then, the two dashed toward him, summoning two of their mythical skills at once.",

The attack was so fast that he hadn't even had the chance to react.\n\"HAHAHA!\" Valgorth's cruel laughter echoed in the chamber as he watched Stark struggle against the bonds, \"THESE CHAINS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OUT OF!\"\n\"...?!\"\n\"DIE!\" Valgorth roared, barreling toward Stark with his fists glowing, flames dancing across his knuckles as he prepared to unleash a devastating blow.\nFor a split second, Stark's heart raced in his chest, a flash of fear crossing his mind.*\nHe was trapped, and Valgorth and Malthus were closing in fast. There was no way out.\nStark closed his eyes, not because he accepted his death, but because he knew what was about to happen.\nAnd at that moment of supposed despair, the Ultimate Clone acted.\n[The Ultimate Clone has commanded EGO to use \"Negate Explosion.\"]\nSuddenly, the demon-like entity that accompanied the clone let loose a pulse of dark energy.\nIt rippled through the chamber, expanding in a small radius around Stark.\nBOOM!\nBoth apostles' abilities were instantly nullified.\nValgorth's flaming fists fizzled out like candles snuffed by the wind, and Malthus's black scythe aura crumbled into dust as if they had never existed.\n\"What?!\" Valgorth's face twisted in disbelief as his powerful attack disintegrated in midair.\n\"Impossible!\" Malthus's rage flared, but before either apostle could react further, the Ultimate Clone struck.\nThe clone, empowered by the demonic EGO, lunged at them with a ferocious growl. Its massive claws tore through the air, aimed directly at the apostles.\nSLASH!\nThe impact sent shockwaves through the chamber, forcing the apostles to go on the defensive.\nThe clone's attacks were vicious and unrelenting.\nStark, freed from the chains (as EGO nullified ALL attacks), quickly regained his balance.\nAnd now this battle could finally be fair: he squared off against Malthus, while his clone kept Valgorth busy.\nThe battle had erupted into chaos once again.\nSparks flew as Stark danced around Malthus's scythe, narrowly avoiding its deadly edge.\nThe ringing clash of steel echoed through the chamber, their weapons/skills meeting with every swing. Each time Malthus's scythe whistled past Stark's neck, it seemed to graze just a hair away from ending him.\n\"You can't dodge forever, human!\" Malthus sneered, swinging his scythe again, barely missing Stark's throat.\nStark smirked, his mind sharp despite the chaos, \"I don't need forever.\"\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\"\nDing!\n[Perfect Dodge!]\nThe world around him slowed. Time seemed to freeze, allowing Stark to think clearly and deeply as he observed his surroundings.\nEvery movement, every breath of his enemies was laid bare in this moment of suspended reality.\n\"These guys aren't invincible. If I hit Malthus with the right combination, he won't stand a chance. As for Valgorth... we can take him down once he's stunned,\" Stark calculated in his head, his mind racing.\nTime snapped back to normal after a few seconds, and Stark's eyes blazed with a fierce vortex of crimson energy. His aura flared, a tangible force surrounding him.\n\"WIELDING CROSS!\" Stark roared, summoning the massive holy cross above him.\nThe divine weapon hummed with righteous power, its surface glowing with blinding light.\nHe swung it with everything he had, aiming straight for Malthus.\nAnd even though the apostle tried to cut it down with his scythe, which he did, it still wasn't enough to completely suppress the holy aura.\nThe cross slammed into Malthus with a thunderous crack.\n-82483!\nThe impact sent the death apostle stumbling back, a grunt of pain escaping him.\nBut Stark didn't stop there. He swung again, harder this time.\n\"ARGH—\" Malthus let out a howl of agony as the second blow struck him even harder, this time not even allowing him to suppress some of its power, sending him skidding back several feet.\n-213748!\nStark could feel the power building within the cross, the energy from the holy weapon surging with every swing.\n[Holy Combo] was now in full effect, and he knew the third strike would be the one to turn the tide.\n[Holy Combo (just a reminder): if you swing your strike twice in a row, the third strike will light up the cross with so much crimson aura that it will deal 200% damage and without fail stun enemies for five seconds!]\nThe cross glowed with a searing crimson light, radiating more power than before.\nStark leaped into the air, his body twisting in a graceful spin, \"I'M ABOVE YOU!\" he shouted as he brought the cross crashing down for the third and final strike.\nSMASH!\nThe impact was devastating. Malthus was crushed beneath the holy weapon, the crimson energy exploding outward as the third strike landed perfectly.\n-443612!\n[Malthus has been stunned!]\nThe death apostle crumpled to the ground, momentarily paralyzed, his body limp from the overwhelming force of Stark's attack.\nBut Stark didn't take time to gloat.\nInstead, he turned sharply on his heel and sprinted toward his clone.\nThe clone was locked in a brutal struggle with Valgorth, and Stark could see that it wouldn't last much longer on its own.\nTogether, they could finish Valgorth before Malthus recovered.\n\"DOUBLE ASSAULT!\" the clone shouted, its stats doubling as it prepared to unleash a final, devastating attack once seeing Stark approach.\nStark grinned, his mind clear with focus.\nHe raised his hand, summoning three of his strongest abilities in quick succession.\nIn one hand, a glowing yellow/red orb—the [Crimson Purification Energy Ball]—crackled with divine energy. In the other hand, the swirling giant fist of [Aura Smash Merge] gathered, ready to unleash chaos.\nAnd lastly, above him, the massive [Spear of Judgment] formed, its tip burning with divine fire as it hovered menacingly in the air.\nValgorth's eyes widened in terror. He knew what was coming.\nStark and his clone moved in perfect synchronization.\nThe clone attacked first, its demonic claws ripping through Valgorth's weakened defenses.\nStark followed immediately, hurling the [Crimson Purification Energy Ball] with deadly accuracy.\n-94728! (this is from EGO)\nValgorth staggered, his health dropping rapidly, but he wasn't down yet.\n\"Crimson Purification...\" Stark whispered as the energy ball exploded.\nBOOM!\n-323,482!\nThe chamber shook violently as the energy detonated around Valgorth. His body was thrown back, but Stark didn't stop. The [Aura Smash Merge] was next, and he hurled it toward the apostle like a crashing storm.\n-156,045!\nValgorth screamed in pain, barely hanging on, and even when he tried to do anything, either Stark or the clone would punch him out of his spell.\nBefore he could recover, the [Spear of Judgment] descended from above, the final blow, as it was infused with [Holy Infusion].\n\"Now!\" Stark shouted at his clone as the spear impaled Valgorth, divine energy flooding his body.\n-847,372!\nThen without wasting time, the clone smashed the ground with EGO dozens of times, dealing damage to Valgorth.\n-33623! -37214! -41237!\nValgorth's health dropped to zero in an instant.\nHe let out one last roar of agony before his body dissolved into nothingness, consumed by the overwhelming power of their combined attack.\n[Valgorth has been defeated!]\nStark stood tall, his chest heaving from exertion.\nHis clone stood beside him, its demonic aura still faintly glowing.\nBehind them, Malthus began to stir.\nThe stun was wearing off.\nAnd yes, all of this happened in mere seconds.\nBut it didn't matter anymore. Stark and his clone turned to face the death apostle, their focus now fully on him.\nMalthus's eyes darted between them, fear creeping into his gaze.\nStark smirked. \"It's over.\"\nHe raised his hand, preparing to unleash another barrage of attacks.\nIn moments, this battle would be finished.",

      "content": "The atmosphere in the chamber shifted the moment Valgorth fell.\nThe heavy tension hanging in the air dissipated, replaced by an unsettling silence.\nIt felt as if the very room itself was waiting.\nTwo of the apostles were now dead, and even with all of their confidence, thinking they had trapped Stark inside of their domain... all of that was nothing.\nOnly Malthus remained now, his black robes swirling around him, shrouded in the fading light from the destruction of his allies.\nStark and his clone stood firm, battle-worn but unwavering. They could sense the overwhelming power radiating from Malthus, but neither showed any sign of backing down.\nMalthus's scythe hung lazily by his side, his eyes glinting with a cruel amusement.\nSlowly, his lips curled into a wicked grin as he raised the scythe high above his head.\nThe weapon shimmered with a dark, unnatural glow, as though it were feeding on the surrounding shadows.\nWithout warning, he slammed the scythe into the ground.\n\"I AM THE MIGHTIEST OF THE ABYSS! FACE ME!\" His voice echoed, causing the very floor beneath their feet to tremble.\nStark's eyes narrowed, his expression cold and unyielding.\nIn that instant, Malthus unleashed his \"Godly\" ability: [Blackened Harvest].\nA dense black mist began to rise from the ground, swirling around Malthus like a living thing.\nIt absorbed the lingering energy of the fallen—the souls of Cerberus, Valgorth, and the countless devils that Stark had cut down along the way.\nTheir twisted forms merged with the mist, feeding into Malthus's growing power.\n\"Just for your information... I am the strongest of the apostles among those three, and my godly skill is one of the best there is in the entire world,\" Malthus smiled.\nHis body swelled as the aura around him darkened, his skeleton (?) muscles bulging, and his already towering frame growing larger.\nThe scythe pulsed, now brimming with raw, demonic energy.\nStark felt the shift immediately. This was no longer the same Malthus. He had become something far more dangerous, far more monstrous.\nHe had pushed himself past his very own limits.\n[Malthus has gone from Calamity to Immortal-Level monster]\nAnd with all the souls he harvested, he became just as strong as Olikar.\nWith an ominous smirk, Malthus pointed his scythe toward Stark.\n\"You will kneel before the power of the Abyss,\" he growled, his voice now deep and guttural, exuding death and destruction.\nBut Stark didn't move. He didn't even blink. Beside him, the clone was still, their synchronization flawless.\nMalthus wasted no more time on words. His body blurred as he surged forward, his scythe crashing down with the weight of a thousand tons.\nThe blade sliced through the air like a guillotine, aimed directly at Stark's head.\nBut Stark was already moving.\nWith reflexes sharpened by countless battles, he activated [Dodge Control], slipping out of the way just as the scythe grazed past, missing him by a hair.\nSLASH!\nThe scythe struck the ground with tremendous force, carving a massive gash into the stone where Stark had stood.\nMalthus's attacks were faster now, infused with the energy of every soul he had consumed. Each swing was filled with the essence of hell itself, every strike meant to kill.\nThe clone sprang into action, darting toward Malthus from the side.\nStill ordering EGO, Its demonic claws glowed with dark energy as it aimed to catch Malthus off guard. But Malthus reacted swiftly, spinning his scythe in a wide arc.\nThe clone barely dodged in time, retreating just as the blade whistled past, too close for comfort.\nThe fight escalated into a deadly dance. Malthus's scythe cut through the air relentlessly, every strike more powerful than the last.\nStark and his clone moved like shadows, dodging, weaving, their movements in perfect harmony.\nEach missed attack from Malthus sent shockwaves rippling through the chamber, shaking the walls, cracking the stone beneath their feet.\nBut it was the same for Stark, as Malthus managed to avoid everything and cut down every holy attack with no efforts.\n\"You think you can avoid me forever? Feel the weight of despair!\" Malthus's voice echoed, dripping with malice.\nHe swung the scythe again, but this time, a wave of dark energy erupted from the blade. The wave expanded rapidly, filling the chamber, leaving no room to escape.\nStark's instincts took over.\n\"Domination Soul!\" he shouted, summoning chains of energy not to bind, but to fight.\nHe swung the chains wide and placed his soul heart in front of them, creating a barrier against the encroaching darkness.\nThe black energy collided with his souls and the chains, sending sparks flying as Stark whipped the crimson soul back toward Malthus, deflecting the wave.\nMalthus snarled in frustration, closing the distance between them, bringing his scythe down with terrifying speed.\nStark barely managed to twist out of the way, sending his soul heart snapping toward the scythe's handle. With a yank, he pulled it aside, just long enough to disrupt Malthus's rhythm.\nThe clone saw its moment, rushing in with EGO's claws outstretched, ready to tear into Malthus. But the apostle was too quick. He leaped back, spinning mid-air, releasing another burst of dark energy as he did.\nSLASH!\nThe clone narrowly avoided the attack, its body bending impossibly to dodge the blade's lethal edge (because of Dodge Control).\nOne wrong move, and either of them would be finished. Stark and his clone were pushing themselves to the limit, walking between the edge of life and death.\nBut they moved flawlessly, their timing perfect.\nMalthus's eyes blazed with fury as he realized his attacks weren't landing.\n\"Enough!\" he roared, raising his scythe toward the sky. The very air in the chamber seemed to warp as the full force of his [Blackened Harvest] exploded around him.\nDark energy swirled in a massive vortex above, crackling with power.\nThe ground beneath them trembled, and from the shadows, spectral hands emerged.\nThese were the souls of the fallen devils, summoned by Malthus's godly power.\nThey clawed at Stark and his clone, trying to drag them into the abyss.\nStark's gaze sharpened. He couldn't let this drag out any longer.\n\"Clone, now!\" Stark commanded, and as if they were one, the clone responded.\nThe clone unleashed [Crushing Gravity], drawing on the might of the [Wielding Cross] and launching it toward the open sky.\nFwish...\nAnd while Malthus was too concentrated on having the hands drag them to the deepest parts of hell, he hadn't focused on the incoming attack.\nHe had seen Stark use it against the guardian ape, but his pride made him believe he could everything.\nHe was proven wrong.\nBOOOOOOM!\nThe cross crashed into the apostle, momenterily staggering him and making him drop his scythe because of the sheer divine power.\n-384,372!\nMalthus let out an enraged roar, momentarily disarmed.\nBut Stark was already moving.\nIn an instant, he teleported behind Malthus using [Crimson Ball Transmission], appearing just behind the apostle before he could react.\nStark wasted no time, grabbing Malthus by the shoulders, locking him in place with an iron grip.\nMalthus struggled, his raw strength still terrifying, but Stark held firm, his aura blazing with determination.\n\"Release me!\" Malthus spat, thrashing violently, but it was too late.\nStark summoned the last of his power, his voice ringing out with finality.\n\"Heaven's Wrath!\" he pointed at the sky after drawing a circle in his hand.\nThe heavens responded.\nA brilliant light split the darkness in the sky, descending upon them like divine judgment.\nThe crimson beam consumed Malthus, its purity burning through the dark power he had harvested, tearing away the souls he had consumed.\n\"Crimson Ball Transmission,\" and Stark had already set his other crimson ball, teleporting away right before being hit (first perk of transmission is he gets another crimson ball to use).\nMalthus screamed in agony, his body dissolving under the blinding light.\nOh, and yeah, Stark fused [Heaven's Wrath] with [Holy Infusion].\n-354825!\n-399573!\n-553211!\nHis health plummeted, his strength drained.\nWith a final explosion of light, Malthus's form disintegrated, reduced to ash, his reign of terror over.\n[Malthus has been defeated.]\nStark stood over the remains, his chest heaving, sweat trickling down his face.\nThe chamber was silent once more, the weight of the abyss lifted at last.\nThe clone stood beside him, its demonic aura still strong.\nIt was finally over.\nStark took a deep breath, wiping the sweat from his brow, surveying the battlefield one last time.\nVictory was theirs.",

      "content": "Stark stood amidst the carnage, his chest heaving from the battle's intensity, as a familiar series of notifications echoed in his mind.\nThe sharp Ding of the system chimed repeatedly.\nThe bodies of the three apostles, the ones of the [Devil's Abyss], were all in front of him.\nCerberus, the massive three-headed dog, was dead, lying there as he was killed by Stark's holy energy.\nValgorth, the desolator, was also down, after getting absolutely comboed by Stark and his clone, there weren't many people or monsters that could survive, especially taking the [Spear of Judgment] and dozens of hits from EGO.\nAnd finally Malthus, the strongest of all of them, was erased from existence by [Heaven's Wrath] after getting hit by the falling cross.\nNone of them stood a chance to begin with, though they did pose a threat to Stark in the beginning, he quickly overwhelmed them the second the clone appeared.\n[You have slain 'Cerberus, The Protector of Hell', gained 36,500,000 experience points!]\n[You have slain 'Valgorth, the Desolator', gained 37,800,000 experience points!]\n[You have slain 'Malthus, the Death Devil' in his ultimate form; gained 45,000,000 experience points!]\n[+119,300,000 experience points!]\n\"...What the hell,\" the amount of experience he got was baffling, twice as much as he did when he defeated Olikar.\nMaybe because he had defeated three apostles at the same time.\nAlso, Olikar gave 47,600,000 experience points (+20 million from the execution), but Malthus gave him 45,000,000; it was so close that it felt like there was almost no difference.\nThe panel did specify \"in his ultimate form\" though, so makes sense.\nAnd of course, Stark leveled up.\n[Current level: 106]\n[Experience: 977,000/8,500,000]\nExperience went up by 100,000 every level currently.\nDing! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!\nThose numbers quickly changed.\n[Your level has increased to level 107, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Your level has increased to level 108, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Your level has increased to level 109...]\n.\n.\n[Your level has increased to level 119, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Skill Points: 103 Available]\nNow... Stark could truly feel the power.\nHis breathing was calm, his eyes were focused.\nNothing much to do beside see what kind of skill he got, since he reached past level 110.\nThe more Stark fought these monsters, the more he won against these impossible beings, the more fed up he got with all of this.\nDing!\n[Level 110 reached (one skill every 20 levels): pick a card!]\nBefore him appeared 5 cards, each with an eye at the back, the pupil staring at him, as if judging him.\n\"Ultimate Clone,\" he ordered, and the clone went in front of the cards, looking at them one after the other to judge which one would be best.\nAfter a few seconds, [This... one... is... best...] the clone pointed at the one to the far right, and Stark took it.\nStark would probably never get used to the clone being able to talk in a panel, though only one word at a time, and very slowly.\nWhen Stark turned the card around, he saw that the drawing at the front was that of a stickman figure, looking normal, except for the fact that two crimson arms were coming out from under the original ones.\nBasically, that thing had four arms, two with a deep red that clearly meant they were added with aura.\nDing.\n...\n[Skill: Asura's Arms]\n[Rank: Godly]\n[Description: Summons two of Asura's arms, the God of Wrath to aid you in battle, they can be used to make you faster, to propel you, to block attacks, basically, they work exactly like normal arms, using your very own wrath to summon them.]\n[Note: The power of this skill is associated to your wrath too, so more anger = more power!]\n...\nStark had the level required to be able to head to the [Platinum] rank using a [Breakthrough Stone] and upgrade his skill level limit, but he had so many of them now that he just decided to let 40 skill points for his most essential skills like Domination and Focus.\nBut suddenly, right as he thought about using his max out core...\nDing!\n[You have completely cleared this Determination-Level rift, eliminating every single monster, you truly are the doom slayer!]\n\"So you can say doom slaye-\"\nZAP!\n-100!\n\"...But I can't,\" he finished his sentence regardless.\n[You have been granted a max-out core as a reward!]\nThis meant that he currently had two of those things at his disposal, able to use them on whatever skill he liked to enhance it to its ultimate form.\n[Skills:] Spatial Inventory; Class Wheel; Perception; Domination lv30; Focus lv30; Aura Smash lv30; Clone Frenzy lv30 (MAX); Invincible Dodge lv30 (MAX); Double Assault lv10; Crimson Spears lv30; Heaven's Wrath lv5; Alchemist lv5; Potion Crafting lv5; Target Manipulation lv1; Dodge Control lv5; Crimson Ball Transmission lv5; Domi-Chains Restrain lvl1; EGO lv5; Crimson Purification lv30; Wielding Cross lv30; Crimson Healing lv70 (MAX); The Void; Banish; Domination Soul; Revenant's Fury 1/3; Holy Infusion; Enrapture; Asura's Arms lv1\n[Domination, Focus and Alchemist cannot be upgraded.]\nNow, Stark could choose any two skills he wanted apart from those that he couldn't, and make them reach their ultimate form.\n[Crimson Healing] maxed at level 70, which would have surely taken him months if not years to reach, and its ultimate form gave him a second life, basically.\nWhat could the other skills, which were attack-oriented, possibly do?\nThe real question Stark needed to ask himself was: what skill could have the highest level.\nSome skills would only reach level 30, but some others could potentially reach up to level 100.\nIf he selected the latter, then he would surely get a perk that was 100 levels worth.\nA perk so strong it could wipe out any monster in one swift motion.\nNow, it was all about being strategic.\nAfter a few minutes of deep thinking, Stark made a list of the skills he could potentially use the cores on: Aura Smash; Crimson Spears; Heaven's Wrath; Crimson Ball Transmission; EGO; and finally, Asura's Arms.\n6 skills, yet only two could be selected.\nThis was the hardest choice Stark was about to make since he appeared in this new world.\nBut before selecting them, he decided to use the 60 skills he spared to upgrade some of the other ones.\nAnd well, as most of his skill were either maxed, couldn't be leveled up or were already at the level limit, he didn't have many choices to select from.\nDing! Ding!\n[You have upgraded 'Domi-Chain Restrain' to level 30 (Gold-Tier Max)!] (-30 skill points)\n[You have upgraded 'Target Manipulation' to level 30 (Gold-Tier Max)!] (-30 skill points)\nHe didn't use that skill much, but maybe it could be better.\n...\n[Skill: Domi-Chain Restrain]\n[Perk: Chains of Judgment (Mythical Perk)]\n[Description: Not only do you get three chains instead of one, but you can also summon \"Gortox\", the chain demon, to aid you in chaining your enemies.]\n...\nHe used this skill, not often, but he used it, but this still confused him regardless.\nWho the hell is Gortox? Should he use the skill now to test it out? Or maybe wait? In the end, he still trained in the [Memories Museum] often too, so he would test it out.\nAnd then... he moved to the other skill.\nA pleasant surprise greeted him, though.\n...\n[Skill: Target Manipulation (ULTIMATE FORM)\n[Perk: Complete Telekinesis (Immortal/Ultimate Perk)]\n[Description: If you can hold off for 1 minute while focusing on your opponent's aura, you can take it over and control their body for 15 seconds.]\n[Note: by that, you can basically make the enemy kill themselves, yes, no joke, as you have full control of their bodies, you will be able to use their own weapons against them, though do note that you cannot use their skills!]\n...\n\"This is...\" Stark's expression darkened, \"So... normal...?\"\nI mean, this was a great perk, but when the hell would he have the time to think about that in battle? And what if the opponent didn't have a fancy weapon like a blade?\nWhen would he find the time to pull up this perk and stand still for an entire minute without the enemy immediately trying to attack him.\nAnd now you might say: \"W-Well, just ask the [Ultimate Clone] to protect you!\"\nBut first, what if the clone died by a massive unavoidable attack, and second of all, if an attack like a giant fire appeared, which hit the entire area, then Stark was fucked.\nHe would need to think about it.\nBut now that he was done with those skills and their perks, he could think about what he needed to do next.\nAura Smash; Crimson Spears; Heaven's Wrath; Crimson Ball Transmission; EGO; and finally, Asura's Arms.\nThe skills were there, the cores were in his hands, all he needed to do now is... choose.\nBecause no matter what, his strength would surely increase.\n\"Alright, I think I know,\" Stark let out a quick smile as he pointed at two of the skills.",

      "content": "In the end, Stark decides to select [Crimson Spears] and [Asura's Arms] as the skills he would max out with the [Max Out Cores].\nHere is his thought process.\nAura Smash could have a perk too difficult for him to wield, it already happened twice already, and going from level to who knows what seemed too much for him; don't get him wrong, it is an incredible skill, but he is satisfied with it right now.\nHeaven's Wrath felt like it wouldn't go past level 30 in terms of max level, after all, what else you could bring to this beam that erased everything that entered it?\nCrimson Ball Transmission was useful in battle, but just like Aura Smash, he had the very deep impression that using that ultimate perk would be hard to master as well.\nAnd as for EGO, well... he just didn't feel like it, as both he and his clone could use it, and a week between each use wasn't necessary right now, it was already strong enough as is.\nAnd so he had finally made his choice—Crimson Spears and Asura's Arms.\nThe [Max Out Cores] had been rare and precious items, and the excitement of pushing two of his skills to their ultimate forms was still coursing through him.\nHis fingers trembled slightly as he activated the first core.\nDing!\n[You have used the [Max Out Core] on 'Crimson Spears'!]\n[Crimson Spears has reached level 100 (Ultimate Form)!]*\nThe surge of power that accompanied the notification was immediate, like a storm of energy brewing inside him.\nIt was an absolutely incredible usage of his skill!\nThe max level skills could reach was level 100, and crimson spears was one of those!\n...\n[Skill: Crimson Spears]\n[New Perk: Heaven's Spear (Ultimate Form)]\n[Description: Upon activation, a colossal rift tears open in the sky, revealing a towering angelic figure, nearly 50 kilometers in height. With a slow, deliberate motion, the angel summons an immense spear of pure crimson energy, large enough to obliterate mountains with ease.\nAt the user's command, the angel hurls the giant spear it summoned with such force that it rips through the atmosphere, and upon impact, the spear triggers a small city-level explosion, powerful enough to destroy a quarter of the capital if aimed right.\nThe spear's power grows proportionally to the user's aura, and its destructive force can be focused to annihilate a single target or spread wide enough to engulf multiple enemies.*\nBasically, nothing survives the divine wrath of the Heaven's Spear, for the [Angel of the Spear] never misses his shot.]\n[Oh and also you have 10 spears now.]\n...\nStark's eyes widened as he read the description, his breath catching in his throat. \"Holy shit,\" he whispered.\nThis wasn't just an upgrade—it was something godlike.\n\"This is... insane...\"\nThis was a weapon of mass destruction.\nIf anyone learned about this, then not only the apostles and monsters, but the humans would try to get rid of him too: what he had in hand was basically an atomic bomb.\nBut there wasn't time to linger on that. He had one more core to use, and it was the one he was even more curious about.\n...\n[You have used the [Max Out Core] on 'Asura's Arms'!]\n[Asura's Arms has reached level 50 (Ultimate Form)!]\n...\nHis heart raced again as the notification popped up. [Asura's Arms] was probably already one of his most powerful abilities (he only assumed because of the rank), and now, at its ultimate form, it promised to be something even greater.\nIt delivered.\n...\n[Skill: Asura's Arms]\n[New Perk: Asura's Wrath (ultimate form)]\n[Description: Harness the power of the God of Wrath to summon four additional arms—two emerging from your shoulders and two from beneath your original arms.\nThese arms are manifestations of pure aura, imbued with divine strength. Each arm is capable of immense physical power, equal to the user's full aura potential.\nWhen activated, the user can unleash a devastating attack called 'Asura's Wrath,' releasing a shockwave that annihilates everything in a 100-meter radius. The more enraged the user becomes, the stronger the aura-infused arms become, scaling with the user's fury.]\n...\nIf he understood that description right, not only would he now have six arms, though he would need to learn how to control them, each of them able to punch an enemy or block an attack, but their special ability was \"Wrath\"?\nUnleashing a shockwave that annihilates anything in a 100-meter radius?\nHow useful would this be? How powerful could it be...?\nStark focused his aura, and he sensed that it grew so much more than before.\nThis power... it was too good.\nStark had just acquired two god-like abilities now.\nAnd he felt as thought he was at the top of the world!\nBut before he could get lost in the euphoria, his thoughts turned back to the idea of the [Max Out Cores].\nThey were strange.\n\"If clearing a rift grants this kind of power,\" Stark said to himself, \"why doesn't everyone do it? Surely there are stronger people out there who could just sweep through these things.\"\nBut to answer his question, something strange happened.\nThe area completely darkened around him, and from the ground emerged a crimson figure completely made out of aura: it was Domination.\nWait... no... it's not domination.\nThat figure indeed had a crimson body, but it also had a [Soul Heart] in front of it, it was wearing a lab coat, carrying a small vial in its left hand, a cross in its right hand, and finally it had demon horns and a demon tail.\nIt was a merge of every single one of his classes!\n\"You look goofy,\" Stark commented while laughing, talking to Domination, after all he knew that he was the one controlling all the others.\n\"Sure,\" Domination shrugged as he snapped his fingers, \"Here is your answer, by the way.\"\nA panel appeared in front of Stark.\n...\n[You are the only one who can get this reward from fully clearing a rift.]\n[For you are the 'Chosen One'!]\n[And as for the 'over-leveled' thing, no, you need to be in a rift that has a close power level to yours, otherwise you don't get anything.]\n...\nAnd then, the panel disappeared.\nThis explained how he was getting those [Max Out Cores] but others didn't.\nStark blinked at the panel, trying to make sense of it. \"I'm the 'Chosen One'? That's why I get these rewards?\"\n[Yes.]\nThis was... surprising.\nAfter all, leveling up a skill to level 50 would take being at least around level 500 for normal people, and as for level 100, well, it was pretty much reaching level 900, meaning you were one of the strongest beings in the entire world.\nAnd yet... at level 119 as a domination user, Stark now had access to one of these powers.\nCrimson Spears and Asura's Arms... would surely be incredible.\n\"Anyway, thank you,\" he turned around, heading toward the portal that had opened, which would send him back to the normal version of the [Devil's Abyss].\nStark took a few steps, but then BOOM!\nA massive shockwave knocked him off balance, and he stumbled, quickly regaining his footing. He whipped around, eyes narrowing at Domination, who no longer had his usual laid-back expression.\n\"I wouldn't show up just to tell you something obvious,\" Domination said in a low tone, his voice serious for the first time in a while.\n\"Then...\"\n\"I'll be frank with you, Host,\" Domination shrugged, \"You've been in the Devil's Abyss for two weeks.\"\n\"Ok, and?\" Stark was used to such things happening, and domination too, so why did he make such a big deal out of it now.\nStark's aura in his eyes grew as his expression darkened.\n\"You missed something important,\" Domination swiped his hand through the air, summoning a new panel.\nAnd then he dropped the bombshell.\n\"The Third Domination trial was announced.\"\nDing! Ding! Ding!\n...\n[All 15 participants have reached level 100 or above, the trial will begin in two weeks.]\n[You will all suffer a true and undeniable dead, for the mercy of the godless demon is nonexistent to humans.]\n[Good luck, participants, I wish you all the luck in the world (I don't)]\n...\n\"But... wait a damn minute,\" Stark's eyes suddenly widened, \"If the trial was announced around two weeks ago, and I've been here for two weeks... then...\"\nDing!\n[Time remaining: 7 hours, 38 minutes.]\nThere were only 7 hours and a half before the trial started.\nNo, actually, even less: time was moving extremely fast on the outside in comparison to here, so when a minute passed here, around five passed on the timer.\n\"Ok, thank you, domination,\" Stark nodded.\n\"No problem, but it doesn't matter, we're surviving,\" Domination said with a sly grin, disappearing into the shadows.\n\"Sure.\"\nNow, it was just Stark, alone, in this empty rift, with the timer beside him still ticking down extremely fast.\nThe Third Domination Trial is coming.\nBut to be honest, Stark was pretty damn calm in comparison to the first two times.\nThe final [Godless Demon Apostle] of the second line was inside the third trial: the [Crimson Moons Trio].\nAnd now... he would be able to meet them.",

      "content": "As Stark stepped through the portal and landed back in the normal version of the [Devil's Abyss], the familiar air of tension hit him immediately.\nThe dark, eerie atmosphere felt more alive now, as demons scattered through the first zone, clashing violently with groups of students trying to hold their ground.\n\"...\"\nStark watched for a moment, taking it all in.\nHe was used to this chaos by now, but something about it today felt different.\nMaybe it was because of the [Third Domination Trial] hanging over his head like a guillotine.\nThen, out of nowhere, a voice broke through his thoughts.\n\"What the fuck?\"\nHe turned, eyes narrowing.\nA guy, who seemed to be part of one of the fighting groups, was pointing directly at him with wide eyes.\n\"I swear I saw that guy come out of a portal... like, out of nowhere!\" the man exclaimed, panic rising in his voice.\nHis friend, beside him, slapped his head, \"Are you stupid? You've been drinking again, haven't you?\"\n\"N-No, I swear… oh, forget it, I must have imagined it...\"\n'Phew,' Stark thought, a small smirk tugging at his lips.\nThat could've gone badly. Explaining that he had come from a completely different part of the rift through some mysterious portal would raise far too many questions—questions he didn't have time for.\nWith a quick focus on his [Devil's Abyss Token], a swirling mist of darkness engulfed him, and in an instant, the rift disappeared from around him.\nWhen his vision cleared, he was back in the academy lobby.\nThe usually bustling space was eerily empty, reinforcing the fact that Stark was the only one who had been inside the rift for the last two weeks.\nStark stepped out of the academy and, without bothering to hail a taxi or wait for transportation, he immediately set off running.\nHis speed was like a blur, the world around him whipping pést as he sprinted toward his apartment.\nThe adrenaline coursing through him from the looming trial announcement made his heart race even faster.\nIn less than ten minutes, Stark arrived at his complex.\nHe darted inside, making his way up the stairs to his floor.\nHis body moved on autopilot, but his mind was swirling with thoughts of the trial, of the looming confrontation with the [Crimson Moons Trio], and what awaited him in the deadly challenge.\nWhen Stark opened the door to his apartment, he was greeted by a pleasant scene: Lana was in the kitchen, cooking something that smelled good.\nSora, on the other hand, was curled up on the couch with a book in hand, looking as calm and collected as ever.\nThe moment Stark stepped inside, both women turned to him. Their eyes widened in surprise, and Lana wasted no time, rushing toward him.\n\"Finally, you're back!\" she exclaimed, flinging her arms around him in a tight hug.\n\"Yeah,\" Stark nodded, hugging her back, though his mind was still elsewhere.\nEven though he'd been gone for two weeks without any updates, it didn't seem like the girls had been worried enough to think something terrible had happened to him.\nThat was... interesting.\nAfter they broke from the hug, Stark asked casually, \"Did you get your flowers?\"\nLana smiled, clearly proud. \"Yes! Sora and I managed to get them. Sora finished hers in under a day and brought some to me, but people have been struggling. Even after two weeks, only six of us managed to complete the task!\"\n\"Oh, wow,\" Stark said, feigning surprise.\nHe had gathered those flowers in less than 30 minutes—though, to be fair, that was in the twisted version of the rift, which was more difficult.\n...\nThey sat down to eat dinner together, a meal Lana had cooked.\nStark tried to focus on the food, but his mind kept drifting back to the countdown timer that hovered in his vision.\nEvery time he blinked, it was still there, ticking away, a constant reminder that time was running out.\nTick! Tick! Tick!\n[Time remaining: 5h34m]\nHe tried to dismiss the panel or minimize it, but it wouldn't go away.\nIt was currently 18h26 PM, so by logic, the trial would start at midnight.\nAs they finished eating, Lana stood up to clear the table, brushing off Stark's offer to help.\n\"No, no, you relax. You just got back.\"\nStark leaned back in his chair, glancing over at Sora.\nHer face was calm, but her eyes were dark, mirroring his own thoughts.\nThe two of them were bound to the same fate—another Domination Trial.\n\"Sora,\" Stark broke the silence between them.\nShe raised an eyebrow but didn't respond.\n\"Did you get the notification?\" he asked, his voice low.\n\"Yes,\" Sora said, almost emotionless. \"In five hours.\"\n\"Same as me, then.\"\nThere was a long pause.\nNeither of them wanted to say it out loud, but they both knew this trial would be just as dangerous—if not more so—than the last two.\nThe first trial had five participants; the second had ten.\nNow, fifteen people were involved, and both Stark and Sora were fully aware of what that meant.\nThe body count and difficulty would rise.\nIn the first two trials, they were the only survivors.\nWhat about the third? Would they walk out of this one alive? Or would this finally be the end?\nSora let out a soft sigh, her eyes dropping to the table, \"We'll get through it.\"\nStark nodded, but his thoughts were elsewhere.\nHe was confident in his own abilities, but he was more worried about Sora.\nThe enemies they'd face this time were going to be much stronger.\nThe trial's recommended level was 100 after all, and Stark was already level 119—far beyond most other participants.\nHe couldn't help but think about Lana though.\nShe wouldn't be able to join them in this trial, and neither of them knew how long they'd be gone this time. The last trial had taken months. What if this one took half a year?\n\"I'll tell her I'm going on business for a few months,\" Sora said suddenly, reading Stark's thoughts. \"I won't be answering any calls. You should do the same.\"\n\"Yeah, I was thinking the same,\" Stark replied, though he wasn't sure how well it would go over with Lana. \"I'll say I'm visiting my family. That's why I won't be able to contact her.\"\n\"Terrible excuse,\" Sora sighed, \"but it's Lana. She'll wait for you, no matter how long.\"\nStark didn't quite understand how Sora could be so sure of that, but he let it go.\nHe trusted Lana, and she was strong in her own way.\nShe could handle a few months of waiting.\nWhen Lana returned from the kitchen, she let out a big yawn. \"Man… I'm exhausted.\"\n\"You should rest,\" Stark said immediately.\n\"I agree,\" Sora added, standing up. \"I'm going to be gone for a while too, on business. It might be a couple of months.\"\n\"Oh, that's fine!\" Lana said cheerfully. \"More time for me and Stark, right?\"\nStark hesitated for a moment, but then added, \"Actually… I'm going to visit my family. I'll be gone for a while, too.\"\nLana's expression darkened, and her shoulders slumped. \"Oh… okay. But can I come with you? You can introduce me to your family!\"\n\"Sorry, they'd prefer I go alone,\" Stark said, trying to sound as apologetic as possible.\nLana looked like she was on the verge of tears, and guilt gnawed at Stark's insides.\nHe didn't want to lie to her, but he had no choice.\nBefore she could fully break down, Stark did the only thing that came to mind. He pulled her into a tight hug and kissed her on the mouth, right in front of Sora.\n\"...!\" Sora's eyes widened, and Stark could feel an odd tension in the air as something passed through her—a strange mix of jealousy and desire.\nShe quickly shook it off, clearing her throat.\n\"If you wait for us, I'll do anything you want,\" Stark whispered to Lana with a soft smile.\n\"R-Really? Anything?\" Her eyes lit up with excitement.\n\"Yeah. Whatever you want.\"\nLana beamed and hugged him again before heading off to bed, clearly exhausted.\nShe also hugged Sora.\nAs soon as she was out of sight, Sora crossed her arms, looking at Stark, \"What does she want that has you promising anything?\"\n\"Heh... I wonder...\" Stark shrugged, though he probably had an idea, \"More importantly though...\"\nFwish! Ding!\nHe raised his arm and summoned a large, ornate black door from the ground.\nIt was the entrance to the [Memories Museum].\nIt hadn't been shown, but Stark still trains regularly inside of the memories museum.\n\"We have four and a half hours. Let's not waste them, this is the memories museum,\" he pointed at the door, \"It can help us become stronger.\"\nSora was surprised, but she nodded.\nBoth of them knew they had to be at their best for the trial, and the [Memories Museum] was the perfect place to hone their skills before it began.\nThey stepped through the door, the heavy weight of the trial hanging over them as the countdown continued to tick away in their minds.",

Her eyes remained locked on the horizon, unblinking, lost in thought. The faint ticking of the panel before her was the only thing she acknowledged.\n[Time remaining: 4h10m]\nHer fingers flexed, then tightened into a fist.\nThis trial was a looming shadow over her mind, a battle that would test her will as much as her skill. She closed her eyes and inhaled slowly, centering herself.\n'I will survive this.'\nWith deliberate care, she knelt on the rooftop, lowering herself into a meditative position.\nHer breathing slowed, and the tension in her body melted away as she prepared her mind.\nShe was not training or fighting. She was finding her calm—her focus. This wasn't the moment to panic. There would be no mistakes. Not in this trial.\nThe sky darkened above her as time continued to slip by. Her heartbeat was steady, the seconds slipping like sand through her fingers.\nShe stayed in her meditation, unmoving.\nFor in the end, she was sure that only one person would survive this trial.\n...\nAnother participant, this time, sat behind his sleek, polished desk in the dim glow of his office.\nHe was sitting in a luxurious office, observing the city above.\n[Time remaining: 3h45m]\nBut he couldn't forget that he also needed to participate in that shitty trial too.\nThis would disrupt his business for a few months, but he had already survived two of these, so he didn't care.\nHis fingers drummed against the desk with a rhythmic precision, his eyes scanning the various screens before him.\nEach one showed different feeds: security footage, financial reports, and more importantly, information about the possible participants of the trial, gotten from the [Domination Association], which registers all [Domination users].\n\"Worthless,\" he muttered, closing the files of several weak contestants.\nHis eyes stopped on one though: Stark Heartsouls.\nBut right as he was about to open it...\nA knock at the door.\nTwo people entered—silent, obedient, their eyes dull and lifeless.\nThey were his best assets, ones he had groomed personally to serve him without question, and also other participants of this domination trial.\n\"Prepare yourselves,\" he ordered, his tone cold. \"We'll kill everyone there.\"\nThe two nodded without a word and left.\nThe man leaned back, steepling his fingers as the timer ticked down on his panel.\nHe watched it impassively, his mind already working through strategies.\nThe world outside his window continued to bustle, but the businessman was already far ahead, calculating every move, planning his domination.\n...\nIn a dimly lit room filled with the scent of paint and varnish, an artist stood before a massive canvas, his movements frantic and precise.\nHis hand moved furiously, splattering colors across the canvas with almost violent intensity.\n[Time remaining: 3h15m]\nHis breath came in gasps as he took a step back to admire his work.\nThe painting was grotesque, a twisted mass of shapes and shadows, barely recognizable as human forms.\nThe artist's eyes were wide, gleaming with a mix of excitement and madness as he stared at it.\n\"It's almost perfect,\" he whispered to himself, his voice trembling with delight.\nHe reached for another brush, dipped it into a deep crimson paint, and splashed it across the center of the painting, as though adding blood to a wound.\nThe clock in the corner of his eye ticked away, but he barely noticed.\nThis was his masterpiece—his art, and it would be remembered long after the trial, after he killed all of the others.\nAs he stepped back again, a twisted smile curled his lips. His gaze flicked to the timer.\n[Time remaining: 2h50m]\n\"Soon, you will all become part of my masterpiece.\"\n...\nIn a dimly lit, candle-filled chapel, a man knelt before the altar, his head bowed in silent prayer.\nThe figure was wearing dark, tattered robes, and the sound of his whispered words echoed faintly in the vast emptiness of the chapel.\n[Time remaining: 1h58m]\nHis hands were clasped tightly, skin pale, but his eyes—half-hidden behind his hood—were wide open, staring into the shadows ahead.\nThe candles flickered, casting long, dancing shadows on the stone walls.\nHe murmured something incoherent, his voice hoarse from hours of prayer.\n\"Lord Godless... We will eliminate all the threats...\"\n\"Lord Godless... Give me some of your power... I shall eliminate all those who oppose you...\"\n[Time remaining: 1h30m]\nThe panel floated before him, its countdown relentless. He didn't need to see it. He could feel it—time slipping away, dragging him toward something inevitable.\nBut then, an answer came.\n\"You wish to eliminate all those that threaten me?\" a manifestation of the [Godless Demon] appeared.\n\"LORD! LORD!\" the man jumped in joy.\n\"If you wish to do so...\" Godless snapped his fingers, transferring a small amount of aura to the man, \"Then get rid of all the participants, especially the black-haired boy with the crimson aura.\"\n\"Yes... Yes... I will, Lord,\" The man kneeled, feeling the newly gained power.\nThe air in the chapel grew cold as he stepped toward the doors, his robes trailing behind him like shadows.\nHis eyes, once filled with devotion, were now hollow, consumed by the darkness that had taken hold of his soul.\nWith a final glance at the altar, he pushed open the doors and stepped into the night.\n\"It shall be done.\"\n...\nInside a rift, while fighting hundreds upon hundreds of monsters, a man and his companion were fighting hordes of monsters after the other.\nThe woman was able to transform herself into a massive beast made of shadows, cutting through anything and everything, her skin so hard that it was almost impossible to cut through it.\nThe man, on the other hand, raised his arm and with a single slash cut through dozens of monsters.\nThe two of them were confused, almost unbothered by the sheer amount of monsters, each and every one of them level 400 and above.\n[Time remaining: 30m]\n[Warning, the domination trial is starting, every participant needs to be ready.]\n\"Should we go, Dan?\" the woman asked, transforming back into her human shape, except for her arm which was now black and with a massive mouth that could extend, eating one monster after the other.\n\"Sure,\" the man nodded, \"Just wanted to experience that adrenaline of being cornered again.\"\n\"Don't worry, none of these people have anything of us,\" the woman smiled, \"You kill them, I eat them.\"\n\"Right.\"\n...\nAnd finally, back to Stark and Sora, who were still training inside the [Memories Museum].\nHe had pretty much mastered the usage of [Asura's Arms], which wasn't that difficult, but he didn't use [Crimson Spear]'s ultimate attack as he didn't feel like showing it, plus there was nothing to master with it: the angel would do everything.\nAnd so...\n[Time remaining: 5m]",

BOOM! BOOM!\nIn the sky appeared three massive moons, with a single pupil in each of them, looking at the participants.\n[This is the 'Crimson Moon Trio', they moonscorched the earth here, transforming everything into the hell it will be for you.]\n[If you manage to defeat them, which is impossible, don't even try, they are level 600 and ranked 'Immortal', then the trial will instantly end, no matter what.]\n[If you beat them right now, all 15 of you will pass.]\nStark's gaze shot up to the sky, narrowing on the three monstrous moons that hovered ominously above.\nThe vast, crimson orbs floated in the void, casting an eerie red glow over the \"Death Village.\"\nThe single pupils in each moon stared down, unblinking, full of malice and apathy.\nThey radiated such immense power that Stark could feel the weight of their presence bearing down on him.\n\"Level 600... Immortal rank...\" Stark muttered, shaking his head, \"That's foolish,\" he smiled, \"You can't beat me.\"\nAround him, the other participants were stirring as well.\nSome exchanged glances, others tightened their grips on weapons or flexed their powers.\nThe tension was palpable; everyone knew the trial had begun in earnest, but none looked brave—or foolish—enough to challenge the moons outright.\nThe moons' impossible presence seemed to be more of a psychological barrier than an actual obstacle.\nTheir immense level made them unapproachable, forcing the participants to focus on the more pressing task at hand—surviving each other.\nUnapproachable... except for Stark, who already knew what he needed to do.\nEven if it took killing every single one of the others, he would go up to these things and kill them, no matter what.\nThe trial was deceptively simple.\nFifteen participants, one objective: be the only survivor and reach the \"Moon Tower.\"\nStark glanced at the tower looming in the distance, its jagged spires cutting into the blood-red sky.\nThe path ahead would be grueling, and every step was guaranteed to be filled with danger.\nMonsters were already lurking beyond the village, waiting for anyone foolish enough to make an early dash toward the tower, or enter \"Termina\", which is the main stage of the trial.\nBut that wasn't Stark's biggest concern.\nNo, it was the other participants.\nHe scanned the crowd quickly, noting their postures, their expressions, and the dangerous gleams in their eyes.\nSome stood confidently, exuding an aura of deadly intent.\nOthers seemed nervous, eyes darting from one person to the next, likely calculating their chances of surviving the imminent bloodbath.\nOne of them was a woman, and she was currently... meditating? What?\n[Code Name: Lilith; Real Name: Lina Silent]\nBeside her, was a businessman, smoking on a cigar that had been in his pockets, he was currently speaking to two other people beside him.\n[Code Name: CEO; Real Name: Miles Molkov]\nRight next to Stark was a tall guy with short white hair reaching his neck, with bags under his eyes and wearing an artist-like costume, he also had two brushes in his hands.\n[Code Name: Artist; Real Name: Kai Algren]\nThere were many people, but Stark didn't have the time to observe all of them, he would do it later.\nStark locked eyes with Sora across the circular square.\nHer determined look was mirrored by his own.\nThey had survived one trial together, but this one was different.\nThis was a deathmatch, and only one could walk away alive—or so it seemed.\n\"...\" but Stark already knew what he needed to do.\nBefore he could linger on the thought, a new panel appeared in front of everyone, and the silence was shattered.\nDING!\n[The trial will begin in...]\n[5...]\n[4...]\n[3...]\nThe countdown was ticking down fast, and Stark could feel his heart rate increasing.\nHis hands twitched instinctively, ready to summon his powers at a moment's notice.\n[2...]\n[1...]\n[Begin!]\nFor a second, no one moved.\nIt was as if the entire square was holding its breath, waiting for someone else to make the first move.\n[Oh, and by the way, there are items and quests that can help you kill someone stronger than you are placed randomly, so if you have no confidence, go get those.]\nThe trial was unfair when humans faced monsters and traps, but when it was about killing one another, it became the fairest of trials ever.\nThe [Moon Trio] was also looking down on the humans, and even with one single eye, you could see that they were pleased, and excited to see the humans kill one another.\nAt least, that is what they believed.\n\"Alright,\" Stark was the first to speak out loud, bringing the attention to himself, \"Let's do this.\"\nBut instead of running toward a participant... he stared at the moons.\n\"Just need to take the three of you down, don't I?\" he smiled.",

      "content": "\"Just need to take the three of you down, don't I?\" Stark smiled as he moved forward, his steps calm and deliberate, as if the chaos erupting around him meant nothing.\nThe other participants were locked in place, wondering what the hell that kid doing.\nBut Stark ignored them, his gaze fixed solely on the trio of moons floating ominously in the crimson sky.\nEach one of them pulsed with malevolent energy, their single pupils watching over the trial like gods observing the struggles of ants.\n\"What the hell is he doing?\"\n\"Is he... trying to fight the moons?\"\n\"Is he insane?\"\nVoices from the crowd of participants echoed around Stark, disbelief and confusion lacing their words.\nThey had all heard the announcement: the moons were level 600 entities, ranked \"Immortal\".\nTo even think of challenging them was madness. And yet, Stark kept walking.\n\"Maybe he wants to get himself killed,\" one participant scoffed, shaking his head.\n\"Better him than us. If he thinks he can take on that, let him try,\" another muttered.\nBut none of them moved to stop him.\nIn the third Domination Trial, no one underestimated anyone.\nThey had seen too many people make that fatal mistake.\nEvery participant here had survived their own horrors, honed their powers, and sharpened their instincts to the point where overconfidence was deadly.\nAnd yet, the sight of Stark's calm march toward the moons left them all bewildered, uncertain if he was a fool or something far more dangerous.\nSora, too, watched in silent disbelief.\nShe had fought beside Stark through the second trial, witnessing his strength and power, but even she was unsure of what he was thinking now.\nTaking on the moons was suicide—wasn't it?\nStark, however, remained undeterred.\nHis eyes glowed with the same crimson energy that rippled through his body, intensifying with each step.\nAs he moved, the village square around him fell eerily quiet, as if the world itself was holding its breath.\n\"COME AT ME!\" Stark roared, his voice cutting through the silence like a blade, his arm outstretched as he pointed directly at the [Crimson Moons Trio].\n\"He's serious...\"\n\"He's calling them out?\"\nThe moons themselves remained silent for a moment, their pupils locked onto Stark.\nThen, a cold, mocking laughter filled the air, not from any of the participants, but from the moons themselves.\nTheir voices boomed across the battlefield, deep and cruel.\n\"Heh?\"\n\"Is he... stupid?\"\n\"Chosen really is dumb.\"\nThe three moons spoke in unison, their voices dripping with amusement.\nThey didn't have mouths, yet you could still hear them speak, kinda weird when you think about it, was it telepathy?\nThe moon in the center, its massive eye glowing with aura, addressed Stark, \"You can try to reach us, if you want,\" it said \"Come on. Entertain us.\"\nAnd then, for a brief moment, everything froze in place.\nThe participants, the moons, even the air itself, seemed to be waiting for what Stark would do next.\nSora clenched her fists, feeling an overwhelming sense of dread, domination trials really pushed her to the limits of her 'emotionless'.\nBut Stark smiled—a slow, deliberate smile.\nHis aura surged, flaring brighter and fiercer until it completely enveloped his form, the crimson light burning so intensely that it distorted the air around him.\nHe looked up at the moons with unwavering resolve and whispered, \"Fine.\"\nThe air around Stark crackled with energy, and something shifted—a palpable tension building as if the world itself sensed what was about to happen.\nStark began to spread his arms wide, about to do something he had never done before.\nSomething so powerful, there was no saying if he could even handle it.\nThe clouds in the sky above began to churn, twisting and darkening, while a low, ominous hum filled the air.\nStark closed his eyes, feeling the immense power welling up inside him, and when he opened them again, his gaze was filled with something new—something otherworldly.\n\"???\"\n\"What the hell...\"\nThe moons could sense, and the participants too.\n\"HEAVEN'S SPEAR!\"\n...\n[Skill: Crimson Spears]\n[New Perk: Heaven's Spear (Ultimate Form)]\n[Description: Upon activation, a colossal rift tears open in the sky, revealing a towering angelic figure, nearly 50 kilometers in height, at the user's command, the angel hurls the giant spear it summoned with such force that it rips through the atmosphere, and upon impact, the spear triggers a small city-level explosion.]\n...\nBOOOOOM!\nA massive, deafening crack split the sky above the moons.\nAnd a colossal rift tore open in the heavens, stretching miles across.\nThe world darkened, the crimson glow from the moons paling in comparison to the apocalyptic force now emerging from the tear.\n\"What the hell-\"\n\"The fuck?\"\nThe moons looked above themselves, surprised.\nUnlucky for them, it was far from being over, actually, it was only the beginning.\nFrom the rift, descended an enormous figure—an angelic being unlike anything anyone had ever seen.\nTowering nearly fifty kilometers in height, its sheer size dwarfed the moons themselves.\nIts body was cloaked in shimmering, ethereal light, its six vast wings stretching wide as if to embrace the entire sky.\nA celestial halo burned above its head, casting a blinding radiance across the landscape, making even the most powerful participants squint in its presence.\nThe angel's gaze was cold and impassive, but its presence was suffocating, it's very being an embodiment of divine wrath.\nThe moons, which had once laughed mockingly, now trembled under the weight of its gaze.\nThey shivered, for the first time, showing a flicker of fear.\nFor the very first time, they were scared of something other than the [Godless Demon].\nAnd then, with a slow, deliberate motion, the angel raised its hand, summoning forth an immense spear of pure crimson energy.\nThe spear materialized out of nothing, its shaft glowing with an unholy light.\n[I will send it upon your command, master.]\nThe angel of the spear spoke through a panel as it hovered above the moons, its cold eyes locked onto its targets.\nStark stood below, his aura blazing as he whispered, \"Angel of the Spear... tear them apart.\"\n[Very well.]\nFWISH!\nWithout hesitation, the angel hurled the colossal spear downward, and the world seemed to hold its breath.\nThe spear shot through the sky with terrifying speed, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake, tearing apart the atmosphere as it descended.\nIts power was incomprehensible, and the sheer force of its descent caused shockwaves to ripple outward, knocking some participants off their feet.\nAfter all, this is the perk of a skill only supposed to be used by a classifier at level 900-1000, something someone at Stark's level shouldn't have.\nThe spear struck the middle moon with a deafening BOOM!\nFor a split second, the world went silent, as if time itself had frozen.\nAnd then, the moon exploded. Not just shattered—obliterated.\nThe crimson sky above seemed to tear apart as the moon disintegrated into nothingness.\nThe participants could barely stand, shielding their eyes from the blinding light and the aftermath of the attack.\nWhen the dust finally settled, the middle moon was gone.\nCompletely annihilated. Not a trace of its once-mocking presence remained in the sky.\nThe remaining two moons trembled, their massive pupils now wide with terror.\nThey had just witnessed a power far beyond anything they had ever anticipated.\n\"WHAT THE FUCK?!\"\n\"THIS IS- WHAT?\"\n[One of the three moons has been slain.]\n[Kill one more, and the last one will reveal its true form, thus the real fight will begin.]\nStark, standing in the aftermath of the destruction, his aura still blazing, looked up at the two remaining moons with a cold, unyielding gaze.\nHe raised his hand again, as if daring them to stay.\n\"Come at me,\" Stark said, his voice calm and resolute.\nOf course, he couldn't do that again until a while, but it was just a threat.\nFor a moment, the moons were silent, their massive pupils locked onto Stark.\nAnd then, without warning, they vanished, disappearing from the sky as quickly as they had come.\n\"FUCK THAT SHIT!\" one of the moons' voices echoed in the distance, their confidence completely gone.\n\"HELL NO, HUMAN! KILL EACH OTHER!\"\nThe moons fled, their laughter gone, replaced by sheer panic.\nThe battlefield was left in stunned silence.\nThe other participants, who had been watching from a distance, stood frozen, their minds struggling to comprehend what they had just witnessed.\nEven Sora, who had fought alongside Stark through thick and thin, was left speechless.\n\"He... destroyed it...\" someone muttered in disbelief.\n\"One of the moons... gone, just like that...\"\nStark stood in the middle of the square, his aura slowly dimming, but his presence was still overwhelming.\nHe had just done the impossible—obliterated a moon with a power so immense it defied logic.\nAnd now, with only two moons left and the path to the Moon Tower clearer than ever, Stark turned his gaze toward the distant tower, his eyes filled with determination.\n'Based on everything I know about the trials... then only killing the participants won't be enough.'\nHe was confident, at 1000%, that even when you were the only survivor and reached the moon tower inside of the 'Termina' city.\nEven after going through the trouble of killing humans and monsters alike, you would go up the tower, and, oh, surprise, there is a boss.\nActually, Stark was half confident that the big boss was the [Crimson Moons Trio], or more like [Crimson Moons Duo] now.\nThey wouldn't let anyone survive this easily, and otherwise why would it be a [Death] difficulty trial?\nWell anyway.\nThe trial was far from over.\nBut after what the participants had just witnessed, they knew one thing for certain:\nStark was not someone to be underestimated.",

      "content": "Stark and Sora stood side by side, watching the dust settle after the moons had fled\nStark, his body still pulsing with the remnants of his aura, gestured toward Sora, \"Let's go,\" and she quickly followed.\n\"What was that?\" she asked as she approached him.\n\"Giant spear,\" Stark shrugged.\nAll of the participants just watched him as he entered the village, not doing anything themselves, too surprised.\nThey knew one thing for certain, though: they shouldn't try to attack Stark if he had such an attack in stock.\nMaybe he even had another?!\nThere were too many risks, and if they wanted to get rid of him, it would be by ambush.\nAt least... that is what they thought until one of them finally broke the silence.\nMiles Volkov, the businessman smoking on his cigar, suddenly laughed loudly, causing everyone, including Stark and Sora, to turn around.\n\"Hahahaha!\"\n\"What's so funny?\" Stark raised his eyebrows.\n\"It's just... It's so funny how you think that little trick of yours would work on us.\"\n\"...?\"\nHow the hell was summoning a whole ass angel a trick?\nStark's initial plan was just to beat the moons, but they had run away, and so now, all participants should have just believed he is untouchable.\nSo... why...\nThe businessman didn't waste time in informing the others of Stark's trick.\n\"Crimson spears,\" the man smiled, \"He used the ultimate perk, as the skill is currently level 100, that is all folks.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Level 100 skill?\"\n\"!!!\" Stark's eyes widened.\nHow the fuck did he know? How the fuck did he see through Stark so easily?\nStark could it in the man's eyes: he could see everything about him.\nThe tension in the air as the businessman revealed that information lowered, but not enough.\nAnd so he continued.\n\"He used the ultimate perk of his skill, which he can only use once every two weeks, meaning that he can't do it again,\" the man puffed again, \"His only other high-level skill is 'Crimson Healing', and all it does is bring him back to full health when his HP reaches 1, it's basically a revive.\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"Well, other than that, his skills are decent, but none are at the level of the one he used, basically, he is just like us, if not weaker,\" Miles smiled mischievously, \"Too bad, you thought no one would try to fight you, heh?\"\n\"I don't think someone who can check out the skills of anyone, as well as description and perks, should be kept alive,\" Stark was mainly speaking to the others.\nThey themselves agreed with him.\nRevealing you had such a passive skill was like a death sentence, it was asking to be killed.\nAnd yet, why was that man so confident?\n\"For your information,\" he spoke again as he left his little space, \"I'm level 135, so if any of you feels good enough to try and fight me, then please do try.\"\nAs a businessman, that guy had used his money to make himself as strong as possible, and it worked.\nHe had dominated both of his first trials, easily killing anyone in his way.\nPlus, he had two other goons in each one of his arms; helping him out whenever he asked, and willing to sacrifice themselves for him.\n\"As much as I'd love to stick around and watch you all tear each other apart,\" the businessman said, clapping his hands, \"I've got business to take care of. So, you folks carry on.\"\nThe man disappeared inside one of the abandoned houses of the village around them, probably trying to get to the city or get quests.\n\"...Fuck,\" Stark gritted his teeth.\nNot only was his ability revealed, that guy also revealed that Stark could get revived once.\nSeems like he couldn't see talents, though, it would have been a disaster if he told the others that Stark also had a talent that allowed him to revive himself at one hp even after death.\nBut with that simple interruption, all the participants looked at Stark, the fear in their eyes had disappeared, and now... they were mad.\nHe had tricked them, but now that his cards were revealed, it was really bad.\n\"I'm the last one to reach level 100,\" Sora informed Stark all of a sudden, \"I'm pretty sure all the others are level 110 or up to level 130.\"\n\"...FUCK!\"\nHe thought he had the complete advantage, but here he was.\nFrom across the village square, two figures began advancing toward them.\nA man and a woman, both moving with purpose.\nThe man was muscular and tall, his short brown hair framing a face filled with cruel amusement.\nThe woman beside him had long black hair and glasses, but her most unnerving feature was the black substance that slithered across her arm, taking the form of a creature with a gaping mouth.\n\"Looks like you had fun with your little show,\" the man sneered as they approached. \"Care to show us what else you've got?\"\n\"Well, I hope you don't mind us testing your strength, then, huh?\" the man smiled as he summoned a single sword out of thin air\n\"...\"\n[Dave Browsky - Level 122]\n[Claire Browsky - Level 123]\n\"Damn.\"\n\"Oh, and for your information,\" the man, Dave, smiled as he positioned himself, \"Me and my partner have already beaten monsters above level 550, so get ready.\"\nThis was bad.\n\"You can try-\" before Stark could finish, or even using [Perception] on them, Dave was already in front of him, his sword right in front of Stark's face.\n\"What?\" Stark's eyes widened.\nEven for a level 122 domination user, this sort of speed was way too much.\nThis isn't normal.\n\"VINE BARRIER,\" Sora mumbled, and thick vines erupted from the ground, barely managing to intercept Dave's attack.\nThe vines curled around the sword, straining to hold it back as sparks flew from the clash..\n\"Heh... so it's a two on two, then,\" Dave laughed.\nFwish! SLASH!\nClaire moved next, her grotesque arm lashing out with the creature-like mouth devouring the vines in an instant. Its teeth chomped through the barrier as if it were paper.\n\"This isn't good,\" Stark muttered, watching the vines wither.\nStark had the power of using his aura to enhance his fists.\nSora had the power to use plants to her advantage.\nBut these two... what were their domination powers?\nStark blinked in surprise, and before he could even think of anything else...\n\"Watch out, you might trip,\" he heard a voice behind him.\nHow is this possible?!\nThe man was right in front of him, and when he blinked, he was gone?!\nSLASH!\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE!\" Stark rolled away, fazing through the blade, as he missed by mere microseconds.\n\"Nice dodge, bro!\" Dave laughed before striking again.\n\"INVINCIBLE DODGE... COMBO!\"\nStark kept dodging, and once he reached the x10 dodge, which is his limit, he used the momentum to grab Dave's arm and kick him away.\n-372!\nHe did absolutely no damage.\nNo... actually...\n-4638!\nStark received more damage than he had caused.\n\"Is that all you've got?\" Dave taunted, his smile never faltering.\nStark gritted his teeth. This isn't going to work.\nThe fight dragged on for a few more brutal minutes, but it was clear Stark and Sora were outmatched.\nDave and Claire toyed with them, barely giving them room to breathe, let alone use any of their abilities effectively.\n\"We need to get out of here,\" Sora whispered urgently.\n\"I know,\" Stark muttered back.\nHis pride stung, but it was the truth.\nThey had no choice but to retreat.\nSora summoned another vine barrier, momentarily blinding their enemies, and the two of them bolted toward one of the abandoned houses.\nStark slammed the door behind them, and they leaned against it, panting for breath.\n\"You could have caught them with your domination ability, why didn't you,\" remarked outside.\n\"Heh,\" Dave laughed, \"Let them go. They're like low-level monsters. Running away like rats when they meet someone stronger.\"\nThe third domination trial could finally start!",

      "content": "\"Well,\" Dave said with a smug grin, looking over his shoulder at Claire.\n\"Hm?\" Claire responded.\n\"Let's just go, I was feeling confident about that kid, but taking too many enemies at once's gonna be difficult.\"\nClaire raised an eyebrow, folding her arms. \"What about the moons? One's already dead, right?\"\nDave nodded, a calculating glint in his eyes.\n\"Yeah, that kid took out one of them, so their power's gotta be reduced.\nIf we bide our time, let the others do some of the dirty work, by the time we're done here, the moons will be easy pickings.\nWe kill everyone else first, then we're the only ones left standing. Simple.\"\n\"Nice!\"\nWithout another word, the two of them turned away from the square, slipping into one of the dilapidated houses.\nThe house they chose was opposite to the ones Stark and the businessman had taken, each group heading their own way toward the same destination: Termina, the heart of the trial.\nAnd so, with that, 7 out of the 15 participants had already gone their own way.\nThe remainder of them were either thinking about their next plan, or too deep in thought to care.\nAmong the stragglers, a pair of twins exchanged a glance.\nWithout a word, they gestured to one another and quietly made their way to one of the houses.\nThey, too, knew that fighting now would be foolish—it was smarter to survive, wait, and strike when their advantage was at its peak.\n\"Hm, interesting,\" a woman with long blonde-haired and fashionable clothes nodded, \"I guess I'll just follow the trends, then, like I always do.\"\nWith a final glance over her shoulder, she headed toward another door, entering yet another crumbling structure and disappearing from sight.\nThere were exactly 15 houses around them, and entering, then leaving them, would make you enter the first area of the trial: the [Death Village].\nAnd so now, only 5 people remained in the middle of the village square.\n\"These people are monsters, hex?\" an old man stood leaning on a cane, his face etched with amusement as he observed the others.\n\"Quit the bullshit, geezer, I'm out,\" nearby, a teenager, no older than Stark, rolled his eyes and groaned.\nHis body crackled with electricity, the air around him charged with static.\nHis very presence was a walking threat, and anyone who got too close would likely be fried on the spot.\n\"Ohoh~\" the old man laughed, \"Seems like these small ones are surprising...\"\nFrankly speaking, if it wasn't for Stark's sudden interruption to fight the moons, then the square would have turned into a bloodbath.\nIf there was no way to get out except if you killed everyone, then the best course of action would be to get this done quickly.\nBut after Stark showed there was indeed a way to win, then everyone suddenly felt like the risk wasn't needed yet.\nOf course, they would kill the moment they saw someone alone, as it could potentially grant rewards.\nBut for now, getting stronger was the top priority.\nThis trial was especially sadistic: notice how so many people are together in pairs?\nStark and Sora, Claire and Dave, Miles and his two goons, as well as the twins.\nIt was as if the people that participated were precisely selected for that, fully knowing they couldn't beat the moons, yet would be forced to kill each other to win.\nThe old man decided to leave too, spinning his cane in his hands.\n\"Well, I received my class very late haha... so seeing all these young folks struggle is interesting,\" he smiled, an intensely powerful aura erupting from him, \"Let's see...\"\nWith that, he entered his own chosen house, leaving the square even quieter than before.\nNow, only three remained.\nAnd they were just as dangerous as the others.\nAmong them, one man, clad in priest clothing, stood still, eyes glazed over as he stared into nothingness.\nHis thoughts were consumed by a singular, maddening desire: 'Kill. Kill. Kill.'\nIn front of him, a glowing panel hovered in the air, displaying a message only he could see.\n...\n[Show your devotion to the 'Godless Demon']\n[Kill one participant to enhance your power.]\n...\nThe priest, whose name was Kinji, gripped his cross necklace tightly, feeling the power of his godless master flow through him.\nHe needed a sacrifice. Now.\nThe second was the artist, his eyes darting everywhere, a vortex of aura spinning in them, much like with Stark.\n\"My masterpiece... I saw the final thing I needed...\"\nOnce he saw Stark's aura, he instantly knew that the blood of this boy would be what could complete his work.\nWith his two brushes in hand, he took a step toward one of the houses, but this time, he actually directed himself toward the one Stark and Sora had taken.\nBut...\nClick!\n[This house is already occupied. Choose another.]\nOnce you close the door of a house, it cannot be opened again.\n\"Masterpiece... don't hide from me...\" he reluctantly took the one right next to it, and entered.\nThe final person left standing in the square was a woman, sitting cross-legged, her eyes closed in meditation.\nShe hadn't moved since the trial began.\n\"...\" she was calm, her aura focused, though dangerous.\nKinji, the priest, turned his gaze toward her, his bloodlust flaring.\n'Yes… yes… she'll be the first. She'll be the sacrifice to my godless master.'\nHis cross necklace shimmered as he strode toward her, the calmness of her posture only fueling his rage.\nAs he approached, the cross transformed in his hand, shifting into a massive sword adorned with intricate symbols.\nHe raised it high, ready to strike.\n\"I wouldn't try that if I was you,\" while not even opening her eyes, the woman spoke, \"You won't even hurt me.\"\nKinji's grip tightened on his weapon, his eyes narrowing in fury, \"Foolish woman… Lord Godless is with me.\"\nFwish!\nWith a snarl, he swung the sword down, aiming for her head.\nBut as the blade neared her, it stopped—suspended in midair, inches from her face.\nAn invisible force held it back, an unseen barrier that Kinji hadn't expected.\n\"...?\"\nThe woman's eyes remained shut, her expression bored. \"Go play somewhere else puppy,\" she said dismissively, raising her hand.\nA massive, glowing palm materialized behind her.\nWith a flick of her wrist, the palm slammed into Kinji, sending him crashing into one of the nearby houses with bone-shattering force.\n-73724!\nKinji coughed, blood dripping from his mouth as he struggled to his feet.\nThis attack took more than half of his life.\n\"Gurh... Lord Godless... why...\"\nHis vision blurred as the system panel appeared before him again.\n...\n[Show your devotion]\n[Kill one human]\n...\n\"Oh... yes... I need to show you that I deserve those powers...\" Kinji laughed by himself, before opening the door of the house he had crashed into and disappeared.\nThe woman, on the other hand, just stood in place, meditating.\n\"Fools,\" she whispered.\nShe didn't even care enough about any of these people to actually try, for she was sure that she was the strongest.\nShe was currently level 140, and if you considered the power of the [Domination] class, then she could take down level 580 and even level 600 monsters if she wanted.\nShe didn't know if she could beat the moons, but there was a good chance she would be able to if she tried hard enough.\n'That boy...' she thought for a moment, 'Nevermind.'\nShe returned to her meditation.\n...\nBack to Stark and Sora, inside the house they took.\nThe place was run-down, with mold creeping up the walls and dust covering every surface.\nThe living room and kitchen were barely more than ruins, and an old, broken television sat in front of a sofa.\n\"We should be careful,\" Sora spoke as they navigated, \"We're probably the weakest here.\"\n\"...Yeah.\"\nStark didn't expect it at all, but if everyone else was level 110, if not more, then there is no way his big level boost could help.\nDave and Claire were level 122 and 123, and the businessman was level 135.\n\"Death difficulty trial for a reason, heh...\"\n\"I guess so.\"\n\"But don't worry, Sora,\" Stark stopped in his tracks, putting his hand on Sora's beautiful white hair, \"Even if everyone else dies, then I'll find a way to kill those moons, no matter what.\"\nHearing that, Sora let out a quick smile, \"I know you will.\"\nJust like that, the two of them nodded, and headed toward the exit door, which is also the entrance to the [Death Village].\nFwish! Click!\n[Welcome to 'Death Village']\n[Be careful of the moonscorched beasts.]",

      "content": "The door creaked open, and a cold gust of air swept past Stark and Sora as they stepped into the ominous surroundings of the [Death Village].\nThe village itself looked like something torn from a nightmare.\nCrumbling houses, their windows shattered and walls lined with dark, twisted vines, flanked the narrow streets.\n[You do not belong here.]\nA warning appeared before them.\nThe two of them exchanged a glance, but still moved forward regardless.\nThey were in the heart of one of the most dangerous places imaginable, and the stakes were life or death.\nIf you put it as if it was a normal rift, then the [Death Village] would be a level 450-500 area, and Termina would be a level 500-600 area.\n\"Stay close,\" Stark murmured, his eyes scanning everything for any sign of movement.\nSora nodded silently, her hand already pulsing with green energy, ready to summon her vines at a moment's notice.\nDespite the oppressive atmosphere, she remained calm—she trusted Stark.\nIf anyone could pull off the impossible, it was him.\nThe village was silent, but it was a dangerous kind of quiet.\nWhere were the other participants?\nWith this many of them, there was no way to not find anybody.\n\"Look,\" Sora pointed at their house, \"We're the only house close by, meaning that every house outside the square directs to a random street.\"\n\"Oh,\" Stark nodded.\nThey moved forward through the streets.\nIt was complete silence though, not a single monster or participant on sight.\n\"These 'moonscorched beasts'... you think they're watching us?\" Sora asked, her voice low.\n\"Don't even know what they are,\" Stark shrugged.\nBut suddenly, a sound broke the silence.\nSkrrt. Skrrt.\nIt was faint at first, but unmistakable—the sound of something scratching against stone.\nStark immediately stopped, motioning for Sora to do the same.\nHis eyes locked onto a nearby alleyway, shrouded in darkness.\nThe noise came again, a scraping sound, like claws dragging across the floor.\nStark's heart pounded in his chest as he squinted into the blackness.\nThere was something there.\nWaiting.\nWithout warning, a figure burst out from the shadows.\nFwoosh!\nIt moved faster than Stark could react, a blur of motion that shot straight toward him, claws outstretched, its eyes glowing with a sickly yellow light.\nStark barely had time to raise fists.\n\"FUCK!\" Stark shouted instinctively.\nSLASH!\n-24772!\nHis arm was slashed by the creature's claws, and Sora immediately kicked it away using her vines.\n-123623!\nThe creature in front of him was monstrous, a grotesque fusion of human and beast.\nIts flesh was pale and cracked, with dark veins pulsing beneath its skin. Its elongated limbs ended in jagged, razor-sharp claws, and its face, if it could still be called a face, had the twisted shape of a human skull, its eyes glowing with a malevolent light.\n\"PERCEPTION!\"\n...\n[Name: Moonscorched Villager]\n[Level: 500]\n[HP: 1,276,377/1,400,000]\n[Strength: 15373]\n[Stamina: 9462]\n[Speed: 19382]\n[Defense:11481]\n[Skills: Void Blink, Devouring Shadow, Lunar Howl, Moonlit Regeneration, Corruption Touch, Flesh Warp, Death Villager, Moonscorched...]\n...\n\"That thing...\" Stark's eyes widened.\nA level 500 monster.\nIt had incredible high stats for a common monster.\nIt surpassed the strength of the apostles in the [Devil's Abyss] too.\n\"You're telling me... this is a common monster?\" Stark's face paled as he took his position.\n\"Here it comes!\" Sora spoke, vines swirling in the air around her as she prepared to strike.\nThe Moonscorched Villager blurred forward in a flash, using [Void Blink] to close the distance between them in the blink of an eye.\nStark barely registered the movement before it was upon him again, claws raised high.\nHe threw himself to the side, narrowly dodging a brutal swipe that tore through the air where his head had been moments before.\n\"Shit!\" Stark muttered, scrambling to his feet.\nThe creature was fast—too fast.\n\"Vine Surge!\" Sora's vines lashed out at the creature, striking it squarely in the chest, but it twisted its body unnaturally, avoiding the worst of the impact with [Flesh Warp].\nHer attack landed but did only minimal damage.\n-47427!\nThe creature's eyes glowed brighter as it unleashed a [Lunar Howl], the sound reverberating through the alley.\n[The monster has called for backup, you should hurry up.]\n\"AURA SMASH MERGE! SPEAR OF JUDGMENT!\"\nStark sent his two merged attacks, hitting the monster in the chest as it howled.\n-283722! -573891!\nIt received incredibly high damage!\nBut before he could do anything else, the moonscorched beast used [Void Blink] again, appearing right behind Stark.\n\"Ah...\"\nBut thankfully, Sora's vines shot out again, entangling the monster's limbs.\nWith an emotionless expression, she used her enhanced control to slam the monster repeatedly against the houses and ground.\nThe Moonscorched Villager screeched in frustration, ripping through the vines with its claws, but the brief distraction gave Stark the moment he needed.\n\"Domination Soul,\" he summoned his heart in front of him, and without waiting a single instant, began to slam it against the monster.\nSLAM! SLAM! SLAM!\nThe first blow put it to the ground, but when it tried to get up, Stark slammed again, forcing it to stay down.\n-184723! -193217! -183749!\nThis kept going until, eventually, the monster stopped moving altogether.\n[You have slain 'Moonscorched Villager lvl500', gaining 1,150,000 experience points!]\nStark staggered back, panting heavily, blood still dripping from his wound.\nHe glanced at Sora, who wiped sweat from her brow but gave him a nod of reassurance.\nThey had won.\nBut before Stark could catch his breath, a notification flashed before his eyes.\n[You have been Moonscorched.]\n\"Huh?\" Stark blinked, confused.\nAnother notification followed:\n[2% Moonscorched]\n\"What... the hell is this?\" Stark muttered, staring at the message.\nHis mind raced, but nothing made sense.\nMoonscorched? How? The creature had been destroyed!\nSora noticed the look on his face. \"What's wrong?\"\n\"I… I think something's happening to me,\" Stark said, his voice tense.\nHe raised his arm, and for a brief moment, he saw it—the faintest flicker of darkness crawling along his skin, like shadows whispering just beneath the surface.\nIt was emerging from the wound he got from the creature.\nAnd suddenly...\nDING! DING! DING!\n[Global Trial Announcement!]\n\"Hm?\"\n\"Oh?!\"\n\"An announcement, they're always helpful!\"\nThe other participants, who were all killing monsters or resting in the houses, also got it.\nEvery participant in the trial had a panel appear in front of them, Sora included.\n[Chosen has been infected by Moonscorch!]\n[Thus, the effects will be revealed.]\n\"...!\"\nA video appeared in front of all participants, showing the moment where the [Moonscorched Villager] emerged from the darkness and slashed Stark's arm.\n[The moment a moonscorched beast hits you, you are instantly infected.]\n[The infection spreads when you remain outside, since the rays of the crimson moons hit you directly.]\n[The only way to reduce the percentage number is to go back in your home and wait.]\n[Though, do note, someone that is moonscorched attracts beast way more than someone that isn't.]\n[If your moonscorched percentage reaches 100, you become like one of the beasts, not only in the trial, but in real life too.]\n\"So... like the black sun in the very first rift I conquered?\" Stark raised his eyebrows.\nBut no answer, and all the panels closed.\n\"Ah... fuck...\"\nHe had been the first to get infected, tough luck.\n[If you get hit again by another moonscorched beast, the power of the infection will grow.]\nStark could finally see why this trial was of the death difficulty.\nAnd he needed to be extra careful.\n\"Let's go,\" Sora nodded.\n\"Yeah.\"\nBut right as they took their first steps to continue heading to [Termina], the city, Stark realized something.\n\"Hey, Sora...\" his expression darkened.\n\"Hm?\"\n\"That monster we fought used a skill called [Lunar Howl].\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"It said that backup was coming soon.\"\n\"...\"\n\"And we've been reading the announcement for at least three minutes.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nWhich means...\n\"SCRAKSKS-\"\n\"GRRRR-\"\nThat the monster they fought wasn't the only one.\nFar down the street, more glowing eyes began to appear in the fog.\nAll the monsters were coming from a single side.\nAnd it felt as though every moonscorched villager that was in Stark and Sora's area had regrouped after the [Lunar Howl].\nStark took the time to observe.\n\"There's 32 of them, we can't win,\" he said, taking a few step backs, \"I'm already injured.\"\n\"Here,\" Sora approached Stark, and using one of her vines, she enrolled it around Stark's arm to cover up the wound, \"That should help.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\nBut as he saw the vine, Stark suddenly got an amazing idea.\n\"Hey, Sora.\"\n\"Hm?\"\n\"Can you restrain these monsters for even just a second?\"\n\"I can... try.\"\nEVERGREEN RESILIENCE!\nThe ground beneath them turned green and grassy, and now, the monsters were in Sora's domain.\nFWISH! FWISH! FWISH!\nHundreds upon hundreds of vines came out of the ground and began to restrain the [Moonscorched Villagers].\n\"NICE!\" Stark smiled, his aura taking over, \"Alright.\"\nHe drew a circle in his palm, then taped it with his fist before pointing at the sky.\n\"HEAVEN'S WRATH!\"\nThanks to his enhanced aura and mastery, the beam took only a single second to charge up, before erupting onto every single one of the beasts.\n-737282! -839304! -647265!\nLet's just say, none of them survived.",

      "content": "The notifications flashed rapidly in front of Stark's eyes, each one a reminder of the carnage they'd just unleashed on the Moonscorched Villagers.\n[You have slain 'Moonscorched Villager lvl500', gaining 1,150,000 experience points!]\n[You have slain 'Moonscorched Villager lvl500', gaining 1,150,000 experience points!]\n...\nThe messages kept coming—32 times in total.\nStark and Sora had decimated every monster in their path, and the rewards reflected that.\nStark felt the surge of power course through his body as his level shot up multiple times.\n[Your level has increased to level 107, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Your level has increased to level 108, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\n...\n[Your level has increased to level 110, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\nHe was now level 110. The notification for his experience progress appeared:\n[Experience: 4,327,000/8,900,000], and with it, another reminder of how much stronger he had become.\n[Skill Points: 63]\nDing!\n[Level 110 Reached: Pick a card!]\nUsually, Stark would summon his ultimate clone, a trusted ally in making difficult choices, and the perfect partner to aid him in battle. But this time, something was different.\nFwish!\nOnly one card appeared in front of him, its back emblazoned with the symbol of a shield.\nCurious, Stark reached out and took hold of the card, feeling a strange warmth as he grasped it.\n[Domination has sensed your difficulties, and thus has decided to help.]\nDing!\n...\n[New Skill: Crimson Barrier (Mythical Passive)]\n[Level: 1]\n[Description: Crimson Barrier is a mystical shield that surrounds Stark at all times, acting as a second layer of protection. The barrier has its own HP pool of 250,000, absorbing all damage until broken. Once shattered, the barrier will take a full day to regenerate.\nStark does not need to activate or maintain it; the barrier operates passively, offering him constant defense, even in the most dire situations.]\n...\nStark blinked. \"Whoa...\"\nIt was as if the Domination system had sensed his struggle against the powerful foes in this trial and had granted him a massive protection.\nThe only other time he had received a defensive ability was much earlier, for one of the first perks of [Domination], and that one could only absorb a mere 5,000 HP.\nBut now, this Crimson Barrier could take up to 250,000 damage—and it didn't even need to be activated.\nIt was always there, guarding him.\nA shield that wouldn't falter unless absolutely overwhelmed.\nHe felt the immediate comfort of knowing he now had a cushion of defense.\nA small smile formed on his lips. \"This is perfect.\"\nThe new skill entered his arsenal, strengthening him further.\nAnd just as he was reveling in this newfound protection, another notification appeared.\n[You have eliminated all the 'Moonscorched Villagers' in your area. The 'Moonscorch Effect' has been removed.]\n\"Hm?\"\n[This means that your moonscorch percentage will go down in this area.]\n\"Oh.\"\nIf you eliminate all of the moonscorched beasts in an area, then not only do you gain massive experience, but the effect of the crimson moons is also completely removed.\nStark glanced at the Moonscorch status indicator.\n[4% Moonscorched]\n.\n.\n[3% Moonscorched]\nLuckily, the moonscorched effect was pretty damn weak, but Stark was confident that the trial played its card on the fact that the more you are hit, the stronger the effect becomes.\nHim and Sora would need to protect one another to not get hit.\nSora, standing beside him, still looked battle-ready but calm.\nShe glanced at Stark. \"Want to take a break to recover?\"\nStark chuckled. \"No, let's keep going.\" His tone was confident. \"Let's enter Termina.\"\nSora nodded, and together they pressed on, knowing that the real danger had only just begun.\nAs they approached the entrance to the city, another message greeted them.\n[Most of you should now understand how this trial works.]\n[But I'm sure none of you are weak enough to die at the hands of the monsters.]\nThe tone of the message was almost mocking.\nStark braced himself.\n[Introducing the \"Key\" task!]\n[If you want to access 'Termina', the main city, you'll have to eliminate three players.]\n[Those who eliminate a player receive an overwhelming advantage.]\n\"Fucking hell…\" Stark muttered under his breath.\nIt was just like the second trial—a ruthless demand to kill other participants.\nHe knew from experience that no trial in the Domination series was the same, but this one clearly wanted blood.\nThe system continued, laying out the harsh terms.\n[Once three players are killed, the gates to the city will be opened, and no new moonscorched beasts will spawn in the Death Village, making it a 'safe zone'.]\n[Kill a player, and you'll receive a 'Moonscorch Cure': Cures you of moonscorch completely for an entire day, meaning that even if you are hit, it won't work on you (Trust me, you'll need this.)]\nStark clenched his fists.\nThis was a cutthroat trial, even with all the monsters, the real threat was always going to be the other participants.\nAnd now, they were all forced to turn on each other, at least, more than before.\nAs if that wasn't enough, the final message made Stark's blood run cold.\n[Oh, and watch out for the sniper.]\nThen, all the panels disappeared.\nWait, what?\n\"Watch out for the sniper?\"\nMost players were currently fighting, so they didn't really have the time to watch the panels.\nStark and Sora was the only ones that had gotten rid of all their beasts this fast thanks to [Heaven's Wrath].\n\"Maybe I should use my skill points...\"\nAnd just as he was about to focus on assigning his skill points, another restriction appeared.\nDing!\n[You are not allowed to use skill points during this trial, as an item specialized for that will be revealed later!]\n\"Of course,\" Stark groaned.\nIn this trial, you couldn't just upgrade your skills mid-battle.\nIf you hadn't prepared beforehand, you were stuck.\nHe was level 110 now, but that didn't mean much if he couldn't improve his skills.\nWorse still, these participants weren't ordinary, they were the best of the best, all at the top of their respective Domination levels.\n[This trial has selected some of the strongest domination users in your level range.]\n\"Yeah, I get it now,\" Stark muttered, realizing that he was truly up against the elite.\nQuickly, Stark retrieved his spirits and began to move.\nHe didn't know the identity, the skills, nor the names of any of the other participants, but surely he could manage.\nHe always did.\nReaching the end of the street he had been in, he noticed a sign that said [Villagers Street].\nProbably related to the monsters he fought, which would also mean that the other participants each got a different type of monsters as well.\nBeside the sign was a door.\n[Use it to enter the main square, right before the city.]\n[From there, you will be access all the other streets.]\nThis is how the beginning of the trial would force them to fight: the person that is fastest to get here would have an incredible advantage by taking their enemies by surprise.\n\"Haha...\" and Stark was sure as hell about to use it to his advantage!\nHe pushed the two wooden gates open, and was greeted by the main square, which was surrounded by houses and crumbling buildings.\nBut he could also see the name of the streets from a distance.\n[Ghouls Street]\n[Rats Street]\n[Birds Street]\nEach participant was having their own battles.\nStark truly thought that arriving first would give him the push he needed to take down one of the participants and get a cure to his moonscorch.\nBut he soon realized, that in the trial, even those that arrive first get unfair treatment.\nFWISH!\nIn the distance, too far for him to notice, the scope of a sniper had been on him right as he opened the door.\nAnd less than five seconds later, a sharp, eerie sound echoed from somewhere far off.\nBOOM!\nStark didn't notice it immediately, but within moments, he felt the disturbance.\nHe had been targeted.\nNot by a monster—but by something far worse.\nSuddenly, a bright flash lit up the sky.\nBOOM!\nBefore Stark could react, the sniper's bullet struck him square in the chest, a massive blast of energy ripping through his Crimson Barrier and sending him flying backward.\n-234,728!\nThe impact was brutal.\nStark hit the ground hard, gasping for breath as the searing pain of the sniper's attack radiated through his body.\nEven with the barrier, you still felt pain, and without it, he would have died, forced to use up [Crimson Healing] at the beginning stage.\nHis barrier had absorbed most of the damage, but it was already dangerously close to breaking.\nThe [Sniper] was here.",

FWISH! FWISH!\nSeveral more bullets cut through the sky, each aimed with deadly precision.\nStark's heart raced, his instincts screaming at him to move.\nHis eyes sharpened, and his body acted before his mind fully registered.\nHe twisted and dodged, narrowly avoiding the streaking bullets, each one tearing through the air with the goal of killing him.\nBut Stark couldn't figure out the sniper's position, it was far beyond the boy's reach.\nHe couldn't just keep dodging.\nThe sniper could be anywhere, and retreating would only give the attacker more opportunities.\nGoing back to Villagers Street wasn't an option either—Stark knew the sniper had an extensive range and could likely shoot him no matter where he went.\nGritting his teeth, he made his decision.\n\"ASURA'S ARMS... WRATH!\" he roared, his aura exploding outward.\nFour crimson arms burst from his body—two extending from his shoulders, and two from beneath his original arms.\nThe ethereal limbs crackled with divine energy, brimming with the raw power of a god.\nEach arm throbbed with strength, mirroring his own potential, but imbued with the divine fury of the God of Wrath.\n[Asura's Arms - Wrath: Activated]\nStark's six arms flexed as he prepared himself for the next attack.\nThe sniper was relentless, but if Stark could intercept one of those bullets, he could turn the tide.\nIt was a gamble, almost suicide, but it was the only option left.\nSomewhere in the distance, the sniper clicked his tongue in annoyance, hidden in the shadows of crumbling buildings.\nHe had been expecting an easy kill.\n\"Hm...\" the sniper muttered, adjusting his scope.\nHis pale, disfigured hand reloaded the weapon, this time sliding in something far more sinister than a regular bullet. \"Looks like I'll have to use this.\"\nThe sniper loaded a glowing bullet into his gun, its surface pulsating with an eerie, crimson-black energy.\n[Moonscorched Bullet Loaded]\n\"This one won't miss,\" the sniper growled, his voice low and mechanical.\nStark, standing in the open with his six crimson arms raised, watched as the sniper prepared his next shot.\nHe didn't know what kind of bullet this was, but something about it felt overwhelmingly dangerous.\nBOOM!\nThe sniper fired, and the world seemed to slow.\nThe bullet was unlike any Stark had ever seen.\nA spiraling, dark red and black projectile shot toward him at terrifying speed, crackling with energy.\nStark barely had time to brace himself before the bullet made contact with his raised arms.\nBAMMM!\nThe impact was so powerful that the entire village could hear it.\nA deafening explosion echoed through the streets, shaking buildings and sending waves of dust into the air.\n...\nIn a nearby alley, Starful, the fashionable blonde-haired girl fighting off Moonscorched Rats, stopped in her tracks, her face twisting in confusion.\n\"What the hell was that?\" she muttered, glancing around nervously.\n...\nElsewhere, Miles, the businessman casually smoking a cigar paused for a moment, looking in the direction of the blast.\nA smirk curled on his lips. \"Oh… it's that boy,\" he chuckled before returning to his fight.\n...\nBack with Stark, the Moonscorched Bullet was spinning violently against his six arms, pushing them backward with overwhelming force.\nHis muscles strained as he resisted the bullet's forward momentum, feeling the raw power coursing through it.\nIt wasn't just a physical attack—it carried something far more dangerous.\n[Description: This bullet has the ability to instantly moonscorch anyone it hits.]\nIf Stark let this bullet slip past, it was game over.\nHe wouldn't be able to use Crimson Healing or his Chosen One talent to protect himself from a direct hit.\nThe Moonscorch would consume him instantly.\n\"RAGHHHH!\" Stark gritted his teeth, digging his heels into the ground.\nHis arms flickered, the crimson energy wavering as the bullet pressed harder.\nThe sheer pressure was immense.\nEvery ounce of strength he had was being funneled into stopping it.\nCrack!\nOne of the crimson arms faltered, but Stark held on.\nHe couldn't let this thing win.\nWith a final burst of strength, Stark stopped the bullet, his body trembling from the effort.\nHis aura arms flickered dangerously, on the verge of dissipating.\nThe bullet, still crackling with energy, hung in the air, inches from his chest.\nBut it wasn't over.\nTaking a deep breath, Stark did the unthinkable.\nHe grabbed the bullet with his bare hands.\n[Do not touch bullet!]\n[Moonscorch infection: 20%… 38%… 53%…]\nIgnoring the rising infection rate, Stark spun on his heels, using the momentum to swing the bullet around him.\nHis body became a blur as he spun faster and faster, his arms moving in unison.\nThe infection surged, reaching a dangerous level.\n[Infection: 72%... 85%... 90%...]\nStark's vision began to blur as the moonscorch threatened to overtake him, but he couldn't stop now.\nWith one final spin, he hurled the bullet back toward the sniper.\nFWISH!\nThe crimson-black bullet shot through the air, faster than when it had first been fired.\nThe sniper, unable to react in time, barely managed a startled gasp before the bullet struck him square in the chest.\nBOOM!\nThe explosion was deafening, the sniper's body engulfed in the destructive force of the bullet he had fired. Stark watched as the sniper's form was thrown from its hidden perch, crashing into the main square with a loud thud.\n-646,849!\nThe sniper writhed in pain, a deep, guttural growl escaping its mouth as it fell from its window onto the ground of the main square.\nNow that it had been exposed, Stark could finally see it in full view.\nThe sniper was a towering figure, nearly five meters tall.\nIts body was grotesquely twisted, with a strange tank attached to its head, linking directly into its spine like a parasite.\nThe sniper didn't actually weird a sniper either, it was just that its right arm had morphed into a massive, cannon-like weapon that fired the devastating bullets.\n[Moonscorched Sniper - Calamity Boss]\n[Level 500]\nThe sniper growled, its glowing red eyes fixing on Stark as it struggled to stand.\nWithout hesitation, it raised its cannon arm once more, aiming directly at Stark.\n\"Even reaching the main square first means trouble, huh?\" Stark muttered under his breath, his six arms still raised and ready for action.\nThe adrenaline still pumped through his veins as he eyed the sniper warily.\nControlling his six arms felt almost natural now, far easier than he had imagined when he first gained the ability.\nThe intense training in the Memories Museum had paid off—he could manipulate them with ease, every motion fluid and precise.\nThe sniper, now back on its feet, growled in frustration.\n\"Die,\" it grumbled, and its cannon arm came to life once more.\n\"SNIPE SHOT!\"\nBOOM!\nAnother massive bullet tore through the air, but Stark was faster this time.\nHe sidestepped, the bullet whizzing past him and smashing into the gate behind him, reducing it to rubble.\nHe activated his Perception, scanning the sniper.\n...\n[Name: Levi, The Moonscorched Sniper]\n[Level: 500]\n[HP: 2,353,151/3,000,000]\n[Strength: 31,283]\n[Stamina: 12,842]\n[Speed: 12,472]\n[Defense: 11,821]\n[Skills: Sniper Arm (Passive); Moonscorched Bullet; Hardened Carapace; Enhanced Scope; Snipe Shot; Unyielding Will (MYTHICAL Passive); Bullet Storm; Shadow Cloak; Explosive Shell; Adaptive Targeting (GODLY PASSIVE)...]\n...\nThat thing overwhelming strength, no wonder it did over 200,000 damage to Stark, even though he was a [Domination] user, which meant his aura protected him.\nA normal person could have potentially received 1,000,000 damage.\nBut what stood out most were its skills—ten of them, all deadly.\n...\n[Sniper Arm (Passive): Fires bullets with extreme precision and power.]\n[Moonscorched Bullet: Instantly moonscorches targets on impact.]\n[Hardened Carapace: Greatly increases defense when under attack.]\n[Enhanced Scope: Increases accuracy from long distances.]\n[Snipe Shot: A charged attack that deals immense damage.]\n[Unyielding Will: Gains increased power the longer a battle lasts.]\n[Bullet Storm: Fires a rapid succession of bullets in a wide area.]\n[Shadow Cloak: Can conceal itself for a brief period.]\n[Explosive Shell: Fires a special bullet that causes a large area explosion upon impact.]\n[Adaptive Targeting: The sniper adjusts its aim, improving accuracy with each missed shot.]\n...\nStark gritted his teeth.\nThis wasn't just a fight against a regular boss—this thing was built for long-range warfare.\nHe needed to act fast before the sniper's skill set overwhelmed him.\nLevi's Adaptive Targeting and Unyielding Will were particularly dangerous if the battle dragged on.\nThe longer it lasted, the more deadly Levi would become.\nLevi raised his cannon-like arm again, the weapon glowing ominously as it prepared another shot.\nStark couldn't give it the chance.\n\"Alright, no more games,\" Stark muttered, his voice a low growl as he readied himself for the next move.\nHis crimson arms crackled with energy, the power of the God of Wrath burning within him.",

      "content": "Stark crouched, breathing deeply as he narrowed his gaze on the towering sniper, Levi.\nThe air around them crackled with tension, thick and suffocating.\nThe moonscorched sniper's grotesque form loomed ominously, the tank on its head pulsing with crimson energy, its cannon-arm whirring ominously.\nStark knew the sniper wasn't a normal opponent; its attacks were deadly, precise, and overwhelming.\nBut this time, he had a plan.\n\"Sora,\" Stark said, his voice steady despite the adrenaline pumping through his veins. \"Hold him off for a few seconds. I need time to lock onto him.\"\nSora, standing by his side, barely nodded, her emotionless eyes reflecting a faint spark of understanding.\n\"Understood,\" she replied in her flat, detached tone, before stepping forward, her hands shimmering with vines and green aura.\nStark closed his eyes for a moment, slowing his breath.\nHis muscles tensed as he focused on the sniper's movements.\nHe activated his perk—Flow—allowing him to delve into the enemy's aura.\nAs the world around him dimmed, all external noise faded into a dull hum. In this state, Stark could feel the sniper's essence, the way its energy flowed and surged through its body.\n[Flow: Activated. 10 seconds to focus…]\nIn those precious seconds, Sora rushed toward Levi, moving with almost mechanical precision.\n\"VINE SMASH!\"\nHer fists glowed with an ethereal light as she lashed out, her vine strikes aimed at the sniper's body.\nLevi grunted, swinging its massive cannon arm toward her in a wide arc, but Sora was too fast.\nShe ducked beneath the blow, her expressionless face never wavering as she delivered a flurry of quick strikes to the creature's legs.\n-73622! -78472! -72713!\nBOOM!\nThe sniper fired another round, the bullet slicing through the air toward Sora, but she leaped backward just in time, her movements calculated and calm.\nStark's eyes snapped open. He had him.\n[Flow: Connection established. Enemy's movements can be predicted 1 second before execution.]\nThe sniper's aura was a steady, unyielding stream of raw power, but now Stark could see the patterns.\nHe could anticipate Levi's next attack before it even happened.\nWith his link secured, Stark grinned, his six aura arms flexing with newfound strength.\n\"Alright, it's my turn now.\"\nWithout hesitation, Stark charged forward, his Asura's Arms glowing with crimson energy as they swung with deadly force.\nThe first set of arms crashed into the ground where the sniper stood, creating a small shockwave that forced Levi to retreat.\n-32731!\nStark followed up with another blow from his secondary set of arms, slamming into Levi's cannon arm, knocking the monster aside before it could fire again.\n-184728!\nThe sniper growled, stumbling from the impact, but quickly recovered.\nLevi raised his cannon arm once more, the tank's cannon that served as his eye locked on him.\nBut this time, Stark was ready.\n\"SNIPE SHOT!\"\nThe sniper's cannon roared as a bullet flew toward Stark, its speed and power enough to obliterate anything in its path.\nBut with Flow guiding him, Stark could see it coming.\nA second before the bullet was fired, Stark sidestepped, his six arms deflecting the bullet mid-air.\nThe projectile exploded behind him, sending debris flying, but Stark didn't lose his focus.\nHe moved swiftly, closing the gap between him and the sniper with ease.\nAs he neared Levi, he activated Crimson Spears.\nFive spears of pure crimson energy appeared around him, each one humming with destructive power.\n\"SPEAR OF JUDGEMENT!\"\nThe aura around him swelled as he summoned the Spear of Judgment—a colossal, crimson spear that materialized above him.\nThe ground trembled as the spear descended, locking onto the sniper's massive form.\nThe sniper tried to swing its cannon/sniper to deflect the spear, but it didn't realize just how strong the spear was.\nLevi's eyes widened as the spear pierced through its cannon, spinning faster and faster, until eventually, the crimson energy detonating upon impact.\nBOOM!\n-837,335!\nThe explosion sent Levi crashing to the ground, its health bar visibly plummeting.\nThe sniper struggled to rise, its body smoking from the blast, but Stark could see the wear and tear.\nThe moonscorched sniper was weakening.\n\"You're done,\" Stark growled, his voice filled with determination.\nLevi, though injured, was not finished yet.\n\"THE MOON LORDS HAVE CALLED MY NAME- NO, OUR NAMES!\"\nLevi spoke for the first time, its aura taking over its entire body, \"WE SHALL NOT LOSE. DIE!\"\nThe sniper growled, its tank-like form twitching as it activated its strongest ability—Bullet Storm.\n\"BULLET STORM!\"\nA rapid succession of bullets sprayed from Levi's cannon arm, each one capable of dealing devastating damage.\nStark's eyes widened, but he remained calm.\nHis skill—Invincible Dodge—kicked in, allowing him to effortlessly weave through the barrage of bullets. Each one missed him by mere inches, but Stark didn't falter.\nThis kept going for 30 seconds.\nAs Levi became more frustrated, Stark saw his opening.\nWith a mental command, Stark used [Domi-Chains Restrain]'s Mythical Perk.\nCrimson chains erupted from the ground, wrapping around the sniper's legs and arms, restricting its movements.\nLevi roared in anger, struggling against the chains, but the more it fought, the tighter the chains became.\nIt could have broke free from a single chain, but three was just overkill.\nThough, if Stark did nothing, then Levi would surely escape.\n\"Chains of Judgment!\"\n...\n[Perk: Chains of Judgment (Mythical Perk)]\n[Description: Not only do you get three chains instead of one, but you can also summon \"Gortox\", the chain demon, to aid you in chaining your enemies]\n...\nWith the chains holding Levi in place, Stark summoned Gortox, the chain demon.\nA massive figure materialized beside Stark, its body wrapped in even more chains, a single eye looking down on Levi as if he was but a mere insect.\nGortox grinned wickedly as it extended its own chains toward the sniper, further restraining it.\nLevi's eyes widened in fear as Gortox's chains wrapped around its cannon arm, preventing it from firing any more bullets.\nStark wasted no time.\nHe raised his arms, summoning the full power of Asura's Arms.\n\"ASURA'S WRATH!\"\nThe six crimson arms pulsed with divine energy, their aura growing stronger with each passing second.\nIn the distance, he could see that Sora had been struggling to keep up, getting hit by three of the bullets and receiving massive damage.\nEven her [Vine Barrier], that she tried to use on Stark to help him, didn't work.\nStark's rage fueled the attack, his body glowing with an intense crimson light.\nThe aura arms swung down in unison, releasing a shockwave that obliterated everything in a 100-meter radius ahead.\nThe ground beneath Levi cracked and shattered as the shockwave hit, the sniper's body engulfed in the destructive force.\nLevi let out one final, agonized roar before the light consumed it entirely.\n-2,347,849!\nThe damage was incredible.\nBOOM!\nWhen the dust settled, Levi's body lay crumpled on the ground, defeated.\nThe sniper's health bar hit zero, and the glowing tank on its head flickered before shutting off entirely.\n[Levi, the Moonscorched Sniper: Defeated]\n[Crimson Barrier has been fully reformed.]\nStark stood over the fallen enemy, his breath coming in heavy gasps.\nHis aura arms flickered for a moment before fading away, leaving him with only his original two.\nThe battle had been fierce, but Stark had emerged victorious.\nHe glanced over at Sora, who had watched the final moments of the fight in silence.\nShe nodded slightly, acknowledging his victory.\n\"It's over,\" Stark said, wiping the sweat from his brow. \"Finally.\"\nBut before he could even catch his breath, a loud clang echoed through the air.\nStark's eyes widened as he saw the gates of the other streets suddenly swing open.\nDust filled the air as figures emerged from the now-opened gates.\nThe other participants had arrived.\n\"Looks like it's finally over,\" Dave appeared, a smirk on his face, \"Damn, our gates were locked… but he beat the sniper, huh?\"\nClaire, beside him, nodded.\nCEO, Or Miles laughed, \"If he didn't, it would have just been embarrassing!\"\nOne by one, the other participants gathered in the square, their eyes all focused on Stark.",

      "content": "Stark stood in the middle of the square, his gaze fixated on the panel floating in front of him.\n[You have slain 'Levi, The Moonscorched Sniper' and gained 6,430,000 experience points]\nDing!\n[Your level has increased to level 111, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Experience: 1,857,000/9,000,000]\n[Skill Points: 68]\nBut there was more.\n[You have defeated one of the five 'Moonscorched Commanders,' granting you a 'Cooldown Gem.']\n[Description: Consuming one of these gems will remove the cooldown of one of your skills, no matter how long it is.]\n\"...!\"\nStark's eyes widened as he processed the message.\nThis was no ordinary reward—it was a game-changer.\nA cooldown reset on any skill meant Stark could unleash one of his strongest abilities again, something that could turn the tide of the entire trial.\nThis item was way too overpowered, no matter how you think of it.\nActually, no.\nWith every other participant, it wouldn't be as overpowered as Stark thinks.\nAll of them have powerful skills, that is true, but not a single one is truly worth using it on compared to Stark's [Crimson Healing] and [Crimson Spears].\nAnd if it could remove the cooldown of ANY skill, then Stark already had an idea.\nWithout hesitation, he whispered to himself, \"Use it on 'Crimson Spears.'\"\nThe gem in his hand shimmered and disappeared in a blue flash.\nDing!\n[Crimson Spears' cooldown has been reset.]\nWhich meant...\n[Heaven's Spear is now available again.]\n\"Incredible,\" Stark muttered, a wide grin spreading across his face.\nHis aura began to ripple through the air, nearly palpable to anyone close enough.\nHowever, before Stark could relish in his new power, movement caught his eye.\nThe other participants were approaching from their separate gates, all converging in the same square.\nThere were 13 of them, each a powerhouse in their own right, each with their own ambitions and lethal skills.\nAs they gathered in front of the gate leading to the heart of Termina, the city where most of the events of this trial would happen.\nA massive [0/3] was written on it in crimson red.\n[3 more sacrifices to open the gate.]\n\"Damn, our gates were locked,\" muttered Shock, the guy with blond hair and electricity dancing around him. \"Looks like it's finally over.\"\n\"Yeah, he beat the sniper,\" replied Claire, the girl with glasses and the ability to transform into a monster.\n\"Before we go any further,\" said CEO, stepping forward with a cigar in his mouth, \"I think it's time for introductions. We should know who we're fighting with—and against.\" He pointed to the gate, \"This is just the beginning.\"\nThe group exchanged glances, some nodding in agreement.\nIt was clear to everyone that forming alliances or at least understanding each other's strengths and weaknesses could make or break them in the next stage.\nWho knows, maybe they will defeat the crimson moons trio?\n\"I'll start,\" said CEO, puffing on his cigar.\nHis presence was calm, authoritative.\n\"I'm CEO, Level 135.\" He gestured to the two individuals standing behind him. \"These two here are my assets—Righlef and Partner. They're both under my control, thanks to my domination skills. We'll be taking this trial seriously.\"\nNext was Kai Algren, the artist, who looked completely disinterested in everything around him.\n\"Artist...\" he said with a bored tone. \"Codename is Artist. Level... doesn't matter. Let's just get this over with.\" He was already drawing with his fingers in the air, as if crafting an invisible masterpiece that only he could see.\n\"Follower,\" the priest-like man mumbled, his eyes never leaving the ground, \"That's all you need to know.\" His voice was soft, yet there was a dangerous undertone in it.\nClaire stepped forward next, \"Claire, codename Demon.\" She pointed to the man beside her, \"And this is Dave, codename Wielder.\" Both of them stood confidently, their levels displayed as 122 and 123 respectively.\nThey gave off a powerful, experienced vibe, clearly ready for what was to come, and they actually gave their real life names!\nShock was next, his blond hair practically glowing as arcs of electricity danced across his body. \"Name's Shock, and as you can see, I specialize in electricity. Level 128. Don't get in my way, and we'll be fine.\"\nClever, the old man with a cane, chuckled before speaking, \"Clever. Old, but still dangerous. Keep that in mind.\"\nHis calm demeanor was unsettling. He seemed frail, but there was something about him that screamed danger.\nThe twins stood side by side, both silent until they spoke in unison. \"Mio and Mao. We don't talk much.\" Their presence was eerie, their movements perfectly synchronized.\n\"Chosen,\" Stark spoke.\n\"Sora,\" and the girl beside him nodded.\nLastly, there was the woman with blond hair and a star in her eyes. She introduced herself as Starfire.\nAs for the final girl, Lilith, who was always meditating, she didn't even say anything, so everyone ignored her.\nAfter everyone had finished their introductions, the group turned toward the gate.\nThe crimson text above it still read:\n[3 more sacrifices to open gate.]\n\"Tch, sacrifices again,\" Shock muttered, crossing his arms. \"We need to kill three people. Otherwise, we're stuck here.\"\n\"Let's vote on who gets sacrificed, alright?\" CEO suggested, exhaling a puff of smoke.\nHis eyes scanned the group, but they lingered on Stark for just a second longer than anyone else. \"No need for unnecessary bloodshed. We can decide this rationally.\"\n\"WE AGREE!\" Righlef and Partner nodded enthusiastically, clearly under CEO's influence.\n\"Ok, but who?\" Claire raised her eyebrows. \"No one's stupid enough to sacrifice themselves. And what if someone runs away into their village? We wouldn't be able to catch them.\"\n\"Not possible,\" CEO interrupted, flicking the ash from his cigar. \"All gates are locked.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What the hell?\"\nThe participants exchanged confused glances, but when a few of them went to check the gates, CEO's words were confirmed.\n[You have reached the main square, no point in going back. Enter the city.]\nThe system message appeared for everyone.\n\"Damn, so we really have no choice,\" Dave muttered.\n\"I have a proposition,\" CEO said, his voice carrying authority as he smirked at Stark. \"How about him?\" He pointed directly at the black-haired boy.\n\"Hm?\"\n\"Ohh~\"\nCEO continued, his words sharp and direct. \"Not only does he have the most powerful skill among us, but he's already moonscorched. If we take him out now, we eliminate the biggest threat early.\"\nA murmur rippled through the group.\n\"Yeah... that's true...\"\n\"Can't deny that.\"\nThe participants started to nod in agreement.\nStark remained silent, his gaze locked on the sky, seemingly indifferent to the discussion about his potential death.\nSora, however, was not as calm.\nShe took a step back, panic flashing in her eyes. \"Stark?\" She whispered, hoping for some kind of reaction from him, but he didn't respond.\nHis gaze remained fixed on something she couldn't see.\n\"By process,\" Dave added, \"we should also take out his lover, the white-haired girl.\" His smile was unsettling as he gestured toward Sora.\n\"!!!\" she had an emotionless look, but even she didn't feel like dying early.\nSora's heart pounded as she looked at Stark again, but he continued to stand motionless, not even acknowledging her worry.\n\"Yes,\" CEO agreed with Dave's suggestion, nodding. \"Two sacrifices down, and then we just need one more.\"\nArtist, for his part, barely seemed to care, his attention still focused on whatever invisible art he was crafting.\nMeanwhile, Follower was whispering to himself, the word \"Kill\" repeated over and over again under his breath.\nA panel appeared in front of Follower.\n[Show your devotion to the 'Godless Demon' to unlock some of his powers.]\n[Kill a participant.]\nAnd underneath it, another panel popped up.\n[Become one of the 'Godless Apostles,' the most precious pawns of the godless demon.]\n[Kill 'Stark Heartsouls,' AKA Chosen.]\nThe name lit up like a beacon in Follower's mind.\nHis eyes darkened with purpose.\n\"How about her?\" Shock pointed at Starfire, the fashionable blonde with the star-shaped pupils, \"She seems to be the weakest.\"\n\"H-HUH?\" Starfire stammered, her voice quivering. \"N-NO I'M NOT!\"\n\"K-KILL...\" Follower's mumbling grew louder.\n\"I-I can manage, really! Find someone else-\" Starfire tried to defend herself, but her voice was drowned out by the growing bloodlust in the air.\nAnd then it happened.\nFWISH! SLASH!\nA cross-shaped sword pierced her chest in an instant, her heart skewered.\nHer health bar dropped to zero.\n-9,999,999!\nIt was over. An instant kill.\n[Starfire has been killed. 14 participants remain.]\nThe killer stepped forward, revealing himself—Follower.\nHe had transformed the cross around his neck into a deadly weapon, striking without hesitation.\nDing!\n[You have proved your devotion to the 'Godless Demon' by killing a participant.]\n[You have unlocked three perks.]\n\"Y-YES! YES!\" Follower screamed in ecstasy, reading the new powers granted to him.\nMeanwhile, CEO paid no attention to the madness, his focus entirely on Stark and Sora. \"You two are the last ones. Accept your deaths peacefully, and it won't hurt as much.\"\nDing!\nThe text on the gate shifted:\n[1/3]\nAll eyes turned toward Stark and Sora, the entire group of participants slowly closing in on them.\nIt was an execution march, with CEO, Righlef, Partner, Artist, Follower, Wielder, Demon, Shock, Clever, Mio, and Mao advancing as one.\n\"A shame,\" CEO sighed. \"You were strong, Chosen, but not strong enough to make a difference in this trial.\"\nThe air grew thick with tension as they neared the couple.\nAnd just as they were about to reach them, Stark finally moved.\nA slow smile crept across his face, and without warning, he let out a small chuckle.\n\"Haha...\" Stark's eyes gleamed with a strange light as he pointed toward the sky.\nEveryone froze.\n\"...What the hell is he laughing at?\"",

      "content": "The square had become a tense battleground, with Stark and Sora pinned against the wall, surrounded by the other trial participants.\nEveryone was inching closer, ready to strike. Stark, however, stood completely calm, his gaze locked onto the sky.\nThe smile that had just spread across his face sent a wave of unease rippling through the crowd.\n\"What's so funny, Chosen?\" CEO asked, his voice low and cold, as if he had already won this battle.\nStark didn't respond immediately.\nInstead, he simply raised his hand, pointing directly at the sky.\nHis smile widened, and before anyone could react, his voice rang out, calm and composed, yet filled with an undeniable threat.\n\"[Heaven's Spear],\" he whispered.\nThe moment those words left his mouth, the atmosphere shifted.\n\"Did he just say Heaven's Spear-\"\nA loud crack echoed through the sky as a massive tear split open the heavens above them.\nThe sound was deafening, like the earth itself was groaning in protest.\nEveryone froze, eyes snapping upward in fear and disbelief.\n\"NOT AGAIN?!\"\n\"WHAT?\"\nFrom the rift in the sky, a figure emerged—an angelic being, nearly 50 kilometers tall, towering over everything.\nIts wings were vast, stretching across the horizon, casting a dark shadow over the entire city.\nThe angel's presence alone was enough to paralyze them all.\nIn its hands, the being summoned a colossal spear of pure crimson energy, glowing ominously.\nThe spear's tip crackled with power, as if ready to obliterate anything in its path.\nThe participants who had been advancing just moments ago stopped dead in their tracks, their faces drained of color.\nEveryone knew what this meant.\nStark had used this ability before, at the very beginning of the trial, to destroy one of the Crimson Moons trio.\nAnd now, that same unstoppable force was aimed directly at them.\n\"Shit...!\" Shock muttered, electricity still crackling across his skin, but his confidence visibly crumbling.\nKai Algren, the Artist, stopped drawing, his invisible brushes frozen in midair.\nEven the ever-bored artist couldn't hide the flicker of fear in his eyes.\nClaire and Dave, the two combat experts, exchanged glances.\nDave's grip tightened around his sword, but neither of them moved an inch.\nThey knew better.\n\"I'll make this simple,\" Stark began, his voice cutting through the air like a blade. \"If any of you come near Sora or me, that spear comes down. And we all know what happens if it hits.\"\nThere was no need for further explanation.\nThe crimson spear in the angel's hands was so massive, so overwhelming, that it was clear to everyone that even a single strike would result in instant death.\nNo skill, no defense could withstand that level of destruction.\nIt was the ultimate form of Stark's ability—[Crimson Spears].\nHe didn't need to boast or scream. The power spoke for itself.\nFor a moment, the square was dead silent.\nEveryone stood frozen, processing what had just happened.\nSome were thinking about their next move, while others, like Follower, were trembling with unhinged excitement.\nEven in the face of such overwhelming power, the priest looked as though he wanted to test his luck.\n\"This is insane…\" Claire muttered under her breath. \"We're just supposed to give up?\"\n\"You fucking liar,\" Dave pointed at CEO, \"You said that he can only use it once every 2 weeks!\"\n\"That is... supposed to be the case, though,\" CEO raised his eyebrows.\nHis eyes darted between the angel and Stark, calculating his odds.\nBut no matter how sharp his business mind was, no amount of strategizing could get around the fact that the angel could obliterate them all in an instant.\n\"You've got to be kidding me,\" Shock hissed, his fists clenched tightly. \"We just let you two sit back and watch while we do all the dirty work?\"\nStark's smile didn't waver, \"That's exactly what you're going to do. Or you can take your chances.\"\nSora, standing beside Stark, finally relaxed.\nHer emotionless eyes now carried a sense of relief.\nStark had just flipped the entire situation on its head with a single move.\nShe didn't need to say anything or ask how; her trust in him was absolute.\n\"You can't expect us to just—\" CEO started, but before he could finish, Stark's gaze sharpened.\nThe angel above shifted slightly, lifting the colossal spear a few more inches as if ready to strike.\n\"Care to try?\" Stark asked, his tone casual but with a deadly edge, \"Step closer. Just one step closer, and I'll release it.\"\nThe sheer size and power of the spear were overwhelming.\nNo one dared to test his resolve. It wasn't a bluff, and they all knew it.\nIf what CEO said was right before, then even if Stark's HP reached 0, he would be brought back to full health, meaning he had nothing to lose in releasing it.\nHe would be hit too, but in the end he would be fine, basically.\nTension hung in the air like a thick fog, the participants locked in place, weighing their options.\nIf they fought Stark, they would die. It was that simple.\n\"We need two more sacrifices to open the gate,\" Dave finally said, breaking the silence, his voice tense. \"If we don't do something, we'll be stuck here forever.\"\n\"Then decide amongst yourselves,\" Stark replied, his voice still calm. \"But remember, if you try anything with me or Sora, you won't live long enough to regret it.\"\nFor several long moments, no one moved.\nThen, in a quick flash of motion, Follower lunged toward one of the twins—Mio.\nSLASH!\nHis sword, still glowing from his earlier kill, slashed across Mio's throat before anyone could react.\n[Perk of the 'Godless Demon' activated]\nSLASH!\n-2,482,958!\n\"YESSS!\" Follower laughed.\nBlood sprayed into the air, and Mio collapsed to the ground, her lifeless body hitting the stone with a dull thud.\n\"MIO!\" Mao screamed, running to her sister's side, but it was too late. Mio was gone.\n[2/3]\nThe system message flashed in front of everyone's eyes. One more.\n\"One more,\" Follower cackled, his eyes wild with bloodlust. \"Just one more, and we're free!\"\nRightlef, one of CEO's goons, looked visibly shaken, backing away slowly from the chaos.\nHe had followed orders without question up until now, but this—this was madness.\nHe turned to CEO, as if waiting for an order or reassurance, but CEO's eyes had gone cold.\n\"Sorry, Rightlef,\" CEO muttered, a deadly calm in his voice. \"You're the weakest link.\"\nBefore Rightlef could even process what was happening, CEO's hand shot out.\nA thin beam of energy, almost too fast to see, pierced through Rightlef's chest.\nHis eyes widened in shock as he crumpled to the ground.\n[3/3]\nDing!\nThe crimson text above the gate shifted once again.\n[Gate Opened.]\n[Mio and Righlef have been eliminated, 12 participants remain.]\nThe massive gate slowly began to creak open, the grinding of metal against stone echoing across the square.\nThe path into Termina lay ahead of them now, dark and foreboding.\nStark lowered his hand, and with it, the angel began to fade, the rift in the sky closing slowly.\nThe colossal spear vanished, leaving only an eerie silence in its wake.\nHe didn't use the perk, meaning that it was still available.\nFor a moment, no one moved.\nEveryone was still processing what had just happened.\n\"Now, if you're smart,\" Stark said, turning away from the group, \"you'll go through the gate and stay the hell out of our way.\"\nThe participants glanced at each other, still unsure, but none of them dared make a move against Stark or Sora.\nThey had seen firsthand what Stark was capable of, and none of them wanted to be on the receiving end of [Heaven's Spear].\nWith the gate now open, one by one, the group began to move forward.\nShock was the first to step through, followed by Dave and Claire, then Artist and Clever.\nEach of them cast wary glances at Stark and Sora, but none of them dared speak a word.\nCEO was the last to go, but not before meeting Stark's eyes one final time.\n\"This isn't over,\" CEO said, his voice low and dangerous.\nStark just smiled. \"We'll see about that.\"\nWith that, CEO turned and walked through the gate, disappearing into the city beyond alongside Partner.\nAs the last of the participants vanished into Termina, Stark finally let out a small sigh of relief.\nSora, beside him, let out an extremely small smile, knowing that—for now—they were safe.\n\"Well,\" Stark said, glancing at Sora. \"That was fun.\"\nAnd with that, they turned toward the gate, walking into the unknown.",

Eliminate all other participants except yourself.]\n[2. Complete at least 5 tasks (5 tasks per participant, not as a group).]\n[3. Defeat all Moonscorched Commanders, if the two conditionsare fulfilled, but the commanders are alive, you'll need to eliminate them.]\n[All these need to be fullfilled to open the tower.]\n\"Tasks?\"\n\"Moonscorched Commanders, huh,\" the participants mumbled.\nA list of tasks appeared in front of all of them, the same across the board.\nThere were [100 Tasks] you could do in [Termina].\nHere are some of them:\n[Steal the \"Power Ruby\" from the museum.]\n[Defeat Father Hugo in the Orphanage.]\n[Kill The Heartless One and The Tormented One, and take their heads.]\n[Defeat the Moonscorched Commander: Mayor of Termina.]\n[Bring the heads of two participants to the fountain altar.]\n...\n[Once a task is complete, it is impossible to complete it again, the difficulty is not stated, but some are obviously than others.]\n[Every reward for these tasks is kept a secret as to not rush the participants.]\nThe enormity of what they were up against hit everyone at once.\nThis was no simple trial of strength.\nIt was a slaughterhouse with a long checklist.\nComplete five tasks. Kill everyone else. Defeat the commanders.\nOnly one could stand at the top by the end.\nAnd the sheer amount of tasks truly showed how big that city was.\nIt could take them months to get all of it.\nEveryone looked at one another, the uneasy atmopshere that had formed before the gate now crumbling as they processed what this trial demanded of them.\n\"Well, this is insane,\" Claire muttered, her eyes scanning the map. \"They're not making this easy at all.\"\nDave nodded grimly, adjusting the grip on his sword. \"We'll need to pick our targets wisely. We can't just rush into these tasks.\"\n\"Or we could start eliminating competition right here,\" Shock sneered, his eyes darting toward Stark. \"Let's face it, some of us won't survive if we all stick together.\"\n\"Yeah, come on Chosen, with your skill you can eliminate at least half of us, select them and deal with it,\" Clever, the old man, smiled.\nStark, ignoring the bubbling tension, was focused on the distant Hollow Tower.\nHis mind was already racing, strategizing.\nThe infection in his body—the moonscorch infection—was slowly spreading.\nHe could feel it.\nEvery second they spent in this cursed city seemed to accelerate it.\nThe infection had already reached 12 percent, and while he still had control, he knew it wouldn't stay that way for long.\nSora, standing by his side, glanced at him. \"How bad is it?\"\n\"Worse,\" Stark replied quietly. \"Being here speeds it up.\"\n[Termina is the heart of the infection, being inside accelerates it, if you want to hold the infection, enter a 'safe house' or drink a \"Moonscorch Cure\", some of the tasks give it as a reward, among many others.]\nThey exchanged a glance, but before they could dwell on it, the others began moving.\nShock and Artist were already scouting ahead, heading toward different parts of the city.\nCEO and his remaining lackey, Partner, started moving toward the Mayor's Manor.\n\"We should split up from them too,\" Stark said, glancing at the map again. \"It's better if we avoid them for now.\"\nSora nodded, and together, they turned toward the Outskirts, hoping to avoid any immediate conflict.\nAs they moved deeper into the city, the eerie silence was broken only by the sound of their footsteps echoing through the ruined streets.\nThe buildings were dilapidated, some on the verge of collapse.\nThe occasional flicker of movement in the shadows hinted at the dangers lurking in the city, but for the most part, the streets were eerily empty.\nAt least, they were empty—until they weren't.\nA sudden, grotesque howl filled the air, and from around the corner, a monstrous figure emerged.\nIt was a twisted, horrifying amalgamation of flesh and bone, with three heads grotesquely merged together, three arms sprouting from a single torso, and two massive, deformed legs.\nIts skin was pale and sickly, covered in veins that pulsed with dark energy.\n[Three-Headed Beast - Level 550]\nThese abominations were scattered throughout the city—vicious monsters that had once been humans, now corrupted by the moonscorch infection beyond recognition.\nA status window appeared in front of Stark's eyes as he used [Perception].\n...\n[Name: Three-Headed Beast]\n[Level: 550]\n[HP: 2,000,000]\n[Strength: 15,893]\n[Stamina: 13,842]\n[Speed: 12,941]\n[Defense: 15,983]\n[Skills: Triple Strike, Blood Drain, Limb Regeneration, Vicious Screech, CorruptedCharge, Flesh Tendrils, Moonscorched...]\n...\nThe Three-Headed Beast lunged forward without warning, its three heads howling in unison.\nStark barely had time to react as the creature swung all three of its arms in a wide arc.\nHe dodged to the side, narrowly avoiding the crushing blow.\nThe ground where he had been standing cracked from the impact.\n\"Sora!\" Stark called out, \"We need to hit it fast!\"\nShe nodded, transforming into her \"vine form\", meaning that her two arms and legs covered themselves in her plants.\nSora leaped forward, her vine claws slashing across the beast's torso, but the creature barely flinched.\n-261,942\nIt roared, swinging one of its massive arms at her.\nShe dodged, but the beast was faster than she anticipated.\nOne of its other arms caught her in the side, sending her crashing into a nearby building.\n-24,683\n\"Sora!\" Stark yelled, but he couldn't afford to be distracted.\nThe beast turned its attention back to Stark, its heads screeching in unison.\nDark tendrils of flesh shot out from its body, trying to bind him in place.\nStark reacted quickly, summoning his [Crimson Spears] and launching a barrage of spears at the creature.\nSeveral of them pierced its body, but the beast didn't stop.\nIt charged forward, its massive body barreling toward Stark.\n\"Damn it,\" Stark cursed, rolling out of the way just in time.\nEven if he had the [Crimson Barrier], tanking damage didn't mean that he wouldn't feel pain, wouldn't be sent flying and wouldn't get infected by the moonscorch.\nThe beast slammed into the ground where Stark had been, its claws digging deep into the stone.\nBefore it could recover, Stark unleashed 3 of his [Aura Smash] fists, aiming for its heads.\nThis time, the attack seemed to do more damage.\n-137192! -144821! -140283!\nOne of the creature's heads exploded in a spray of blood and gore, but the other two continued to screech, their eyes filled with rage.\n\"Regenerating,\" Stark muttered, watching as the beast's flesh began to knit itself back together.\n+300,000!\nThis thing wasn't going down easily.\nSora rejoined the fight, her vineform already healing from the earlier hit.\nThough she was now infected by [Moonscorch] too.\nTogether, they pressed their assault, dodging the beast's attacks and striking whenever they saw an opening.\nBut it was a brutal fight.\nEvery time they landed a blow, the beast would regenerate.\nEvery time they thought they had it cornered, it would unleash another powerful attack.\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, the beast staggered, its body riddled with wounds from Stark's spears and Sora's claws.\nWith one final screech, it collapsed to the ground, its massive form twitching before finally going still.\n[You have defeated a Three-Headed Beast and gained 1,500,000 experience points.]\nStark let out a breath, wiping the blood from his face. \"That... was rough.\"\nSora shifted back to her human form, panting heavily. \"Yeah... and there's bound to be more of those things.\"\nThis thing was actually the most common monster in Termina, so yeah, by the end of the trial they're gonna have to be able to fight these things easily.\nBefore they could catch their breath, the ground trembled slightly, and a familiar, ominous presence filled the air.\nStark's eyes narrowed as he looked down the street.\nStanding there, cloaked in the shadows of a crumbling building, was another figure—a Moonscorched Commander: Chaugnar\nThis one was different from the beasts.\nIt was humanoid, dressed in tattered robes, one of its hands was cut off, and in the other it carried nothing but a bell.\nIts face was covered by a mask, and the aura it emitted was far more dangerous than anything they had faced so far.\nThough you could see its mouth.\nAnd it was smiling.\n[The Moonscorched Inquisitor.]\n\"Looks like we've found the second commander,\" Stark said, his voice tense.\nSora tensed up, preparing for the fight.\n[Task #1: Defeat the Moonscorcher Sniper - Completed]\n[Reward: Cooldown Gem.]\n...\n[Task #24: Defeat the Moonscorched Inquisitor]\n[Reward: ???]\nBut before they could make their move, two more figures emerged from different streets.\nShock and Artist, two participants.\nBoth of them had evidently been drawn by the commotion and had arrived just in time to witness the beginning of a battle that could decide their fates.\n\"Well,\" Shock grinned, electricity crackling around him, \"this just got interesting.\"\nStark tightened his grip, knowing that this fight was about to become a lot more complicated.",

But that thing's no joke.\" He pointed at the Inquisitor. \"How about we form a temporary alliance? Just long enough to wipe out that thing.\"\n\"Temporary alliance, huh?\" Stark said, his tone flat.\nHis eyes flickered to Artist, who still hadn't spoken.\nSora remained silent as well, but she gave a small nod, acknowledging the necessity of teamwork.\nAt least, for now.\nBefore they could finalize any agreement, the Inquisitor's bell rang—a sharp, haunting sound that cut through the air like a blade.\nThe street trembled, and from the shadows, five grotesque, three-headed beasts materialized, their monstrous forms twisting and writhing with malice.\n[Three-Headed Beast - Level 550]\nThe same monsters he and Sora struggled against.\nThe monsters were vicious, relentless, but they weren't his immediate concern.\nHe needed to know who he was fighting alongside—or more accurately, against.\nHe turned his gaze toward the others then used [Perception].\nThe first one he used was against Sora since he hadn't done that since a while back.\n...\n[Name: Sora]\n[Level: 109]\n[Class: Domination; Plant Princess]\n[HP: 153,000]\n[Strength: 18,728]\n[Stamina: 17,201]\n[Speed: 16,472]\n[Defense: 15,983]\n[Skills: Domination, Flower Analysis, Radiance, Elements of Nature, Vine Surge, Pollen Bombs, The Flaming Rose, Regenerative Drop, Nature Distortion, Flower Barrier, The White Jade (Mythical), Evergreen Resilience, Petrification, Vine Barrier, Vine Smash, Carnivorous Plant, The Flower of Hope (Godly), Flora-Guns (Mythical), The Birth of a Star (Godly), Vine Transformation (Godly)...]\n...\nHe already knew Sora's capabilities, but it was good to have a reminder.\nThen, his eyes shifted to Shock, and his [Perception] skill activated once more.\n...\n[Name: Shock]\n[Level: 127]\n[Class: Domination; Electric Overlord]\n[HP: 205,000]\n[Strength: 20,742]\n[Stamina: 19,991]\n[Speed: 22,183]\n[Defense: 17,632]\n[Skills: Domination; Thunderclap, Lightning Flash, Electric Surge, Stormcaller (Mythical), Thunder Prison, Overload, Shockwave (Godly), Static Discharge, Arc Lightning, Volt Burst, Thunder Crash, Chain Lightning, Thunder Blitz, Lightning Blade, Electrocution, Surge Barrier, Ion Pulse (Mythical), Electromagnetic Field (Godly)...]\n...\nShock was even more dangerous than Sora in sheer offensive power.\nThat much was clear.\nFinally, Stark focused on Artist, who was still standing silently, his brushes dripping colors into the air.\n...\n[Name: Artist]\n[Level: 130]\n[Class: Master of Colors]\n[HP: 189,000]\n[Strength: 19,582]\n[Stamina: 18,937]\n[Speed: 18,745]\n[Defense: 16,981]\n[Skills: Brush of Life (Godly), Palette Shield, Canvas Creation, Color Infusion, Stroke of Genius, Masterpiece Summon, Spectrum Slash, Oil Wave, Canvas Barrier, Portrait of Power, Ink Torrent (Mythical), Watercolor Burst, Chromatic Storm, Paint Strike, Vivid Imagination (Godly), Brush Barrage, Pigment Veil, Artful Dodge, Splatter Explosion (Mythical), Abstract Detonation (Godly)...]\n...\nArtist, as bizarre as he was, had incredible potential to wreak havoc with his arsenal of artistic skills.\nAs they said before, each of them could rival Stark in terms of power and skills.\nIf it wasn't for [Heaven's Spear] being so overpowered, surely it would have been bad for him.\nSuddenly, the Inquisitor's bell rang again, snapping Stark out of his thoughts.\nThe five three-headed beasts lunged forward, charging with terrifying speed.\nStark tightened his grip, and just as Shock moved to engage, a panel appeared in front of all of them.\n[Only the person who deals the final blow will have their tasks marked as completed.]\nFor a moment, there was silence.\nThe implications hit everyone at once.

      "content": "Before Stark could react to Shock's audacious kill theft, a notification panel materialized before him.\n[You have slain \"Chaugnar, The Inquisitor's Servant.\" Gained 7,000,000 experience points.]\n[You have defeated a Three-Headed Beast. Gained 1,500,000 experience points.]\n[You have defeated a Three-Headed Beast. Gained 1,500,000 experience points.]\nDing!\n[Your level has increased to Level 112, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Experience: 4,357,000/9,250,000] (Level 112)\nStark blinked at the notifications, momentarily stunned.\nKilling those beasts had been only enough for one level up?\nThe experience gain was underwhelming.\nBut that didn't matter now. The only thing on his mind was vengeance. The bastard had stolen his kill, and Stark was determined to settle the score.\n\"FUCK YOU!\" he roared, launching himself at Shock with such speed that Sora could hardly track his movements.\nBut Shock was a being of electricity, and in an instant, he vanished in a flash of lightning.\n\"Not fast enough,\" he sighed, his voice echoing from the rooftop of a nearby building.\n\"COME DOWN IF YOU'RE A MAN!\" Stark shouted, his frustration boiling over.\n\"I'd rather not,\" Shock shrugged, using [Lightning Flash] again to teleport just out of Stark's reach, his prize of the Inquisitor's kill slipping further away.\n\"I'm out too,\" Artist murmured, his own dark intentions flickering in his mind. He longed to claim Stark's blood for his masterpiece, but with [Heaven's Spear] still in the boy's arsenal, he couldn't risk it.\n\"Brush of Life,\" he muttered, sketching a door on the wall of a building before stepping through it, disappearing into the unknown.\nStark shook his head, bewildered.\n\"WHAT?\"\nSo let's get this straight, one could move at lightning speed and another could draw things to make them real?\nThese people were utterly bizarre.\nMaybe it was because Stark wasn't used to seeing new domination abilities that he felt that way.\nKilling [Chaugnar] didn't grant any reward beside experience, so basically, he had done all of this for no reason.\nWith a resigned sigh, Stark glanced at his panels, and a warning flashed.\n[Warning! Moonscorch level at 50% . Find a safe zone!]\n\"Let's go,\" he ordered Sora, and she quickly followed him without saying anything, sensing that Stark was angry.\nThe map they got as they entered Termina didn't specify what constituted a safe zone or how to find one, but Stark was determined to wait until his Moonscorch percentage decreased, using the time to strategize his next move.\nThis trial had proven to be far more challenging than the previous two combined—not just in terms of the monsters, but the twisted participants, too.\nThe first trial had semi-normal challengers, the second had its share of madness, and now, they faced pure insanity.\nWith a simple goal of entering the [Hollow Tower] to emerge victorious, each contestant fought tooth and nail.\nStark may not have understood most of their abilities, but he still possessed the [Heaven's Spear].\nSurely, that would see him through this ordeal.\nWouldn't it?\nGetting rid of a few additional [Three-Headed Beasts], as well as [Moonscorched Knights], Stark and Sora made their way through the outskirts of the city.\nThey actually managed to somehow win against the monsters after understanding the fact you shouldn't let them get too close to you if you want to survive.\n[Warning! Moonscorch level at 58%. Find a safe zone!]\nThe percentage was climbing, but not fast enough to actually be a threat.\n\"If we wanna remove our infection, we're gonna have to get one of those [Moonscorch Cures],\" Stark said to Sora, and she nodded.\nThis meant they needed to complete at least two tasks if they wanted to have a decent chance at survival.\nOtherwise, they could soon turn into one of these beasts.\n[Stark: 1/5 Tasks]\n[Sora: 0/5 Tasks]\nAfter fifteen additional minutes of fighting and walking, both Stark and Sora leveled up to level 110 and 113, respectively, the former getting a new skill.\nAnd thankfully enough, less than five minutes later...\nDing!\n[Safe zone detected nearby!]\nOne of the doors of the nearby buildings was glowing, and once they entered it, it revealed itself to be a safe zone!\nThe interior was just as moldy and crumbling as the rest of the town, but at least, in here, the moonscorch infection rate would go down.\n[This safe zone is now marked on your map.]\nOpening the map, they noticed that a small dot appeared where they currently were, meaning they could come back if the situation became too hard.\n\"That's... fair,\" Stark sighed as he sat on the couch, resting, \"We'll soon get them all.\"\n\"Yes,\" Sora nodded as she sat beside him.\n...\nMeanwhile, Shock had managed to put some distance between himself and Stark at breakneck speed.\nAnd after claiming the reward from completing the task, he immediately pulled up his map to assess his location.\n\"Hm...\" he mused, glancing at his surroundings. \"Alright, I'm close to the Mayor's Manor. Might as well rest there.\"\nA grin crept across his face as he examined the item in his possession.\nDefeating the Inquisitor had not only rewarded him with experience; it had granted him something more—an opportunity.\nThe prospect of taking down Chosen was no longer a distant dream.\nAs he made his way toward the manor, he dispatched of the beasts that dared to cross his path quite easily, his electric aura crackling with energy.\nEach strike was swift and precise, leaving a trail of defeated foes in his wake.\nUpon entering the manor, he was met with an unexpected sight.\n\"Hello, sir,\" a butler was at the entrance, greeting anyone who entered, bowing down in a way that made it impossible to see his face, \"Welcome to the Mayor's Manor.\"\n\"Hm,\" Shock scratched his chin, \"Is there a-\"\n\"Yes, sir, a safe zone is available right next to me.\"\nShock looked to the right, and indeed, there was a door which was glowing.\nHe didn't trust that, obviously, but his map came to the rescue.\nDing!\n[You have found safe-zone, marking it on your map!]\n\"Nice...\" Shock smiled, this meant he wouldn't have to worry much, plus, this butler seemed to want to help them.\nAs Shock approached the butler, he couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that clung to the air.\nThe butler, dressed impeccably in a tailored suit, exuded an air of sophistication, yet his face betrayed his Moonscorched state—skin slowly melting away, draping over his features like wax on a candle.\n\"Shit...\" Shock instinctively took a step back, he hadn't really paid attention to its face before.\n\"Any problems, sir?\" the butler said, his expression shifting, exuding a powerful aura, much more than even the [Inquisitor].\n\"Hm... nothing much,\" Shock wasn't scared of it, but this hospitality was probably the only one he would get in the trial, he couldn't waste time.\n\"Very well,\" the butler tried to smile, though it was just terrifying, \"You can rest, and if you wish, you can meet up with the mayor of Termina, if you feel like it.\"\n\"Huh... thanks...\"\nA panel appeared in front of him as the butler mentioned the Mayor.\n[Task #66: Defeat the Moonscorched Mayor.]\nShock's eyes widened slightly.\n\"You can take your time to enjoy our manor, sir,\" the butler bowed.\nThis instinctively made him look around, and he was indeed surprised.\nIn a trial dominated by squalor and despair, this manor radiated opulence, with ornate chandeliers dangling from the ceiling and rich tapestries adorning the walls.\nIt felt surreal, as if he had stepped into another world.\nBut no, he was still in the domination trial.\n\"Thank you,\" he said, a sense of relief washing over him.\nWithout further hesitation, he pushed open the door and stepped inside the safe zone, the air instantly shifting to a soothing calm.\nBut he wasn't the only one that was inside.\nThere, at the center of the room, awaited CEO, a knowing smile playing on his lips.",

      "content": "Inside the grand yet half-decaying safe zone of the Mayor's Manor, Shock could sense an overwhelming presence even before his eyes settled on the figure seated comfortably by the fireplace.\n\"Oh...?\"\n\"Hm?\"\nIt was CEO, the businessman that didn't hesitate to kill his goon to pass the gate.\nPartner, CEO's loyal henchman, stood silently to the side, his gaze flicking between Shock and his boss.\n\"Well, well, well,\" CEO greeted, his voice smooth yet menacing. \"I didn't expect to see someone else so soon... Shock, was it?\"\nShock's eyes narrowed as he stood his ground.\nHe wasn't particularly thrilled about this encounter but knew it was inevitable.\nBoth of them, and every single participant in this trial, had one common enemy: Stark Heartsouls, or Chosen, which is who they know him as.\nReaching into his pouch, he pulled out the item he had obtained from defeating the Inquisitor.\nIt glimmered slightly as he held it up for the CEO to see.\n\"This,\" Shock began, \"is the Skill Canceller.\"\nCEO raised an eyebrow.\nPartner, who had been standing stiffly, leaned in with mild curiosity, his head tilting slightly as if trying to get a better look.\n\"And what exactly does it do?\" CEO asked, though there was a glint in his eye that suggested he already knew.\nShock's lips curled into a thin smile. \"Cancels any skill usage when you're close enough to your target. A single touch, and their abilities are locked. Completely.\"\nCEO leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers. \"Now that,\" he mused, \"is quite the treasure.\" He gave Shock a calculating look, the kind that promised both opportunity and danger. \"What do you intend to do with it?\"\nShock shrugged, as if the immense power of the item didn't particularly concern him. \"You already know, no need to keep the act up,\" he sighs.\nPartner chuckled lightly but quickly stopped as CEO shot him a brief glance.\nWith his item in hand, Stark's feared [Heaven's Spear], which is the perk everyone was scared of, could be deactivated.\nAnd even for a single second.\nEven if it was for a single moment, the moment Stark lost that ability, then they would kill him.\nIt was a mutual understanding between everyone.\nThe room was tense, the unspoken power dynamics between the three of them thickening the air.\n\"Interesting,\" CEO finally said, his eyes gleaming. \"But what brings you here, really? It's not just to show off, is it?\"\nShock glanced around the luxurious, albeit eerie, surroundings of the Mayor's Manor before replying. \"Moonscorch.\"\n\"Ah.\" CEO sighed, \"Same here.\"\nEven CEO got infected, and it wasn't a surprise, because beside the girl that was meditating (her name is Lilith), everyone got moonscorched by now.\n\"So, what's the plan?\" Shock asked, he wasn't in the mood for small talk, \"Why are you here?\"\nCEO's expression darkened slightly. \"There's power to be gained here, and tasks to complete,\" he said. \"Three tasks inside this Manor. We each get one.\"\nShock didn't fully trust CEO, not even close.\nBut for now, he saw no point in making enemies when they could temporarily cooperate.\nHe glanced at Partner, who had been listening silently, and noticed something unsettling in the man's demeanor.\nThe look in his eyes suggested he was just waiting for an excuse to strike.\n\"Fine,\" Shock said, relenting. \"Let's get this over with.\"\nThey would need to kill each other by the end, but increasing your chances of survival is a good thing.\nThey all stood up, the mood shifting toward action.\nAs they exited the room and walked toward the grand staircase leading to the Mayor's chamber, the eerie silence of the manor settled over them.\nThe old wood beneath their feet creaked ominously, and the air carried a faint, sour odor, as if the building itself was decaying from within.\nThe moonscorched butler reappeared as they approached the door, \"I hope you enjoyed your rest, s—\"\nBefore the creature could finish, CEO waved his hand lazily, and in a swift, brutal motion, a shockwave of dark energy surged forward.\nThe butler disintegrated instantly, leaving nothing but a pile of ash where it once stood.\n\"Too noisy,\" CEO muttered, not even bothering to glance at the now-dead servant.\nShock watched silently, making a mental note of CEO's nonchalance toward killing, but also filing away the power he'd just witnessed.\n\"Let's go kill that Mayor,\" CEO said, a grin creeping across his face. \"It's time we clean house.\"\nShock simply nodded, still unsure of what CEO's real intentions were, but willing to go along with the plan for now.\nThe three of them made their way up the grand staircase, passing portraits of former mayors who all seemed to gaze down with hollow eyes.\nThe air grew heavier as they neared the Mayor's chambers.\nThe massive wooden doors loomed ahead.\n\"Here goes nothing,\" CEO smirked, stepping forward.\nWith a swift, powerful kick, he flung the doors open.\nInside, sitting at the head of a grand rectangular table, was the Mayor.\nHe was an unsettling figure, clothed in fine, noble attire, though his grotesque face was a reminder of his moonscorched condition.\nBeige skin sagged unnaturally from his face, and atop his bald head were two menacing, triangular horns.\nHe regarded them with a smile that was far from welcoming.\n\"Guests,\" he said in a slow, deliberate voice. \"Do enter.\"\nShock, CEO, and Partner cautiously stepped inside, sensing that something was very wrong.\nAs soon as all three crossed the threshold, the door slammed shut behind them.\n\"...?\"\nThe Mayor snapped his fingers, locking them all in here with him.\nThey couldn't escape anymore, and they actually tried.\nKicking the door didn't work anymore.\n\"Take a seat,\" the Mayor said, his smile widening.\nCEO's eyes narrowed as he turned back, \"How about I—\" he tried to attack.\nBut before he could do anything...\n\"Take. A. Seat.\" The Mayor's voice carried an undeniable weight of authority.\nBOOOOM!\nWithout warning, an explosion of force sent CEO flying across the room, slamming him into the wall.\nThe impact was so powerful that it ripped through his defenses, a notification briefly flashing in his peripheral vision.\n[You have taken 132,284 damage.]\nShock's breath caught in his throat.\nEven CEO wasn't immune to the Mayor's dominance.\n\"Shit...\" Shock and Partner didn't expect this, and so they respected the Mayor's wish, taking a seat, CEO following closely as they all sat around the table.\nThe mayor's voice cut through the silence once more, calm and composed. \"Let us enjoy some delicacies while we speak now, shall we not?\"\n[Termina's Mayor – Level 600]\nShock's eyes widened at the level indicator. Level 600.\nThey were hopelessly outmatched.\nIt's not because the [Crimson Moons] are level 600 that enemies are below that after all.\nQuite the opposite: the moons were the strongest since they are the apostles, but regardless, some enemies above level 600 are present.\nThe Mayor was one of them.\nHe was extremely powerful.\nTOO powerful for any of them to take.\n\"This is bad,\" Shock muttered under his breath, his mind racing as he weighed his options, \"We shouldn't have done that...\"\nBut before he could strategize further, the Mayor's eyes locked onto him.\n\"No talking while around the table, gentlemen.\" The Mayor's smile faded slightly, his tone growing colder. \"This is your first and final warning.\"\nIn the eerie silence that followed, Shock studied the Mayor.\nBut he mainly looked at the weird horns.\n[Do not mention his horns under any circumstances.]\n[You will be instantly cut if you do.]\nA warning panel appeared before all three of them.\n'Ah shit...' both CEO and Shock sighed.\nPartner, on the other hand, made the biggest mistake of his life: he gulped nervously, his face pale.\nBut even that small sound was enough.\nSLASH! SLASH!\nWith two swift movements, the Mayor's hand, holding an ornate knife, slashed through the air, and Partner was cut clean in half.\n-999,999!\nBlood splattered across the table as Partner's bisected body crumpled to the floor, his lifeless eyes staring up at the ceiling.\nCEO and Shock sat frozen, too cautious to let out a single sound: they weren't angry or sad for the death of Partner, they just didn't want to be next.\nA bead of sweat dripped down Shock's temple as he realized the sheer impossibility of their situation.\n'What the hell have we gotten ourselves into...'\nThis was supposed to be a place where they would complete tasks, level up, and dominate all others.\nYet, now, even though they thought they had been so powerful, and that they would be able to defeat the moons.\nThey were locked in a twisted game with the mayor, who seemed to enjoy seeing them struggle.\nThe Mayor wouldn't kill for no reason, but both CEO and Shock knew saying anything that it didn't like would be an instant death.\nWith the bloodied knife still in its right hand, and a massive fork in its left, they knew it could reach them.\nAfter all, it had moved so fast while killing Partner that they had a hard time following it.\nAs if mocking them, three panels appeared in front of them.\n[Task #66: Defeat the Moonscorched Mayor.]\n[Task #67: Take the 'Basement Key' from the Mayor and enter it.]\n[Task #68: Defeat the \"Basement Demon\"]\n'Ah shit... here we go again...' CEO and Shock let out a quick smile.\nIt wasn't the first time they were in impossible situations, after all.\nAs [Domination] class users, they had been ready for this, maybe not at the level they are currently at, but there was no denying it was exciting.\nIf it came to it, they would fight the Mayor.\nBut for now...\n\"Let us play, gentlemen,\" the Mayor laughed as he pointed both of his giant utensils at them.",

      "content": "Stark and Sora remained within the safe zone just outside the city's decaying outskirts, feeling a temporary sense of relief.\nTheir [Moonscorched] infection was down to 0%, which meant they could delay the inevitable decay a little longer.\nThen, out of nowhere, a notification popped up.\nDing!\n[Global Announcement: Participant \"Partner\" has been killed by the \"Mayor.\"]\nStark's eyes narrowed as he processed the message. \"Partner's dead. That means CEO's probably in the manor with him,\" he muttered.\nSora glanced over, her usual calm demeanor unchanged. \"So, where do we go now?\"\nFor Sora, following Stark had become almost second nature.\nIt felt safer than making independent decisions, especially in the chaotic landscape of Termina, where dangers lurked at every corner.\nAll she needed to do was fight when necessary, and Stark seemed to know exactly where to go.\nStark pulled up the [Termina Map], scanning the various locations scattered across the city.\nThere were 97 tasks still left to possibly complete, and they were spread out across multiple areas.\nTasks were essential—not only for leveling up but for gaining any possible edge over the other participants.\nThe longer they waited, the fewer tasks would be left, and time was running out.\nThe other participants wouldn't wait either, and as the trial wore on, the monsters and challenges would only grow stronger.\n\"We've got a lot of options,\" Stark said, zooming in on one particular area. \"But here—this place.\" He tapped the map. \"The orphanage. It's nearby, and we can get several tasks done there.\"\nIt wasn't like they had any real choice.\nSitting around the safe zone wasn't an option.\nThe so-called \"safe zones\" weren't exactly safe; they merely reduced the [Moonscorched] infection.\nHigh-level monsters could still infiltrate them, and the other participants would eventually come hunting. Besides, they needed to stay active—staying idle meant falling behind.\n\"Let's move,\" Stark sighed, getting up.\nSora nodded. \"Alright, to the orphanage, then.\"\n\"Yep.\"\nTogether, they left the safety of the zone and ventured out, battling monsters along the way.\nEach fight sharpened their skills, their movements in sync as they dispatched various foes that littered the outskirts.\nBy the time they reached their destination, they had both gained two more levels.\nStark was now level 115, and Sora had reached level 112.\n[Experience: 1,545,000/10,000,000] (level 115)\n[Skill Points: 88]\nAs they arrived at the orphanage, another notification chimed.\nDing!\n[You have arrived at the Orphanage.]\nHowever, another announcement immediately followed.\n[Global Announcement: Participant \"Mao\" has been killed by \"Father Hugo\"!]\nStark stopped in his tracks, his eyes narrowing at the latest death notification. \"Wait a minute...\" He had heard that name before.\nDing!\n[Task #13: Defeat Father Hugo in the Orphanage.]\nThat's right!\nFather Hugo, one of the five commanders, was inside the orphanage.\nHe had just killed Mao, and now they were about to walk into his domain.\nThe orphanage, a place that might have once been a haven for children, was now home to something far darker.\nStark glanced at Sora.\nThe number of participants was thinning out fast.\nOnly ten remained: Lilith, CEO, Shock, Clever, Dave and Claire, Priest, Artist, Sora, and Stark.\nAnd of course, those that were still alive were the most powerful and important ones.\nEach of them was building their power for the ultimate showdown, preparing to enter the [Hollow Tower] where only one could claim victory.\nStark wasn't fully confident, though.\nHe had a bigger goal than just survival or beating other participants.\nIf he could defeat the moons, he could end it all.\nBut, deep down, even he wasn't sure if he could actually pull it off.\n\"Let's go beat Father Hugo's ass,\" Stark grinned.\nThe fact that the priest had killed a participant didn't bother him as much as it probably should have.\nAfter all, there were other tasks in the orphanage to deal with too. If Father Hugo turned out to be too difficult, they could always gather some helpful items along the way.\nFrom the outside, the orphanage looked like something pulled out of a nightmare.\nThe structure was old, its wooden walls dark and splintered with age.\nThe windows were cracked, the glass fogged up from the inside, casting an eerie gloom over the entire building.\nVines snaked their way across the walls, creeping toward the roof, giving the impression that the orphanage was being consumed by the very earth it stood on.\n[Despite being a place for children, you sense no joy, only dread.]\nSora's face remained neutral as they approached the heavy, worn doors.\nStark pushed them open, and they stepped inside.\nAs the door shut behind them, it made a distinct click, locking them in.\n\"Hm,\" Stark muttered under his breath.\nIt seemed that Termina had a habit of sealing off locations once you entered them, forcing you to face whatever lurked within.\nIt happened when they first entered the city, and it was currently happening to CEO and Shock in the Mayor's Manor.\nThough Stark had no way of knowing about the latter, so all he could focus on was the task at hand.\nThe moment they entered, a series of panels appeared before them, each displaying a new task.\n[Task 13: Defeat Father Hugo in the Orphanage.]\nSeveral other tasks flashed up on the screen:\n[Task #14: Investigate the abandoned classrooms, there may be something in there.]\n[Task #15: Find the missing orphan's journal and bring it to its ghost.]\n[Task #16: Banish the lingering spirits in the dormitory.]\n[Task #17: Kill all entities inside the orphanage.]\n[#18: Destroy the cursed toys in the playroom.]\n[Task #19: Survive Father Hugo's \"test of faith.\"]\nEach task seemed to point to different areas within the orphanage, and the unsettling atmosphere gnawed at them as they explored.\nStark and Sora explored the orphanage, but the deeper they went, the more unsettling the atmosphere became.\nThe classrooms were empty, their desks still neatly arranged as though the children had vanished in the middle of their lessons.\nAll exit doors were locked, and windows shut.\n\"This is... eerie,\" Sora said quietly.\nStark chuckled, trying to lighten the mood. \"Oh, you feel dread too? Thought you were emotionless to the core.\"\nSora shot him a sideways glance but didn't bite. \"I just don't like seeing a place for children in this... state. This trial is truly wicked.\"\nStark raised an eyebrow. \"You like children?\" He hadn't expected that. Sora had always come off as indifferent to most things.\n\"Yes,\" she replied simply.\nThat caught Stark off guard.\nHe was about to ask more, curious to learn something new about his companion, but before he could say anything—\nTap. Tap. Tap.\nCREAK! BAM!\nA loud crack sounded as Stark stepped on a fragile floorboard.\nThe wood splintered beneath his feet, and he fell through the floor.\n\"Shit!\" Stark cursed as he plummeted into darkness.\nHe quickly tried to throw a Crimson Ball to stop his fall, but he missed it, and before he could attempt another, his body hit the ground hard.\nBAM!\n-13,371 HP\nStark groaned as he pulled himself off the ground, wincing in pain.\nHe wasn't dead, but the fall had left him bruised and disoriented.\nLooking around, he realized he was in the orphanage's basement.\nThe hole he had fallen through was too high to climb, and there was no sign of Sora.\n\"She'll be fine,\" Stark mumbled to himself. \"She can handle herself.\"\nThe room he found himself in was unsettling.\nWhite walls surrounded him, but what stood out were the chains hanging from them.\nScattered throughout the room were corpses, some of adults, others... children.\n\"This place just gets better and better,\" Stark sighed, trying to push the disturbing images from his mind.\nThere was only one exit: a wooden door at the far end of the room.\nStark headed toward it without hesitation, wanting to get out of here and meet up with Sora again.\nBut just as his hand reached for the handle—\nSLAM!\nThe door burst open.\nA massive figure loomed in the doorway.\nStark barely had time to react before it kicked him with a force that sent him flying back into the wall.\nHis shield cracked under the impact.\n-83,394 HP\nBut it didn't break.\n[47,812/200,000]\nit still held on from his previous encounters.]\n\"Fuck...\" Stark groaned, pushing himself to his feet, feeling the sharp pain in his side. But he wasn't about to go down that easily.\nA voice echoed through the room, deep and menacing, \"Bad child. Escaping is not allowed.\"\nStark's eyes narrowed as he looked up, seeing a panel display in front of him.\n[Moonscorch Commander: Father Hugo.]\n[Level 600]\n\"Damn.\"",

      "content": "Stark stood across from Father Hugo, staring up at the towering figure.\nThe air in the basement felt suffocating, thick with the stench of decay and the oppressive weight of something far worse.\nFather Hugo, the Moonscorch Commander, was a living nightmare.\nHis dark, priestly robes clung to his massive frame, and his face, twisted and swollen with corruption, barely resembled anything human.\nStark wiped the sweat from his brow, eyes scanning for weaknesses.\nBut he found none.\nThere was a flicker of hesitation, but he shook it off.\nLevel 600.\nThat number burned in his mind.\nIt was far beyond his capabilities, but he didn't have the luxury of retreating now.\nHe couldn't show fear. Not after coming this far.\nFather Hugo tilted his head, his voice an eerie croak, \"Children who stray must be... corrected.\"\nWithout warning, the priest lunged forward.\nStark had barely a second to brace himself.\nHis instincts kicked in— Invincible Dodge—he sidestepped the attack, narrowly avoiding Hugo's fist, which smashed into the ground with terrifying force. Cracks splintered outward, shaking the entire room.\n\"He's too strong...\" Stark muttered under his breath, but there was no turning back.\nCrimson energy surged around Stark's body as he prepared his counterattack.\n\"Crimson Spears!\"\nTen blood-red spears materialized in the air, swirling in a deadly formation.\nWith a thought, Stark sent them flying toward Hugo's chest, each spear aiming for a vital point.\nBut Father Hugo barely flinched.\nHis arm moved with frightening speed, swatting the spears aside like they were nothing more than twigs.\nTwo of them managed to pierce his side, but the wounds were shallow, barely scratching his grotesque skin.\n-13,842!\n-14,437!\nBefore Stark could react, Hugo's massive foot slammed into his chest with bone-crushing force.\nCRACK!\n-83,394!\nStark was thrown back, his shield completely cracking under the sheer power of the attack.\n[Your \"Crimson Barrier\" broke.]\nHis vision blurred as pain seared through his ribs.\nBlood trickled from his mouth as he gasped for air.\nHis health bar had plummeted.\nHe was dangerously close to death.\n\"I need to-\"\nHe couldn't even finish his sentence that he sensed an overwhelming aura behind him.\n\"Oh... god...\"\n\"Children, do you understand?\" Hugo spoke, his entire figure darkened by his aura, only his eyes being white and leaving a trail as they moved.\n\"Correction SMASH!\"\nBOOOOOOM!\nHugo smashed Stark's head.\nIf it was any other participant, then they would have died at this point.\n-170,383!\nHe was about to collapse from the pain.\nBut then, like a spark reigniting, the familiar surge of power coursed through him.\n[Crimson Healing activated, Full Health restored.]\n\"Get up... get up...!\" Stark whispered to himself as his consciousness came back, adrenaline pumping as he scrambled to his feet.\nFather Hugo loomed over him, his eyes burning with a sick, religious stare.\nStark knew he couldn't win. Not now. Not against something this powerful. But he could run.\nThe wooden door at the far end of the room was his only chance.\nStark summoned what strength he had left, pushing through the agony that radiated from his cracked ribs.\nHe glanced at the chains on the walls, the scattered corpses, and something inside him screamed to move faster.\nWith a burst of speed, Stark dashed toward the door, ignoring the ominous creaks and groans of the floor beneath him.\nFather Hugo's heavy footsteps followed, methodical and unhurried, as if he had all the time in the world.\n\"Crimson Ball Transmission!\" Stark yelled, throwing one of his crimson orbs toward the door.\nHe snapped his fingers, teleporting instantly.\nJust as Father Hugo reached out with one of his massive hands, Stark blinked through space and appeared on the other side of the door.\nHe slammed it shut behind him and fumbled with the handle.\nHis heart pounded in his chest as he searched for something to hold it closed.\nThere!\nA small iron key lay on a nearby shelf.\nStark grabbed it, thrust it into the lock, and twisted.\nThere was a satisfying click, but Stark knew this would only give him around two seconds of additional spare time.\nHe needed to get back to Sora.\nFather Hugo was too powerful, even with all his skills, his boosts, everything he had learned up until now.\n[Heaven's Spear] came to his mind, but he shook it off.\nHe needed it for the other participants, as well as the moons.\nHe quickly noticed a flight of stairs that led up and found his way out of the basement.\nDing!\n[You will not be able to leave the 'Orphanage' until you defeat Father Hugo.]\n\"Figured as much,\" Stark muttered, wiping sweat from his forehead.\nHe knew he couldn't just leave the orphanage.\nWhatever twisted magic this place held wouldn't let him go until Hugo was dead.\nBut that fight—he wasn't ready for that. He had to find Sora, regroup, and come up with a plan or another way to leave.\nBOOM!\nHe heard the sound of the door he had locked effortlessly being destroyed, and so he knew he needed to be faster.\nWith a final glance at the basement door, Stark began to make his way through the narrow, dimly lit hallways of the orphanage.\nThe eerie silence pressed down on him like a weight.\nThe idea of seeing [Father Hugo] emerge from the corner of a hallway terrified him.\nAfter all, he knew that this thing was faster than him: it was walking to make sure Stark he was nothing but a bug.\nHe passed several rooms, each more unsettling than the last.\nCribs overturned, old toys scattered across the floor, their bright colors faded with time and dust.\nThere were no signs of life, just remnants of a happier time long gone.\nHis breath was ragged, his body still recovering from the brutal assault.\nEven with [Crimson Healing]'s recovery, he somehow still felt pain, which was weird.\nWhere was Sora?\nShe had to be okay. She was strong, he reminded himself.\nMaybe not as strong as the others, but they were alone in the orphanage, so it should be fine.\nBut still, his mind raced with worst-case scenarios.\nHe couldn't afford to lose her—not here, not like this.\n\"Sora?\" he shouted.\nBut nothing.\nStark pressed on, moving through the dark corridors.\nEvery creak and groan of the old building made him tense, expecting Father Hugo to burst through a wall or a door at any moment.\nHe kept his fighting position at all times just for this reason.\nThen, he heard it—soft footsteps in the distance, light but deliberate.\nStark's heart leaped as he quickened his pace, turning a corner to find Sora emerging from one of the classrooms.\n\"Sora!\" Stark called out, relief in his voice. \"We need to get out of here!\"\nShe looked up, her expression calm, \"What happened? You disappeared for a while.\"\n\"I fell into the basement,\" Stark explained quickly, glancing over his shoulder, half-expecting Father Hugo to burst through the floor.\n\"And Father Hugo... he's a monster. I tried fighting him, but it's not happening. He almost killed me.\"\nSora's eyes narrowed, instinctively activating her aura, \"So what's the plan?\"\nStark shook his head. \"There's no plan, Sora, that thing is killing us if we get too close, we need to find another way.\"\n\"...\" Sora's eyes widened slightly.\nShe had never seen Stark like this.\nIt was apparent from his expression that he was serious.\n\"QUICK, WE NEED TO-\"\nHe held her hand as he tried to quickly move.\nBut... it was too late.\n\"Found you, bad children.\"\nA voice could be heard from the corner of a hallway, and from it appeared [Father Hugo], the smile on his face still visible.",

      "content": "Stark's heart pounded as he and Sora locked eyes with Father Hugo.\nThe dark-robed figure was a nightmare brought to life, his twisted smile stretching unnaturally as he filled the corridor with his overwhelming presence.\nEvery step echoed, the floorboards creaking beneath his weight, and that nauseating stench of decay rolled toward them, making Stark's stomach turn.\n\"There you are, little ones,\" Father Hugo murmured, his voice reverberating with a chilling edge. \"Only the faithful will find salvation in this sacred place.\"\nThe notification blared in front of Stark's vision, listing out tasks he hadn't completed that were scattered throughout the orphanage.\n[Task #13: Defeat Father Hugo in the Orphanage.]\n[Task #14: Investigate the abandoned classrooms; there may be something in there.]\n[Task #15: Find the missing orphan's journal in the library and bring it to its ghost.]\n[Task #16: Banish the lingering spirits in the dormitory.]\n[Task #17: Kill all entities inside the orphanage.]\n[Task #18: Destroy the cursed toys in the playroom.]\n[Task #19: Survive Father Hugo's \"test of faith.\"]\n\"Well, that's comforting,\" Stark muttered, eyes scanning the corridor for a way out.\nHe tightened his grip, glancing at Sora. \"Let's move. That thing's going to tear us apart if we stay here.\"\nSora's face was tense, but she nodded, her aura flaring around here, ready to deflect or block any attack, \"Where?\"\n\"Anywhere that isn't here,\" Stark hissed, and they bolted down the corridor.\nFather Hugo's footsteps were slow, almost measured, as if he was savoring the chase.\nStark and Sora dashed through the narrow hallways, their feet pounding against the decaying wood.\nEvery so often, they'd catch a glimpse of Hugo's shadow stretching across the wall, his presence relentless.\nHe was walking so slowly, yet always caught up no matter.\nStark would try and send [Crimson Spears] or [Crimson Fists] at him.\nBut...\nFwish! Fwish! Fwish!\nFor some reason, Father Hugo blocked it all.\nMaybe he had actually let Stark's spear hit him before? Who knows.*\nEven the [Spear of Judgment], who Stark thought was incredibly powerful, was blocked and broken.\n[Task #15: Find the missing orphan's journal (in the library) and bring it to its ghost.]\nStark spotted a room labeled Library to his right. \"In here!\" he whispered, gesturing for Sora to follow.\nThe room was cluttered with dust-covered books and forgotten toys, their once-bright colors dulled.\nStark's eyes scanned the shelves, searching for anything that resembled a journal.\nAt last, he spotted a small leather-bound book tucked away on a shelf and pulled it out.\nThe faded name of a child, \"Samuel,\" was scrawled on the cover.\n[You have found the missing orphan's journal.]\nBefore they could take a breath, a low, cold whisper filled the room, \"Have you come to read my story?\"\nA translucent form, the ghostly figure of a child, appeared near the corner of the room, his pale face drawn with sorrow. Stark held out the journal, offering it to the child.\n\"It's yours, isn't it?\"\nThe ghost nodded, taking the journal in trembling hands before fading away, leaving a strange, cold silence in its wake.\n[Task #15 Complete. Reward: \"Blood-Stained Amulet\" (Reduces the infection rate)]\nStark slipped the amulet between his neck alongside his [Sculk Necklace] and gave Sora a nod. \"One down. Let's keep moving.\"\nHe did try to attack with [Sculk] by the way, but Hugo didn't even budge.\nHe needed to complete the most amount of tasks possible.\n\"Where do you think you're going?\" but as they tried to leave the library, Father Hugo suddenly appeared, grabbing Stark from the neck and lifting him up.\n\"S-SHIT!\"\n\"Vine Smash!\"\nBAM! BAM! BAM!\nSora then tried to strike Father Hugo repeatedly, but a single movement of his empty hand sent her flying.\n\"...Die, child,\" Hugo smiled.\n\"FUCK YOU!\"\nCrimson Ball Transmission!\nStark threw the ball behind and snapped his fingers, teleporting away from Hugo's grip.\nHim and Sora immediately ran away.\n\"Keep running, it only excites me more!\"\nAs they crept further down the hallway, an open doorway led them into the Dormitory\n.\nShadows hung heavy in the air, and faint murmurs drifted from the beds where spectral forms tossed and turned in a restless slumber.\nStark sensed it was the perfect place to cleanse.\n\"Sora, I'm going to purify this area.\"\nWith a nod, Sora took her position at the entrance, ready to intercept anything that might interrupt him.\nStark closed his eyes, summoning the radiant crimson energy of his skill.\n\"Crimson Purification!\"\nA wave of holy aura surged outward, washing over the dormitory.\nThe restless spirits dissolved in its warmth, their expressions of anguish easing before they vanished into the ether.\n[Task #16 Complete. Reward: \"Clarity Orb\" (Negates all hallucinations for 60 seconds upon use).]\nStark exhaled, his breath hitching as the energy drained from him slightly. \"Not this... fuck...\"\nSora's eyes darted down the corridor. \"He's here,\" she whispered, her tone laced with urgency.\nThey barely had time to react. Father Hugo's massive form stepped into the doorway, blocking any path to freedom. His arms stretched out as if welcoming them into an embrace, a sickening smile plastered across his face.\n\"Children must be obedient,\" he murmured.\nWithout hesitation, he lunged forward.\nStark activated\nInvincible Dodge,\nsidestepping the priest's grasp just in time.\nSora spun out of the way, her [Vine Blade] which she summoned flashing as she attempted to strike Hugo's side, but the priest merely laughed, his skin repelling her blade as though it were made of straw.\nStark's instincts screamed at him to run. \"We can't hold him off like this. Move!\"\nThey ducked into another hallway, and Stark's eyes fell upon a door marked Playroom\n.\nThey entered to find rows of dusty shelves lined with broken, malformed toys.\nDolls with hollow eyes stared back at them, and stuffed animals were twisted in unnatural poses.\nEach toy seemed to emit a faint, malevolent aura, tainted by years of abandonment.\n[Task #18: Destroy the cursed toys in the playroom.]\nSora picked up one of the toys—a ragged bear with a sewn-on smile.\nAs soon as she touched it, its eyes glowed red, and it lunged at her hand, trying to bite down.\n\"These toys are cursed… they're alive.\"\nStark's crimson energy flared around him. \"They won't be for long. Crimson Spears!\"\nThe spears materialized, and with precise control, Stark launched them into the cursed toys, tearing them apart one by one.\nThe toys writhed and twisted, releasing small bursts of dark energy as they were destroyed.\n[Task #18 Complete. Reward: \"Master Key\" (Unlocks any lock in the orphanage).]\n\"I DON'T WANT ANY OF THESE THINGS,\" he shouted, \"I WANT A GODDAMNED COOLDOWN GEM!\"\nIf he didn't have his [Heaven's Spear] ready at any point, every contestant would try to kill him.\nHe wanted to make sure he had it at all times.\nOtherwise, he would have to use it on [Father Hugo] and put himself at risk.\nWhen using [Heaven's Spear], a giant angel appears in the sky, so if the angel throws the spear, it wouldn't take a genius to realize that Stark didn't have it anymore.\nEspecially CEO, that asshole, even though he is alone now, probably is strong enough to take him on without issues.\n\"Wait, Stark!\" Sora mumbled, looking at the key, \"This can be useful!\"\n\"...Yeah,\" Stark's mind raced as he clutched the Master Key.\nThere had to be one place left they could escape to.\nHis memory snapped back to a map he'd glimpsed earlier—a layout of the orphanage showing a courtyard just beyond the main hall.\n\"Come on, Sora. I think we can reach the courtyard,\" he said, pulling her along as they navigated the winding hallways.\nAs they neared the main hall, Hugo's voice boomed behind them, filled with unholy wrath. \"Your insolence shall not go unpunished!\"\nThey threw open the final door leading to the courtyard, bursting into the night air.\nStark's chest heaved as he looked around, taking in the vast, open space filled with tangled vines, decrepit statues, and a suffocating darkness that shrouded the area.\nFor the first time, he allowed himself a brief moment to catch his breath.\nBut the reprieve was brief.\nA strange chill filled the courtyard, coiling around them like a suffocating fog.\nStark and Sora froze as the ground in the center of the courtyard began to tremble.\nShadows pooled together, congealing into a massive, writhing figure, its form shifting and pulsing as it absorbed the darkness around it.\nIn an instant, Stark's vision flashed red, warning of an incoming enemy:\n[Eternal Regret – Level 600, Formed from the Tormented Souls of the Orphanage's Lost Children]\nThe creature stood taller than Father Hugo, its translucent body shuddering with the faces of dozens of children, mouths twisted in agony.\nThe cries of the lost souls pierced the air, a dreadful chorus of pain and sorrow.\n\"Oh god,\" Sora breathed hard, still trying to keep her cool, \"Stark… what do we do?\"\nStark's mind raced.\nHis skills weren't fully cooled down, and he knew that facing the Eternal Regret head-on would be a death wish: it could be just as strong as Hugo.\nBut there was nowhere to run.\nThey were trapped between Hugo and this monstrous embodiment of pure anguish.\nThe beast's eyes flickered, focusing on them both, a single word echoing from its hollow chest in dozens of different voices.\n\"Release…\"\nStark steadied himself, his jaw set. \"Sora, whatever happens, stay close and don't let go.\"",

      "content": "As Stark and Sora faced the towering horror of Eternal Regret and the relentless Father Hugo, an icy wind gusted through the courtyard.\nThe courtyard was vast but closed in by stone walls and towering iron gates, a cage that had become their last stand.\nWith Eternal Regret blocking any escape and Hugo advancing behind them, retreat was no longer an option.\n\"Stay close,\" Stark spoke to Sora.\nShe nodded, her eyes narrowed, looking back and forth between the two enemies.\nFather Hugo, though walking at relatively slow speed, was now already visible to them, still marching.\nAnd on the other hand, Eternal Regret loomed over them, its translucent form shifting, the faces of anguished children trapped within the creature's body shifting in silent screams.\nStark steadied himself, knowing full well that whatever he did next had to count.\nWith a flick of his hand, he conjured his [Crimson Spears], launching three toward Eternal Regret's core, hoping they would hit something substantial in the nebulous mass of shadows and souls.\nThe spears shot forward, piercing the creature's form, but instead of any satisfying impact, they seemed to dissolve within it, each face in Eternal Regret's body twisting into brief expressions of even deeper sorrow before the spears vanished.\n\"No good,\" Stark muttered, frustration building.\nThis wasn't like Father Hugo—there was nothing solid to strike.\n\"Perception!\"\n...\n[Name: Eternal Regret]\n[Level: 600]\n[HP: 1]\n[Strength: ???]\n[Stamina: ???]\n[Speed: ???]\n[Defense: ???]\n[Skills: Release...]\n...\n\"Huh?\" Stark was confused, and he actually stopped doing whatever he was doing because of this.\nHe couldn't see the stats?\nAnd what about its health points, why were they at one?\nOnly one skill as well?\n...\n[Skill: Release]\n[Description: Release all of your regrets and destroy anyone who tries to stop you.]\n...\n\"Stark!\" Sora's voice was sharp with warning as she glanced over his shoulder.\n\"Huh?\" he snapped back to reality and looked behind.\nFather Hugo had drawn close, his lips curling into that sadistic smile as he whispered, \"There is no escape.\"\nWithout hesitation, Stark lunged to his right, avoiding the priest's outstretched hand.\nHe activated [Invincible Dodge].\n[Perfect Dodge!]\nHe let the world slow for a split second as he slipped out of the way, but just as he did, Eternal Regret let out a horrific wail.\nThe ground trembled, and Stark staggered as his dodge window ended, thrown off balance by the force of the cry.\n\"Sora!\" he called, looking at her.\nShe nodded, eyes flashing with determination as she gripped her [Vine Blade], her literal newest skill.\nStark took a steadying breath and then activated [Double Assault].\nHis strength and speed doubled in an instant, and his senses sharpened as time seemed to slow around him.\nHe moved in a blur, striking at Eternal Regret's shadowy limbs, hoping to break through its defenses and give Sora an opening.\nEach punch from Stark was met with wisps of darkness dissipating, and though the creature wasn't physically harmed, its form seemed to tremble, a resonance of pain echoing back at him.\nHe punched so hard and fast that his fists became almost invisible, averaging 50 hits per second.\n\"LET'S DO THIS!\" he shouted, \"ASURA'S ARMS!\"\nHe summoned the four arms, and they also began to punch [Eternal Regret].\n0! 0! 0! 0!\nHe just needed...\n0! 0! 0! 0!\nOne single point of damage.\n0! 0! 0!\nYet even with everything, he didn't manage to damage it.\nHe spent his entire 20 seconds hitting the creature, but the max he did was make its form twitch slightly.\nFather Hugo wasn't even moving anymore, seemingly laughing at Stark's futile attempt.\n\"Alright,\" once the timer stopped, he looked back at Sora, \"Physical attacks won't work-\"\nBOOOM!\nFather Hugo quite literally teleported next to Stark, and though the boy saw it, he didn't manage to avoid the fist.\nSLAM!\nHe was sent crashing toward one of the courtyard walls, destroying it.\n-18,374!\nBut it was fine, because as long as he still had his six arms, he could manage something.\nFather Hugo's mocking laughter echoed, his twisted smile widening.\nHe continued marching toward Stark, actually walking right past Sora and ignoring her.\n\"Not worth my time,\" he whispered when she could hear.\n\"...\"\n\"Come,\" Father Hugo gestured for the other monster, and it followed his orders.\n\"Follow... Father... Hugo...\" the voices on its body wailed.\nStark wiped the blood from his lip, gaze flicking between the two menacing threats.\nEternal Regret's ghostly wails intensified, the faces of trapped souls swirling faster within its shadowy form, as though sensing an opening to feed off his growing despair.\nStark clenched his fists, feeling a surge of resolve.\nThey couldn't afford to retreat, not when every second wasted meant giving these creatures more control over the situation. \"Alright,\" he muttered to himself, \"if direct attacks are useless, then maybe…\"\nHis mind raced, considering his options.\nHis gaze landed on the red glow of his [Crimson Purification].\nPerhaps… it was risky, but it might work.\nFocusing his energy, he summoned the holy skill, and as a crimson aura enveloped him, he felt a wave of purifying heat course through his body.\n\"CRIMSON PURIFICATION!\" he roared, unleashing the energy in a blinding burst.\nThe light radiated outward, its holy energy aimed directly at Eternal Regret's shadowy form.\nFor a moment, the creature recoiled, the shadowy faces within it contorting, mouths open in silent screams as the holy aura washed over them.\n\"!!!\"\n0!\nIt didn't receive damage.\nBut...\n\"Alright.\"\nAt least now he had a way to momentarily stun it.\nFather Hugo on the other hand shook off the energy with overwhelming easy, a simple swing of his arm cutting it off.\nWielding Cross!\nStark needed to keep trying, though.\nSMASH!\nHe summoned his giant cross, hovering above him, and then swung it like a baseball bat toward Father Hugo.\n\"Fool.\"\nBut the old man grabbed it with his bare hands, took it away from Stark, and threw it.\n\"...Dude.\"\nThat guy had quite literally every solution to his skills.\nHe wanted to use [Heaven's Wrath] at this point, but he was sure Hugo would avoid it with no problems.\n\"So you think a little trick will save you?\" Hugo taunted, his eyes gleaming with sadistic pleasure. \"Only the faithful will find salvation.\"\nStark tensed as the priest lunged forward, swinging his arm in a brutal arc.\nSora tried to intercept, her [Vine Blade] flashing as she aimed for his side, but Hugo's hand snaked out, grabbing her by the wrist and twisting it painfully.\n\"This useless child is only causing us trouble, getting rid of her will make it all easier.\"\n\"Sora!\" Stark shouted, but Hugo tossed her aside as if she were nothing.\nStark gritted his teeth, fury bubbling up inside him.\nHe couldn't waste any more time; Hugo had to be stopped.\nHe clenched his fists, summoning all the power he had left.\nHis aura took over his entire body, covering it entirely, only leaving his eyes visible with a visible white aura.\nWith a burst of speed, Stark lunged forward, his fist crashing into Hugo's chest with enough force to crack the air.\nThe impact reverberated through the courtyard, sending the priest skidding backward.\n-47,839!\n\"DIE. YOU. FUCKING. HERETIC.\"\nBut Hugo simply laughed, straightening with a sickening crack. \"Is that all, child?\" he taunted, wiping a thin line of blood from his lip.\nStark growled in frustration, the energy draining from him. He was running out of time and options.\nHugo took a step forward, raising his hand, dark energy swirling around his fingers.\n\"Sora… find cover!\" Stark shouted, throwing up his six arms as a wave of darkness exploded from Hugo's palm, engulfing the courtyard in shadow.\nThe air grew cold as ice, and the shadows seemed to press in on them, cutting off all light.\nStark blinked, his vision adjusting to the darkness, trying to find Sora.\nBut all he could see was Hugo's eyes glowing faintly, piercing through the black.\nHis heart pounded, each beat echoing in his ears as he struggled to steady his breath.\nHe wouldn't give Hugo the satisfaction of showing fear.\nA low chuckle rumbled from the darkness. \"Lost, are we?\" Hugo's voice slithered through the shadows, taunting him.\n[Test of Faith]\n[Task #19: Survive Father Hugo's \"Test of Faith.\"]\n\"God damn it...\"",

Intruder.]\nBefore he could react, the ground gave way beneath him, stones crumbling, sending him plummeting downward.\nHe landed hard, his brush clattering beside him.\n\"Damn.\"\nDusting himself off, Artist took in his surroundings.\nA tunnel stretched ahead, dimly lit by torches lining the walls.\nThe pathway could lead only one way: forward.\nHe walked through the tunnel, feeling an oppressive weight in the air.\nOnce he arrived at the end, he noticed an exit door at the far end of a giant room.\nBut before that door is a fountain.\n[Tormented and Heartless Altar]\n[Drop your blood in it to summon them.]\n\"...\"\n[They are one of the moonscorched commanders.]\n\"Oh.\"\nSo they were the final moonscorched commanders.\nThe Mayor was one, Father Hugo another, and these two were the last.\n\"Well, might as well,\" he smiled.\nWith a quick slash of his brush across his palm, crimson dripped into the altar's basin.\nAnd the moment the blood met the liquid...\nBOOM!\nIt surged upwards, twisting and contorting into shapes.\nArtist watched, captivated, as the blood spun higher, transforming into the first figure: a skinless humanoid, basically it had no human skin and you could see the red interior.\nIt was wearing a cloak made out of its skin, and it had no mouth, as if it did, you would have to constantly hear its screams, for it is always tortured.\n[The Tormented One.]\nA second figure took shape beside it, feminine and almost divine.\nShe wore a dark suit over her body, the only exposed part of her being her face, which retained a disturbingly serene beauty.\nIn her right hand she was carrying a golden spear, and in her left a black blade, there was also a golden halo above her head, and black wings on her back.\n[The Heartless One.]\n\"A mix of angel and devil...?\" Artist pondered as he prepared to battle.\nBut Artist hadn't realized something, none of the participants did.\nThe Sniper and Inquisitor are the weakest commanders by far, only serving the purpose of making the participant's confidence grow.\nThey are dummies, basically, they serve no purpose.\nBut the other three on the other hand: the Mayor, Father Hugo, and The Altered Ones (which is the duo name for Tormented One and Heartless One) are on another level.\n[Tormented One - Level 600]\n[Heartless One - Level 600]\nThey are also the strongest commanders out of the lot, stronger than both Mayor and Hugo.\nBasically, Artist was facing something almost impossible to beat.\n\"...\"\nThe Heartless One's laughter rang through the chamber, cold and mocking. \"A cute little human… releasing us, just to die.\"\n\"You aren't good enough to be part of my masterpiece,\" that is all Artist said as he stared at the two of them, \"Begone.\"\nThe two figures loomed closer, indifferent to his words.\nTheir levels—an overwhelming 600 each—did not escape him, but Artist's confidence never wavered.\nHe had no illusions; he understood the stakes, but even then, he didn't feel like running.\nHe would only run if the situation required it.\nThe Tormented One shifted, the grotesque form radiating a nauseating heat, its hollow eyes fixated on him.\nThe Heartless One moved with fluid grace, brandishing her spear, wings arcing back as she prepared to strike.\nArtist moved first, holding his brush, colors spilling into the air.\nHe cast [Ink Torrent], a jet of dark ink whipping forward, blinding the Tormented One momentarily.\nBefore the creature could regain sight, Artist followed with [Brush Barrage], each stroke sharp and swift, cutting through the air in blurs of color and force.\nThe Heartless One sidestepped, her movements graceful and deadly.\nShe lunged, her spear gleaming in the dim light, aiming straight for his chest.\nArtist twisted, narrowly evading the strike as he unleashed [Chromatic Storm], an explosion of colors that engulfed the room, bursts of energy forcing the Heartless One to retreat, her golden halo dimming.\nBut even then...\n-0! -0!\nArtist couldn't harm them for some reason.\nHe had believed he could maybe just try to test his luck and see if he could take them on.\nBut he now removes everything he said before: these things couldn't be beaten, not a chance.\n\"Well,\" he sighs, \"I guess I'll just leave,\" he drew a door in the ground, opened it, and jumped inside right as the [Tormented One] was about to blast him off.\nArtist had just unleashed two monsters in the trial, and they could now leave the Museum and chase other participants.",

More...\"\n[Prove your devotion.]\n[Kill 5 participants.]\n[2/5]\n\"I need more...\"\nFollower had gained incredible abilities from the [Godless Demon], allowing him to grow so strong he could defeat a moonscorched commander by himself.\nAs you probably realized, he had contracted with the godless demon himself to grant him more power.\nIt was something you could do: contract with one of the apostles, or the godless demon himself to become one of his followers.\nAs a price for that, he would need to follow the orders of the godless demon forever, but it didn't bother him: he actually liked it.\n\"I need... more...\"\nAnd in the end, if he manages to complete his ultimate task, then he will rank up to being one of the [Godless Demon Apostles].\n[Ultimate Task]\n[Kill Stark Heartsouls, AKA Chosen, and escape this trial alone.]\nThe more he fed on these powers, the more powerful he would become.\nBeing an apostle was a honor to him.\nOh, yeah, and let's just say... he wasn't the only one who received this offer.\nActually, the task [Kill Stark Heartsouls] had been given to two other people beside Follower.\nThey were people the [Godless Demon] deemed strong enough to become possible apostles.\nAnyway, back to the trial, Follower was moving fast through the city, killing anything he saw, unbothered by the experience gain as two attacks were enough to end most monsters now.\nAnd then... he arrived at the square where the massive [Hollow Tower] is located.\nA low voice, barely a whisper yet filled with an insatiable hunger, echoed through the square.\n\"More… more...\"\nDave's grip tightened on his sword as he scanned the darkness beyond the square.\nHe saw the figure approaching, slowly stepping into the faint torchlight.\nThe figure's eyes glinted with an unnatural gleam, and his presence alone seemed to make the air heavy, thick with malice and an insidious intent.\nThe man's skin seemed pallid, almost gaunt, as though drained by something far darker than death.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nFollower's eyes, glassy and intense, locked onto them, a crooked grin spreading across his face.\nHis fingers traced the edge of his [Cross-Sword], the weapon gleaming with a deadly, crimson aura.\nHe muttered something under his breath, and the shadows seemed to grow thicker, the world closing in around him.\nHe stopped a short distance away, standing before them with an air of reverence, yet somehow still seething with a quiet, feverish madness.\n\"Prove your devotion,\" he whispered, voice tinged with something unhinged. \"Three more… for the godless demon.\"\nDave and Claire exchanged a quick glance, understanding flashing between them.\nThere was no need for words; they'd been in this trial long enough to know that anyone who wore that expression was either an enemy or a dead man walking.\nWithout hesitation, Dave surged forward, his sword elongating to strike from a distance.\nThe blade stretched out, hurtling toward Follower, but with a smirk, Follower sidestepped, his movement fluid and disturbingly fast.\nWith barely a pause, Dave teleported beside him, using his [Reach] to close the gap in an instant and unleash a powerful overhead slash.\nYet Follower was already ready, moving in sync with Dave's assault.\nHis [Cross-Sword] flickered upward to meet Dave's blade in a harsh clang of metal.\nFollower's smirk grew, his voice lilting as he taunted, \"Is that all you can do?\"\nClaire's eyes narrowed as her arm began to shift, black scales creeping up her skin as she transformed it into the monstrous claw of Aleor.\nShe rushed forward, thrusting the claw toward Follower's torso.\nHe spun, narrowly dodging her attack, his movements as smooth as liquid, and in one swift motion, he brought his sword down toward her exposed side.\nDave's sword whipped through the air, intercepting Follower's blow and deflecting it with a burst of energy.\n\"You're not getting through that easy,\" he growled, stepping in front of Claire.\nENERGY SWING!\nHis elongated sword shimmered as he swung it, creating arcs of energy that swept across the square, forcing Follower to leap back, momentarily on the defensive.\n\"Well... at least I tried to be nice,\" Follower sighed, \"This is gonna be painful.\"\nBut as they moved, they felt an overwhelming pressure, an aura thick with an unnatural power that seemed to crush the very ground beneath it.\nFollower's eyes glowed as he lifted his [Cross-Sword], a twisted smile on his face.\nHis voice dripped with a chilling satisfaction. \"You don't understand, do you? You're not fighting a mere participant anymore.\"\nCRIMSON CORRUPTION!\nWith a dark incantation, the [Godless Demon's Blessing] surged through him, transforming his aura into a pulsating, corrupted energy that radiated outward.\nHe vanished, reappearing behind Dave in an instant, bringing his sword down with a vicious slash.\nDave barely had time to parry, his arm vibrating from the impact.\nFollower's strength was unreal, like the weight of several men pressing down on him at once.\nClaire lunged at Follower, her left arm shifting into Aleor's claw as she swung at him, aiming to tear through his chest.\nHe sidestepped, his movements impossibly swift, and retaliated with a precise strike to her side, the blade grazing her flesh with a flash of crimson.\n-43,414!\nClaire hissed in pain, retreating a few steps. \"He's stronger than he looks,\" she muttered, clutching her side, blood seeping through her fingers.\n\"Stay focused,\" Dave replied, his voice grim.\nHe raised his sword once more, determined not to let their opponent overpower them.\nFollower grinned, feeding off their fear and desperation.\nHis [Godless Demon's Blessing] had pushed his abilities beyond human limits.\nHe raised his hand, dark energy swirling around him as he whispered another incantation.\nDEMON'S GRASP!\nIn the next instant, he disappeared from sight, reappearing behind Claire and thrusting his sword toward her back.\nDave's instincts kicked in, his [Reach] activating as he teleported beside her, intercepting the strike just in time.\nThe impact sent both of them skidding backward, but Follower didn't let up.\nHe pressed forward, his strikes relentless and brutal, his eyes glazed with a fanatical hunger.\nClaire transformed her legs into Aleor's, kicking Follower back with a monstrous force.\nALEOR COMBO!\nShe followed up with a flurry of slashes, her limbs shifting between human and monstrous, her strikes erratic and unpredictable.\nBut Follower's reflexes were razor-sharp. He dodged each blow with an almost supernatural ease, retaliating with a brutal slash that sent her sprawling.\n\"Claire!\" Dave's voice was strained, his own energy waning as he charged forward, summoning all his strength to launch a final assault.\nSTAR REACH... EXPLOSION!\nHis sword stretched to its maximum reach, a blur of steel and fury as he swung with every ounce of his power.\nFollower merely smirked, raising his [Cross-Sword] to block. \"Is that all?\"\nATTACK NEGATION!\nWith one powerful swing, he shattered Dave's attack, the force of the collision reverberating through the square.\nDave staggered, struggling to stay on his feet, his sword trembling in his grip.\n\"Die,\" Follower whispered, his tone devoid of mercy.\nWith one swift motion, he plunged his sword through Dave's chest, the blade gleaming with crimson light as it tore through flesh and bone.\nDEMON DEVOURING!\n\"Adios,\" Follower smiled.\nHis blade turned completely dark as he whispered his strongest perk.\nAnd then...\nBOOM!\n-999,999!\nDave's eyes widened, a gasp escaping his lips as he slumped forward, life slipping from his body.\nClaire screamed, her form shifting completely into Aleor's monstrous shape as she lunged at Follower, her claws slashing with a desperate fury.\nBut Follower was calm, his movements a blur, and with a calculated swing, he sliced through her, cutting her down with ruthless precision too.\nAs the blood pooled around his feet, Follower wiped his blade, a twisted satisfaction settling in his gaze.\nHe knelt before the massive doors of the Hollow Tower, bowing his head in a mockery of reverence.\n\"For you, my crimson lord,\" he murmured, voice laced with devotion.\nThe Hollow Tower loomed above him, silent and unyielding, but to Follower, it was alive with the presence of the godless demon he served.\nTwo more fallen—two more steps closer to becoming an apostle.\nWith a cruel smile, he rose, turning his gaze toward the city, ready to continue his bloody path through Termina.\n[8 participants left.]\n[Global Announcement: Participant \"Wielder\" has been killed by \"Follower.\"]\n[Global Announcement: Participant \"Demon\" has been killed by \"Follower.\"]",

The. Chosen. One.]\nIt wasn't a task anymore.\nIt was an order.\nA cold gust swept through the square, rustling the hem of his cloak as he surveyed the square, the flickering torchlight casting ominous shadows over the Hollow Tower's towering facade.\n\"Where is he,\" Follower kneeled, \"Show me where he is, master Godless, and I shall execute him on the spot.\"\n[...]\nThe silence hung heavy, as if the entire world were holding its breath.\n[Very well.]\nThen, slowly, a dark, shimmering arrow materialized before him, floating in midair, and pointed steadily in the direction he was to go.\nIt pulsed with an unnatural glow, almost breathing with life as it awaited him to follow.\nThe Godless Demon's voice resounded once more, its power vibrating in his very core.\n[It will show you Chosen's position wherever he goes.]\nFollower grinned, nodding in appreciation. \"Thank you,\" he murmured, straightening and locking his gaze on the arrow.\nWithout another word, he began to follow it, every step bringing him closer to his target.\n...\nBack to the Orphanage.\nFar from the square, deep within the courtyard of the orphanage.\nStark blinked, his vision struggling to adjust.\nBut there was only darkness, a thick, oppressive void that smothered everything in its path.\nAll he could make out were two pinpricks of light, faint but deadly, piercing through the black—the cold, glowing eyes of Father Hugo.\n\"Lost, are we?\" Hugo's voice slithered through the shadows, mockingly, his laughter echoing in every direction.\nA notification flashed before Stark's eyes.\n[Test of Faith]\n[Task #19: Survive Father Hugo's \"Test of Faith.\"]\n\"God damn it…\" Stark cursed under his breath, his fists clenched tightly.\nHe felt his heart pounding, each beat sounding like a war drum in the silence, but he forced himself to stay calm.\nThis was just another obstacle, another twisted trial.\nBut as he reached out for his powers, the dark energy of Hugo's spell constricted around him, dulling his senses, his focus slipping from his control.\nHe struggled to summon his crimson aura, but it was like grasping at smoke.\nEvery skill, every bit of his strength was being suffocated by this hellish darkness.\n\"Show yourself!\" he roared, his voice echoing uselessly into the void.\nBut Hugo only chuckled, his voice omnipresent. \"Show myself? Why would I, when you're already so… helpless?\"\nA cold shiver ran down Stark's spine as he realized that Hugo's voice wasn't just taunting him—it was everywhere.\nSurrounding him, closing in on him.\nAnd then, suddenly, pain shot through his body, sharp and unyielding.\n-14,924\n\"Your senses are so dulled you don't notice pain until it reaches you,\" Hugo laughed, \"So weak.\"\nHe staggered, his legs buckling as he struggled to stay on his feet.\nFather Hugo had punched him in the gut, and to put it in perspective, each one of Father Hugo's punches could destroy a small building.\nNo kidding.\nStark was running out of options, and fast.\n\"Do you not see that everything is useless?\"\nPUNCH! BAM!\n\"ARGH-\"\n-17,493!\n'That guy isn't attacking Sora at all...' Stark thought, 'Good... it's better this way.'\nPUNCH! PUNCH!\nTwo more swings at his face brought him back to reality.\n-14,495! -13,921!\nFather Hugo took pleasure in knowing Stark was defenseless.\n\"COME ON!\" Hugo shouted for the first time, \"SHOW ME!\"\nCrimson Ball Transmission!\nStark tried to teleport, but Hugo would be there, waiting for him.\nCrimson Purification!\nHe would send a wave of aura outward, but it didn't hit anything.\n\"Tsk tsk,\" Hugo appeared in front of him, shaking his finger, \"Bad child.\"\nPUNCH!\n-18,384!\nStark's HP was getting dangerously low.\nDomi-Chain Restrains: Chains of Judgment!\nHe sent all three chains toward the white eyes he could see, and also summoned [Gortox] to send a few dozen more.\nBut even then.\nSLASH! SLASH! SLASH!\n\"Do you think these can hold me down?\" Hugo kept laughing, \"This. Is. Nothing.\"\nNone of this worked.\nNONE OF IT IS WORKING!\n\"Do you believe...\" Hugo's figure appeared before Stark, looking down on him as he was nothing more than a bug, \"That you can win?\"\n\"...\" Stark's looked down, clenching his fists.\nThere was no way he could win against [Father Hugo] and [Eternal Regret].\nBut Hugo hadn't finished his sentence.\n\"When even she couldn't?\"\nHe grabbed onto the darkness, and from it pulled Sora's head, completely separated from her body.\nHer eyes were hollow, blood dripping from her mouth, eyes and nose.\n\"!!!\" Stark's eyes widened, completely shock written on his face.\n\"Your little friend won't be watching your dying face, but at least see hers.\"\nAt that moment, Stark saw red.\nHe couldn't even feel his surroundings anymore.\n[This is fake, by the way.]\nA panel appeared before him.\n[It is one of his illusionary skills, do not trust it.]\nBut even then, Stark couldn't stop feeling rage.\nHow dare this ugly looking thing do this.\n[Oh well, just eliminate him.]\nBefore he could even realize it himself, Stark moved his fist toward Hugo's face.\nIt was so fast, in fact, that even he didn't see it.\nAnd neither did Father Hugo.\nSLAM! BOOOOM!\n-273,941!\nThe punch was like an explosion, destroying everything around it, including the darkness that had taken over the courtyard.\nDing!\n[Task #19: You have survived Father Hugo's \"Test of Faith\"]\n[You have received the \"Hollow Teleporter\"]\n[Description: Will teleport you in front of the Hollow Tower instantly. Can be used by several people if holding hands.]\nNotification rang out, but Stark was too focused in taming his anger.\nHe quickly calmed down as he saw Sora use her vine powers to block [Eternal Regret]'s attacks, though.\n\"Phew...\" he mumbled.\nFather Hugo on the other hand had been sent flying toward yet another wall, destroying it.\nHe had actually received damage!\nBut Stark didn't plan to stay here any longer.\nBy sheer luck, he had gotten an item that could allow him to leave this place.\nThough, when he looked up again, he realized it wasn't luck at all.\n[Talent: Chosen One, activated]\n\"Damn.\"\nWithout wasting a moment, he reached out, calling, \"Sora! Grab my hand, now!\"\nShe looked back while restraining the giant beast that was on the verge of breaking through her barrier, then ran toward Stark, not questioning what he wanted to do.\nStark didn't hesitate.\nHe activated the Hollow Teleporter, gripping Sora's hand as the courtyard around them began to warp and twist, the darkness melting away into a blur of motion and light.\nIn an instant, they were gone, leaving behind the haunting laughter of Father Hugo and screams of [Eternal Regret] as they vanished into thin air.\nThe world stabilized around them, and suddenly they found themselves sprawled on the cold stone floor of the square right before Hollow Tower.\nThe air was heavy, filled with the ominous energy of the tower, but it was safe—safe from Father Hugo, from the suffocating darkness that had nearly claimed them.\nStark and Sora lay there, panting, their chests heaving as they struggled to catch their breath.\nStark's mind raced, processing everything that had just happened.\nThey had been inches from death, standing against one of the most terrifying entities in this trial.\nAnd they had only barely escaped.\nStark's gaze drifted up to the towering ceiling above, the walls lined with shadows that seemed to pulse and breathe with a life of their own.\n\"That's... the place,\" he looked up, impossible to see the top of the tower from there.\nThe conditions to open it were still written on the door for him to check, but he didn't bother as he already knew them.\nAs he sat up, a fierce determination glinted in his eyes. \"We were so close…\" he muttered, his fists clenching at his sides.\nHe could still feel the lingering chill of Father Hugo's darkness, the way it had constricted around him, choking the very life from him.\nHe wouldn't forget it.\nThe ominous silence of the Hollow Tower loomed around them, but Stark's thoughts were sharp, focused.\nThey were far from safe, but they were alive.\nAnd in this hellish trial, that was something to hold onto.\nElsewhere in Termina, the remaining participants fought for survival, each one entangled in the twisted games of the trial.\nEight remained.\nOne seeking for another to achieve the great status of [Godless Demon Apostle].\nTwo stuck in a manor with a crazy mayor that could kill them at any moment if they didn't follow his rules.\nTwo so calm it didn't even seem like they cared about this trial at all.\nOne having just unleashed two terrifying beasts on the rest of the participants.\nAnd the last, Stark and Sora, just escaped death from one of the commanders they were supposed to defeat.\nThe Mayor, The Tormented One, The Heartless One, Father Hugo, and Eternal Regret.\nThese entities were the strongest in the trial.\nIf they wanted to win this trial, they would need to kill them all.\n\"This trial is… fucking… insane…\" Stark grit his teeth, a vortex of crimson energy swirling inside his eyes as he clenched his fists.\nThe sheer force of his aura pulsed outward.\n\"I'm going to fucking… destroy… EVERYTHING.\"\n[EGO Meter: 100/100]",

Shock shot a glare at CEO, his expression filled with anxiety.\nThey both knew that if the Mayor discovered his servant was dead—and worse, that they were responsible—they'd be as good as corpses.\nThe Mayor wouldn't just punish them; he'd make sure they suffered.\nThey both tensed, bracing to either fight or flee.\nThen, with an echoing SLAM, the chamber doors swung open.\nThree butlers entered the room, each carrying massive covered dishes.\nCEO's brows knit in confusion.\nHe could have sworn—\nThe truth hit him as he used his eyes to scan the newcomers.\n[Mini-Boss: Butler Trio]\n[Level: 590]\n[Skills: Loyal Regeneration, Moonscorched, Butler Swing, Random Plate, Mayor's Servant…]\nCEO focused on [Loyal Regeneration] for a split second:\n[Loyal Regeneration: As long as the Mayor is alive, they will regenerate indefinitely, unable to leave his side as their loyalty transcends life itself.]\n\"Damn…\" he muttered, realization dawning.\nThey couldn't kill these things, not with the Mayor around.\nEven the notion of an ambush was out of the question.\nThe butlers placed their dishes on the table, each one heavier and more ominous than the last.\nThen, without a word, they bowed and exited the room as silently as they had come.\n\"Let's play a game,\" the Mayor said, his grin widening as he uncovered the dishes with a flourish. \"These,\" he announced proudly, \"are the specialties of Termina.\"\nThe sight was grotesque: a bubbling black slime, a mangled Moonscorched creature that looked half-digested, and a pile of unidentifiable, rotting remnants.\nShock scowled. \"Specialties, my ass.\"\nThe Mayor's eyes narrowed, and an unsettling aura filled the room. \"What did you say?\"\nShock stiffened instantly. \"…Nothing. Looks delicious.\"\n\"Good!\" the Mayor laughed, his mood shifting back to dark amusement. \"Because each of you will take a bite from every one of these marvelous dishes.\"\nThe silence stretched painfully as CEO and Shock exchanged looks.\nEach dish seemed to be worse than the last.\nBut the Mayor was waiting, and they were running out of options.\nThe Mayor snapped his fingers, and a distant metallic click reverberated from downstairs.\n[The manor is locked.]\n[Find the key, obtain the Mayor's permission, or defeat the commander to escape.]\nCEO clenched his jaw. \"If we eat this… we can leave, right?\"\nThe Mayor grinned wider. \"Perhaps.\"\n[You have received an additional secret task: Eat the disgusting food.]\n[Reward: Key to the Basement.]\nShock's eyes widened as he saw the notification.\nEating this stuff would be their ticket to the basement—and, potentially, a way to an exit.\nThe Mayor picked up a chunk of the Moonscorched beast and swallowed it whole, smacking his lips in satisfaction. \"Come on. It's delicious!\"\nThe black slime-like liquid was literally moving.\nAnd he expected them to eat it?\nIt wasn't the disgust that was the problem either, as if it was only that, CEO would have begun eating it all.\nBut...\n[Moonscorched food: Every bite will add 50% to your infection rate.]\nThere was quite literally no way to escape this without being transformed\nShock didn't need the specifics to feel the dread creeping in as well.\nHe eyed the shifting black goo, visibly recoiling.\n\"Businessman Analysis,\" CEO whispered, scanning the room in desperation.\nHis gaze settled on a glint of metal around the Mayor's neck—the Basement Key.\nIt dangled from a chain, just within reach if they dared to act.\nWith a decisive breath, CEO stood up, drawing the Mayor's attention.\n\"All right,\" he said, clenching his fists as his aura flared around him.\n\"Oh?\" the Mayor tilted his head, amusement glinting in his eyes. \"You're so eager to enjoy the meal that you can't even sit still?\"\nShock, who had frozen in place, gave CEO a panicked look, signaling for him to sit back down.\nBut CEO's mind was made up.\n\"Hey, Mayor.\" He let his energy gather, his beam charging in his hand. \"You've got terrible taste in food.\"\nThen, without another word, he fired a focused beam at the Mayor's chest.\nThe Mayor's smile didn't falter.\nHe flicked his knife to intercept the blast, but it disintegrated in his hand, leaving him with only a fork.\nHis expression turned cold. \"Oh, I see. I suppose dinner's over, then.\"\n\"That's right,\" CEO replied, dropping into a ready stance. \"Let's end this.\"\nThe Mayor raised his arm, but just as he began to move—\n\"Ion Pulse (Godly Skill),\" Shock's dagger glowed with electric energy, and he teleported with [Lightning Flash] to the Mayor's side.\nHe plunged the weapon into the Mayor's knee, releasing all his pent-up energy.\nZAP! ZAP! ZAP!\nElectricity coursed through the Mayor, temporarily locking him in place.\nLines of damage numbers floated over the Mayor's body:\n-13,934! -12,952! -11,431!\n[Mayor has been stunned.]\n\"GRAB IT, IDIOT!\" Shock yelled, feeling the Mayor's menacing gaze on him despite the stun effect.\nThe Mayor's eyes held a twisted glee, even as he growled, \"Another bad guest.\"\nEven stunned, the Mayor managed to speak and move slightly.\nShock had never encountered such resistance against his stun before; it wasn't supposed to happen.\nCEO sprang forward, seizing the key from around the Mayor's neck.\nNot willing to waste a moment, he fired another beam at the Mayor's arm to prevent him from retaliating.\nThe Mayor instinctively blocked with his fork, barely holding off the blast.\nShock ceased his Ion Pulse, stumbling back with fatigue.\nThe two exchanged a look, and without a word, bolted for the door.\nAs they sprinted through the dark hallways, the Mayor's laughter echoed after them. \"So it's a game of cat and mouse, then?\" He flicked his wrist, summoning another knife to his hand.\nThey dashed through the corridor, twisting around corners in a frantic bid to escape.\nCEO held the basement key tightly, his mind racing through potential escape routes.\nThere was no time to formulate a solid plan—the Mayor would be right behind them any second.\n\"We need to find a way to trap him,\" CEO muttered as they reached a flight of stairs.\nShock glanced back nervously. \"Do you see the size of this place? Trapping him won't be easy.\"\n\"Then we'll settle for delaying him,\" CEO replied, his voice grim. \"He's toying with us, but he won't take us lightly if we put some distance.\"\nOn the way down, they met up with the [Butlers Trio], which tried to stop them.\n\"Escaping Master M is useless.\"\n\"Master M will catch you.\"\n\"He is toying with you.\"\nThey kept laughing, pointing at CEO and Shock.\n\"WELL, FUCK YOU,\" CEO shouted as he unleashed [Triple Beam], shooting one at every butler, exploding their bodies before they could even say anything else.\nThe two men then dashed forward, noticing that the butlers were already starting to form back, their exploded bodies merging back.\nThey could also hear the footsteps of the Mayor coming for them.\nThere was only one place they could go to at this point: the basement.",

      "content": "Shock and CEO tore down the narrow corridor, hearing the Mayor's slow, taunting footsteps echo from above.\nHis laughter sent chills through their spines, a twisted reminder that he was only toying with them.\n\"COME ON…!\" Shock hissed, practically throwing himself forward.\nHe was mainly saying that to CEO, though, as he was the one holding the key.\nShock would have been much faster, but the businessman wouldn't give the key.\nThey had one mission now—get the basement door open and figure out an exit plan.\nIn front of them, the door leading to the basement loomed, a promise of escape that was already starting to slip through their fingers.\nThey fumbled with the key, hands slick from the adrenaline.\nThe Mayor's laughter grew louder.\n\"Shit… hurry,\" CEO muttered.\nFinally, with a loud click, the door swung open.\n[You have opened the basement.]\n[The exit key is placed beyond the \"Basement Demon.\" You can choose to fight it or try to take the key and run.]\n[Note: Opening the manor door without killing the Basement Demon will unleash it on Termina.]\nShock glanced at CEO, his brow furrowing. \"Doesn't matter. There's already like five of those level 600 monsters roaming around out there. What's one more?\"\nNice thinking, Shock, release something else in addition to Father Hugo, the Altered Ones and Eternal Regret.\n8 participants left, and at this point, already 5 level 600 monsters were on the move.\nBut of course, releasing one more wouldn't make a difference anyway, right?\nThey dashed down the stone steps, the basement spreading out beneath them, wider than they'd expected, dimly lit and filled with a sour, decaying stench.\nFlickering lights cast shadows against the walls, twisting into shapes that seemed to move of their own accord.\nGroans and shuffles echoed, and figures lurked in every corner—a hellish greeting party.\nThey tore through the darkness, ducking and weaving past smaller monsters prowling the basement.\nThese creatures were low-level, practically irrelevant to them, but a distraction they couldn't afford.\nA quick flash of CEO's beams sliced through their ranks, leaving nothing but twitching limbs and the scent of scorched flesh.\nAnd then they saw it: the Basement Demon, a shadowed silhouette that lingered in the farthest reaches of the darkness.\nIts figure was massive, a monstrosity barely visible except for the faint glimmer of light against its grotesque, unblinking eyes.\nAnd at the very back of the room, almost taunting them, hung the exit key on the wall.\nRight before they could reach the key was a massive hallway of darkness: the territory of the demon.\n\"That's our way out,\" Shock muttered.\nBut first, they need to go through the darkness ahead, the face of the basement demon visible beyond, seemingly waiting for them.\nThey could also hear the footsteps of the mayor getting closer.\nShock groaned as he suddenly dashed toward the darkness, but then was immediately stopped by dozens of hands coming out of the walls, blocking him.\n\"AH, FUCK!\" Shock swore, his blade flashing as he slashed through the hands.\nBut he wasn't fast enough; some of the claws dug into his skin, raking down his arms, leaving trails of blood as he pushed on.\nAfter a few seconds, his fingers finally closed around the key.\nHe turned back, only to see the Basement Demon shift, pulling itself out of the shadows.\nIts body was a twisted blend of scales, claws, and muscle, a hulking beast seemingly patched together from nightmares.\nIt roared, the sound like shattering glass and grinding metal, reverberating through the entire basement.\n\"Oh, shit,\" CEO muttered, firing off a beam that blasted part of the creature's hide, though it seemed barely fazed.\nShock was forced to use [Lightning Flash] again to dash from the end of the basement all the way back to CEO.\nBut now, he couldn't be as fast as before.\nThey sprinted, the Basement Demon hot on their trail, claws slashing through the air.\nIt was fast, faster than they'd anticipated, and every time they glanced back, it seemed even closer, its eyes locked on them with a gleeful, malicious hunger.\nAnd then, up ahead, stood the Mayor, still calm, still composed, like he was watching a particularly amusing play unfold.\nHis expression was unreadable, though a glint of satisfaction crossed his eyes as he saw them struggling.\n\"Oh, seems like you unleashed 'it,'\" he chuckled. \"Well, good luck with that.\"\nHe even bowed, stepping to the side.\nShock blinked, barely processing what just happened. \"Uh… what?\"\nThe Mayor smiled, \"I just received some rather interesting news. So, for now, I think I'll sit back and enjoy watching all of you scramble. Do your best to survive.\"\n\"AH, FUCK, I DON'T CARE!\" Shock shouted.\nThe basement demon's guttural snarl echoed from behind, making him practically dive up the stairs, the key clutched tight in his hand as they finally burst out of the basement and up toward the manor's entrance.\nThey skidded to a halt, throwing the door open just as the creature's claws scraped against the steps behind them.\nWith a last glance back at the Mayor, they bolted through, leaving him standing in the hallway, his expression a mix of curiosity and amusement.\nThey left the Manor, but as they did, a message appeared.\n[You have unleashed the \"Basement Demon\" on Termina.]\n[Pray for your survival.]\nThe more time they spent doing random shit, and the more they unleashed these monsters, the harder it would become.\nAnd then, just as they caught their breath outside the manor's gate, another notification rang out.\n[Global Announcement]\nAcross Termina, every player paused, their attention turning to the floating panels in front of them.\nStark and Sora, sitting on the square near the Hollow Tower, looked up, squinting at the message.\nLilith and Clever both opened an eye, glancing up from their places of rest.\nIn the museum, Artist, who had finally managed to steal the coveted [Power Ruby], froze mid-movement.\nEvery single player was glued to the screen, bracing themselves for what might come.\nIt wasn't another death notification, though.\nIt was worse.\n[Global Announcement: All elite monsters have now been unleashed and are roaming Termina. Encountering one is nearly guaranteed death.]\n[Have fun, participants!]\nShock and CEO exchanged a grim look as the announcement ended.\nThey were neck-deep in a trial that was now spiraling out of control.\n[The Basement Demon, Father Hugo, the Altered Ones (Heartless and Tormented), Eternal Regret and the Mayor.]\n[They are all out there now, stalking Termina, each one more bloodthirsty than the last (except the Mayor for now).]\n\"Well,\" Shock exhaled, trying to catch his breath. \"That's... not good.\"\n\"No kidding.\" CEO ran a hand over his face, his usual stoic expression slipping as he stared at the sprawling town before them. \"This whole place is about to turn into a war zone.\"\nAnd somewhere out there, Stark, Sora, Artist, Lilith, Clever—everyone was now on a collision course with these monsters.\nOne slip-up, one wrong turn, and any of them could find themselves staring down one of these elite monsters, facing a near-certain death.\nShock shook his head. \"I'm out of here, didn't plan to be buddy-buddy with you anyway, you fucking maniac.\"\nShock ran away, and CEO just shrugged.\n\"Neither did I.\"\nThey both ran as they didn't want to meet with the [Basement Demon].",

Either Chosen has died, or he used an item that teleported him somewhere.]\nFollower clenched his fist, frustration bubbling under his calm exterior. \"Then bring it back! I don't care how. Just bring the arrow back!\"\n[Impossible. His aura is the key. Unless he uses it again, I won't be able to locate him.]\nThe voice grew colder, almost amused.\n[It's rare to find an aura so filled with raw hatred. It's one of the strongest I've ever sensed.]\nFollower suppressed a snarl.\nStark's aura was supposed to lead him, yet now it slipped through his grasp, leaving him in silence.\nFor now, he'd have to bide his time, he could maybe try to complete his own tasks, or get rid of the other participants/commanders.\nThe weight of loneliness settled in—he despised the company of people as much as he did monsters.\nOnly Godless, the true power in this planet, earned his admiration.\nEveryone else was nothing more than a distraction, and Follower's pulse quickened with the prospect of being rid of them.\nFollower trudged forward, sweeping through a horde of minor creatures, tearing them apart with single-handed strikes, his movements bored yet lethal.\nAnother beast—a twisted, hulking wolf—lunged at him from the shadows, but he dodged with barely a shift of his foot, his eyes glazed with boredom.\n[You should be careful of Chosen,] Godless warned, the voice prickling in his mind.\nA message suddenly appeared in front of Follower.\n\"Hm?\" Follower barely reacted, brushing off the warning.\nIt wasn't the Godless Demon himself speaking, but the curse that he had infused into him using his aura.\n\"Why should I be careful of him, he is far weaker than we are,\" Follower shrugged, nonchalant about it.\nThen, out of nowhere, a message materialized in front of him, the voice deeper now, almost hesitant:\n[Chosen... He's not what he seems.]\nFollower raised an eyebrow, ready to question it further, but was interrupted by a thunderous roar.\nStartled, he glanced toward the direction of the sound, the ground rumbling beneath his feet as it grew louder.\n[Never mind.]\nThe voice cut off abruptly, vanishing as Follower's curiosity peaked.\n\"'Be careful'?\" he echoed, still half-distracted by the warning, \"of Chosen?\"\nHe followed the direction of the noise, moving swiftly between alleyways until he caught sight of the source: a massive, monstrous beast roughly the size of a car, its claws digging deep into the ground as it fought a lone figure.\nHis eyes narrowed as he recognized both the beast and its opponent.\n[Basement Demon], the creature's name blazed above it in crimson letters.\nThis was the same creature that had recently escaped from the mayor's mansion.\nAcross from it, a lean, elderly man stood in place, facing the monster.\nFollower didn't know him well enough, but there was no doubt this was Clever, the old, unassuming participant who, despite his frail appearance, radiated an aura of cold calculation.\nClever's silhouette was backlit by a golden glow, which took the form of a towering, serene statue of a woman, her arms folded in rest.\nIt had at least a hundred arms, each golden hand gracefully poised as if waiting to be called into action, her main arms grouped in a prayer, and her eyes closed.\nThe statue was at least three times the size of a skyscraper, by the way.\nFollower watched, transfixed.\nWith a single motion from Clever, the statue's hands came to life, following his every command.\nThe old man didn't even need to do anything other than clasp his hands together in some sort of prayer, mimicking the statue's pose to command it, the dozens of hands slamming down and blocking every attack.\nEach hit from the golden hands sent shockwaves echoing through the streets, creating deep fissures in the ground.\n[This guy is dangerous.]\n\"Obviously,\" Follower replied under his breath, watching as Clever effortlessly controlled his golden guardian.\nFollower knew instantly—if he tried to face this man, he'd be overpowered.\n[This guy is... don't fight him.]\n[No matter what.]\n\"Fighting him is not worth it anyway,\" Follower shook his head, \"I'll watch.\"\nThe [Basement Demon], which had been named as one of the strongest beasts of this trial, a level 600 monster that could cause havoc in the real world, even going as far as destroying whole cities, was currently being fought by Clever alone.\nAnd yet, that old man didn't seem scared.\nIn fact, his eyes weren't opened either.\nHe didn't move at all as all the arms and hands of his giant golden status did the work.\nThe monster clawed and screeched, but each of its attacks was met by the golden statue's massive hands, crushing its defenses.\nSLAM! SLAM! SLAM!\nThe relentless barrage echoed across the city, each strike widening the cracks in the ground.\nThe Basement Demon stumbled, its body bruised and bleeding, its monstrous strength crumbling under the assault.\n\"Guess I'll need to adjust my rankings,\" Follower muttered, watching in awe as Clever's powers unfolded before him.\nIn his mind, he made a note:\nFollower could barely believe Clever's strength.\nThough they were in a level 100 trial, Clever was operating on a completely different plane.\n[Clever - Level 156]\nThis old man could take on level 700 monsters if he wanted, maybe a bit more thanks to his abilities.\nBecause right now, Clever was quite literally only using his basic skills.\n[Hand Slam], [Golden Chop], and [Hand Synchro] were the skills he was using among the 25 he currently had.\nIt made no sense for this old man to even be here.\nIn fact...\n[That old man has an Immortal-Level skill.]\nClever had a skill from the highest category.\nA skill so powerful it could possibly rival Stark's [Heaven's Spears].\n[Follower's Power Ranking:]\n[1. Clever]\n[2. Follower]\n[3. CEO]\n[4. Artist]\n[5. Shock]\n[6. ??? (Girl that didn't tell her name)]\n[7. Chosen.]\n[8. Sora.]\nThis was the power ranking he made, and he gradually changed it as he saw the others unleash more abilities.\nChosen was last because he was one of the weakest, the only problem was the [Angel of the Spear] that was protecting him.\nHe would need to find a way to get through that.\nMeanwhile, with a final, devastating blow, Clever's golden statue slammed one of its hands down, slicing the Basement Demon cleanly in half.\nThe creature let out one last, anguished roar before collapsing, its body lifeless as the remains sizzled in the dirt.\n[Global Announcement: \"Basement Demon\" has been killed by \"Clever!\"]\nFollower took a breath, glancing around to see if other participants had been drawn by the noise.\nBut the streets remained silent.\nThe other players had work of their own and, for now, stayed distant.\nClever, however, didn't seem fazed by the announcement.\nHe finally exhaled, dispelling his aura, causing the golden statue to dissipate as he cracked his neck with a faint sigh. \"This trial's too easy.\"\nFollower narrowed his eyes, his curiosity piqued as Clever muttered under his breath.\nClever could probably take care of the [Crimson Moons] that stopped them from leaving by himself, and with his basic attacks too.\nThe other participants were an eyesore, and none of them, except for Chosen, had actually interested him enough.\n\"This whole thing isn't even a challenge,\" Clever continued, a slight smile touching his lips. \"I might just kill them all and be done with it.\"\nThe other participants were an eyesore, and none of them, except for Chosen, had actually interested him enough.\n\"Maybe I'll save Chosen for last,\" Clever mused to himself, his gaze turning towards the center of Termina, where the other participants roamed. \"But first… a little rest.\"\nA [Moonscorched Cure] had appeared in his hands, and he instantly used it, curing him from his conditions.\nThe only reason he had been infected in the first place was because he actually allowed the monster to hit him, just to see how it felt.\nClever's skill with his golden arms and statue meant he could summon them in less than a second, rendering any ambush futile.\nHe didn't even need his eyes open to sense an attack.\nAs he resumed his calm, leisurely walk through the ruined cityscape, Follower remained transfixed, every instinct urging him to stay out of Clever's path.\n\"This is insane,\" Follower's pupils were shaking in place.\nHe wanted to kill, he wanted to shed blood.\nBut it would be impossible to kill this guy, there was no chance anyone could do anything, even if all the monsters, commanders, and participants of this trial joined together.\nIn the end, your [Domination] powers are the result of luck.\nClever's power was named [100-Golden Arms Statue], and it must be among the top 10 strongest domination powers in the entire world.\nWhy the hell did he end up in this trial? It wasn't fair!\nMaybe it was to give them all a chance to actually win by killing every enemy, then the moons?\nWho knows...\n\"That guy is the most dangerous, I'll need to be more careful than I thought,\" Follower turned around, but not before eyeing the remains of the [Basement Demon], who wasn't even able to get close to Clever.\nBut suddenly... right as he thought of that...\n[No.]\nFollower stiffened, feeling Godless' consciousness grow colder and sharper.\n[Clever isn't the most dangerous here.]\n\"What?\"\nIt was the consciousness of the godless demon speaking, meaning that he could detect auras and powers.\nHe couldn't deny Clever was powerful.\nBut... power isn't everything.\n\"Who could possibly be more dangerous?\"\n[Chosen.]\n[No one is as dangerous as Chosen. His hatred, his aura, his potential... they are unlike anything in this world.]\nFollower's breath hitched, and he swallowed hard.\nThe command in the voice left no room for interpretation.\n[Stop him while he is in his weakened state, no matter what.]\nFollower clenched his fists, feeling a thrill surge through his veins.\n\"Yes, Master Godless.\" He turned, determination hardening his gaze.\nStark, weakened or not, would not escape his wrath.",

But Sora's was climbing fast.\nNot fast enough to actually be an issue, though, as each minute would grant you around 1% of moonscorch.\n\"We can't stay here much longer. We have to get somewhere else,\" Stark said. \"There'll be something out there that can help us.\"\nEvery participant was growing stronger, and they couldn't be the only one just sitting there doing nothing.\nShe nodded, standing straighter as they scanned the path ahead.\nBut then, out of the silence of the Hollow Square, dozens of monsters roaming around, a voice called out.\n\"Well, I didn't expect to see anyone here.\"\nStark and Sora turned, and there she was—a red-haired girl with a relaxed, easygoing smile, nothing like her meditative state back in the village square.\nThe girl from before, the one who hadn't bothered to share her name.\n\"Oh, it's you,\" Stark muttered, watching her carefully.\nShe grinned, her red hair glowing in the dim light, and waved. \"Yeah, I was wondering if you'd remember me. Chosen and Sora, right?\"\nThey exchanged a glance. Stark had a feeling she wasn't here by chance.\n\"What do you want?\" Sora was the one who spoke, seemingly protective of Stark.\nNo one would dare approach Chosen and Sora, the number one enemies of this trial.\nEveryone, even Clever, knew that angering Stark could result in getting hit by a spear capable of destroying entire cities.\nSo, no thank you!\n\"The name's Lilith, and I'm just like you: aiming for the moons,\" she said cheerfully, \"You are the only duo left, everyone else is solo, so they probably all plan to kill each other.\"\nThe ease in her tone caught Stark off guard, especially after seeing how silent and calm she'd been before. \"You didn't seem too talkative back in the village,\" he pointed out.\n\"Yeah, well, that was me in my [Meditation] state,\" she said with a shrug, \"Helps me keep my skills up, tune out distractions. But I don't mind company once in a while.\"\nIt was strange seeing someone so relaxed, almost cheerful, in this bleak place.\nStark sized her up.\nBut he couldn't trust anybody.\n\"Mind if I ask what level you are?\" Stark said, his voice casual, but his [Focus] skill activating just in case.\n\"Level 136,\" she replied, looking him dead in the eye. \"Just enough to take down a level 600 elite boss on my own. Still want me on the team?\"\nSora's eyes widened slightly, and even Stark was impressed, though he hid it well.\nA level 600 elite boss on her own?\nThat was pretty much like taking out a commander.\nShe was stronger than Stark, no denying it.\nBut this meant a higher chance of betrayal.\n'Flower Analysis,' Sora mumbled, and dozens of flowers came out of the ground, stopping right in front of her ears, whispering things to her.\nStark was about to refuse the invitation.\nBut before he could say anything.\n\"She can be trusted, I believe,\" Sora spoke, nodding.\n\"...\" Stark was confused as to why Sora would suddenly say that, but he trusted her, \"Alright, you can join... for now.\"\nBut to be safe, he activated [Flow], focusing on her for ten seconds, enabling the ability that allowed him to track her every movement one second before she made them.\nHe then used [Target Set] from his [Focus] skill to pinpoint her location.\nNo way was he was letting her wander out of his sight unnoticed.\nWith these two things, there was no chance she could ambush him.\nPlus, he always had his second life in case he needed it.\n\"Let's head out,\" he said after a moment, leading the way out of the Hollow Square. \"We're going wherever we feel like.\"\n\"No problemo,\" Lilith winked while making a small ok sign with her hand.\nStark didn't know who she was, and her appearance was too sudden for his taste, but at the end of the day, if Sora said it was okay, then so be it.\nLilith was extremely beautiful, her long red hair reaching her waist, and her crimson eyes always flaring with aura.\nThere was some kind of tension around her wherever she went, and she was undeniably powerful.\nWhether she was an ally or a future traitor, it didn't matter to Stark.\nIf he got killed, he would revive and instantly use [Heaven's Spear].\nNo one knew of his revives besides the one of [Crimson Healing], so it didn't matter.\nAs they made their way through the eerily quiet streets, Lilith chatted with Sora, their conversation casual, almost too casual for the tension all around them.\nStark kept an eye on them, but Lilith seemed genuinely friendly, if a bit enigmatic.\nThere was no denying her confidence.\nBut there was also something about her that Stark couldn't quite put his finger on.\nOn the way to their next location, Lilith showed incredible power: she could fly, use her energy, beams, magic swords, everything, basically.\nHer [Qi Aura], which she got from the [Domination Talent] was something she could use to make almost anything.\n[Name: Lilith]\n[Domination Talent: Cultivation]\nIt was yet another top 10 strongest domination talents.\nAnd of course, it was normal: this trial regrouped the strongest at their level, so no wonder.\nLilith even managed to take down a level 550 elite by herself, not allowing Stark and Sora to act under the pretext of \"let me show you what I can do\".\nStark kept noting every single skill she used in his mind, though, in case they ever fought.\n...\nAn hour later.\nTheir moonscorch infection was getting pretty high, and so they needed to find another safe zone.\n[Most safe zones in Termina are destroyed by now, you need to find one inside of a specific structure.]\nKnowing that, the trio soon approached the [Temple District], the path ahead marked by grand pillars and massive, ancient carvings.\nThe towering stone structures loomed over them, casting long shadows across the ground.\nStark couldn't shake the feeling that something dangerous lay ahead.\nBut Sora's moonscorch rate was at 94%, so he needed to be quick.\n\"I'm sure there's a safe zone inside,\" Lilith nodded, optimistic.\nShe was actually the only one not moonscorched for some reason.\nUnlike Clever, the idea of being touched by these beasts disgusted her, and so she didn't test it out.\n\"Probably, just make sure to be quick,\" Stark replied, glancing at Sora's display, her infection still ticking up.\nHe quickened his pace, leading them toward the central structure.\nThe entrance to the temple loomed before them, its doors partially opened as if inviting them in.\nThe air inside was still, a stark contrast to the chaos they had left behind in the orphanage and Hollow Square.\n\"Just for your info, every place you enter locks itself behind you,\" Stark informed Lilith, \"We'll probably have to complete a task or something.\"\n\"Hm... no problem, I'll help,\" Lilith shrugged, unbothered.\nBut as soon as they stepped into the vast hall, Stark's instincts flared.\nHe immediately sensed a presence ahead, something ominous and overpowering.\nAnd then they saw him.\nA massive figure knelt at the center of the room, his back turned to them, head bowed in prayer.\nThe aura around him was cold and merciless, filling the room with a suffocating pressure.\nStark's breath hitched as the name and level appeared above the figure's head.\n[Father Hugo - Level 600]\nA chill washed over him.\nHe'd barely survived their last encounter.\nAnd here he was, praying as if waiting for their arrival.\n\"OH COME ON!\" Stark shouted, instinctively shifting into a defensive stance, \"That guy is pretty much stalking us at this point!\"\nSora's face went pale, and even Lilith's relaxed demeanor tensed as she took in the threat before them.\nFather Hugo slowly rose, turning toward them, a smirk playing across his lips.\n\"Children... I found bad children to play with...\"\nHis gaze held the cold confidence of someone who knew he was invincible, towering above them in his moonscorched form.\nThat thing could roam through the entire city, but the first thing it did was head to the [Temple]?\nStark almost wanted to say he was a good priest, but that would be too good for such a disgusting being.\n\"I had hoped you'd come,\" he murmured, his voice carrying through the vast hall. \"You saved me a lot of trouble children.\"\nStark's grip tightened, his mind racing through every skill he had.\nThis wouldn't be like before.\nHe'd barely scraped by last time, and Sora wasn't in a better state than he was.\nClick!\n[Door of the temple has been locked!]\n[There are no tasks in the temple as they have been removed for this occasion!]\n\"Are you serious?\" this trial was pretty much toying with them.\n[The only way to leave is to kill Father Hugo.]\n[Good luck!]\n\"Stark… can we even…?\" Sora's voice was barely a whisper, her eyes locked on the massive figure.\n\"We don't have a choice,\" Stark replied, his voice steady.\nHe activated his aura, the thought of retreating didn't even cross his mind anymore.\nNot with Father Hugo standing between them alone now.\nPreviously, there was [Eternal Regret] to take care of too, but now, he was alone.\nLilith stepped forward, her usual cheer replaced by a fierce, determined glare.\nHer aura flared, a wild, almost feral energy emanating from her as she pulled out two swords made out of blue QI.\n\"Well, then,\" she said, her voice a low growl, \"looks like I'll have a bit of fun after all.\"\nFather Hugo's smile widened as he raised one hand, summoning a swirling mass of dark energy.\nStark could feel the weight of his power, every fiber in his being screaming to run, but he held firm, focused on every movement, every second that ticked by.\nFather Hugo let out a laugh, a sound that echoed through the temple as if mocking their determination.\n\"Come, then. Show me what makes you think you can survive, or maybe... you want to run just like last time, little rabbits?\"\nStark, Sora, and Lilith didn't wait another second.\nThey lunged forward, their combined auras blazing.",

      "content": "Father Hugo appeared in the doorway, towering and dark, his eyes glowing a sickly yellow that barely lit the shadows around his face.\nStark used [Perception] immediately, the details of Father Hugo's stats flooding his mind.\n[Name: Father Hugo, Moonscorch Commander (Immortal)]\n[Level: 600]\n[HP: 8,000,000]\n[Strength: 34,127]\n[Stamina: 17,853]\n[Speed: 8,632]\n[Defense: 37,249]\n[Skills: Correction Smash, Divine Wrath, Holy Bind, Redemption Beam, Aura Suppression, Soul Cleaver, Sacred Ground, Iron Fist, Celestial Judgment (Mythical), Punishment, Blessed Chains (Mythical), Salvation's Edge, Abyssal Silence (Mythical), Test of Faith (Godly), Penitent's Fury, Martyr's Barrier (Godly), Return to Sender (Immortal)]\n...\nStark swallowed.\n\"He's level six hundred…\" he already knew that, but the stats and skills looked too powerful for his taste.\nAnd he had an [Immortal] level skill, which is the highest rank.\nFather Hugo's gaze shifted to him, a slow smirk tugging at his lips as his fists began to glow with a golden light.\nThe power radiating from him was almost unbearable, pressing on Stark, Sora, and Lilith like a physical weight.\nStark clenched his fists and summoned [Asura's Arms].\nWith a burst of crimson energy, four powerful, aura-infused arms materialized around him, each one crackling with barely-contained force.\n\"Alright,\" he muttered, more to himself. \"Let's go.\"\n[3...]\nFather Hugo cracked his fingers and neck.\n[2...]\n\"Bad children will be disciplined.\"\n[1...]\n\"I'll use your bodies and hang them around the temple.\"\n[FIGHT!]\nLilith shot forward with a speed that made her almost invisible.\nIn a flash, her [Celestial Blades] appeared, dual swords of shimmering qi, and she launched a rapid strike.\nShe slashed at Father Hugo, but his [Martyr's Barrier] flared up, blocking her blades with ease.\nHis eyes gleamed as he turned to her, and with a swift motion, he swung his hand to deliver a punishing [Correction Smash].\nLilith managed to dodge at the last second, twisting mid-air and landing on her feet just outside the range of the strike.\nShe avoided the [Moonscorch] effect.\nThe impact left a deep crater in the floor, cracks spidering outward as Father Hugo's fist crushed the ground.\n\"Lilith, keep your distance!\" Sora shouted, her hands already weaving vines.\nWith a sweep of her arm, she summoned [Vine Surge], roots and plants bursting from the ground to wrap around Father Hugo's legs. \"We need to slow him down!\"\nFather Hugo chuckled, his laughter deep and chilling. \"You think such pitiful attempts will hold me?\"\nWith a burst of energy, his [Aura Suppression] flared, and the vines withered and snapped under the sheer pressure of his aura.\nSeeing the vines break, Stark sprang into action, using his speed to maneuver around Hugo, dodging the wild swings of his iron-clad fists with [Invincible Dodge].\n[Perfect Dodge]\nThis slowed time just enough for Stark to glimpse Hugo's movements, allowing him to counter with his own attacks.\nOne of Stark's aura fists lunged forward, crashing into Hugo's side with enough force to send a shockwave through the room.\nHugo staggered, momentarily caught off-guard.\n-11,849!\nLow damage.\nBut he quickly recovered, smiling, \"Nice one, child.\"\nLilith took the opening, using [Dragon's Breath] to unleash a blazing stream of energy directly into his face.\nThe flames seared Hugo's skin, leaving charred marks across his face and neck.\n\"...\"\n-4,384! -7,371!\nBut Hugo barely flinched again, his defense and magic resistance too high.\n\"Is that all?\" he sneered, his eyes gleaming with a twisted satisfaction.\nHe raised his arm, summoning [Celestial Judgment].\nA massive, glowing blade of divine energy formed in his hand, radiating a blinding light.\n\"Watch out!\" Stark yelled.\nHugo swung the blade down with immense force, aiming at Sora.\nShe threw up her [Flower Barrier] just in time, the translucent shield taking the brunt of the strike.\nBut the barrier shattered instantly, sending her flying backward.\nShe hit the ground hard, gasping for air.\n-32,834!\nThat thing does high damage, and takes little to none.\nHow was this fair.\nHe was comparable to a level 750 normal monster.\n\"The moonscorch is the true way to strength,\" Hugo laughed, \"Join me.\"\n\"Alright, that's enough!\" Stark growled, pushing himself to his limits.\nHe combined his six aura arms and lifted them up, then he concentrated on his [Aura Smash], merging of all his fists into a giant one.\n\"Fool,\" Hugo laughed, \"Martyr's Barrier!\"\nThe crimson fist collided with Hugo's barrier, it was the thing that allowed him to endure so much and receive so little damage.\nBut...\n\"FUCK YOU!\"\nRight as the fist was about to collide, Stark overused his aura on the fist.\nBOOOM!\nAnd it exploded right as it was about to reach Hugo.\nThis wasn't one of his [Aura Smash] perks, not at all: he just made it in the moment after knowing from the orphanage chase that no projectiel would work.\nThe fist exploded, sending Hugo flying across the room and slamming him into the far wall.\nCRACK!\nAnd the [Martier's Barrier] cracked a little.\nIt didn't break, but it was progress.\nFor a moment, the room was silent, dust swirling around the area where Hugo had crashed.\n-37,939!\nBut then, a low, sinister laugh echoed from the debris.\nHugo stood up, brushing dust from his shoulders, not even fazed.\nHis eyes locked onto Stark. \"Impressive... but futile.\"\nHe raised his hand, summoning [Blessed Chains].\nGlowing, divine chains shot out from his palm, homing in on Sora with terrifying accuracy.\nShe tried to dodge, but the chains adjusted mid-air, wrapping around her limbs and binding her tightly.\n\"NO!\" Stark yelled, rushing forward, but Hugo raised a hand, his aura flaring with a golden light. \"[Sacred Ground].\"\nA dome of divine energy surrounded Sora, blocking Stark's path as the chains tightened around her.\nShe struggled, but the chains sapped her strength, glowing brighter with each passing second.\nSora's eyes widened as her energy drained rapidly, and her movements slowed until she finally went limp.\n[Sora is knocked out!]\n\"This dome is unbreakable,\" Hugo laughed, \"Good luck saving her.\"\nBAM! BAM! BAM!\nStark tried to hit the dome with everything he had, using all of his fists, but as Hugo said, it didn't even budge.\n'Damn it... I would have to use EGO's Negation...' he thought, but he didn't want to do that now.\n[EGO Meter: 100/100]\n\"Your struggle is worthless,\" Hugo sneered, his voice cold and mocking. \"Bow before the authority of the Moonscorch.\"\nFury boiling within him, Stark activated [Crimson Purification].\nA shockwave of crimson holy energy burst from his body, flooding the room.\nThe energy clashed against Hugo, but he wasn't phased.\n\"I am quite literally unaffected by holy attacks,\" he shrugged, \"It's obvious, isn't it?\"\n\"...Yeah, it kind of is.\"\nBut that wasn't why he did that.\nBeside him, Lilith raised her hand while flying with [QI Flight], and unleashed [Divine Energy Spear].\nA colossal spear of pure qi formed in her hand, radiating divine blue energy.\nWith all her might, she hurled it at Hugo.\n'Not as strong as mine, though,' Stark noticed.\nThe spear headed toward Hugo, but right as it was about to hit his barrier, the priest quite literally just grabbed it with his hands.\n\"Hm,\" and just like last time, he broke it in half, \"That's all?\"\n\"STOP DOING THAT,\" Stark was growing more angry every attack Hugo casually dodged or shrugged off.\nHe seized the moment, summoning all ten of his [Crimson Spears].\nThey hovered around him, each one glowing with a fierce, red energy.\nThen he sent them hurtling toward Hugo, each spear striking with deadly precision.\n\"Aura Supression,\" Hugo put both of his hands together, closing his eyes, and a transparent shockwave was sent through the temple.\nAnd the exact moment he did that...\nBAM!\n\"Huh?\" Lilith's [QI Flight] was cancelled, resulting in her falling down, forcing Stark to grab her.\nIn addition to that, all of Stark's spears were reduced to nothing.\nBut of course, it couldn't end so easily.\n\"Return to Sender... Initiation...\" Father Hugo was using his strongest skill now.\nEven for such strong foes, using Immortal-Level skills was a difficult task, and Hugo was concentrating as hard as he could, drops of sweats appearing on his bald forehead.\n\"Your efforts are wasted,\" he said coldly. \"You cannot stand against the Moonscorch.\"\n\"Not yet,\" Stark muttered, clenching his fists, his aura flaring, \"I'm gonna murder you...\"\nBut then...\n\"RETURN TO SENDER!\"\nFather Hugo finalized the usage of his strongest skill.\nVictory was now impossible.",

      "content": "Father Hugo's laughter echoed in the temple as the dark, crimson, and blue auras swirled around him.\nThe air grew thick with a mix of intense energy, twisting and melding into something that looked both holy and corrupted.\nHe begun hovering a few feet above the ground, his expression one of twisted delight.\n\"Look at this power!\" Hugo's voice boomed, his eyes glinting with an unsettling joy. He raised his hand, allowing the combined auras to dance along his arm. \"Your strength, your skills—they're now mine!\"\nStark's fists tightened, his gaze fixed on Hugo's smug expression. The realization hit hard: Hugo had just absorbed [Crimson Spears] and [QI Flight].\nThey were staring down an even more monstrous version of the priest than before.\n\"Can't believe it…\" Stark muttered, gritting his teeth.\nHe could still feel his connection to his skills, but seeing them twisted in Hugo's hands felt like a violation.\nLilith, by his side, looked equally horrified as Hugo raised one of his newly copied spears, its crimson glow matching Stark's.\n\"QI flight!\" Lilith used her skill, and it seemed as though she could still use it.\n'So he copied it...' Stark thought.\n\"You've both proven quite entertaining,\" Hugo said, his voice dripping with arrogance. \"But playtime is over.\"\nWith a smirk, Hugo summoned ten [Crimson Spears], their familiar red glow casting ominous shadows across the walls.\nHe held them around himself, the ease and familiarity he displayed making it clear he'd instantly mastered Stark's ability.\nHugo waved his hand, sending the spears hurtling toward Stark and Lilith with terrifying speed.\n\"Dodge!\" Stark shouted, leaping to the side.\nHe summoned his own [Crimson Spears], countering with his own barrage to intercept Hugo's.\nThe two volleys of spears collided in mid-air, sending shockwaves throughout the temple.\nThe ground beneath them cracked and trembled from the impact, each explosion adding more destruction to the temple.\nLilith took advantage of the chaos, darting forward with [Flash Step], her swords materializing with a shimmering glow as she lunged at Hugo.\nHer blade met Hugo's arm, which was shielded by his barrier.\n\"You can't touch me,\" Hugo taunted, his voice dripping with mockery.\nLilith glared, raising her hand to summon another [Divine Energy Spear].\nShe hurled it toward Hugo, but he countered with Stark's [Spear Block], deflecting it away as if it were nothing.\nStark watched in frustration, feeling the depth of Hugo's mastery over his stolen abilities.\nThen Hugo raised his arm high, his eyes locked onto Stark with a twisted grin.\nStark felt the surge of energy even before he saw it—a colossal spear forming in Hugo's hand.\nThe weapon radiated a raw, overwhelming power.\n\"Oh no…\" Stark's eyes widened as he recognized his own [Spear of Judgment].\nHugo was using one of his strongest abilities, a colossal spear that could shatter even the toughest defenses, and also followed the target no matter what.\nBut strangely enough, he didn't actually throw it at Stark or Lilith.\nWith a dark smile, Hugo lifted the spear high above his head and then, with a forceful downward swing, slammed it into the temple floor.\nThe ground buckled and shattered, splitting open as the spear's impact reverberated through the entire room.\nCracks shot out in all directions as the floor gave way.\n\"Get down!\" Stark shouted, reaching out to grab Lilith's arm as the ground collapsed beneath them.\nThey fell, tumbling through the crumbling stone and landing hard in the [Underground Temple] below.\n\"Just how many fucking buildings have underground zones?!\" Stark shouted as he fell.\nThe air was thick with dust, and Stark pushed himself up, coughing as he tried to get his bearings.\nThe dimly lit underground chamber stretched out before them, with ancient pillars and worn-out symbols etched into the walls.\nSomewhere in the darkness, Hugo's mocking laughter echoed.\n\"Well, well,\" Hugo's voice sneered from above as he floated down, his silhouette barely visible through the dust. \"Welcome to the depths, children. Let's make this even more enjoyable.\"\nStark got to his feet, eyes narrowing as he watched Hugo descend, the stolen [QI Flight] making him hover effortlessly.\nLilith was right beside him, her breathing heavy but her eyes still fierce with determination.\n\"We need a plan,\" she whispered. \"This place is smaller—there's less room to dodge.\"\nThey were in a circle arena under the temple, and the hole was so big it was impossible to get back up, even using [Crimson Ball Transmission].\nThey were stuck now, with no exit on sight.\nStark nodded, glancing around at the columns and walls. \"Yeah, but maybe we can use that to our advantage.\"\nBefore they could coordinate any further, Hugo raised his hand, calling forth more [Crimson Spears].\nThis time, they were tinged with a faint, dark aura that seemed to taint the crimson glow, making them even more menacing.\nHe let them loose while flying around, sending a relentless rain of spears toward the two.\nStark and Lilith dove behind one of the large stone pillars, the spears slamming into it with explosive force, cracking and splintering the ancient stone.\nAs the dust cleared, Stark darted out from cover.\nHe lunged forward, focusing all his strength as he aimed for Hugo's head.\nBut just as his fist was about to connect, Hugo activated blocked with [Iron Fists], both of his arms turning silver.\n\"Didn't think you could actually hit me, did you?\" Hugo taunted, delivering a counterstrike that sent Stark stumbling backward.\n[Moonscorch infection increased.]\nLilith took advantage of the opening, flying upward with her [QI Flight] and launching herself at Hugo with her twin blades.\nShe moved with impressive speed, her attacks swift and precise, but Hugo matched her move for move, wielding his many skills with an eerie familiarity.\nBut then...\nStark made a second mistake.\n\"DOUBLE ASSAULT,\" he was getting tired of this bullshit, and so he decided to activate his skill, doubling his stats and aura for 20 seconds, \"ALRIGHT, HUGO, AVOID THIS!\"\nStark was ready to dash, his speed surely enough to instantly overpower Hugo.\nBut that was when he made his second mistake: and it was to assume Father Hugo couldn't use his Immortal Perk again.\n\"Aura Suppression...\" He allowed a hit from Lilith to place his palms together.\nFWISH!\nAnd Stark's aura was taken straight out of him again.\nIt didn't cancel his own [Double Assault], but he had a bad feeling.\n\"RETURN TO SENDER...!\" Hugo's eyes opened, and his dark aura completely took over his body, \"DOUBLE ASSAULT!\"\nHe used the skill too, and suddenly, right as Lilith was about to swing at him, he moved to fast it almost looked like he disappeared.\n\"Thanks for the skill, child,\" Hugo appeared before Stark, punching him in the gut and sending him flying backward.\n\"GARGH,\" even with his own [Double Assault], Stark struggled to stay in place.\n-43,839!\nHis defense was doubled, but Hugo's attack was as well.\n\"Stay put, I'll deal with you last,\" Father Hugo grinned before disappearing from view.\nThat exchange lasted less than a second, and so it meant was still in the air, confused as to where Hugo could have gone.\n\"Hello, there, child,\" he smashed her down.\n[You have been infected with moonscorch.]\nAnd he didn't waste any time in appearing behind her again as she looked up.\n\"You are slow, child.\"\nLilith, even though she was level 137, couldn't understand how this was possible.\nHer eyes widened before she received another punch in the face.\nWhat followed was a complete beatdown.\nLilith gasped as the combined assault tore through her defenses.\nShe tried to dodge, but the energy struck her squarely, sending her crashing into the wall.\nShe slumped to the ground, blood trickling from the corner of her mouth.\n[HP: 37,374/232,000]\n\"Lilith!\" Stark yelled, rushing toward her, but Hugo stepped between them, blocking his path with a sneer.\n\"No interruptions,\" Hugo mocked. \"It's time she learned what happens when you defy the Moonscorch.\"\nHe raised his hand, his aura flaring as he activated [Blessed Chains] again.\nGlowing chains shot out, wrapping around Lilith's limbs, holding her in place as she struggled against them.\nHer strength faded as the chains tightened, draining her energy.\n\"Stark...\" Lilith mumbled, smiling, \"Kick that guy's ass...\"\nHe didn't know Lilith for long, not even two hours actually, but even then, he was mad.\n\"Let her go!\" Stark shouted, fury igniting within him.\nHe charged forward, but Hugo casually extended one hand, using [Sacred Ground] to summon a wall of crimson energy that threw Stark backward.\nHugo turned his gaze back to Lilith, his expression darkening as he increased the power of his chains.\nHer struggles grew weaker, her breaths shallow as the chains squeezed the life out of her.\n\"You… will… break,\" Hugo whispered, his voice cold and merciless.\nLilith's eyes widened in terror as she felt her energy slipping away, her vision blurring.\n[Lilith has been knocked out!]\n\"I like to make sure the children are aware of the torture, a slow death isn't beautiful, after all,\" Hugo laughed as he turned back toward Stark, \"You are the last one.\"\n\"I'll kick your ass alone, I don't need anybody else anyway,\" Stark's expression turned cold, positioning himself for what was next.",

At least she'd made it.\nA few feet away, Lilith's body was sprawled on the ground, her energy completely drained.\nStark barely knew her, but she'd helped him fight, and that was enough for him.\nFor a 3v1 battle, Father Hugo had completely wiped them out.\nThe fact that Hugo had managed this said everything about his power.\nMaybe Hugo was as strong as the moon trio themselves?\nNo, Stark shook his head. No way.\n\"Child, let us continue,\" Hugo's voice echoed, cold and mocking.\nHe lifted his arm, summoning a spear glowing with raw, ominous energy.\nIt was [Spear of Judgment], a move Stark owned.\nHugo's laugh boomed as he raised it. \"Or do you no longer have the strength?\"\n\"Not going to fly anymore?\" Stark asked, deadpan.\n\"I can't,\" Hugo shrugged, unbothered.\nStark quickly pieced it together: Hugo could only use stolen abilities if the original user was actively using them.\nThat was why Hugo had only been able to take his [Crimson Spears] and [Double Assault] earlier.\nAn unconscious person meant he couldn't do it anymore.\nStark needed to be careful of what he used.\nOr at least, that is what the him 5 minutes ago would say.\nBut now?

Fwish!\nThe two massive, crimson spears hurtled through the air, colliding with an explosive shockwave before shooting upward.\n\"What the?\" Stark was confused, was that a normal reaction.\nOr maybe the fact the spears followed one another resulted in a constant loop of going up.\nBOOM!\nThe impact shattered what remained of the temple ceiling, revealing the sky above.\nStark saw the two colossal crimson moons, each with a singular eye, glaring down at him.\nBut as soon as his gaze met theirs, they fled, vanishing into the night.\n\"Cowards,\" Stark muttered, his focus returning to Hugo.\n\"Alright, Hugo,\" he said. \"Copy this.\"\nStark drew his energy from deep within, channeling every bit of his aura into a single, destructive move.\nHe knew what he was about to attempt was reckless, but he was far past the point of caring.\n\"Heaven's Spear!\"\nA dark rift tore open in the sky, spilling forth a radiant, towering angelic figure nearly fifty kilometers high.\nThe being hovered, massive and imposing, its white, ethereal wings stretching across the horizon.\nWith a slow, deliberate movement, it raised an enormous spear of pure crimson energy, its size capable of leveling entire cities.\nStark couldn't help but feel a surge of confidence—until he looked at Hugo.\nThe man was grinning, his eyes filled with twisted satisfaction.\nA second rift appeared beside Stark's, this one inky black, as Hugo summoned his own angelic figure—a shadowy, warped imitation of Stark's.\nThis one wielded a dark spear, crackling with a vile energy.\nThe two divine beings faced off, each with their spears raised high, awaiting their masters' commands.\n\"You think you're special, child?\" Hugo sneered. \"You're nothing but another pawn.\"\nStark clenched his fists. He didn't respond. Talking wouldn't do any good here, not with someone like Hugo.\nSuddenly, Hugo leapt forward, fists blazing as he tried to catch Stark off guard.\nStark met him, and the two clashed, exchanging brutal blows.\nEach punch shook the ground beneath them, sending shockwaves through the already crumbling temple.\nStark's anger was allowing him to actively compete with Hugo in terms ot physical strength, his eyes leaving a trail of crimson aura as he moved.\n\"YOU'RE GOING TO DIE, HUGO, YOU KNOW IT!\" Stark punched the air so fast that even though Hugo blocked with his arms, he was still stumbling back.\n-17,948!\n\"Heh, getting stronger, I see,\" the priest laughed.\nAt last, Hugo's dark angel began to move.\nHe was ready to strike.\nWith a menacing grin, Hugo pointed at Stark. \"It's time,\" he said coldly, directing his angel to hurl its spear down toward them.\n\"Come on, dark angel, show them who's the king.\"\n[Very well, you damn fucking idiot.]\n\"???\"\nThe air around them grew heavy, thick with energy as the spear hurtled toward the earth.\nThe shockwave alone was enough to make the ground beneath Stark's feet tremble.\n\"Holy shit!\" Shock gasped while fighting monsters, \"STARK IS...\"\n\"There's two of them?\" Artist questioned, while drawing on the buildings.\nEven the other participants who'd been watching from afar couldn't hide their shock.\nOne [Heaven's Spear] was already unimaginable—two was enough to bring sheer terror to everyone in range.\n\"Master... I see what you mean now,\" Follower looked at the two angels, his vision flooded by their beauty, \"Chosen is truly the most dangerous of all.\"\nStark didn't flinch. He'd expected this.\n\"Alright, asshole, let's do this,\" he muttered, a smirk breaking across his face as he activated [Dodge Control].\nImmediately, his body shifted, flowing like water as the world around him began to slow down.\nThe power of [Dodge Control] took hold, his body adapting in real-time to avoid anything that came his way, no matter how powerful or destructive.\nIn front, Hugo stared at the falling spear, his face a mix of fascination and resignation.\n\"Child…\" he murmured, eyes fixed on the massive energy above. \"This world is already in ruins.\" His mouth twisted into a bitter smile. \"Let's both die together.\"\nIt dawned on Stark then—Hugo didn't plan to survive this.\nHis goal had always been to take out as many participants as possible, even if it cost him his own life.\nNo way anyone survives something so powerful, not even he could.\nSo his plan was to take the four of them with him.\nThe domes would probably survive since they are indestructible, but he was already using them on both Sora and Lilith, meaning that as he died, the girls would slowly begin to suffer and moonscorch.\n\"My plan is perfect!\" Hugo cackled, throwing his head back as the spear continued its descent.\nBut Hugo wasn't stupid—he noticed Stark activating a skill, one that might let him escape the spear's impact.\nAnd just as predicted, Hugo planned to copy it and mimick Stark's actions.\nWhether he survived or not, in the end, he would be there to end the humans.\nHugo smirked, immediately calling forth another shockwave of dark energy from [Aura Supression] in an attempt to absorb Stark's skill.\nIf he could pull Stark's [Dodge Control] from him and copy it, he would be safe.\nBut this time, it wouldn't work.\n\"Has anyone ever told you that you're an idiot?\" Stark stood in place as the shockwave was approaching him, his expression so malicious that it became even scarier than Father Hugo's.\n\"What the hell are you talking about, child-\" it didn't take Hugo long to realize just how fucked he was.\n[Dodge Control] didn't just evade attacks.\nIt made Stark's body teleport around anything that could hit him—even if that \"attack\" was an unavoidable shockwave.\nWithout it, Hugo couldn't use [Return to Sender].\nThe shockwave passed through empty air as Stark's body blinked between locations faster than Hugo could register, teleporting around the assault until he was beside Hugo, gripping his shoulder with a vice-like hold.\n[Your shockwave didn't hit anything.]\n\"You're fucked, and you know it,\" Stark muttered, still smiling.\nHe raised his other hand, pointing toward the sky, where the colossal spear Hugo himself sent was only meters away from impact.\nTime slowed down, their gazes fixed on the destructive force about to consume them.\nHugo looked up, eyes wide, a final trace of fear flickering in his gaze.\n\"…Child of demons,\" he murmured to Stark, \"You win.\"\nAnd then, the spear hit the ground.\nThe world detonated in a blinding explosion of crimson and shadow as the spear impacted the ground, tearing the temple and everything around it into shreds.\nThe impact was felt far beyond the immediate area, a shockwave of light and sound ripping through the landscape.\nEvery participant, monster, and even the moon apostles themselves were stunned, momentarily frozen in awe and horror.\nWhen the dust settled, Stark was gone from the point of impact, [Dodge Control] allowing him to escape the explosion's reach.\nWith Lilith and Sora in his asura arms, he leapt and dashed over debris, using his agility to scale the remnants of the temple.\nHe reached the edge of the crater, glancing back at the devastation.\nA massive hole marked the area where the temple had once stood, stretching out like a scar across the landscape.\nStark exhaled, satisfaction coursing through him.\n\"And to think,\" he muttered, \"that was just a pale imitation.\" If Hugo's [Heaven's Spear] had been that strong, his own must be even stronger.\nHe hadn't even used it!\nThat stupid Father Hugo quite literally killed himself using the skill he thought would end them all!\nDing!\nA notification flashed in his vision.\n[You have slain \"Father Hugo, Moonscorch Commander,\" +50,000,000 Experience Points!]\n[Task 13: Defeat Father Hugo in the Orphanage - Completed]\n[Gained two rewards: Priest's Cross (???) and Moonscorch Cure (Use to completely heal moonscorch).]\nA smirk tugged at Stark's lips.\n\"Looks like the priest is going to hell.\"\nStark didn't waste a single second though, dashing forward as he needed to find a safe zone.\n[Sora: 98% Moonscorched]\n[Lilith: 13% Moonscorched]\nThe latter had been hit several times, so no wonder it was going up this fast.\nIt should stabilize later, but until then he simply decided to not try his luck and so to use the newly acquired [Moonscorch Cure] on Sora.",

He stepped forward, relief flooding him as the notification appeared:\n[Safe zone discovered!]\nSighing, he guided Lilith and Sora over to a small bed.\nWhen looking at them from this position, they were pretty damn cute.\nBut Stark didn't think of that.\nHe was too focused on what's next, and so as he sat on his chair, he placed his chin on his hands and began thinking, a spinning vortex of aura appearing in his eyes as he was deep in thought.\n\"Kill...\" he whispered.\n[Participants Alive:] Sora, Clever, Lilith, Shock, CEO, Artist, Follower, Stark\n[Enemies Alive:] Tormented One, Heartless One, Eternal Regret, The Moon Apostle, The Mayor\n...\nMeanwhile, outside the temple ruins, another figure lingered, his eyes wide as he took in the scorched earth and wreckage.\n\"Wow…\" Shock muttered, inching closer to the smoking battlefield.\nThe sight of the massive crater and the faint traces of the [Heaven's Spear] blast made his breath catch. \"So, this is what Chosen's power looks like…\"\nSeeing the extent of the devastation left him feeling unsettled.\nAs he observed, a creeping sensation of being watched tingled at the back of his neck.\nHe froze, his gaze darting around.\nFrom behind a half-destroyed column, a figure stepped out, his presence dark and chilling.\nShock stiffened as the tall, looming figure of Follower came into view.\nFollower's expression was blank, his movements slow, almost measured, like a predator sizing up its prey.\n\"The maniac...\" Shock mumbled, a forced grin creeping onto his face.\nFollower tilted his head slightly, studying Shock with an unblinking intensity.\nHe looked unfazed by the destruction around them, as if it were simply another day.\nThe corner of Follower's mouth twitched slightly as he let out his aura, \"Why are you here?\"\n\"I mean, I was curious.\" Shock's grin faltered as he took a step back, his instinct for survival kicking in. \"You know, just checking things out.\"\n\"Curiosity,\" Follower murmured, his eyes narrowing as he took a step forward. \"Such a dangerous thing.\"\nIn an instant, the atmosphere shifted.\nFollower's presence became suffocating, his gaze sharpening with a bloodthirsty glint.\nShock felt a cold sweat break out as he realized the danger he was in.\nThere was no amusement in Follower's expression now—only raw, lethal intent.\nShock scrambled back, his hands already reaching for his weapon.\nBut Follower was faster.\nWith a burst of speed, Follower closed the distance between them.\nShock barely had time to raise his guard before Follower's hand slammed into his chest, sending him sprawling onto the ground.\nShock coughed, the wind knocked out of him. \"H-Hey, hold on! We don't have to do this!\"\nBut Follower's response was only a cold stare as he approached.\nHis movements were calm, precise, as though he'd already decided how this encounter would end.\nHe lifted his arm, energy crackling around his fingers.\n[Godless Demon perk activated.]\n\"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU-\"\nBefore Shock could finish, Follower lunged, his fist slamming into Shock's gut with brutal force.\nShock doubled over, gasping, his knees hitting the ground as pain tore through him.\nDesperation clawed at him. He raised his hand, trying to summon a skill, but Follower was relentless.\n\"Please… don't…\" Shock's voice wavered, his body shaking from the sheer force of Follower's attacks.\nHis plea was cut short as Follower grabbed him by the throat, lifting him effortlessly off the ground.\nFollower's eyes were unreadable, cold and merciless.\nHe didn't react to Shock's pleading expression, nor did he flinch at the panic in Shock's eyes.\nWith a sudden twist, Follower tightened his grip, and Shock's cries grew weaker.\nDEMON DEVOURING!\nHe yet again used up his most powerful perk, a dark aura emerging from his body and gripping onto Shock's, devouring him completely.\n\"N-No…\" Shock's voice was a whisper now, his strength fading as his vision began to blur. \"Please…\"\nBut his plea fell on deaf ears.\nBOOM!\n-999,999!\nInstant death.\nFollower watched, unblinking, as Shock's body went limp.\nThen, with a final, swift movement, he released his hold, letting Shock's lifeless body slump to the ground.\nDing!\nThe notification rang out, cold and final:\n[Participant \"Shock\" has been killed by \"Follower.\"]\nSeven remained.\nFollower knelt beside Shock's body, his hand brushing over the item Shock had carried—the [Skill Canceller].\nA smile played at the corners of his lips as he held the device, feeling the power it held.\nDing!\n[You have stolen \"Skill Canceller\"!]\nThe implications of his new prize sank in.\nWith the ability to cancel one skill, Follower knew he now had a weapon powerful enough to take down even Chosen's [Heaven's Spear].\nAnd also...\nThere was one last thing...\n[Prove your devotion.]\n[Kill 5 participants.]\n[5/5]\nDing!\n[You truly are a follower of the Godless Demon.]\n[You have received a new perk: \"Godless Demon Transformation\" (Immortal)]\n[Ultimate Task: Kill Chosen.]\n[0/1]\n\"Yes...

      "content": "[Participant \"Shock\" has been killed by \"Follower.\"]\nStark sat in silence beside the bed where Lilith and Sora were resting.\nHe was tired, probably more than anyone else, but still, he needed to stay up.\nHe couldn't let his [Ultimate Clone] do all the work, and a sudden attack on this room would probably destroy all of it before they even realized it.\nPlus, he was too pre-occupied by what would happen next to sleep.\nShock's death meant there were only seven people left in the trial now.\nThe one who'd stolen his kill on the [Inquisitor] was gone.\nRemoving himself, Sora, and Lillith, it left 4 other powerful participants.\nThe fact they each survived in solo already said enough about their power.\nClever? He was an old man, but Stark had a bad feeling about him regardless, almost as if none of the monsters or participants in this trial were worth using his powers on.\nCEO? A maniac, truly, and he was the one who exposed Stark at the beginning, as well as started this whole attack.\nArtist? Extremely powerful too, the only one Stark saw the powers of live, since he also fought the [Inquisitor] with him.\nAnd finally, Follower, the most mysterious of them.\nHis [Focus] skill kept shouting [WATCH OUT] every time he got close at the start, was there a reason for that?\nAnd on the other side of the trial, there were the monsters.\nStark hadn't met many normal monsters anymore, meaning that they either got all killed, or that the moon trio realized that it would just give experience to the participants, thus removing them.\nIn both cases, it means only the elite of the elite remained:\nEternal Regret, the creature made of the hundreds of souls from the orphanage children.\nThe Mayor, Stark hadn't met him, but he had killed one of CEO's goons, so he was definitely powerful.\nTormented One, Never met either, no idea what it could be, same thing for the Heartless One.\nAnd finally, the big boss of this trial: the moon apostle.\nStark didn't know it, but he theorized that the [Moon Trio] was actually but a facade for the real [Moon Apostle].\nMaybe defeating all three would reveal him.\nNot that it would make a difference anyway.\nRight as he was about to continue thinking about the future, though...\nThe most important announcement of this trial appeared.\nAn announcement that would change the entire trial.\nNo.\nIt would change the entire world.\n[Global Announcement: More than half of the participants have been slain, and all conditions have been met for the \"Grand Initiation\".]\n[Go outside if you aren't already.]\n\"Huh?\"\nThe atmosphere around the entire trial darkened.\nAnd it wasn't just a feeling anymore, it quite literally did.\nStark felt like he needed to go outside, no matter what.\n\"Clone, protect them,\" he whispered, gesturing to Lilith and Sora, and the [Ultimate Clone] nodded in understanding. \"I have... a bad feeling.\"\nStark left the safe zone of the museum, avoiding the debris from the fallen structure, and finally, he opened the entrance door of the museum.\nAnd that's when he saw it.\nThe sky, now a menacing crimson red, cast an eerie glow over the entire landscape.\nAnd most importantly...\n\"What the hell is that...\" he looked up, specifically toward the [Hollow Tower].\nThe tower was massive, but at the very top of it, a timer appeared, ticking down.\n[Time before the 'Grand Initiation': 59:37 minutes... 59:36...]\nEverywhere in the trial, except for Lilith and Sora, every participant could see that timer too.\nAnd they all wondered: what the hell is the [Grand Initiation].\n[This will change the entire world outside.]\n[Enjoy while you still can.]\nAt this point, they were used to the trials and their random encounters/events.\nBut never has any of them claimed to \"change the whole world\".\nWere monsters from this trial appear in the real world? Would they be forced to do tasks in the real world, killing millions?!\nWhat the hell was it?\nAll they could do was wait the hour to see.\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\nThree rifts split open in the sky, and the three [Crimson Moons] appeared.\n'So he's back...' Stark thought.\n[You need to kill all three moons to reveal the \"Moon Apostle\", otherwise they regenerate at some point.]\nTo keep things clear, Stark mentally labeled them Moone, Motwo, and Mothree.\n\"So it's time,\" Moone grinned, though that was only visible by the massive eye it had.\n\"Yeah, I guess it was bound to happen at some point,\" Motwo sighed, sounding almost indifferent.\n\"From today onward, the moment this timer hits 0, the end of humanity will begin,\" Mothree added.\nThe three moons couldn't hear the participants, nor could they see Stark's exasperation as he shouted, trying to get some kind of response.\nIt seemed as though they were speaking, but the main goal of this conversation was to announce something to the participants.\n\"This trial is reaching its halfway point.\"\n\"Agreed.\"\n\"Now the whole world shall see what is happening behind the scenes, beyond what they believed.\"\n\"They will discover the truth.\"\n\"The participants should feel honored,\" Moothree dared to add, laughing.\nMoone shrugged, as if the lives of the participants were trivial, \"Will they be honored? After all, this will be a big deal, won't it?\"\n\"We're going to kill them anyway,\" Motwo stated flatly. \"This is just a warning for humanity.\"\nThe three moons then spoke in unison, their voices merging into a chilling harmony as they all stared at Termina, and specifically at the participants, their pupils darting at their positios.\n\"The new world order is coming. You will all be bound to your fates.\"\nAnd with that, the three moons vanished, leaving Stark to stand alone in the blood-red glow of the sky.\nHe stared, dumbfounded, at the timer ticking down.\nEvery word they'd said only served to deepen the pit of dread in his stomach.\n\"Bro what?\" Stark was flabbergasted.\nThe hell were they even talking about?\n\"The end of humanity? The truth? New world order?\" Stark murmured to himself, reeling from the cryptic words.\nNone of it made sense, yet every part of him sensed that whatever was coming was monumental.\nWhat in the flying fuck does any of that mean?\nFor a few moments, he just stood there, transfixed by the timer.\nThe entire trial was eerily silent now. No monsters roamed the streets; it was as if everything had gone still in preparation for the \"Grand Initiation.\"\nAll the moonscorch was gone.\n\"The halfway point... huh...\"\nThe trial had always been deadly, with monsters and participants killing each other at every turn. But this was different.\nThis felt like something much larger, something beyond just survival.\nAnother way of escaping this trial? Maybe?\nBut before that, they would need to go through the [Grand Initiation].\nThey claimed that it would change the entire world.\n\"Probably related to the godless demon,\" was Stark's guess, and he was completely right.\nKnowing that no monsters were there anymore, he just sat on the stairs of the museum, looking up.\nIt was the same thing for all other participants.\nArtist drew a bed and rested on it, knowing that no monsters would come to disturb him.\nClever spun his cane, unfazed, biding his time.\nCEO too, didn't do much, deciding to still roam around in case he could find anything.\nAnd then there was Follower.\n[It is our time.]\n\"Yes, master,\" Follower whispered to himself, a twisted smile spreading across his face.\n[You have received the information. The world will now kneel before \"Domination\" users. Be ready.]\n\"Yes...\"\nHe was ready for the [Grand Initiation], more than anyone else.\nNo... he was thrilled.\nThe chaos to come was exactly what he had been waiting for.",

      "content": "Stark sat on the museum steps, eyes locked on the crimson sky, which had grown darker since the timer appeared.\nThe clock counted down, second by second, showing just under an hour left.\nWhatever the [Grand Initiation] was, it loomed closer with every tick.\nAround Termina, the remaining participants waited, each feeling the weight of the impending event.\nStark thought back to the ominous announcement: \"This will change the entire world.\"\nThe words gnawed at his mind, a sense of dread settling in his chest.\nYet even as Stark's nerves frayed, he knew he couldn't afford to lose focus.\nHe was one of the few domination users left, and this [Grand Initiation] would likely push them all to their limits.\nAfter all, even in the real world, what actually was the number of domination users who survived until the third trial?\nMaybe less than 1%.\n...\nElsewhere, in a dark alley across the city, CEO paced, eyes darting between the timer in the sky and the buildings around him.\nFor once, even he seemed to understand that this event was bigger than any scheme he'd devised.\n\"So, the halfway point… if they're revealing this to the world, then everything we've done here… it's going to mean something outside, too.\" He clenched his fists, determination flashing in his eyes.\n\"Just you wait, all of you,\" he muttered to himself. \"I'll survive this, and then I'll become the richest man alive...\"\n...\nMeanwhile, Clever, an old yet sharp-eyed participant, observed the sky from the shadows at a quiet corner of Termina.\nHis calm demeanor hid a mind constantly analyzing every detail.\nThe moons had hinted at something big coming, and he knew that the battle ahead would be unforgiving.\n\"Let's see if you young ones are ready for what's coming…\" Clever murmured, leaning back against the wall.\n...\nThe timer dropped to 30 minutes.\nStark shifted his focus to the door of the museum, where Sora and Lilith lay resting in the museum's safe zone.\nHe knew he had to plan not only for himself but for the two of them as well.\nThat is if they didn't wake up.\nIt would be bad if they didn't, though.\nBut after getting hit by Hugo's attacks, it was normal anybody would feel down.\nWith only ten minutes left on the timer, a low, ominous hum vibrated through the sky.\nStark and the others all froze, sensing that something massive was about to happen.\nAnd then…\nBOOM!\nA deafening crack split the air as a colossal rift opened above the [Hollow Tower].\nIt looked like the sky itself was tearing apart, revealing swirling blackness beyond.\nThe three crimson moons reappeared, larger and more terrifying than before.\nTheir voices echoed across the city, chilling every participant to the bone.\n\"Welcome… to the end.\"\nThe words resounded within their minds.\nStark gritted his teeth, looking up at the moons, his fists clenched. He could feel it—this was just the beginning.\nAs the timer reached its final seconds, a new message appeared in bright red text across the sky:\n[The Grand Initiation has begun.]\n1:00…\n0:59…\n0:58…\nThe countdown continued, but as it did, a series of panels appeared in the air.\n[Since the beginning of it all, the \"Domination\" class was always the secret one.]\n[No one except a select few and those that have it know of its existence.]\n[But it is time for it to change.]\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What?\"\n[The Grand Initiation of the world to the Domination class will begin once the timer hits zero.]\n[You will all be participants of this game, watched by the entire world.]\n[Are you ready?]\n[The descent of the Godless Demon is happening soon.]\n\"Mhm,\" Clever nodded, smirking.\n\"???\" CEO raised his eyebrows, confused. \"What?\"\n\"Descent of the Godless Demon?\" Artist climbed out of his makeshift bed, startled.\nAnd finally…\n\"YES! YES! THE WORLD SHALL WATCH AS WE KILL ALL OF THEM!\" Follower was on his knees, crying tears of joy. \"THE WORLD WILL FALL!\"\n10…\n9…\n8…\nStark watched as the timer neared its end, a deep sense of foreboding settling over him.\nHe didn't know exactly what was coming, but he knew he had to be prepared.\n7…\n6…\n5…\nReveal the Domination class to the whole world? How? And why?\nWhy were they suddenly players in a game? Weren't they already in a deadly trial?\nOr maybe it was another one of those massive events that could kill them all?\n4…\n3…\n2…\n1…\nAnd when would the [Godless Demon] descend?\nStark braced himself.\n0!\nFWISH… BOOM!\nThe entire trial seemed to explode upon itself.\nAnd every participant suddenly felt a piercing headache, even Follower and Stark.\n\"What the...?\" Stark clutched his head, trying to resist the pain, his vision flooded by shadows and images he knew weren't real.\n[Welcome.]\n[To the Grand Initiation.]\n[Your fates are now sealed.]\nInside the museum, Sora and Lilith woke up, both clutching their heads in agony.\nThey'd each had a nightmare—a vision of a massive demon, its voice urging them to wake up and not miss the [Grand Initiation].\nSweat dripped from their foreheads, fear gnawing at them.\nFor Sora, this fear was even greater than any she'd felt before, it was more than the one she had against the warden of the second trial.\n\"Did you... see that too?\" Sora asked Lilith, her voice trembling.\n\"...Yeah.\" Lilith nodded, eyes wide.\n\"Can't be a coincidence. Let's go outside.\"\nStark's ultimate clone, who had been guarding them, noticed they were awake and gestured for them to follow it toward Stark.\nThey made their way through the museum's wrecked halls, stopping at the entrance where Stark stood, looking up at the sky.\nThe pain in their heads dulled, but as they lifted their gaze, they saw something they could never have imagined.\nIn the sky, the figure of a colossal demon materialized, its two crimson eyes locking onto them.\nIts overwhelming aura filled the air, making them all feel weak.\nA single second of inattention would result in them being knocked out again.\n[Domination users.]\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\n\"…\"\n[The entire world is watching you now.]\n[Do whatever you feel is right.]\nWith those simple words, the creature faded away.\nBut in that brief glance, it seemed as if it had directed its disgust of the human race particularly toward Stark, as if his mere presence was offensive.\n\"What did it mean by 'the whole world is watching us'?\" Lilith asked, still shaken as she looked up at the sky.\nSilence.\nStark didn't respond, his gaze fixed above.\n\"Hello?\" The two girls approached him, trying to catch his attention. \"HOLY—!\"\nThey flinched, recoiling from the intense hatred radiating from Stark's aura.\nHis body seemed cloaked in a crimson energy, his white pupils shaking with fury.\n\"It meant it literally,\" he finally spoke, his voice a low growl. \"The whole world's watching us. The Domination secret is out.\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What?\"\nAcross the city, every other participant was coming to the same realization.\nThis trial was but a game to the apostles and godless demon.\nThat is why they organized this whole [Corpse Festival] thing: they enjoyed seeing those that could defeat them kill one another.\nStark didn't know who was making these trials, but it seemed that they were now cooperating with the godless demon.\n[Every trial needs to be fair.]\nThat is what Stark remembered, and the probable reason why they weren't just instantly killed.\nThere were rules to follow, and now, this twisted game of death would be watched by everyone.",

      "content": "In the outside world.\nNot only in Fellarbrug, but in all other countries in Rheria, something strange happened.\nIn every country, every town, and every corner, electronic devices suddenly flickered.\nPhones, computers, billboards, and even holographic displays glitched for a second, then resumed, but not with their usual content.\nEach screen turned a deep, impenetrable black.\nPeople across schools, businesses, cafes, and homes exchanged confused looks.\nThe usual hustle fell silent, replaced by murmurs of concern and bewilderment.\nFaces lit only by the cold light of the screens, they waited, wondering what was happening.\nOn every screen, a shadowed figure appeared, his outline vague but menacing, with two piercing crimson eyes that seemed to look directly into the soul of each viewer.\nThe feeling of being watched, of having something far more powerful than them seize control, settled over everyone.\n\"What the hell?\" someone muttered.\n\"Is this some kind of hack?\" asked another.\nBut there was no answer.\nThe figure's voice echoed suddenly, resonating not from the devices but seeming to whisper directly into each ear.\n\"Hello, humans.\"\nThe voice carried an otherworldly authority, chilling everyone in an instant.\nBefore anyone could react further, the figure raised its hand and snapped its fingers.\nSNAP!\nThe world outside transformed in an instant.\nThe sky shifted, bleeding into a deep, unsettling crimson that spread across the horizon, casting a sinister glow over the entire landscape.\nSunlight dimmed as if absorbed by this red veil, leaving the world beneath it cast in an ominous glow.\nIt was as if the world itself was plunged into a living nightmare.\n\"AAAAH!\"\n\"What's happening?\"\nEven the strongest of classifiers, those at level 600, 700 and up were confused.\nWhat was happening to the world?!\nIn every corner of Rheria, panic erupted.\nCars screeched to a halt, people pointed to the sky in disbelief, and even newscasters stammered over their words as they struggled to describe the bizarre events unfolding around them.\nBack to the broadcast, the Godless Demon's figure still filled every screen, his crimson eyes burning brighter.\nHis voice cut through the growing chaos with ease, grabbing everyone's attention.\n\"Welcome to the Grand Initiation,\" he said, \"Today marks a new beginning. You may not understand yet, but you will soon.\"\nIn every city, in every gathering, people stared in stunned silence, their eyes glued to the broadcast.\nThe figure gave a chilling smile.\n\"Let's cut to the chase,\" he said, snapping his fingers once more.\nThe screens shifted, and five words appeared, large and ominous.\n[Third Domination Trial: Corpse Festival]\nEveryone's confusion only deepened as more words followed:\n[Difficulty: Death]\n[15 Participants.]\nOn the screen appeared 15 squares, displaying the faces of all the participants.\n\"Huh? Isn't that the CEO of the Amaterasu group?\"\n\"That's Sora Gardenis!\" another pointed.\n\"And that's Kai Algreen, the genius Artist!\"\nPowerful figures, faces known all across Rheria—these were the participants.\nShocked whispers spread as more faces were recognized.\nAnd then... the broadcast shifted again.\nBAM! BAM! BAM!\n[Starfire - Eliminated by Follower.]\n[Rightlef - Eliminated by CEO.]\n[Mao - Eliminated by Follower.]\n[Partner - Eliminated by the Mayor.]\n[Mio - Eliminated by Father Hugo.]\n[Dave - Eliminated by Follower.]\n[Claire - Eliminated by Follower.]\n[Shock - Eliminated by Follower.]\nIn seven of the fifteen boxes, gray-out effects started appearing, with red X's crossing out the faces.\nThe crowd gasped as one box after another was grayed out, the participants marked as eliminated.\n[7 participants Alive.]\nThe 7 squares that remained were those of: Chosen, Lilith, Sora, CEO, Follower, Artist and Clever.\nIt was undeniable—the implication was that they had died.\n\"What... did they just say Starfire's dead?\"\n\"Mio and Mao too? They were my favorites...\"\n\"That Follower guy is insane, someone has to stop him...\"\nThen, another message appeared, jolting them from their shock:\n[Do you want to watch the trial?]\n[Yes] [No]\n[The choice that receives the majority vote will determine the outcome.]\n[If yes is selected, you will have access to watch the trial live from the perspective of any participant.]\nInstantly, all those that shouted quieted down, gulping.\nIt felt unreal, like a twisted game, yet the allure of watching such a deadly trial was powerful.\nSlowly, people began to vote, curiosity overriding their fear.\nFrom teenagers to elders, from the poor to the rich, everyone made their choice.\nAnd in the end...\n[Results are in.]\n[99.99% of the population has voted for 'Yes.']\n[You will be able to follow the trial live now.]\n[Enjoy, for the world is in their hands.\nA haunting silence settled over the crowd as the screens turned black once more, only to reawaken with the images of a crumbling city with a crimson sky.\nIn the background, they could see a massive tower.\nAnd then, a prompt appeared on their screens.\n[Which participant do you want to follow?]\nThe list appeared: [Sora, Clever, Lilith, CEO, Artist, Follower, Stark.]\nWith trembling hands, people selected, and it was no surprise that Follower, the one who had already claimed multiple lives, attracted the most attention.\nThe allure of such a dangerous figure was irresistible to many.\n...\nMeanwhile, in the Domination Association headquarters, a place only known to those in the highest circles of power, the event had brought a storm of panic.\n\"Boss!\" one operative shouted. \"This is unprecedented. We've never seen anything like this.\"\nThe middle-aged boss, Oliver, narrowed his eyes.\nHis gray hair and the weight of countless years of experience made him an intimidating figure, yet even he couldn't hide his shock.\n\"BOSS?!\"\n\"THIS ISN'T NORMAL!\"\n\"SHUT THE FUCK UP, ALL OF YOU,\" he shouted, \"I know this isn't normal, but we can't do anything.\"\nThe other domination users/staff fell silent, their fear evident but controlled as they awaited further orders.\n\"The entire world voted, and they now all heard of the term domination trial, plus, it's a death difficulty trial, so it doesn't matter who's in it, they are all going to die.\"\n\"But chief, the problem is that the entire world will know about them... no... about us,\" a beige haired woman sighed.\nOliver's gaze hardened, \"Doesn't matter. Whatever is happening in that trial, it's unlike any other we've seen.\nWe have to watch and observe. There's something... ominous about this. It's as if these participants, as if this trial, is a threat to the entire world.\"\nNo one dared to speak, the weight of Oliver's words sinking in.\n\"Way to say it, boss,\" only one figure laugh through it all: Juan, the very same guy that first tried to get Stark to join the association.\n\"We may be the strongest Domination users alive, but even we have limits. Watch and learn. I don't know what awaits us if these participants fail, but my instincts tell me it won't end well.\"\n\"...\"\nAll the domination users inside the [Domination Association] were strong, but many hadn't even entered their third trial yet.\nEven Oliver was only level 200.\nAnd once he confirmed there was no domination trial at level 200, he believed that it meant there wasn't anything beyond that.\nIt became too difficult to level up, and he had the strength of a level 1000 classifier already, so there was no need to go any further.\nHe had all the experienced and knowledge about the domination class he needed, but something like that had never happened before.\nHe turned to the screens, which showed the remaining participants.\nThere were only seven left.\n\"The whole world is watching...\" Oliver whispered, \"Don't disappoint us. Domination users. It is a death trial, but I hope at least one of you survives.\"\nWith that, he and the rest of the operatives settled in to watch, their fear tempered by a sense of pride and challenge.\nAcross Rheria: Fellaburg, Ostount, Lampod and all other countries, hundreds of millions of eyes fell on their screens, watching.\nAnd so...\n[You are currently watching the third domination trial.]\nDing!\nTheir screens finally showed the participants they selected.\n[One final warning to you all.]\nA text appeared in front of everyone's eager eyes.\n[If every participant dies.]\n[Then... well, let's just say there won't be much to observe of this world anymore.]\nNo participant had transformed yet, but if all of them died, they would instantly transform into moonscorched beings in the real world, rivalling level 700-800 classifiers.\nThe lives of millions were at stake, at this point.",

      "content": "None of the participants could truly understand what \"the world watching them\" meant.\nIt wasn't possible that the outside world would have access to the domination trial after all, right?\nRight as he thought of that, Stark suddenly felt the pressure of being watched from every direction.\n\"What the...\" his eyes widened, his pupils shaking, \"Could it be...\"\nBut the new notification about their next objective snapped him back to reality.\n[Head to the Hollow Tower Square - Time limit of 2 hours.]\n[Those that don't have 5 tasks completed by then will be instantly Moonscorched.]\nStark's heart skipped a beat.\nThe Moonscorch threat was serious, and it was the first time this trial actually threatened them with instant death.\nTalk about fair, heh?\nHe quickly checked his own status and breathed a sigh of relief.\n[Completed Tasks: 5/5]\n\"Oh, then I guess it's fine,\" he muttered, but not everyone was in the clear.\nAnother panel popped up, showing everyone's current progress:\n[Stark: 5/5]\n[Sora: 2/5]\n[Follower: 5/5]\n[Clever: 5/5]\n[Lilith: 5/5]\n[CEO: 5/5]\n[Artist: 4/5]\n\"Huh,\" Stark glanced at Lilith's name. \"How'd you finish all your tasks already?\"\nLilith shrugged, a small smile tugging at her lips. \"Did all I could find in the shopping district, which is where I was resting.\"\n\"So, you must have gotten some good items, right?\"\n\"Better than you'd think.\" Lilith tapped a few times on the air, pulling up her inventory for Stark to see.\n[Lilith's Items: Cooldown Gem, Double Power, Revive Token, Teleportation Sphere, Moonscorch Cure]\nStark's eyes widened. \"Those are… insane items. You should use the Moonscorch Cure, though.\"\n\"Good point,\" Lilith replied, activating the item.\nInstantly, the remaining traces of Moonscorch vanished from her.\nShe flexed her fingers, looking visibly relieved.\nBut then Stark's eyes drifted back to Sora's status.\n\"Only 2 tasks completed. She still needs three more,\" he said, concern evident in his voice.\nLilith nodded, thinking. \"There were a few tasks left in the shopping district that I skipped. She could finish them quickly if we work together.\"\n\"Then let's move.\" Stark turned to Sora. \"We have two hours. We're going to get you those tasks and then head to the Hollow Tower. Stay close.\"\nThe three of them bolted toward the shopping district, finding it easily.\nIt was a massive street filled with dozens of shops, though most were overrun and had broken windows, shutdown, or covered with wood planks.\nThey dashed past dilapidated storefronts, overturned carts, and flickering neon signs casting eerie lights on the streets.\nTheir first stop was an old bookstore, its windows cracked and dusty.\n\"There's a task here,\" Lilith informed as they followed her.\nInside, books were scattered everywhere, but a strange panel appeared as they entered.\n[Task: Locate the Forgotten Tome. Reward: Teleportation Token]\n\"It's like hide and seek,\" Sora muttered, already scanning the room.\nStark and Lilith split up, moving methodically between aisles and stacks of books, knocking aside debris as they searched.\nMinutes later, Lilith's voice rang out as a book at the very far end of the bookshelves emitted some sort of dark energy, \"Found it! Come get it, Sora!\"\nIf Lilith grabbed it, it would be considered that she was the one that completed the task, and you couldn't have that.\nSora walked toward Lilith, then lifted a thick, leather-bound book from a stack on a high shelf.\nThe moment she touched it, the book glowed, and a new item appeared in Sora's inventory.\n\"Double Speed Token,\" Sora read out, looking pleased. \"That'll come in handy.\"\n\"One task down. Let's keep going,\" Stark urged, already moving back out onto the street.\nThe next task wasn't far.\nAn old bakery lay around the corner, its glass door hanging off one hinge.\nThe smell of something burnt and stale lingered in the air as they stepped inside.\nA new notification greeted them.\n[Task: Recover the Golden Rolling Pin that is guarded by the \"Baker\".]\n\"Huh, so there's still monsters?\" Stark wondered.\nIt would indeed feel refreshing to be able to fight.\nThe place was a mess, flour and broken glass scattered across the floor.\nSora darted behind the counter while Stark checked the back kitchen.\nThere, he found a door with the sign [Employees Only].\n\"Come!\" he shouted to Sora and Lilith, whom arrived 20 seconds later, \"Watch out, there might be a boss.\"\nHe slowly opened the door, his aura activated in case anything ambushed them.\nBut strangely enough... there was nothing.\nActually, no, there was something.\n\"Look down!\" Lilith pointed, and as Stark did that, he noticed a large corpse.\n[The Baker - Level 600 Elite]\nThis elite boss was dead before anyone even got to it, and there was some sort of black liquid covering half of his body, eating him out.\n\"Moonscorch,\" Stark whispered, \"Well, doesn't matter.\"\n\"Got it!\" Sora's voice almost sounded happy as she grabbed it, holding a dusty golden rolling pin, and with a flash, the rolling pin transformed into something else.\n\"Armor Reinforcement Shard… not bad.\" Sora held up the shard.\n\"Alright, two down, one to go,\" Stark said, feeling the tension ease a bit.\nBut as they stepped outside, he caught a glimpse of the red sky and remembered the time limit.\n\"Let's keep moving.\"\nTheir last stop in the shopping district was an abandoned electronics store.\nFlickering lights cast ominous shadows across the shattered display cases, and most of the screens were cracked or covered in dust.\nA panel appeared as soon as they entered.\n[Task: Restore Power to the Store. Reward: Protection Amulet]\n\"We'll need to find the breaker,\" Stark muttered.\nLilith pointed towards the back, where a faint hum indicated the presence of a power source.\n\"Come on, it should be here somewhere.\"\nThey hurried down a narrow hallway lined with broken display cases, moving deeper into the store until they reached a dusty breaker panel.\nStark yanked open the panel, inspecting the wires and switches inside.\n\"It's... a puzzle,\" he was quite surprised to see this, as it was straight out of a video game.\nBasically, you needed to place the wires in the good order.\nIt didn't take Sora much time to do it, though.\nThe fact these tasks were so easy was mainly because of the facts that there were no monsters to slow their progress.\nThe library would have had the [Librarian] elite, the bakery would have the [Baker], and the electric store would have had the [Electric Manager].\nWithout these things, it became too easy.\nWhat was the goal of this trial in stopping the monster spawn...?\n\"Done!\"\nThe store flooded with light, illuminating everything with a cold, artificial glow.\nThe Protection Amulet appeared in Sora's inventory too\n\"Got it!\" she cheered. \"That's all five.\"\nThey shared a quick, relieved smile.\nThey'd done it—Sora had her five tasks completed.\nThey stepped back out onto the crimson-lit streets, the Hollow Tower visible in the distance, looming over the ruined cityscape.\nThe clock was still ticking, and other participants were undoubtedly already on their way there.\nStark glanced at the timer on his panel. \"We still have time, but we should hurry.\"\nAs they made their way through the shopping district, the city around them felt like it was holding its breath.\nThe streets were empty, an eerie silence pervading everything.\nThe only sound was the faint hum of electricity and the echo of their footsteps.\nWhen they reached the square before the Hollow Tower, they saw that everyone else was already there, standing at various points across the wide, open space.\nThe atmosphere was tense, each participant eyeing the others warily.\n\"Why aren't they fighting one another-\" Stark wondered as he stepped foot, after all he was sure any of these people would kill at any moment.\nAn answer came as soon as he entered.\n[Fighting between participants is prohibited currently, anyone who does it will be moonscorched.]\nCEO stood with his arms crossed, his eyes cold and calculating.\nFollower's face was twisted into a grin, as if savoring the tension in the air.\nLilith shifted closer to Stark, keeping her gaze sharp as she assessed the crowd.\nArtist and Clever exchanged brief glances, as if mentally preparing themselves for whatever came next.\nStark felt the weight of the moment.\nThe silence stretched, everyone seemingly waiting for someone else to make the first move to talk, or just wait for another panel to appear.\nFinally, another notification appeared, breaking the standoff.\n[Congratulations on completing the tasks. You've reached the Hollow Tower.]\n[Now, let us put on a show for all of our spectators.]\nBOOM!\nAn explosion in the distance could be heard, and suddenly, a dark barrier formed around the [Hollow Tower Square], blocking all of them from leaving.\n[Escape isn't possible anymore.]\nAll the participants could feel that what was about to happen was bad.\nAnd the fact the trial described it as the halfway point meant that there were still things to do.\nIn the real world, everybody was in the edge of their seats, waiting to see what could possibly happen.\nNo one even bothered doing their work correctly, focusing on their screens and the trial.\nThe world had one question: just how much would the participants have to go through.\nThe answer could come sooner than expected.\nBusinessmen? Who even cares about the clients, they're also watching their screens after all.\nRestaurant/coffee shop workers? We'll prepare your food when something dull happens, until then you'll have to wait.\nAnd let's not talk about the powerful families.\nLana's family, Stark's family, Sora's family, all guilds and groups, they all watched it happen with amazed eyes.\nThis was unlike anything that happened until now.\nAnd so now, the name of the 7 alive participants was known to everybody in Rheria.\nThey became world-known celebrities in less than an hour.",

      "content": "Moonless Family Home.\nLouise Moonless, Arthur Moonless, and Aoki Moonless sat in the cozy living room, leaning into their family discussion.\nThe soft glow of the lamps barely outshone the massive 4K television that dominated the wall.\nAs soon as the big announcement that shut down all screens appeared, Aoki went down from his room, just to see his parents in the living room, staring at the screens.\n\"What's happening–\" he began.\n\"Shhh…\" Arthur cut him off, pointing at the TV.\nThe screen showed Stark's face, as well as every other participant in the 15 squares.\n\"HIM?!\" Aoki's reaction was immediate, his tone laced with disdain. \"I knew he was bad news!\"\nFrom the start, Aoki never trusted Stark.\nHe'd been uneasy ever since Stark had visited their home for an offer to join the [Rift Conqueror's Academy].\nThe idea of someone that young, that mysterious, already aligning himself with such prestigious groups had rubbed Aoki the wrong way.\nPlus, he dared to try and flirt with his sister!\nWorse of all, they apparently live together now!\nAnd now, seeing him here, as one of the last seven participants of that thing called the Domination Trial, Aoki's suspicions only deepened.\n\"What even is Stark's class, anyway?\" Aoki muttered, glancing at his father.\nArthur looked at him, almost as baffled.\n\"I don't know,\" he admitted. \"Considering his family, it should be [Soul Wielder]. But I've never seen him summon a [Soul Heart], not even once. And I've seen him fight.\"\nLouise's voice was soft, her curiosity clearly piqued. \"But these other participants… they're not just anyone.\"\nShe wasn't wrong.\nThe seven left in the trial were more than just participants.\nEvery surviving name was well-known and respected—some feared.\n\"Sora Gardenis…\" Louise continued, eyes narrowing thoughtfully. \"Who doesn't know about her?\"\nSora's beauty and the \"Gardenis\" family name were extremely famous.\nThen, of course, there was CEO, whose very name commanded influence and power.\nKnown as the head of the Amaterasu group, his presence in such a deadly trial raised questions.\nWhy would someone as influential as him risk his life? Was he forced into this?\nBut the most dangerous person among all of them was... Clever.\nStark didn't know it, and most people didn't since he was from another country in Rheria, but Clever was considered one of the most powerful people in his respective country.\nHe is able to take down level 600 bosses easily, and even manages against level 700s.\nThere were even rumors that if he used his entire potential, he could beat level 750 or level 800 monsters.\nBut who knows.\nAll that Arthur knew was that anybody who dared to defy Clever would die.\n...\nGardenis Family Home.\nIn another household, the tension was equally high.\nMike Gardenis and Elise Gardenis watched in shock as they saw their daughter's face among the final seven.\nUnlike their daughter, who was notoriously reserved and expressionless, Mike and Elise were both open and social.\nTheir family dynamic was warm, and they had three children, two daughters and one son, but Sora was the only one emotionless in their entire family.\nThey didn't know why that was as they always made sure to provide everything for her using their money from their various businesses, but no one could understand why.\nStrangely enough too, she was the strongest person in the family.\nHer father was a [Magus], her mother an [Archer], and her brother and sister were both mages too.\nSora was the only weird one, at a young age able to do stuff most people shouldn't be able to do.\nAnd to add to that, Sora was also somehow, though they tried to consider their children all the same, the most beautiful of them all.\nEven more so than their mother, who would sometime get jealous and tease her.\nAnd that's why they became extremely overprotective.\nBeautiful, smart and powerful? It was a whole package!\nAs a result, dozens if not hundreds of other families tried to pair her up with their sons for an arranged marriage.\nBut of course, not only did Sora categorically refuse, but her parents refused that too.\nWhen asked why, Mike had once famously declared, \"Our daughter will choose who she wants. If she doesn't like your son, get lost.\"\n\"We want someone that will actually protect her and help her out, so no, thank you,\" and her mother was the same.\nMike and Elise wanted someone that could understand their daughter even though she was emotionless.\nThey wanted someone that would be there, but unfortunately, that person never came.\nNone of those that came and went were worthy, and their daughter didn't like them either.\nEventually, no one tried anymore, as Sora wouldn't even bat an eye at them.\nSo you could imagine the surprise when they saw their daughter on the list of participants of that trial, among one of the 7 alive ones.\nAnd even more shocking, when the screen began displaying the actual trial...\n\"Mom! Sora's with a guy!\" Elise's eyes widened as her son's voice brought her out of her thoughts.\n\"WHAT?!\" Mike and Elise leaned closer to the screen, their jaws dropping.\nSure enough, Sora was standing next to someone, their shoulders almost touching.\nTheir shock was palpable—Sora, who refused and disgusted to let any man come within three meters, was here, side-by-side with a stranger.\n\"Just who is he…\" Mike's gaze sharpened, his protectiveness flaring up.\n\"That's Stark Heartsouls,\" Elise answered after a beat. \"I heard his family disowned him… something about him lacking the [Soul Wielder] class.\"\n\"STARK HEARTSOULS?\" Mike's voice shot up in disbelief. \"Well, let's see how this unfolds. If that boy so much as touches a strand of her hair, I'm going to murder him.\"\nBut right as he said that, the father suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.\n[Bad idea, Mike, Stark is at least twice as strong as you are.]\n...\nThen there was Stark's own family, perhaps the most bewildered of them all.\n\"What the hell...?\" Jay, Stark's only brother and leader of the [Wyvern Wrath Guild], the one he had outran back in the first secret rift he went into, mumbled.\n\"Stark?\" Both of his sisters, Lara and Nissa, looked at each other, their mouths agape.\nEven Aiden, Stark's father, and Sini, his mother, couldn't hide their shock.\nThey had disowned Stark nearly 1.5 years ago, convinced that he was a lost cause.\nYet now, their son's face was everywhere, proof that he was still fighting.\n\"Mom! All my friends are messaging me asking if that's my brother!\" Nissa blurted out, turning to her mother. \"What's going on?\"\n\"I… I don't know,\" Sini answered, fear edging her voice.\nWhat the hell was Stark doing along with all of those powerhouses.\nEven a single one of those participants would defeat their entire family 10x times over without breaking a sweat.\nThere was no chance Stark was like them, right?\nYou can't become so strong in less than 2 years... right?!\n\"He's with Sora Gardenis and Lilith Silent,\" Jay was baffled as well, why was his brother, much less popular than he was, with these two beauties!?\nBoth Sora and Lilith came from families with more power and influence than theirs, and possibly even more than the Moonless family.\nYet there was Stark, right by their sides.\nThe Heartsouls family could only watch, having chosen Stark as the [Chosen] participant they'd follow in this trial.\n\"Did he unlock his class?\" Lara asked.\n\"Probably,\" Aiden muttered, though his gaze remained hard. \"But the real question is… is it [Soul Wielder]?\"\nThey couldn't watch Stark fight because of the lack of monsters, but soon enough they would.\nMaybe it was to make the suspense higher in the entire world that the trial removed every moonscorched monster, actually, it would make sense!\n...\nAnd lastly, there was Lana.\nAlone in her apartment complex, she felt a tangle of emotions as she watched the broadcast.\n\"Didn't they say they were going somewhere else?\" she murmured to herself, trying to piece together the truth.\nBut, in opposition to all the others, who were shocked and/or worried, Lana, on the other hand was... relieved.\n\"PHEW!\" She laughed, \"And here I was thinking they went to have sex behind my back!\"\nShe had thought about this possibility since they first spoke, but she couldn't stop Stark from having a relationship with Sora if he wanted.\nThe best she could do was wait for him, and see if he would like her to join.\nInstead, he was in a trial that could kill him at any moment!\nHer relief, however, didn't last long.\n\"WAIT WHAT?!\"\nAs she clutched her phone, her fingers shook, her mind reeling at the dangers Stark would be facing.\nShe didn't understand why they both hid this from her, but there must be a reason.\nStark and Sora wouldn't betray her, she knew it, and Sora wouldn't play dirty in romance, maybe she would even be willing to share if it came to it, who knows.\nBut then why are they there?!\n...\nAround the world, the reactions varied.\nSome were curious, others worried, and a few were dismissive.\nBut everyone was tuned in, watching closely.\nWhether they were protective like Sora's family, bewildered like Stark's, or holding their breath in fear like Lana, one thing was certain: everyone was watching, waiting to see who would make it out alive.\nThe trial continued, and the world held its breath.\nBack in the trial, the timer finally reached 0, and as the dark barrier that stopped them from leaving the [Hollow Tower Square] formed.\nA message appeared.\n[Get ready to fight.]",

      "content": "A message hovered in the air in front of each participant:\n[Get ready to fight.]\nAnd then–\nFWISH! RUMBLE!\nThe ground shook, and from the shadows emerged every elite monster still roaming the trial.\nThe atmosphere of the Hollow Tower square, which was up until now only filled with the other participants, changed drastically as five terrifying figures appeared.\nThe first was the Mayor.\nClothed in fine, noble attire, he looked oddly dignified, but his grotesque face twisted with moonscorched madness.\nHis beige skin sagged, his bald head crowned by two sharp, triangular horns.\nHe gripped a fork in his right hand and a knife in his left, his weapons glinting ominously.\nAnd before anyone could react, he threw his knife toward the [Ultimate Clone], hitting it straight on and making it disappear.\n\"OH COME ON,\" Stark was the one who shouted, \"WHY HIM?!\"\n\"Because I felt like it.\"\n[Termina's Mayor - Level 600 Moonscorch Commander]\nBehind him were his loyal servants:\nA group of three identical butlers, each dressed in black suits with white gloves.\nThey followed the Mayor closely, never leaving his side.\nThe Butler Trio's skill, [Loyal Regeneration], meant they'd revive endlessly as long as the Mayor was alive.\n[Butler Trio - Level 590 Mini-Boss]\nThe next creature was The Tormented One, released by Artist from the museum.\nA skinless, humanoid horror, its red muscles and sinews exposed under a cloak made from its own skin.\nWith no mouth, it couldn't scream, but its mere presence radiated agony, as if each step was a testament to endless suffering.\n[Tormented One - Level 600 Moonscorch Commander]\nBeside it stood The Heartless One.\nShe was feminine, yet terrifying, almost divine.\nShe wore a dark suit, her face disturbingly serene, framed by a golden halo above her head.\nIn her hands were a golden spear and a black blade. Her black wings stretched wide, casting a shadow over the battlefield.\n[Heartless One - Level 600 Moonscorch Commander]\nThen there was Eternal Regret.\nIt towered over the rest, a writhing, shifting mass of shadows that seemed alive.\nIts form constantly morphed, the twisted faces of children screaming and crying within it.\nTheir agony filled the air, a haunting chorus that chilled everyone who heard it.\n[Eternal Regret - Level 600 Elite]\nStark already knew about that thing.\nThe creature absorbed anything thrown at it.\nPhysical attacks were useless against it, after all, he had hit it hundreds of time over with [Asura's Arms].\nThese five horrific beings were the last obstacles standing between the participants and their goal.\nThen, a new message appeared:\n[Killing other participants is completely allowed. In the end, only one may enter the tower and face the moons.]\nThe phrase sent chills through them all.\n\"Face the moons?\" CEO raised his eyebrows, a grin creeping onto his face. \"I knew it. This is a [Death] difficulty trial for a reason.\"\nThis meant that even if they survived each other and the bosses… they'd still have to face the moons themselves to win.\nA daunting, nearly impossible task.\nEveryone exchanged uneasy glances.\nMeanwhile, Follower remained unfazed.\nA private message had appeared just for him:\n[Do not worry about the moons. If you beat them, you'll take their places—and more.]\n\"Yes, lord,\" Follower murmured with grim determination, his gaze locked onto Stark.\nIn contrast, Clever chuckled to himself, rubbing his beard.\n\"Let's see how these young ones handle this.\"\nThe old man was so confident in his powers against everyone that he didn't even know if he should actually use them or just stand back as a spectator.\nAfter all, a single reveal of his domination power would result in nobody attempting to kill him, much like with Stark.\nThe countdown appeared in front of everyone.\n[3…]\nAuras flared around each participant.\nStark's aura burned crimson.\n[2…]\nThe five monstrous bosses prepared themselves, each one radiating a terrifying presence.\n[1…]\nThe participants glanced at each other, each silently debating whether to focus on the monsters or turn on each other first.\n[FIGHT!]\nThe trial began.\nWithout hesitation, Stark dashed forward, heading straight for [Eternal Regret].\nHe was the first to move among all, taking even the monsters aback.\nEven they needed to think of their strategy if they wanted to win against the humans, yet here was that guy, instantly fighting.\n\"You beat me once!\" Stark laughed, charging with fierce determination. \"I'll kill you now, just like I killed Hugo!\"\nHe launched a flurry of [Crimson Spears] straight at Eternal Regret.\nBut as soon as the spears touched the shadowy creature, they were absorbed into its writhing form.\nThe spears vanished, leaving no trace.\n\"Damn it!\" Stark cursed, \"It's gonna work at some point!\"\n[Eternal Regret] only had one hp, so any attack would instantly kill it.\nHe tried again, sending a [Holy Infusion]-charged punch as that thing definitely looked demonic, but the impact did nothing.\nEternal Regret absorbed the energy, unaffected.\nSora, meanwhile, had her sights on The Heartless One.\nHer eyes narrowed, calculating the right moment to strike.\nShe darted forward with a flash, her [Vine Sword] swinging in a precise arc.\nCLANG!\nThe Heartless One blocked Sora's attack effortlessly with her golden spear.\n\"Yawn...\"\nTheir weapons clashed, sparks flying as Sora's sword met the black blade in the Heartless One's left hand.\n\"Strong….\" Sora muttered, her grip tightening as she pushed back, unleashing a barrage of strikes.\n\"THAT'S MY GIRL!\" Mike Gardenis, Sora's father, shouted from the comfort of their living room.\nThe Heartless One moved with serene grace, deflecting each attack with chilling ease.\n\"Forgot about me?\" but Lilith also jumped in the fight, wanting to help out her new friend.\n\"Fool,\" Heartless didn't seem bothered, raising her spear.\nOn the other side of the battlefield, CEO aimed his sights on the Mayor.\n\"We meet again,\" The Mayor sneered, raising his fork and knife like a twisted nobleman ready to feast.\nHis butlers stood at his side, their eyes locked on CEO with unflinching loyalty.\nCEO raised his hand, unleashing a powerful beam of energy.\nZAP!\nThe beam struck the Mayor square in the chest, but he merely chuckled, shrugging it off.\nThe Butler Trio moved in front of him, shielding him from any further attacks.\n\"PLATE THROW!\" The Mayor's mocking grin grew wider as the butlers threw their plates at CEO, forcing him to retreat.\n\"Alright, then. I'll play along.\" CEO smirked, summoning a barrier to protect himself.\nHe fired again, determined to pierce the Mayor's defenses.\n\"I'll help you, old man,\" Artist sighed, appearing beside CEO, \"But I'll expect compensation.\"\n\"Heh? Trying to get money in such a situation, we don't even know if we'll all live.\"\n\"Doesn't matter, I just want to get money.\"\n\"Fine by me, I have too much of it anyway,\" CEO smirked.\nMeanwhile, Follower watched from the shadows, his eyes locked on Stark.\nHe used one of his perks [Shadow Veil] to hide from everyone and everything.\nHe hadn't forgotten his mission.\nWhile everyone else was distracted, he moved, blending into the darkness, positioning himself close to Stark.\nHe waited for the perfect moment to strike, his [Skill Canceller] in hand.\nClever, standing back, watched the chaos unfold with a grin.\n\"These fools are doing all the work for me.\" He murmured, crossing his arms.\nBut when his eyes landed on The Tormented One, he raised an eyebrow.\n\"Hmm, you might actually be worth my time.\"\nWith a powerful stomp, Clever launched himself forward, not even bothering to activate his aura, slamming his fist into The Tormented One.\nHis strength reverberated through the ground, but the creature barely flinched.\nIt turned its hollow gaze on Clever, its expressionless face radiating pain and suffering.\n\"Oh?\"\n...\nBack at Stark, he wasn't giving up on Eternal Regret.\n\"Fine. Absorb this!\" He unleashed [Asura's Wrath], summoning multiple crimson arms to pummel the creature from every angle.\nThe fists struck Eternal Regret, each blow heavy with energy.\nBut like before, it absorbed every hit, growing darker and more chaotic with each one.\nIt wasn't even retaliating!\nStark clenched his jaw.\n\"There has to be a way…\" He muttered, frustration building.\nLilith shifted her strategy.\nShe broke off from her clash with the Heartless One and aimed a powerful [Qi Pulse] blast at the Heartless One's exposed face.\nThe attack hit, but the Heartless One merely tilted her head, unaffected.\n\"Tch…\" Lilith frowned. \"Looks like brute force isn't enough.\"\nThe Mayor, meanwhile, had CEO cornered.\nHis butlers kept regenerating, returning to shield him each time CEO blasted them away.\n\"Annoying pests!\" CEO growled, backing up to gain some space.\n\"You should be careful,\" Artist smiled, not having done anything until now, instead focusing his mind on his future creation to possibly win.\nThe Mayor chuckled darkly, raising his fork as if about to feast on his prey.\n\"You're nothing but an appetizer, dear CEO, and I see that your other friend is already gone.\"\nCEO's eyes narrowed.\n\"He wasn't my friend.\"\nWith a shout, he unleashed his [Money Wave] skill, sending a massive wave of energy toward the Mayor and his butlers.\nThe blast knocked them back, giving CEO a brief moment to breathe.\nSo basically, this is how it is going:\nStark VS Eternal Regret.\nSora and Lilith VS Heartless One\nCEO and Artist VS Mayor and Butler Trio\nClever VS Tormented one, though the former is mostly having fun with it.\nAnd finally, Follower is just hiding, the chaos of the square allowing him to not be noticed, lurking around Stark and waiting for the boy to give him an opening.\nUnknown to him, though, Stark could perfectly see him.\n[Watch out.]\n[Focus] had already warned him, and so he was ready to counter-attack Follower at any time, though he wanted to focus on [Eternal Regret].\nRight as Stark gave another punch to the beast...\nIt finally decided to activate its skill.\n\"Release...\"\nThe chaos would be much worse now.",

I can't do it...\" Artist muttered, his eyes wide with fear.\nHis voice trembled as he stared at the Mayor. \"I... I need more time...\"\nIn opposition to what you might believe, it had already been 10 minutes since the battle started.\nAnd the Mayor had strangely only been aiming at Artist, already hitting him twice with his weapons.\n\"Come on, citizen, accept your fate,\" Mayor laughed.\n\"FUCK YOU-\"\nBefore he could finish his sentence, the Mayor extended his hand.\nIn an instant, Artist was lifted off the ground, his body frozen in mid-air.\nThe Mayor's voice was calm, unyielding.\n\"You should've known better than to think you could challenge me.\"\nArtist opened his mouth to try and insult him again, but before he could say another word, the Mayor gestured.\nA thick, sharp blade of energy extended from the ground, piercing straight through Artist's chest.\n\"FUCK!\" CEO rushed forward.\nArtist's body was cleaved in half, his hand reaching desperately towards Stark as his final breath left him.\n\"My... master...piece...\" Artist thought before dying.\n\"USELESS!\" CEO shouted as he used [Mana Laser] to try and damage the Mayor.\n...\nStark's eyes burned with fury as the Mayor executed Artist so effortlessly.\nHe had been watching the scene unfold from a distance, his mind focused on Eternal Regret in front of him.\nHe didn't care about Artist, but the fact one of them died so easily while none of the elites were down meant that they could all die.\n[Ding!]\n[\"Artist\" has been killed by \"Mayor\"!]\n[6 participants remain.]\nThe battle was no longer about tactics or strategy for Stark. It was about rage.\nHis anger swelled, drowning out everything else.\nThe souls of the damned in Eternal Regret seemed to feed off his fury, their screams growing louder, more intense.\nStark's hands clenched into fists.\nIt was time to end it.\nClever, meanwhile, was enjoying himself more than anything.\nThe Tormented One was relentless, its body made of endless writhing tendrils of agony.\nBut Clever wasn't using any of his advanced skills.\nNo, he was fighting it with nothing more than basic strikes and pure strength.\nHe didn't even summon his [100-Golden Arms Statue], instead only summoning [Golden Gauntlets] around his hands to make it more fun.\nHand Slam, Radiant Pulse, and Crushing Palm—each blow landed with such force that the Tormented One wanted to in pain, its form shifting to avoid each attack.\nBut Clever's hands were unstoppable, and each hit sent shockwaves through the creature.\n\"Is this really all you can do?\" Clever chuckled, sidestepping an attack. \"How disappointing.\"\nHe moved with fluid precision, blocking and countering the Tormented One's strikes with ease.\nIt was almost as if he were playing with it, enjoying the battle for what it was.\nThe world, all watching everything unfold before them, were baffled.\nHis power was beyond anything they could comprehend.\nAnd all the participants as well.\nThese monsters, these humans, they were all so strong, and yet all fighting in front of their eyes.\nIt was probably the most entertaining scene they had scene in years.\n...\nBack at the center of the battlefield, Stark was now fully focused on Eternal Regret.\nHe had had enough of this.\nHe activated his [Double Assault] skill, doubling his stats for 20 seconds.\nHis body surged with power, and the four crimson arms from his Asura's Arms skill erupted around him.\nEach arm clenched into a fist, radiating an aura of violent intent.\nWithout a moment's hesitation, Stark dashed forward.\nHis speed was impossible to follow.\nThe world seemed to slow as he closed the gap between himself and the creature.\nBut instead of attacking with his fists, Stark did something reckless that could probably take him out if [Eternal Regret] decided to use [Release] again.\nHe reached out with all of his arms and took hold of Eternal Regret.\nThe creature screamed, thrashing in his grip, but Stark's strength held it in place.\nIt was now or never.\nStark raised one of his hands to the sky, focusing every ounce of his energy.\nHe drew a circle in his palm, feeling the raw power build within him.\n\"GO TO HELL, FUCKING DEMON!\"\nHEAVEN'S WRATH!\nThe sky above seemed to crack as a massive beam of light began charging up.\nOne second later though, it was already ready, Stark's aura speeding up the process.\nIt tore through the air with incredible force, shaking the battlefield.\nThe other participants and monsters scattered, scrambling to avoid the descending beam.\nEven the [Crimson Moons Trio] went out of the way, scared to be hit by another one of the boy's attacks.\nYet Stark didn't move.\nThe beam was wide, nearly impossible to avoid.\nThe shockwaves from the blast rattled the ground, sending tremors through the square.\nThe souls within Eternal Regret shrieked as they were about to be enveloped by the light.\nBOOOOOM!\nStark held on, gritting his teeth as the beam drew closer.\nJust as it was about to hit the ground, Stark released his grip on the creature.\nSNAP!\nHe wasn't stupid, and he had obviously set up a [Crimson Ball Transmission] just in case he needed to escape.\nIn an instant he was out of harm's way.\nAnd so the beam descended to the ground with a deafening roar.\nEternal Regret was caught in the full force of the blast, its form disintegrating under the sheer weight of the energy.\nThe souls that made up its body screamed one last time, and then they were gone, ascended into nothingness.\n-1!\nIt actually received damage.\n\"HAHAHAHA!\" and Stark couldn't help but laugh.\nThe beam finally faded, and the battlefield was silent.\n[You have defeated \"Eternal Regret\". You have received 1 experience point.]\nA single experience point for that was blasphemy, but Stark didn't care, too focused on what to do next.\nHe wasn't done. Not yet.\nActually, he was ready for more, his anger not stopping at all.",

      "content": "Stark stood among the wreckage of his battle with Eternal Regret, breathing heavily, his eyes scanning the chaotic battlefield.\nThe message flashed before him and every other participant:\n[Eternal Regret has been killed by \"Chosen\"]\n[6 Participants Alive: Chosen, Sora, Lilith, Follower, Clever, and CEO.]\n[4 Monsters Alive: Mayor, Butler Trio, Tormented One, Heartless One.]\nHe didn't waste a moment, and he didn't care about taking a break or anything of the sort.\nThere were still monsters to take down, and he wanted to do it quickly.\nAs he turned, he caught sight of Sora and Lilith struggling against a towering figure with black wings: the Heartless One.\nThey were keeping their ground, but their breaths were heavy, their movements slowing.\nA bit farther, Clever faced off against the Tormented One, moving in sharp, precise strikes that seemed to almost mock the creature.\nThough for some strange reason, no matter how many times Clever hit that thing, it simply wouldn't go down.\nCEO, meanwhile, battled the Mayor and his three butlers, looking barely able to fend them off.\nAnd somewhere in the shadows lurked Follower.\nStark frowned.\nHe could sense Follower's presence nearby, and that dark aura he carried was all too familiar.\nThe moment he had seen Follower, he'd sensed it.\n\"Godless Demon?\" he had thought, a shiver running down his spine.\nIt was an aura he'd felt twice before, and it had always signaled danger.\nBut there wasn't time to worry about him now.\nSora and Lilith needed help.\nWithout hesitation, Stark dashed toward them, his mind quickly analyzing the situation.\nHe activated [Perception] as he moved, locking onto the Heartless One's stats and skills.\n...\n[Name: Heartless One, Moonscorch Commander, Immortal-Level]\n[Level: 600]\n[HP: 10,000,000]\n[Skills: Halo of Despair, Spear of Divine Ruin, Blackblade Cleave, Winged Judgment, Duality Strike, Serene Malice, Harbinger's Descent, Soul Rapture, Heavenly Spearfall, Void Embrace, Golden Retribution, Sin Seeker, Angel's Lament, Dark Purification (Mythical), Eternal Suffering (Mythical), Celestial Annihilation (Godly), Eternal Suffering (Godly), Divine Scorn (Immortal)]\n...\nStark's eyes narrowed.\nHeartless One was far from an ordinary foe. He had to act fast.\nSora and Lilith barely held their ground, sweat lining their faces as they kept striking with everything they had.\nLilith's [Celestial Blades] sliced through the air while Sora's [Vine Sword] lashed out like a green whip.\nBut Heartless One only laughed, deflecting each attack with ease using her own golden spear or dark blade.\n\"When will you learn?\" she sneered, her voice dripping with arrogance as she pushed them away, \"Let's end this.\"\nWith a cold smirk, she activated [Eternal Suffering].\n[Eternal Suffering: Stabs her spear into the ground, anchoring her opponents' shadows to it. Enemies bound in this way are immobilized for 8 seconds, taking continuous damage as their shadows try to pull free.]\nA dark, twisted aura formed around her as she plunged her spear into the ground.\nInstantly, shadows lashed out, pinning Sora and Lilith in place.\nBoth girls gasped, unable to move as dark energy coursed through them, sapping their strength.\nHeartless One raised her spear, a merciless glint in her eyes as she dashed toward the girls, wanting to get rid of them both once and for all.\nBut before she could strike, Stark lunged forward, his [Spear Block] active.\nHe intercepted Heartless One's spear just in time, blocking the blow and deflecting it.\n\"Nice try.\"\nThe force of the clash sent a shockwave rippling through the area, but Stark held firm, his eyes locked onto Heartless One.\nSora and Lilith staggered back, freed from the immobilizing shadows.\n\"Thanks…\" Sora whispered, catching her breath.\n\"No time for thanks. Focus,\" Stark said sharply, not taking his eyes off Heartless One.\nHeartless One's eyes narrowed, a hint of irritation flashing across her face. \"Another fool,\" she murmured, her wings flaring.\nStark launched forward, fists wrapped in the crimson glow of [Aura Smash].\nHe threw a barrage of flying crimson punches using [Spam], each one a phantom fist that pounded toward Heartless One.\n[Spam Perk: Instead of summoning 5 fists to either send them at your enemies or merging them to do immense damage, you can instead decide to separate these fists into five distinct ones too, meaning 25 crimson fists. Not very good damage and no stun, though.]\nShe deflected the first few with her spear, but the intensity of his assault forced her to step back, her calm demeanor slipping.\nLilith joined in, her [Qi Sword Creation] flickering to life, slashing through the air and aiming for Heartless One's exposed side.\nThe blade left trails of glowing energy, each strike intensifying with Lilith's focus.\nSora followed, her vines emerging from the ground to overwhelm the boss.\nHeartless One snarled, her wings folding protectively as she activated [Wings of Shadowlight], turning momentarily invulnerable.\n[Envelops herself in a mix of light and shadow, granting her temporary invulnerability for 5 seconds. Attacks directed at her during this time are reflected back at 50% power.]\nEvery strike from Stark, Sora, and Lilith bounced off her, each blow deflecting back in shimmering bursts.\nThe effect only lasted five seconds, but it was enough for Heartless One to reposition.\nShe leaped into the air, diving back down with [Harbinger's Descent], sending a shockwave that forced them all back.\nStark gritted his teeth, sliding to a stop.\nHis [Focus] picked up a shift in her stance—she was about to use [Soul Rapture].\n[Locks eyes with an enemy, channeling dark energy to rip a portion of their soul. This siphons health and reduces the enemy's stamina, healing the Heartless One and boosting her damage output briefly.]\n\"Don't let her lock eyes with you!\" he shouted.\nBut it was too late.\nHer dark gaze met Sora's, and a tendril of energy lashed out, sapping Sora's health and adding it to Heartless One's own.\nSora's face paled, her knees buckling.\nStark threw himself in front of her and sent his [Crimson Spears] in a sweeping arc, forcing Heartless One to break her focus.\nLilith seized the opening, her [Mystic Bindings] wrapping around Heartless One, momentarily holding her in place.\n\"Now!\" Lilith shouted, her voice strained.\nStark summoned [Spear of Judgment], a colossal weapon forming above him, radiating holy light. He hurled it down with all his might, aiming to break through Heartless One's defense.\nThe spear smashed into her, sending her reeling back, her wings fluttering weakly.\n-2,783,911!\nThe damage was incredible!\nBut Heartless One's fury only grew.\n\"Enough!\" she roared, her voice echoing with rage.\nWith a flick of her hand, she unleashed [Void Embrace], a zone of distorted energy that made their vision swim, hallucinations flickering in and out.\nStark blinked, his sight blurred, but he steeled himself, using [Focus] to stay on track, dodging her [Duality Strike] as it aimed for him.\nShe understood that Stark was the reason she was losing ground in this battle, and so just like all the others, she aimed for him.\nLilith, breathing hard, lifted her hand and activated [Qi Barrier], protecting herself and Sora from the swirling dark energy around them.\nThen she channeled her [Healing Aura], restoring some of her strength and helping Sora recover.\nThe emotionless girl obviously didn't stand still either, using [Regenerative Drop].\nHeartless One scowled, raising her black blade high, her voice a low growl.\n\"Do you really think you can win? I am beyond your reach!\" She charged at them, her blade glowing with a dark light as she executed [Blackblade Cleave], sending waves of damaging energy in every direction.\nStark twisted, dodging, while Sora and Lilith managed to avoid the worst of it, though their movements were visibly slowing.\nRealizing their fatigue, Stark knew he needed to do it all himself, grabbing Heartless One's spear with his six arms (4 from [Asura's Wrath]), then after punching her away.\n-432,904!\n\"You…you DARE!\" Heartless One screeched, her wings stretching to their fullest.\nAnd so with a look of utter contempt, she activated one of her most powerful skills.\n[Celestial Annihilation].\nAt that moment, the battlefield seemed to freeze.\nHeartless One's dark and holy energies merged around her, swirling into an ominous, crackling aura.\nHer spear and blade aligned as she pointed them forward, the mixed energy converging into a single, colossal beam of power.\nStark, Sora, and Lilith barely had time to react, their eyes widening as the blinding light intensified.\nThe air hummed with an unbearable tension, and Stark's heartbeat thundered in his ears.\nThe ground shook as Heartless One released the devastating blast, the beam stretching across the battlefield with unimaginable force, heading straight for them.\nThe sheer power and size of the attack left everyone stunned, and even the other participants and monsters knew they could be damaged if it hit them.",

      "content": "The Heartless One raised her arms, summoning her deadly attack.\nA massive surge of energy erupted, taking shape into a blinding, radiant sphere.\nHer skill, [Celestial Annihilation], pulsed with a terrifying light, building power before it would release destruction upon everything in its path.\nStark's eyes went wide, realizing the deadly force behind it.\nEveryone else on the battlefield looked up, dread washing over them as the raw energy hummed louder, ready to consume everything.\nEven the boss monsters knew they couldn't be hit by that thing.\nSora instinctively reached into her inventory, pulling out her [Protection Amulet].\nIt was her one plan—a way to shield them from the blast.\nBut just as she was about to activate it, Stark's hand shot out, gripping her wrist tightly.\n\"DON'T USE THAT!\" he shouted.\nHis grip was firm, too firm, but he couldn't afford to be gentle right now.\n\"That's for later,\" he added, his tone urgent.\nSora stared back, wide-eyed, but she trusted him.\nShe tucked the amulet back, watching as Stark prepared for what came next.\nWithout another word, Stark scooped up Sora and Lilith, holding them securely with [Asura's Arms].\nThen, he aimed a [Crimson Ball Transmission] just behind the blast radius, snapping his fingers.\nIn an instant, they teleported out of the blast's range, landing safely a good distance away.\nThe three of them watched from afar, and Stark let out a tense breath.\nNow it was up to the others to survive on their own.\nThe Mayor stood his ground as the [Celestial Annihilation] hurtled toward him, his face calm.\nHe crossed his arms, activating his skill, [Giant Utensils].\nThe knife and fork in his hands enlarged, gleaming with energy as he positioned them before him.\nAs the deadly blast struck, he swung the utensils, deflecting the energy to the sides, letting it split and crash into the ground around him. He stood in the center of the storm, unfazed.\nIn the shadows, Follower watched, his dark form blending perfectly with the surroundings.\nHe didn't even flinch as the blast neared.\nHe simply melded further into the shadows, the attack passing over him as if he weren't even there.\nHe stayed completely hidden, waiting for his perfect moment.\nThe Butler Trio stood close by, but without any special defense in their arsenal, they faced the brunt of the blast head-on.\nThe blinding light washed over them, their bodies disintegrating instantly.\nYet, only seconds later, their forms began to reappear, reforming themselves with eerie resilience.\nNot too far away, the Tormented One remained still as the blast surged toward him.\nIt struck him directly, the immense power rippling over his body.\n-0!\nBut there was no effect—no damage registered.\nEven when Clever had toyed with him earlier, punching him around, he hadn't taken a single hit.\nThe others could only wonder if he had been through so much pain and torture that he'd become completely immune.\nEither way, the attack didn't harm him.\nHe stood there, untouched.\nClever, however, decided he wasn't going to just stand still.\nThough he didn't yet feel like using his power yet, [100-Golden Arms Statue], he wasn't going to leave himself exposed, either.\nWith a quick command, he activated [Ironclad Defense].\nFive massive golden hands appeared, each one of them positioned around him in a protective formation.\nThe blast hit the hands, dispersing against their glowing surfaces, but Clever stood safely behind, unharmed.\nAll eyes now turned to one remaining participant: CEO.\nHe froze, seeing the massive blast bearing down on him, and quickly scanned through his skills.\nThere had to be something that could protect him…\nBut as he mentally flipped through each one, he felt panic rising.\nMost of his skills were for attacks—countless powerful beams, destructive waves—but very few were defensive.\nIn desperation, he activated [Diamond Defense] first, a barrier of glittering, diamond-hard energy forming around him.\nHe added [Infinite Cascade], sending a barrage of beams forward, hoping to weaken the blast.\nThen he launched [Endless Beam], followed by [Beam Genesis], firing everything he could into the oncoming energy.\nHis beams clashed with the annihilation blast, struggling to hold it back.\nBut after a few moments, he realized it was useless.\nHis eyes widened.\n\"AH, FUCK THIS!\" CEO shouted, activating every attack skill he had, throwing everything at the blast, hoping to create an impenetrable wall of energy.\nBut the blast continued, ripping through his beams and defenses.\nBOOOOM!\nIt hit him dead on, a searing wave of energy enveloping his form.\nHe activated a few last-ditch life-saving items—[Protection Enhancement] and [Instant-Healing Orb]—just barely clinging to life.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the light faded.\nHe stood there, smoke rising from his body, his HP dangerously low.\n[CEO: 12,832/235,000]\n\"Heh…\" he breathed, trying to keep his composure, \"Looks like I'm still good to go—\"\nHe joked around, wanting to prove his superiority, but before he could even finish his sentence...\nKnife Slash!\nThe Mayor materialized behind him and swung.\nWithout warning, the Mayor's knife sliced through CEO's torso, cutting him clean in half.\nThe two halves of CEO's body fell to the ground, lifeless.\n\"You went out the same way as your subordinate, how does it feel,\" Mayor laughed so hard that everyone else stopped what they were doing to look at him.\nEven people in the outside world had chills go down their spines as they saw just how quick he had died.\nCEO, real name Miles Volkov, an extremely wealthy businessman that could have anything he wanted, had died, just like that.\nMoney and power didn't save him.\nThe world was getting more scared by the second.\nThe more they watched this trial and the participants die, the more scared they became.\n[If all participants die, a terrible event will happen]\nAnd to rub the salt in the wound, the panel that they feared appeared back.\nDing!\n[\"CEO\" has been killed by \"Mayor\"]\n[5 Participants Alive]\nThe blast from [Celestial Annihilation] had left a massive crater behind, almost destroying half of the Hollow Tower Square.\nMayor glanced around the wreckage with a grin before looking up at the sky, \"The area's too small, moons,\" he called out, barely able to contain his amusement.\n\"Deal with it,\" the cold voice of the moons replied, cutting off his complaint. \"And kill the rest of them quickly.\"\nMayor shrugged, casually seating himself on the ground. \"Alright, alright,\" he replied with a smirk. \"But I think I'll rest a bit for now.\"\nHe watched the remaining participants, eyes gleaming with anticipation.\nMeanwhile, Stark set Sora and Lilith down, both of them looking worn from the encounter.\nHe took a moment to catch his breath, then grinned.\n\"Stay here,\" he told them, a fierce look in his eyes. \"I'm getting rid of that bitch.\"\nHe turned his gaze to the Heartless One, who stood across from him, watching him with a mocking smile.\n\"How foolish,\" she said, eyes narrowed. \"Deciding to fight me? Alone?\"\nStark cracked his knuckles, his grin widening. \"I don't need anybody to kick your ass.\"\nBut he wasn't reckless.\nHe knew her stats were likely a match for his, and she had powerful skills that could turn the tide if he wasn't careful.\nHe glanced back at Sora. \"Pass me the [Double Speed Token],\" he said, holding out his hand.\nSora quickly pulled it from her inventory and handed it to him.\n[Double Speed Token: Doubles your speed stats for 5 minutes.]\nWith his current speed of 28,000—and boosted further by his [Domination Buff]—this would push him well over 60,000.\nThat is how he always dominated with [Double Assault] except if the monsters had countermeasures.\nWith that kind of speed, he could outmaneuver even powerhouses at level 800 or 900.\n\"Let's see if I can manage...\"\nHe crushed the token, feeling its power surge through him, a thrill of energy filling his veins.\n[Speed stat doubled for 5 minutes.]\nStark clenched his fists, feeling the sheer speed pulsing in his limbs.\nHe looked up at the Heartless One, his grin turning into a determined glare.\n\"Alright,\" he said. \"Let's do this, you ugly monster.\"",

      "content": "Stark's body shot forward like a blur, so fast that even Clever, the sharpest observer among them, couldn't follow.\nHe was a streak, a line of movement, and by the time Heartless caught on, he was right in front of her.\nBut Stark hadn't won yet.\nBecause…\n\"Heh,\" Heartless smirked, her dark eyes narrowing as she felt Stark's speed bearing down on her. \"You're not the only one who can do this.\"\nIn that instant, her aura shifted.\nHeartless activated her strongest skill.\nDIVINE SCORN!\n[Description: if a situation becomes too overwhelming, your hatred and dislike will merge together to double one of your stats for the rest of the battle.]\nA surge of power exploded around her, a dark energy wrapping over her like armor.\nThis was no ordinary skill. This was her Immortal-Level skill, a skill fueled by hatred itself, turning her bitterness into raw power.\n\"SPEED!\" she shouted, her voice echoing as she chose the stat she wanted to double.\nThe dark energy flared around her, doubling her speed.\nIn the blink of an eye, she matched Stark's swiftness.\nNow they were on equal ground.\nStark grinned.\nHe sent one of his crimson spears flying toward her, aiming right at her chest.\nBut she deflected it with a flick of her black blade.\n\"Hahaha,\" Stark laughed. \"Looks like you aren't as stupid as I thought!\"\nHeartless rolled her eyes, smiling back. \"Shhh, boy, you're not my type.\"\nStark raised an eyebrow. \"Thank god. I'd be worried if I was!\"\nAnd then—\nBOOM!\nThe clash was like thunder.\nBoth of them moved at such impossible speeds that all anyone saw was a blur.\nThey collided again and again, each impact ringing out with a deafening echo.\nThey were like ghosts, vanishing and reappearing in rapid bursts, each blow shaking the ground.\nIn the real world, viewers watching the broadcast were left in disbelief.\n\"Put it in slow mode!\" someone shouted.\n\"Idiot! It's a broadcast; you can't rewind it!\"\nEach time Stark swung a fist, Heartless countered with her golden spear or her dark sword, every blow either blocked or redirected.\nThey were equally matched, each of their movements precise, fluid, deadly.\nHeartless lashed out with Halo of Despair, a dark aura enveloping her, lowering Stark's defenses and slowing his reactions.\nStark felt it immediately, his body growing heavier, his movements just a touch slower.\n[Description: Creates an ominous aura around her, lowering the defense and speed of enemies within a 30-meter radius by 20%. The aura slowly drains their energy, weakening their attacks.]\nShe followed up with Spear of Divine Ruin, thrusting her spear with lightning speed, aiming for Stark's chest.\nStark barely dodged, but the tip grazed him, leaving a burning mark that intensified the pain.\n-9,834!\n\"Hah!\" Heartless cackled, eyes glinting. \"Feeling the pressure yet?\"\nBut Stark wasn't about to back down.\nHe lunged forward with his fists, each punch fast as a bullet, yet she deflected every single one, her smile only growing wider.\nThey clashed again and again, and slowly, Stark realized something alarming: Heartless was… better than him.\nShe was faster with each move, deflecting, parrying, countering in ways that left him struggling to keep up.\nTwo minutes passed, and he was still getting nowhere.\nThen, Stark's eyes narrowed.\nHe realized what he needed to do.\nA grin spread across his face, a dangerous glint lighting up his gaze.\n\"Alright...\" he breathed in and out, making everyone look at him.\nDomination Soul!\nWithout hesitation, Stark summoned his Soul Heart.\nA small, crimson heart appeared in his hand, pulsing with a fierce energy that only he could control.\nHe held it up, and suddenly, everyone watching felt a chill run down their spines.\nInstantly, not only the participants, but all those in the real world held their breath as they realized something.\nHow was this guy summoning a soul heart, even though with everything they saw until now, he clearly wasn't a [Soul Wielder]?\nThere was little to no info about the trial, but if it was the [Domination] trial, then doesn't it mean it was another class.\nThey knew what this meant.\nAnd yet...\n\"Hm...\" Clever scratched his beard, even he was wondering who the hell was that kid.\nFollower, standing nearby, looked baffled. \"What…? He's using a Soul Heart?\"\n\"What the...\" Lilith, who had never seen Stark use his soul heart until now, was also surprised.\nTo them, all previous skills could be given to the domination class, but this one, no, it couldn't, it had to be the [Soul Wielder] class.\nAnd even in the real world, the panic was spreading, news were reporting like crazy, and chat forums were exploding.\n\"A SOUL HEART?!\"\n\"But it doesn't make sense, he didn't even use it until now?!\"\n\"Can Soul Wielders fight without them...?\"\n\"No!\"\nAnd of course, the most shocked people of all were Stark's family, who's jaws quite literally hit the ground.\n\"What the...\" Aiden, Stark's Father, looked at the TV screen with widened eyes.\nThe attention of the entire world was now on the boy as the camera focused on his fight.\n\"Honey, this is... impossible? They said for sure there was no chance he would awaken this class...\"\n\"Mom?!\" Lara screamed.\n\"Oh come on, my friends are asking if I can introduce them to my brother...\" Nissa sighed.\nEveryone, everywhere, was shocked, and now all they could do was see what Stark could do with that smiling crimson heart of his.\n=).\nStark's grin widened. \"Alright, let's end this,\" he said, holding the heart up like a weapon.\nHeartless blinked, her gaze narrowing in suspicion.\n\"Let's go!\" Stark shouted, swinging his Soul Heart forward, aiming it directly at Heartless.\nHeartless raised her spear in defense, but Stark's soul weapon was relentless.\nWith a twist of his wrist, he sent a wave of energy crashing toward her, catching her off guard.\nShe tried to counter, but the force of Stark's attack was too strong.\n-148,392!\nThey clashed, once, twice, three times, moving so fast that their figures blurred even more.\nEach strike sent shockwaves through the ground, breaking rocks and cracking the earth beneath them.\nStark pressed forward, driving her back step by step.\nShe retaliated with her Winged Judgment, summoning dark feathers from her wings, each feather homing in on Stark.\nThey exploded around him, bursts of dark energy filling the air.\nBut Stark powered through, his fists smashing through the feathers, each impact causing a burst of dark energy that he ignored entirely.\nHis determination was unbreakable.\nThe fight was brutal, unforgiving.\n\"Why don't you learn?\" the boy mocked, sensing that Heartless was getting more overwhelmed by the second.\nHeartless launched a new barrage, this time using Blackblade Cleave, her black blade releasing a wave of dark energy that lingered in the air.\nStark dodged most of it, but he was forced to move through part of the wave, feeling his energy sapped, his strength waver for just a moment.\n\"Hmph,\" Heartless sneered, her eyes gleaming with victory. \"Not so tough now, are you?\"\nStark laughed, barely fazed. \"You talk too much.\"\nHe swung his Soul Heart again, this time pouring more energy into it, the crimson glow flaring.\nHeartless moved to block with her spear, but the impact sent her skidding back, her defenses barely holding.\n\"You think you're so good, huh?\" Stark began to rant midfight, \"All of you think you own this fucking place, well, don't worry about that, I'll send you back to Godless, your little master.\nEach move was faster, more intense.\nHeartless responded in kind, her Duality Strike unleashing a mix of holy and dark energy that exploded around them both.\nThey moved so fast that no one in the audience could keep track.\nBut Stark was reaching his limit.\n[2:12 minutes of \"Double Speed\" left.]\nHis time was running out. Only a little over two minutes left in Double Speed.\nHe had to end this now.\nHeartless noticed his intensity and smirked. \"Running out of time, are we?\" she taunted.\nBut Stark only smiled back, his gaze fierce. \"Guess you'll find out soon enough.\"\nHe needed to win within that time limit, otherwise it was game over.",

      "content": "The battle between Stark and the Heartless One raged on, both of them moving at such incredible speed that the world around them seemed frozen.\nTo the others watching, the two combatants were nothing more than crimson and black blurs colliding again and again, the force of their blows sending shockwaves through the air.\nStark unleashed his skills over and over, each blow amplified by the crimson aura that surrounded him.\nHis [Asura's Arms] lashed out too, striking from unpredictable angles and allowing him to deflect the attacks or grab them.\nBut the Heartless One was relentless, her golden spear and dark blade dancing through the chaos.\nEvery swing of her weapons carried deadly precision, and she met Stark's attacks head-on, blocking and countering with incredible skill.\nBOOM!\nAnother clash sent both fighters skidding backward, their feet tearing into the ground as they tried to maintain their footing.\nStark smirked, wiping a trickle of blood from his mouth.\nAt this point, his aura was not only taking over his face, but his entire upper half too.\nThe angrier he got, the more his aura would take.\n\"You're tough,\" he said.\n\"And you're exhausting,\" the Heartless One replied with a twisted grin, the black aura of her skills swirling around her like a storm.\n[1:31 minutes of \"Double Speed\" left]\nStark didn't waste a second.\n\"I need... to... get her... FAST...\"\nHe dashed forward again, closing the distance between them in the blink of an eye.\nHis [Crimson Spears] materialized mid-sprint, streaking toward her like deadly missiles.\nCLANG!\nThe Heartless One spun her dark blade, deflecting the spears with ease.\nThen she finally decided to use her wings for the first time.\n\"HARBINGER'S DESCENT!\"\n[Leaps into the air with her wings, before crashing down and creating a shockwave. Enemies in the vicinity are thrown back and momentarily stunned by the impact.]\nShe does as the skill indicates, but as she crashed into the ground...\n\"It's my win, human,\" the stun would be enough to hold Stark for one second, and that would be more than enough for her to cut him in half.\n\"Not bad,\" Stark muttered, but he wasn't stupid.\nINVINCIBLE DODGE!\nHe rolled forward, avoiding the attack thanks to his invincibility frames.\n\"Huh.\"\n\"Just like in Dark Sou-\"\nZAP!\n-100!\n\"Damn.\"\nPeople were surprised that a fucking lightning strike hit Stark out of nowhere, but maybe it was one of the Heartless One's skills.\nThe sheer intensity of their duel left the spectators frozen, even the [Tormented One], who had stopped attacking Clever to watch the fight unfold.\nThe clock was ticking.\nStark knew his [Double Speed] had less than a minute left.\nThe strain of maintaining such a high level of combat was beginning to take its toll, but he couldn't let up.\nThe Heartless One was just as relentless.\nShe activated [Void Embrace], covering the battlefield in a haze of dark energy.\nStark's vision blurred, his accuracy faltering as hallucinations danced in the corners of his eyes.\n\"Cheap tricks!\" he growled, summoning his [Crimson Ball Transmission] to teleport above the haze.\nSNAP!\nIn a flash, Stark reappeared in the air, hurling another [Crimson Spear] down toward her.\nThe Heartless One laughed, effortlessly dodging and countering with [Blackblade Cleave] again, sending a wave of dark energy slicing upward.\nStark twisted mid-air, narrowly avoiding the attack and landing with a thud.\nTime was running out.\n[WARNING!]\n[30 seconds remaining!]\nWith 30 seconds left, Stark felt his body beginning to slow.\nHis breathing was heavy, and his crimson aura flickered faintly.\nThe Heartless One sensed his weakness and smiled wickedly.\n\"This is the end,\" she declared, raising her spear high.\nThe golden weapon glowed with radiant energy as she activated [Heavenly Spearfall].\nDozens of holy spears materialized in the air, each aimed directly at Stark.\n\"Bring it on!\" Stark shouted as hard as he could, summoning another [Crimson Ball].\nHe threw it in the air above, intending to teleport out of harm's way.\nBut she was faster.\nThe Heartless One tricked him, and instead of the spears crashing down, SHE shot forward before he could snap his fingers.\n\"Huh?\"\nIn an instant, she was directly in front of Stark, her spear poised to deliver the final blow.\nStark's eyes widened. He wasn't fast enough to react.\nAnd then... he gambled.\nRemember about the [Incubus] class Stark got?\nThe one that was utterly useless in battle except against females foes?\nWell... if the Heartless One could be considered a girl, then maybe...\n\"ENRAPTURE!\"\n[Enraptured (Incubus Skill): Only works on female foes, but you can use that skill to increase your charm and make them lose focus for a bit.]\nA powerful crimson aura radiated from Stark, and his features shifted slightly.\nThat change was only visible to the Heartless One, by the way.\nHis face became sharper, more alluring, an unearthly charm emanating from his entire being.\n\"W-Wow,\" The Heartless One hesitated.\nFor a single, critical second, she faltered.\nHer grip on the spear slackened, her attack freezing mid-motion as her focus wavered.\n'He's totally my type now!'\nIt was all Stark needed.\nSNAP!\nHe teleported into the air, his [Crimson Ball] floating where he was now standing.\nFrom above, he activated [Domi-Chains Restrain], summoning three crimson chains that wrapped tightly around the Heartless One.\nShe struggled against them, her strength threatening to tear them apart.\n\"Not enough?

      "content": "[5 Participants Alive]\n[3 Monsters Remaining]\nThe trial was reaching its final showdown, and everyone, including the participants, wondered what would happen once all monsters died.\nIf the rules were correct, only one of the participants could enter the [Hollow Tower] to win, meaning that by the end of it all, only one could remain.\nFor the Gardenis family, it meant the huge possibility of their daughter dying.\nFor Lana, it meant that Stark or Sora would die, and no matter who it would be, they would be devastated.\nAnd for the entire world, it meant that among all of those still alive, only one would rise to be the strongest.\nThe millions of screens displaying the trial were perfectly connected, meaning that those in the outside world could see all of it happening thanks to smooth cameras that followed everything.\nFor example, while Stark and Heartless One were fighting, the cameras were all on them, leaving out everybody else.\nThis was how this trial allowed those outside to see everything.\n\"Hey,\" the Mayor was the first to speak, and all the attention turned to him.\nIn contrast to his usual calm demeanor, the mayor had a bad feeling about all of this, and when he stared at Stark, it was almost as if he saw a terrifying presence.\nAlmost just as scary as the [Godless Demon].\n'That kid... the more he fights... the more he gets fed up with all of this, the stronger he gets,' he realized, 'And so that means that...'\nMayor smirked as he pointed at Stark with his disgusting hands.\n\"I say we eliminate that guy first.\"\nHe was talking to not only the remaining monsters, meaning the [Butler Trio] and [Tormented One], but also the participants.\nMainly to [Clever] and [Follower] though, as it was unlikely Lilith and Sora would betray him.\n\"Are they fucking serious?\"\n\"NO FUCKING WAY?!\"\nPeople in the real world were shocked: these monsters were quite literally asking humans to team on someone else.\nThis was unheard of in humanity, as monsters ALWAYS fight humans, no matter what happens, yet here they are, trying to gang up on one simply because they fear he might be too strong.\nPlus... wasn't Clever the strongest?\nThat old man could summon his golden statue and smash all of them at the same time if he felt like it.\nAnd yet...\n\"This might be a good idea,\" the old man smiled, \"I say we tear him apart.\"\nHe was totally in, the idea of all of them fighting that kid fascinating to him.\n\"I'm in too, as long as I get the final blow,\" Follower appeared from the shadows, quite literally next to Mayor.\nYet, as expected, Mayor didn't attack Follower, meaning that he was actually serious about fighting and killing Stark together.\nTormented One nodded his head too, taking a few steps toward Stark to indicate he was in on the idea.\n\"Oh, and before we can start the massacre,\" Clever smiled, \"Let's take care of the other two,\" he pointed at Sora and Lilith.\n\"I wouldn't do this if I was you, old man,\" through all of this, Stark was strangely calm, looking at them with the most neutral of expressions.\n\"Do we kill them?\" Follower pondered, he didn't care about the other two, but if they could meddle in his plan then he would get rid of them.\n\"Don't worry,\" Clever kept smiling as he snapped his fingers, two massive golden arms emerging from the ground beside the girls and grabbing them both, \"They can't escape anymore.\"\nSora and Lilith tried to escape, obviously, but not only were none of their skills working, but every time they resisted, the grip on the golden arms tightened.\nIf they kept going, their organs would be crushed, so now, all they could do was watch as Stark was getting teamed on by 5 people.\nIn the outside world, people were baffled.\n\"Seriously, 5V1?!\"\n\"Cowards, not gonna lie.\"\n\"I mean, that guy's so problematic both monsters and humans decided it was better to eliminate him together, so who knows...\"\nIn schools, restaurants, company buildings, everyone watched, Stark's neutral face appearing on every screen.\nThe crimson aura that over his face growing in power as his opponents began walking toward him.\n\"Are you... sure...?\" Stark asked one more time, closing his eyes and smiling.\n\"You ain't gonna do shit,\" Follower laughed, \"We saw you use your giant spear or whatever against Father Hugo, you can't bluff your way out of this!\"\n\"Oh?\" Stark kept smiling, \"If that's what you think.\"\nStark, through all of his, could only find it amusing that these people... no... these things would try to team up on him simply because he was a threat.\nIt was... sad.\nRight now, through his vision, all he could see were their darkened figures marching toward him, their eyes glowing with their respective aura's color.\nAnd to make it worse, a panel appeared in front of everybody to seal the deal.\n[5V1]\n[Mayor, Butler Trio, Tormented One, Follower and Clever] VS [Chosen].\nBut that's not all.\nBecause... this trial truly wanted Stark to die.\nThe [Crimson Moons Trio], the [Apostles] and even the [Godless Demon] wanted the Chosen One to be killed, so that they can take over this world.\nAll those that joined them would reign, while all those that refused and wanted to fight will be annihilated.\nAnd though Godless knew there were a few levels 900 or even 1000 classifiers that could be difficult to deal with, he was still confident their greed would allow him to recruit them.\nBut Chosen One was... weird.\nGodless Demon felt it through his very being since he saw him: that kid wouldn't back down, no matter what.\nKilling him was the best solution.\nIf he could descend to Rheria, he would have already done it, but the preparations of the [Final Ritual] were soon coming to an end.\nThe moment they did, the world would be at his mercy.\nAnd so through all of that hatred for Stark, a single rule was added to the trial.\nA rule that changed everything, and everyone's eyes widened as they saw it, including the participants, monsters, and those in the real world.\n[Secret Rule: if Chosen One is eliminated, then all of those still alive will automatically win, and to all the monsters alive, they will be able to meet with Godless and ascend to a better title.]\nInstantly, the tension in the air became ten times as strong.\nEven Clever, who was joking around until now, activated his [100-Golden Arms Statue], the giant golden statue appearing behind him.\nFollower also activated his aura, a monstrous and dark figure appearing behind him: it was the fruit of his most recent task completion.\nAnd if he managed to kill Chosen, he would be able to use the powers as he wanted, taking over countries when Godless descended.\nMayor and Tormented One also grew serious: ascending in title means possibly becoming an apostle or general of the army, it was something they couldn't refuse.\nAt this point, killing Chosen was the smartest decision if you wanted to live.\nAnd even people in the real world could now understand why they decided to gang up on him.\nBut through all of this, Stark kept smiling.\nHe asked the question one last time.\n\"Are... you... sure?\"\n\"Yes,\" Clever grinned.\n\"Affirmative,\" The Mayor confirmed.\n\"If sir decides to kill you, then we are with him,\" The butler trio nodded.\n\"Why wouldn't I?\" Follower laughed.\n\"...\" Tormented One nodded.\nAll of them agreed.\nThe entire world held its breath as they waited to see what Stark could possibly do.\n\"You should be happy, you know?\" Clever spoke as he pointed at the restrained girls, \"At least your two little girlfriends are going to be able to get out of here alive.\"\n\"...\"\n\"Just give up, you can't beat us, no matter what,\" Follower advanced, his dark aura taking over his body.\n\"...\"\n\"It was nice fighting with you, human, but we have more important things to do,\" Mayor bowed out of respect, \"You shall be remembered.\"\n\"...\"\nAnd then... Stark laughed.\n\"You guys are so... stupid, hahaha,\" he held his stomach, actually thinking all of this was funny.\n\"Did he go insane?\"\n\"No, I'm not insane,\" he wiped the tears from his eyes, \"But...\"\nStark's expression suddenly became so serious, and his aura so powerful, that all the others took their defensive stances\n\"I guess all of you are going to die now.\"\nClever's golden statue loomed behind him, its massive arms ready to crush anyone who defied him.\nFollower's shadowy aura twisted unnaturally, a monstrous figure hovering just behind him, exuding pure malice.\nThe Mayor's grotesque form pulsed with dark energy, and the Butler Trio's synchronized movements were sharp and calculating.\nEven the Tormented One, silent and deadly, glared at Stark with glowing eyes.\nThe camera focused on Stark as he placed his two hands together, his eyes still closed.\nAnd then...\nHe pointed at the sky.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What is he doing?\"\nThose outside the trial, and that had never seen it, were confused, but on the other hand, all of those inside suddenly tensed up.\nThat's when Stark whispered the words that could crush anyone who fought him.\n\"Heaven's Spear,\" he smiled, calm as ever, \"Angel of the Spear, come to my rescue.\"",

      "content": "Before everyone's cautious gazes, Stark lifted his arm, an explosive aura emerging from his body.\n\"Heaven's Spear,\" he whispered, pointing at the sky, \"Angel of the Spear, come to my rescue.\"\nA rift tore through the sky, turning it into a golden color, and from it emerged a giant figure.\nStark's arm stayed raised, the massive angelic figure above him radiating an overwhelming aura.\nIts form towered over the battlefield, its colossal spear resting easily in one hand.\n[What do you wish for me to do, master?]\nThe angel spoke, his voice loud and thunderous as he had the spear in hand, ready to throw it.\n\"If I ever say the word 'GO', then launch it, and if they try to attack me, throw it as well,\" he instructed, and the angel nodded.\nAll of the participants now knew they couldn't act out.\nEven if they killed Stark in one blow, the angel would still throw the spear, and there was no saying whether any of their barriers could block it.\n\"I'll inform you of three things,\" he raised of his fingers while pointing at monsters and participants.\nBut before he could continue what he was about to say, a panel appeared in front of him.\n[To make it fair, we'll inform you that \"Follower\" has the \"Skill Canceller\" item, meaning he can cancel your \"Heaven's Spear\" if he uses it.]\nStark made sure to keep his expression neutral, but turned his pupils toward Follower, who seemed like he wanted to grab the [Skill Canceller] from his system inventory.\n\"!!!\" Stark knew this was bad, and he hadn't expected anything like that.\nBut now that he did know, he wasn't about to let it slide.\n\"Clone Frenzy,\" he whispered, a singular clone, the only one he could summon because of the cooldown, appearing.\nThen he whispered a single instruction to it: use [Crimson Ball Transmission] to do what needs to be done.\nThe clone nodded, throwing the crimson ball, and setting it right behind Follower.\n'Now wait.'\nThe clone kneeled down, it's crimson body waiting for the opportunity it sought.\n\"Back to what I was saying,\" Stark repeated, \"I'll inform you of three things.\"\n\"First of all, the angel above me can't miss his shot, no matter, so don't even think of escaping to somewhere else,\" as a proof, he displayed the status panels for the [Heaven's Spear] perk.\n[Heaven's Spear (Ultimate Form): : Upon activation, a colossal rift tears open in the sky, revealing a towering angelic figure, nearly 50 kilometers in height. With a slow, deliberate motion, the angel summons an immense spear of pure crimson energy, large enough to obliterate mountains with ease.]\nEveryone gulped as they saw it, and even the people outside the trial could feel the sheer aura of that thing.\n\"Second of all, the spear does enough damage to instantly evaporate you, no amount of defense could save you, I believe even a level 850 or 900 classifier would get instantly killed,\" yet again, he spoke the truth, not needing any proof this time for everyone to believe him.\nAnd last...\n\"You can't escape the range, as the spear could be enough to destroy a small city due to the blast,\" he finally said, smiling.\n\"BULLSHIT!\" Follower called out.\n\"Hm?\"\n\"I saw the spear attack in the temple, and it was only enough to destroy the temple and an area 1 kilometer around it, that's definitely not a city!\"\nThat is definitely true as well, after all, if the attack was so powerful, why did the impact destroy so \"little\".\nWell...\n\"Father Hugo was the one who threw that spear, not me, he simply copied my attack, basically a weaker version of mine,\" he smirked, \"You can even ask the other commanders if you wish?\"\nAs Tormented One couldn't talk, all eyes fell on the Mayor, whose expression turned serious and cautious.\nWith a sigh, he admitted, \"Hugo can basic skills and their perks to perfection, but when it comes to massive perks such as... this one... he could probably only use around 10% of their power.\"\n\"...\" Follower instantly began to sweat, making him even more eager in using the \"Skill Canceller\" now.\nIf Father Hugo only used 10% of the angel's power, and destroyed that much, then what would even happen with Stark's aura and 100% of it's power?\nNo one could imagine.\nBut all the people in the real world had a rough image: total annihilation.\nChosen had the lives of millions in his hands since the beginning.\n\"I hope you understand now, so...\" Stark laughed, \"Just let go of them,\" he pointed at the two girls, \"And kill each other.\"\n\"That is... if you guys don't want to just team up and kill the moons,\" he added a last option, pointing at the sky, where the three moons were watching.\n\"You think we're scared?\" the Mayor intervened, \"If you use that thing, you're going to die too!\"\nInstantly, all the others realized it as well: Stark wasn't invincible, he was about to get it too if he throws it.\n\"That is true,\" he admitted.\n\"HAHA, THEN IT MEANS YOU'RE JUST AS FUCKED AS US!\" Follower laughed, letting go of the [Skill Canceller], \"IDIOT!\"\n\"No,\" Stark shook his head, \"Because I'd rather kill myself with you all than let you win.\"\n\"Bullshit,\" Clever spoke for the first time.\n\"Oh?\" Stark looked at him, a vortex of crimson aura appearing in his eyes, \"But I am serious, I'll kill myself to take you all with me.\"\nThe aura in his eyes was so overwhelming and insane that everyone instantly believed him.\nThat kid was fucking crazy!\n\"And what about your two girlfriends? You're gonna let them die?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Stark shrugged, pushing the bluff to its max, \"I don't care about them that much, all dying together is beautiful, isn't it?\"\nOf course, everything Stark was saying was pure bluff: he had his [Chosen One] talent perk to revive him, while Lilith and Sora had the [Protection Amulet].\nThat is the reason why he stopped her from using it when faced with the [Celestial Annihilation].\nBut it was to push the bluff to its limit that Stark had to say all of that, and best of all: they believed him.\n\"ARE YOU CRAZY?!\" Lilith shouted.\n\"...Believe in him,\" but Sora quieted her down, knowing that Stark wouldn't sacrifice them.\nIn the outside world, everyone was going ballistic.\n\"HOLY FUCKING SHIT!\"\n\"THAT GUY'S INSANE?!\"\n\"Suicide annihilation, heh?\"\nEven Sora's family, and specifically her father, was going crazy from rage.\n\"T-This kid,\" he couldn't even fathom how his daughter could meet someone so bad, \"FUCK!\"\nTo the world, and even those inside the trial, Stark looked more monstrous than ever the monsters themselves.\nStark's family was the same, terrified and shocked.\nJust what the hell could have happened during those 1.5 years that made Stark so powerful, and that pushed him to have such a mindset?\nKilling them all was alright if you had a backup plan to survive.\nAnd even killing yourself would be brave if it meant your loved ones could survive.\nBut at the end of the day your plan is just to: kill everyone, including you and the girls you were with, then it's just pure insanity.\nThat's not brave, nor heroic, it's just... evil.\nAnd worst of all, every screen showed Stark's figure, taken completely over by his crimson aura, only his mouth and eyes visible because of the white trail.\nHe was completely serious.\n\"Well then,\" he spoke, smiling, \"What's your choice,\" he bowed, mocking the Mayor, \"It doesn't matter to me.\"\nThe world waited for the other's answer.\nBecause no matter what they answered, then something crazy would happen.",

      "content": "The air was thick with tension as Stark stood beneath the colossal angel, the massive spear glowing ominously in its grasp.\nAt any moment, if Stark felt like it, he could order it to throw the spear, killing every single one of them.\nEveryone had been frozen, unsure of their next move, weighing their options carefully.\nStark's crimson aura radiated outwards, making it hard for anyone to look directly at him without feeling overwhelmed.\nThe Mayor was the first to move, his calculating eyes darting between the angel, Stark, and the other participants.\n\"Your bluff won't hold forever, Chosen,\" the Mayor growled, stepping forward. \"Someone will call it. Someone always does.\"\n\"And yet,\" Stark replied calmly, his voice carrying across the battlefield, \"none of you have yet.\"\nThe silence that followed was suffocating.\nNo one wanted to make the first move.\nNo one could, or else it would be instant death.\nNo one wanted to risk being the one who triggered the angel's wrath.\nIn the midst of this standoff, Follower's lips curled into a sneer.\n\"Enough of this,\" he muttered under his breath, reaching into his system inventory.\nStark's eyes shifted slightly, catching the subtle movement.\nFrom his inventory, Follower pulled out a scroll, its surface shimmering faintly with golden text.\nThe moment the scroll appeared, an announcement flashed before every participant and on every screen worldwide:\n[Skill Canceller: Cancels out any skill, even if it is Immortal or level 100!]\nGasps erupted from those watching both inside and outside the trial.\nAn object that wouldn't be powerful under usual circumstances because of the many skills everyone had.\nBut in Stark's case, whom [Crimson Spear]'s [Heaven's Spear] was his lifeline, it was a big deal.\n\"YOU FOOL,\" Follower bellowed, raising the scroll high. \"NOW YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE MASSACRED!\"\nEvery participant's eyes widened, realizing the implications.\nAnd they all smiled as well, ready to dash the moment the angel disappeared.\nStark, however, remained unshaken. His calm demeanor only deepened the unease of those around him.\n\"GOODBYE, CHOSEN ONE!\" Follower shouted, activating the scroll with a triumphant laugh.\nBut as his fingers began to glow, the sound of Stark's voice cut through the chaos.\n\"Idiot,\" Stark whispered, barely audible but brimming with confidence.\n\"!!!?\"\nSNAP!\nThe sharp sound echoed as Stark's crimson clone, calm until now, snapped its fingers.\nUsing [Crimson Ball Transmission], it teleported directly behind Follower, the crimson energy of the clone swirling as it materialized.\nBefore Follower could react, the clone grabbed the scroll from his hand.\n\"YOU LITTLE- GIVE ME BACK-\" Follower roared, swinging a fist at the clone.\nBut the clone didn't hesitate.\nIt unfurled the scroll and activated it immediately, aimed directly at Clever.\nFWISH!\n[You have cancelled the \"Golden Grip\" skill.]\nThe golden arms holding Sora and Lilith disintegrated instantly, freeing them both.\nBoth Lilith and Sora fell on their feet, surprised, but ready to fight.\n\"WRRAAAA!\" Follower roared in frustration, his fist finally connecting with the clone and obliterating it in one blow.\nCrimson energy scattered like shards of glass, but the deed was already done.\nStark smirked, tilting his head mockingly.\n\"Thanks for the assist, Follower,\" he said, his voice dripping with sarcasm.\n\"YOU...!\" Follower growled, his eyes bloodshot with rage.\nBefore he could charge, Sora and Lilith both moved to Stark's side, their gazes wary.\n\"Are you alright?\" Lilith asked, her voice strained but steady.\n\"Better now,\" Stark replied without taking his eyes off the battlefield.\nThe other participants began to stir, the tension reaching its breaking point.\n\"Well, does any of you think he had some sort of... how do I say it nicely... a trick to stop me?\"\n\"...\"\nNo one could speak.\n\"Enough games!\" The Mayor's voice boomed, his patience clearly gone. \"This has gone on long enough. If we don't act now, that angel will annihilate all of us!\"\n\"You're welcome to try,\" Stark replied coolly, his hand gesturing towards the angel above. \"But I wouldn't recommend it.\"\nClever, now free of his skill, turned his gaze toward Stark, his expression unreadable.\n\"I admit,\" he said slowly, \"you've surprised me. But don't think this changes anything.\"\n\"It doesn't have to,\" Stark replied. \"Feel free to make your move. I'm ready.\"\nThe Mayor stepped forward, his aura flaring.\n\"If no one else will act, I will,\" he declared.\nBut before he could take another step, Tormented One let out a guttural growl, its massive, disfigured form lurching forward.\nBut it didn't attack Stark, not at all.\nIt attacked... Clever.\nThe Mayor stopped in his tracks, narrowing his eyes, \"So you fell for his tricks,\" he whispered, watching as Clever instantly replied by swinging one of his golden fists.\n\"So,\" Stark said, his tone casual but laced with a sharp edge, \"Gonna kill each other, huh? Then let me enjoy the show.\"\nHe gestured upward, where the angel held the colossal spear, its crimson glow intensifying,\n\"And if any attacks hits me or the girls...\" he smiled. \"...it's game over.\"\nThe participants exchanged uneasy glances, the stalemate dragging on.\nSuddenly, Follower snapped.\n\"ENOUGH!\" he screamed, lunging toward Stark with wild eyes.\nStark didn't flinch.\nThe angel's grip on the spear tightened, and for a moment, it seemed as if the end was near.\nBut before the angel could act, another participant intervened.\nClever moved with blinding speed, intercepting Follower and slamming him to the ground, while keeping the Tormented One in check with his statue.\n\"Stop being reckless,\" Clever hissed.\nFollower struggled beneath him, his rage boiling over.\n\"HE HAS TO DIE!\" Follower screamed.\n\"And so will we if you keep this up,\" Clever snapped back.\n\"FUCK... YOU...\" Using the entire power he had earned from the [Godless Demon], Follower's body exploded with aura, sending Clever flying in the opposite direction, \"I'M KILLING EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU!\"\n[Annihilate them all to prove yourself, Follower.]\nA panel appeared in front of him, meaning that killing Stark wasn't the only way to get stronger anymore, he could kill them all.\n\"Oh?\" Mayor's expression was still serious, \"Looks like Chosen didn't even have to push you that much to begin to go insane, kid, alright, you're gonna die,\" Mayor took his stance.\n\"...\" Tormented One also turned his attention, managing to break one of the golden arms that was blocking him.\nIt went from a [5V1] to a [1V1V1V2] in mere minutes, with Stark, Lilith and Sora able to enjoy the show.\nAny movement from the others and he would launch the spear.\nThe single reason he didn't do it was because he would need it for later, specifically against the moons.\n\"Oh yeah,\" Stark spoke to Lilith, watching Mayor and Follower engage in a battle, \"Give me the [Cooldown Gem] you got from your task.\"\n\"Huh?\" Lilith tilted her head, \"Why should I?\"\n\"Lilith,\" Sora held her shoulder, shaking her head, \"Trust him.\"\nFor some reason, Lilith was really fond of Sora, her calm face and expressions were enough for her to agree.\n\"Alright, you saved me twice...\" she mumbled, pulling out all of her items instead of only the [Cooldown Gem], \"You're gonna need them more than me, probably.\"\nIn front of Stark's eyes were: [Cooldown Gem, Double Power, Revive Token, Teleportation Sphere, Moonscorch Cure x1]\nBut Stark decided to only take the [Cooldown Gem], [Double Power], [Revive Token] and [Moonscorch Cure], which he used immediately since his moonscorch percentage was already reaching its peak.\n\"Keep the [Teleportation Sphere], they're safety items, I don't need them,\" Stark smiled gently at Lilith, and for some strange reason, through the boy's bruised and tired face, her heart skipped a beat.\n\"A-Alright,\" she nodded.\nNow all Stark needed to do was sit back and enjoy the show.",

He ignored the cuts, his fists glowing dark with [Crimson Corruption].\nFollower lunged at the Mayor, but one of the butlers intercepted, swinging a massive tray at him.\nThe blow missed as Follower ducked, retaliating with a punch.\nThe butler stumbled back as he was hurt, but [Loyal Regeneration] quickly mended the damage.\nThe Mayor laughed. \"You'll need more than that.\"\nWith a swipe of his hand, he summoned spinning plates through [Dinner is Served].\nThe spectral plates homed in on Follower, forcing him to leap backward.\nThe butlers moved in again, using [Mayor's Servant] to chain their attacks.\nOne swung a fork, while another hurled plates from a distance.\nFollower caught one plate midair, shattering it with his clawed hand.\nHe growled, using [Demon's Grasp] to extend his claws, which glowing menacingly.\nHe slashed at the nearest butler, tearing through its chest.\nBut the regeneration kicked in immediately, leaving no permanent damage.\n\"You're annoying,\" Follower muttered.\nThe Mayor activated [Silver Service], spinning his utensils in a whirlwind.\nThe energy pulled Follower closer, and the utensils slashed across his torso, leaving deep gashes.\nFollower winced but recovered quickly.\n-17,834!\nHe landed a solid punch on the Mayor, but [Table Manners] triggered.\nThe Mayor dodged and stabbed Follower in the shoulder, dealing true damage.\nThe Mayor smirked. \"You're nothing but a pest.\"\n\"Annoying little shit...\" Follower growled, \"You're simply using tricks over and over...\"\n\"And yet you can't do anything about it.\"\nFollower retaliated with another claw slash, but the Mayor blocked it with [Polished Edge], his knife gleaming with enhanced power.\nA counterattack followed, forcing Follower to retreat.\nThe butlers swarmed again, swinging their plates at random to strike Follower with incredible force, they didn't fear for their lives since they knew they would be revived.\nHe rolled to the side and used [Attack Negation] on the next swing, canceling it entirely.\nFollower then dashed toward the Mayor, claws aimed for his heart again.\n\"I just need... a single opening...\"\nThe Mayor stepped back, activating [Utensil Storm].\nForks and knives rained down, forcing Follower to zigzag through the onslaught.\nA spectral fork struck Follower's leg, pinning him momentarily.\nThe Mayor dashed forward with [Fork Toss], aiming for Follower's chest.\nFollower broke free just in time, dodging the Mayor's attack and slamming a fist into his ribs.\n-859,384!\n\"From a single punch?!\" The Mayor stumbled, but the butlers rushed in, their loyalty unwavering.\nTheir speed and power increasing as they coordinated attacks. Plates flew, forks stabbed, and trays swung, all aimed at overwhelming Follower.\nFollower roared, activating [Crimson Corruption] again.\nA dark aura burst from him, knocking the butlers back temporarily.\nHe focused on the Mayor, charging forward with relentless fury.\n\"Feast of Fury,\" he smiled, unleashing a rapid combo of utensil strikes.\nFollower blocked and dodged, each attack growing faster and deadlier.\nOne strike connected, leaving a gash across Follower's chest. He gritted his teeth and countered with a clawed strike, but the Mayor dodged effortlessly.\n\"You'll need to try harder,\" the Mayor taunted, and his fork struck Follower, marking him with a defense-reducing debuff.\nFollower ignored the pain and slashed at the Mayor again.\nHis claws tore through the air, forcing the Mayor to parry with his knife.\n\"That kid...\" Mayor, though confident, he could sense that no matter how many times he was hitting him, Follower seemed to only grow stronger by the second.\nThe butlers returned, their regeneration fully healed. They attacked from all sides, overwhelming Follower with their relentless assault.\nFollower slammed his foot into the ground, creating a small shockwave to push them back.\nHis claws glowed brighter, and his eyes sharpened, identifying a weakness in the Mayor's stance.\nThe Mayor grinned. \"You'll never win. As long as I stand, they cannot fall.\"\nFollower smirked. \"Then you're gonna be the first to go down.\"\n\"BANQUET OF ETERNITY!\"\nMayor tried to activate his strongest skill besides his Immortal one to finally end this fight.\nBut before he could do anything...\n\"Watch your back next time, dumbass,\" Follower already behind, having adapted to Mayor's fighting style flawlessly.\nThis was one of the passive perks Follower acquired besides those he got to deal damage: the more he fought and received damage, then the easier it would be for him to overwhelm his enemies.\nHe couldn't do that with the [Heaven's Spear] since it was just too strong, able to wipe him in mere seconds, but for anyone else, it was his strategy.\nHe believed that it would also work perfectly with Stark, that is if he didn't have another skill to instantly end a battle.\n\"Yawn...\" meanwhile, Stark was lying down, observing the battles and taking into account every single skill the others were displaying.\nHe would surely need to remember them for later.\nTormented One and Clever on the other hand were locked in a stalemate, as Tormented One couldn't even reach the old man, but his [100-Golden Arms Statue] dealt literally 0 damage to the thing.\n-0! -0! -0!\nSensing the growing danger of this trial, Clever got serious and slammed his fists repeatedly, but the creature would get up no matter, as if unaffected.\nAfter a short while of fighting, Follower landed a devastating punch, sending the Mayor crashing into a wall.\n-1,734,945!\nHe had adapted to their fighting style perfectly now, even the butler trio sensing that no matter what they did, it wouldn't work.\nThe square fell silent for a moment.\nFollower laughed. \"Weak, and worse of all, your horns look stupid and ugly.\"\nDing!\n[Do not insult the Mayor's horns]\nSuch a warning had appeared in front of Shock and CEO in the manor, but Follower didn't know about it, and frankly, even if he did know, it wouldn't change much.\nThe Mayor's expression twisted with rage.\nHis hands gripped his utensils tightly, his entire body trembling with fury.\n[Conditions met to use \"Immortal\" Skill]\n[Horn Call] was a condition skill, much like EGO meter and the fact you need to make the meter reach 100, but in that case, the condition was for someone to insult Mayor's horns.\n\"You're dead, kid,\" the Mayor said, his voice cold and furious.\n\"Sure thing, you ugly little shit,\" Follower replied, unfazed.\nThe Mayor dashed forward, his rage fueling his every movement.\nFollower grinned, ready to end the battle in one counterattack.",

A single one of my attacks could kill you, and my defense is high enough so that you can't possibly even imagine killing me, give up!\" Mayor laughed, dashing again.\n\"You're becoming boring,\" Follower whispered, \"Goodbye.\"\nFwish!\nMayor swung, trails of dark aura leaving a dark trail behind.\n\"GOT YOU!\" he successfully managed to hit the place where Follower was, \"I cut you so easily that I didn't even notice the chance, humans are so weak.\"\nOutside, all people could was a mist beginning to form, as well as Mayor's dark aura.\n\"Damn, so Follower's done for just like that?\"\n\"Pretty weak if you ask me...\"\n\"No chance!\"\nAnd all of those believed that the great Follower wouldn't die so easily would be completey right.\nBecause back in the trial...\n\"You're right, humans are insanely weak, but lucky for me,\" Mayor heard a voice behind him, sweat dripping from his brow, \"I'm not human.\"\nFwish! Slash!\nSharpening his claws to the max, he used [Demon's Grasp] to pierce through Mayor's sturdy body.\n\"Fool! My body is too sturdy for you to actually pierce it from one end to the other,\" Mayor mocked, \"Now you're gonna die.\"\nBut that was Mayor's biggest mistake: he didn't instantly retaliate.\nBecause Follower's plan wasn't to pierce him: it was to hold his heart.\n[Demon Devouring: Pierce your enemy, and hold your claws in their hearts for five seconds, then you'll instantly kill them.]\n1...\n\"Do you truly believe you can beat me,\" Mayor kept mocking, \"All you humans are so idiotic!\"\n2...\n\"First, that stupid and ugly guy with his two girlfriends thinks he can put us all on lockdown simply because he has a powerful skill...\"\n3...\n\"...And then you believe you can stop us all?\"\n4...\n\"Even if you did kill me, you would still have to face the moons, and I promise you that you're not surviving!\" Mayor continued in his speech.\nHe had tried to liberate himself from the claws several times, but for some reason, Follower held really tightly.\n\"Now you're about to die, and I'll finally be an apostle-\"\n5.\nHe couldn't even finish his sentence that an excruciating pain hit him: his heart exploded, like, literally.\nDEMON DEVOURING!\nBoom!\n-99,999,999!\nInstant death!\n\"H-Huh...?\" Mayor couldn't understand how this was possible.\nAfter all... Only the [Godless Demon] had such an ability to begin with, no human should ever have that!\n\"Oh...\" in his final moments, Mayor finally understood, \"We were stupid...\"\nHis horns stopped glowing, and his body also stopped emanating this dark aura.\nInstead, in a final gesture that displayed his entire personality, he bowed in front of Follower.\n\"It was a truly beautiful fight, but I have lost.\"\n\"Know your place, garbage.\"\nMayor chuckled before adding something else.\n\"But you will never win this trial,\" he eyed Stark, who was behind Follower, \"Someone is gonna stop you, someone much stronger than you are.\"\n\"Nobody's stronger than me, bitch,\" Follower gave him the middle finger as Mayor fell, dead.\nDing!\n[Mayor has been killed \"Follower\"!]\n[5 Humans Alive: Stark, Lilith, Sora, Follower and Clever.]\n[2 Monsters Alive: Butler Trio and Tormented One.]\nIt didn't take long for Follower to get rid of the [Butler Trio] afterward, the three butlers having lost their will to live after the mayor died.\nThey didn't even protest as Follower slashed them repeatedly.\n[Mayor has died, thus \"Loyal Regeneration\" cannot be activated.]\nDing!\n[Butler Trio has been killed \"Follower\"!]\n[Follower is on a rampage!]\nAnd so with that, only one monster remained: Tormented One.\n\"Deal with that yourself, old man,\" Follower groaned, sitting on the ground and closing his eyes, \"That little shit actually hurt me a bit.\"\nIt didn't mean he was growing stronger after every blow that he didn't feel pain, after all, and so now all they could do was wait for Clever to get rid of [Tormented One].\nActually, once Stark decided to check out the status panel of that thing, something strange happened.\nInstead of the usual window appearing, it was simply a few messages.\n[So much agony.]\n[Cannot kill via damage.]\n[Find another way, it can't feel pain besides the one it was put on for hundreds of years.]\n[It has nothing but its extreme defense and overwhelming strength.]\nThese four panels appeared in front of him, meaning that... he couldn't check the status window?\nWell, it did give him basic info: that thing for some reason had no skills, maybe removed by the [Godless Demon] after putting him through the torture.\nBut in exchange, it seemed as though he was invincible, unable to receive damage from anything or anybody, and his two burly arms could potentially destroy a building by a single swing.\nBasically, you don't want to get hit by that thing.\nAnd Clever seems to do a great job holding it off, since it easily gets overwhelmed by the dozens of arms blocking its path or slamming it in place.\n-0! -0! -0!\nBut as the panel says, doing all of that doesn't result in anything significant happening to it.\nClever, angry that his all powerful statue couldn't do anything in front of such a weak monster, one that couldn't even retaliate, was growing frustrated.\nCELESTIAL SMITE!\nTen of the arms of the golden statue merged into one, slamming the [Tormented One] in place hundreds upon hundreds of times.\nThousand Hands Devotion!\nThen he began to punch it with all its arms at once.\nEmbrace of Eternity!\nAnd finally, he trapped it inside dozens of hands, closing them around it and squeezing as tight as possible in the hopes of crushing its organs.\nBut even after all of that.\n\"...\" Tormented One's muffled screams could still be heard as he used his hands to block the strikes and liberate himself from the grip.\nHis strength was truly otherworldly.\nAnd there was no chance they could kill it in a normal way, if even Clever struggled to do that.\nOf course... that is if Stark decided not to act, as he in fact had a way, but he wouldn't bother taking the risk for them.\nPlus, if the [Tormented One] didn't attack him when he threatened them with the [Heaven's Spear], then it means it still feared being killed by it.\nMight as well wait for them to all die before trying anything.",

They're all fucked!\"\n\"Chosen has to do something now, right?\"\nClever could hold it off for weeks if he wanted, as he didn't need to focus to give his statue orders, but he didn't feel like doing the work for all these people.\nBut regardless of that, hours passed.\nAll the participants were now sitting on the cold ground, while Clever [Golden Statue] kept Tormented One in place, sending him in the opposite direction whenever he approached too much.\nHe was extremely slow, so it took him around 10 minutes to traverse the square anyway.\nStrangely enough, no one in the real world, even those that knew nothing was gonna happen, kept watching.\nThey returned to their daily tasks, like working or talking to one another, but still kept their phones and screens in case of any development.\nLilith was meditating, her eyes closed, gathering more strength to be able to fight.\nSora on the other hand was playing with her vines, twirling them.\n\"That's my daughter,\" Mike Gardenis laughed as he saw Sora act so cutely, something very weird as it didn't happen often, actually, it didn't happen at all.\nWas she this comfortable with these people?\nFollower was punching the barrier of the [Hollow Tower Square] repeatedly while mumbling unintelligible words, as if speaking to someone else.\nHis wounds were already healed thanks to his other passive he acquired: [Godless Regeneration].\nClever also just closed his eyes, resting.\nStark was the only one not doing anything, observing all the others.\nHe could sense Follower's gaze on him sometimes, but every time he looked, the man would go back to punching the barrier.\nHe looked above, and saw the three moons still looking at them, their pupils locked on him precisely.\n\"...\"\nBut Stark didn't want to stay here for too long.\nHe didn't feel like staying in this place any more than he has to, especially now that only one commander remained, and that the moons were within his grasp.\nIf he killed them, all of this could end.\nHe also wanted to get rid of Clever and Follower, since they could cause problems.\nBut as he expected, the moons would never go down, and quite frankly it was impossible for them since they were too big.\n[If you kill all three moons, then the true form of the apostle will reveal itself.]\nHe clearly remembered that panel appearing before him.\nIf the [Moon] Apostle was in his true form, then he probably wouldn't be able to escape anymore.\nBasically, Stark needed to find a way to kill all three moons, as well as Clever and Follower, in one attack.\n'Hey,' Stark thought, directly linking himself to the angel above, who still looked down on this trial with his otherworldly gaze, his hand raised.\n[Yes, master?]\n'Can you manage to destroy all three moons,' this was the simple task he gave it.\nStark believed it would be difficult.\nThe first time he threw his spear, at the beginning of the trial, all the moons did was get out of the way when their friend was targeted, thus only resulting in one moon being killed.\nPlus, as Stark feared killing Sora, he had deliberately reduced the output of the spear, not by saying it loudly, but because the angel subconsciously understood what Stark wanted and followed through.\nBut now that he wanted to go full annihilation route, there was no need to hold back.\n[Yes, I can do that, and even end it with the spear crashing in the middle of the square.]\nThe angel said in a neutral and holy voice.\n'Amazing, then please do that in exactly three minutes.'\n[Alright.]\nIn response to its master request, the angel, who stood idle for all these hours, suddenly moved, taking a more appropriate stance to unleash all of its power.\nThough it made sure to not reveal that it was planning to throw the spear, as otherwise it might ruin Stark's plan.\nThe moment the angel moved, Follower immediately stopped punching the barrier and looked up, and Clever also woke up from his nap.\nHis golden statue instinctively placed around 50 giant golden hands around him to protect him.\nThey could sense that something was gonna happen soon if they don't move, as Stark's patience couldn't be infinite.\nHe was crazy enough to tell the two girls he would kill them at any moment if he felt like it, so no wonder.\nBut surprisingly, the three moons didn't even bother moving or staring at the angel even though they sensed its presence.\nAnd the reason was simple:\n\"There's three of us, no chance he can eliminate us,\" Moone laughed\n\"His previous spear hit one of us, then disappeared, meaning that with only one spear, we can just escape and attack,\" Motwo added.\n\"Just stay on guard, if he throws it, make sure to escape, the one that's been targeted will undeniably regenerate since he can't use it again.\"\nThey were just this confident in their power.\nWere the foolish? Or was it because they were given the [Apostle] title that they thought they were in invincible in this trial and because it was their domain?\nIn the end, they would soon realize that they were dumb for thinking like that.\n\"Use your protection amulet when I throw the spear,\" Stark ordered Lilith and Sora.\n\"You're gonna use it?!\" Lilith was baffled, \"But what about you?!\"\n\"Got the [Revive Token], so it's fine,\" he didn't reveal he could also revive himself one more time with his talent, but better keep it a secret.\nAfter doing that, Stark got up, grabbing the attention not only those in the trial, but in the real world too.\n\"HE GOT UP!\"\n\"Shit, shit, what's gonna happen?\"\n\"Chosen, are you gonna the thing?!\"\nStark arrived in the middle of the [Hollow Tower Square], and even [Tormented One] stopped what he was doing as the boy approached.\nHe put his palms together, making sweat drip from everyone's brow, even those outside.\nAnd then...\n\"Goodbye, everybody,\" he smiled, a vortex of aura spinning in his eyes, as if he was insane, \"ANGEL, THROW THE SPEAR!\"\nThe outside world exploded (not literally) as those words were uttered.",

      "content": "\"Goodbye,\" Stark smirked, raised his hand toward the sky, \"Angel, throw it,\" he ordered.\nThe angelic figure, towering and divine, didn't hesitate. Its voice echoed like a symphony of bells.\n[Very well.]\nIt hadn't even been 3 minutes, but the angel simply followed what Stark said.\nThe [Crimson Moons Trio] apostle floated above the battlefield.\nTheir otherworldly forms, twisted and malevolent, radiated confidence.\nTheir laughter rang out across the square as they mocked Stark's attempt.\n\"Does this fool think a single attack can harm us?\" one sneered.\n\"Let him try,\" another hissed. \"We're invincible here. Let him use his strength in vain.\"\nBut they would soon learn their confidence would be their downfall.\nThe angel, with deliberate precision, pulled back its arm, ready.\n\"GO!\" Stark shouted.\nFWISH!\nIts sheer velocity cracked the air, shattering sound itself, and the world trembled under the might of the throw.\nTo hit all three [Crimson Moons Apostles], as well as the ground, the angel threw the spear with such force that it damaged itself from the impact, ripping apart the sky, changing its color completely.\nHowever, the spear did not descend in a straight path. Attached by an invisible golden thread, the angel swung the spear like a divine whip.\nThis was the only way it could think of to actually manage to follow the orders of its master: Stark.\n\"WHAT?!\" the apostles roared as the spear curved, moving sideways\nBefore they could react, the colossal weapon struck, and it was much bigger than them.\nBOOM!\nThe first moon was obliterated, shards scattering like starlight.\nBOOM!\nThe second moon shattered before it could retaliate, its energy dissipating into nothingness.\nBOOM!\nThe third moon, caught mid-escape, met the same fate, its fragments swallowed by the storm of energy.\nThe explosions were deafening, their shockwaves rippling across Termina.\nThe three moons, believed to be invincible, were reduced to cosmic dust.\nBut that didn't mean the apostle was dead.\n...\nThe outside world erupted in cheers and disbelief.\n\"OH MY GOD, HE DID IT!\"\n\"HE FUCKING DID IT!\"\nOn every screen broadcasting the trial, people jumped to their feet, screaming in celebration and shock.\n\"Does this mean we win?!\"\n\"Is it over?!\"\nInside the square, Lilith stared at the destruction with wide eyes.\n\"Wow,\" she whispered. \"But... doesn't this mean there's nothing left for us to do?\"\n\"No.\" Sora's voice was sharp as she snatched the Protection Amulet from her inventory.\n[Protection Amulet: Summon a protection that can tank any attack no matter what.]\nShe activated it, summoning a golden sphere around herself and Lilith.\nThis was their only chance at survival, and so as the small sphere closed in on them, they prayed that they would be safe.\n\"Stark's gonna attack the square for sure, look at his eyes,\" Sora continued.\n\"???\" Lilith did as told, and she was right, Stark's eyes well full of insanity, the crimson vortex still visible in them as he smiled, looking up.\nRight as the spear killed all three moons, the divine entity moved again.\nAnd so the angel above, as if confirming their fears, swung the spear one final time.\nIts arc widened, and with unrelenting speed, it descended toward the square itself.\n\"HOLY FUCK!\"\n\"DAMN?!\"\n\"HE'S GOING TO DESTROY EVERYTHING!\"\nNo one could believe that Stark was crazy enough to still want to kill himself even after having the chance to win that trial.\nBut of course, Stark knew the reason he needed to send that spear was because defeating the moons only meant the real form of the apostle would appear.\nBasically, he couldn't afford to let the other two problematic participants live.\nFWISH!\nAs Follower and Clever observed the spear come down, they saw their lives flash before their eyes.\nNever could they have ever imagined their lives could end by the hands of a random kid in a deadly trial that owned an impossibly powerful skill.\nA skill so powerful even the strongest of classifiers and monsters could get instantly killed by it, and even the [Godless Demon] would probably get hurt too, or so Follower believed.\nA skill so powerful... it was going to kill them in one blow, then completely erase them from existence.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nBut no.\nThis couldn't end like this, not in such a humiliating way.\n\"I'M THE FUCKING STRONGEST DOMINATION USER,\" Clever, the old guy, shouted at the top of his lungs, still carrying his cane in his hand and pointing at the descending spear, \"YOU... WON'T... KILL... ME!\"\nHe had never truly had the will to live, fighting monsters simply because it was fun, and you could see it even in this trial: he liked being a spectator more than a fighter, enjoying the drama between the others.\nBut for the first time, Clever felt like he wanted to get through this and live, then teach that kid a lesson he could never forget.\nHe would display his head in a public space, and describe him as the public enemy number of humanity.\nAnd so...\n\"ZERO HAND!\"\nHe used his [Immortal] skill, the strongest skill he had.\nHe had only ever used it once before, and the outside world had NEVER seen him use it either, even though he was pretty famous in his country.\nAs he activated his skill, the massive statue behind him suddenly turned from a golden color to a shimmering white, like some sort of diamond.\nThen, all 100 arms and hands merged together into the [Zero Hand]: a giant hand, the size of the entire [Hollow Tower Square], made out of pure diamond.\n[It is said that this hand is indestructible, granting its wielder both enormous attack and defense.]\n\"HELP ME, ZERO HAND!\" Just like Stark, Clever also requested the aid of the golden statue, now the diamond statue, who lowered the diamond hand in front of Clever.\nHe climbed inside, then it closed on him, leaving absolutely no room or hole to see him through: it was the perfect defense, the thing he thought could allow him to survive this.\nAfter all, the only way to avoid such an attack is by using an Immortal skill.\n\"Idiots,\" Clever laughed, and even though it was dark, he still felt secure inside the [Zero Hand].\nNow, the only person who was left was Follower, and he simply watched the spear descend, not doing anything.\nIn contrast to Clever, he had given up his powers in exchange for the perks he had used until now, meaning that he couldn't avoid or dodge: it was over for him.\n\"Sorry, Lord Godless,\" he kneeled, truly sad that it was going to end like this, \"I was too weak.\"\nJust like that, he gave up, understanding why the panel had informed him that Chosen was the most dangerous person, forcing even Clever to hide and cower in fear.\nAnd now, the spear was only a few meters above the ground, time slowing down as it was about to hit the point of impact.\nLilith and Sora were inside the [Protection Amulet], Clever was in his [Zero Hand] protection and Follower simply gave up.\nWhat about Stark, you might ask?\nWell, he was also just staring at the spear, which hovered right above him, and people couldn't believe that this kid was actually ready to die even though he had already killed the apostle.\n\"FUCK. CHOSEN.\"\n\"FUCK. CHOSEN.\"\nOutside the trial, protests began, with the chant \"Fuck Chosen\" being shouted everywhere.\n\"At least that filthy bastard's going to die.\"\n\"Yeah, but he's taking everyone with him.\"\n\"I think Lilith, Sora and Clever are going to survive because of their protections, though, but Follower's done for.\"\nThey truly hoped that at least one of the participants survived, because if everyone dies, they had been already informed twice that something terrible and world changing was going to happen.\n\"See you in hell, assholes,\" Stark whispered as he smiled, truly making everyone outside, even his family and those of Lana and Sora, hate him.\nAnd then it happened.\nBOOM!\nThe world faded to black as the spear hit the ground, destroying literally everything around it.\nAnd it wasn't just the square: the barrier around the square was shattered, and the explosion took part in the entirety of Termina.\nEverything was destroyed, and through the many cameras in the sky, all humanity could do was watch in disbelief: this was the skill that kid had?!\nThe Orphanage? Gone!\nThe Manor? Gone!\nAll the districts and streets? Poof!\nEven from their safe locations, those watching had chills go down their spine, the strongest of classifiers sensing the absurdity of the situation.\n\"DID THEY ALL DIE?!\"\n\"MY GOD, I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT?!\"\n\"FUCK. CHOSEN.\"\nWell, it was safe to say that this trial couldn't go on anymore, since the main stage was destroyed.\nAnd even the [Hollow Tower], which was where the last surviving participant that had killed all the commanders and completed 5 tasks needed to go, crumbled under the sheer force, reduced to nothing.\nThe world both inside and outside the trial fell silent as the dust settled.\nThey were all waiting to see who had survived and who didn't.\nBecause no matter who it was, then they would be the winner of this trial, or at least that is what they believed.",

      "content": "After the impact from [Heaven's Spear], the entirety of Termina, which means the trial, was destroyed, including the [Hollow Tower].\nEven he didn't expect it to be this powerful, but it also means that if he had decided to use it since the beginning, this entire trial would have been over in seconds.\nIf he did that though, Sora and Lilith would have died, even though he wouldn't have known of the latter anyway.\nThe [Hollow Tower Square], being the main point of impact, received the highest percentage of destruction, a massive crater appearing in the middle where the participants previously were.\nStark, on the other hand, completely disintegrated because he had simply just tanked the projectile without even defending himself.\nWell, even someone that was kilometers away from the square would have still died, but Stark still took the entirety of the impact.\nAll he could see now was black.\n\"Here again, huh.\"\n[Do you want to use the \"Revive Token\"?]\nBecause he had taken it from Lilith, he could successfully revive himself without using his talent.\nWhich meant that he still had a revive afterward!\n\"How long do I have to use it?\"\n[30 minutes.]\n\"Then I might as well just rest a bit,\" Stark sighed, closing his eyes to think about his next plan.\nThe [Moon] Apostle was probably now out there, in his true form, meaning that he would need to find him, after all.\n...\nBack in the trial.\nAs the dust settled, the cameras focused on the bottom of the crater.\nThe first thing people noticed was that the [Protection Amulet] had actually survived this impact, meaning that, as its description said, it tanked an attack even as powerful as this one.\n[Protection Amulet has been broken.]\n\"SHE'S ALIVE,\" Mike and Elise Gardenis, Sora's parents, cried tears of joy as they saw their daughter survive this hell.\n\"Sis!\" and even her brother and sister were happy.\n\"Sora!\" tears also welled up in Lana's eyes, because even though she saw her as a love rival, her interactions and the fact they lived together for a bit did make them closer than before.\nThough, in contrast to what many believed, as the golden sphere that protected the two girls disappeared, everyone noticed that they were, in fact, unconscious.\nEven through this barrier, the shock from the explosion shook them and resulted in them passing out.\nAnd other than these two, there was one more person alive, whose body didn't disintegrate.\n\"Clever?\"\n\"Probably, he did use [Zero Hand] after all.\"\nBut they were wrong.\nBecause Clever was nowhere to be seen: the one that survived was Follower, and some weird black substance was over his body, seemingly protecting him.\n...\nBefore the impact.\nFollower had completely given up, kneeling to the ground and begging the Godless Demon for forgiveness as he failed his mission of killed Stark.\nBut right as the spear was about to the ground, killing them all, a panel appeared in front of him, and time slowed down.\n[Your devotion to the Godless Demon is admirable, even at the face of death, not many are as devoted as you are.]\n\"Huh?\"\n[As a gift, the Godless Demon has decided to aid you.]\nIn less than a fraction of a second, a black figure materialized in front of Follower, you couldn't see its skin since it was made of a weird substance, but it had crimson eyes and horns.\n[The Godless Demon will defend you from this attack.]\n\"What-?\" Follower didn't have time to speak as the spear finally hit the ground, exploding everything around it.\n[The ultimate protection of the \"Godless Demon\" has been granted to you.]\n[You have been promoted to \"Godless Demon Apostle\"]\nFollower had actually been promoted mid-crisis, meaning that the Godless Demon was watching the trial from somewhere.\nThe weird black demon that appeared in front of Follower instantly dashed toward the man, entering his body.\nThen a weird black substance materialized all around Follower for some reason.\nThat is how he was alive.\nAs for Clever, well, he did use [Zero Hand], but let's not kid ourselves, did he really believe he could escape a goddamned level 100 spell capable of eliminating level 900 classifiers and monsters?\nI mean, that would just be silly.\nAs you might predict it, the moment the spear exploded upon contact with the ground, the diamond hand gripping Clever inside and protecting him instantly evaporated.\n\"WHAT-\" and so the confident old man was also killed before he could even say anything else.\nGive him a break, though, there was no chance he could have survived this.\n...\nPresent.\n\"Follower's alive...\"\n\"What the fuck?!\"\nThe black substance on his body slowly seeped back inside of him as the dust disappeared, revealing that he was also unconscious.\n\"So three people alive, but all unconscious?\"\n[Clever has been killed by \"Chosen\"!]\nAnd then nothing else.\n60 seconds passed, then 5 minutes, then 10, then 20.\nAnd yet, nothing was happening.\nNo one could afford to get their eyes off the screens for even a second, not wanting to miss any important details.\nBut it seemed like the trial was truly in stalemate.\nOr at least, that was until people started noticing something strange.\nIt all started with some asking a simple question: why was there no message that Chosen had died.\nAnd in mere minutes, the entire world was now asking themselves that very same question.\nIf Chosen had truly died, then there should have been no problem putting a message that he indeed was gone.\nPlus, out of the 15 squares that displayed the participants, the ones that weren't crossed out were: Sora, Lilith, Follower and... Chosen.\nThere was something strange going on.\n...\nBack in that dark space of his, a message appeared in front of Stark as he rested.\n[Warning, only 5 minutes left to pick option.]\n[Failure in picking will result in permanent death.]\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Stark knew that it was time to get back to the trial.\nIf everything went well, then Lilith and Sora should be the only ones still alive, meaning all Stark needed to do was team up with them and eliminate the apostle.\nDing!\n[You have used your \"Revive Token\"!]\n[Brace yourself!]\nHis consciousness faded as he was being brought back to life.\nAnd so, as the tensions in the real world about what happened to Chosen reached their peak, a sudden flash of light was seen in the middle of the crater.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What's happening?\"\n\"The fuck?!\"\nStark's body was completely disintegrated from the impact, but the [Revive Token] still needed to revive him.\nMeaning that instead of bringing back every single one of his cells, which is what his talent would do, instead, he just... respawned, in a flash of blue light.\nDing!\nHis body flickered a bit before appearing again.\n\"Damn, like in a video game,\" Stark smiled, surprised, moving his arms and body to make sure everything was functional.\nThe atmosphere around the trial was now extremely calm.\n\"Lilith, Sora?\" he turned his gaze, and noticed that they were out cold, \"Oh.\"\nAnd once he looked around... he noticed Follower too.\n\"What the fuck?\" Stark was more surprised than anybody else: if even Clever with his total protection was killed, then what the hell was this still doing.\nOh, and talking about Clever.\nDing!\n[You have slain \"Clever\", gaining 120,000,000 experience points!]\nThis was absolutely massive.\nKilling that old man gave even more experience than Father Hugo (50 million) and the Tormented One (60 million) combined!\nIt seems like killing other participants was truly the way to success, no wonder Follower did it!",

BAM!\nBut right as it was about to hit, a dark figure emerged from Follower's body and tanked the attack, placing its hand forward to destroy the spear.\n\"...\" it looked directly into Stark's eyes.\n\"...\" and Stark looked back at it, \"Alright.\"\nThat thing must have protected Follower from dying.\nWas it his talent? Or something else?\nBut in the end, he was stuck in that giant crater.\nEvery other participant was dead, Lilith and Sora unconscious, and Follower was being protected by whatever that thing is.\nWhich means that he was stuck in here alone.\n\"What's my next move…\" he muttered.\nThen, suddenly, the air shifted and the sky above began to darken.\n\"...?\"\nStark looked up, his eyes narrowing.\nThe moon seemed to glow brighter, casting an eerie light over the destroyed trial.\nClouds swirled violently, creating a vortex above the crater.\nAnd from the center of it, something emerged.\nA figure descended slowly, shrouded in silver light.\n\"...\"\nAs the figure came closer, the light dissipated, revealing its form.\nThe Lord of the Moon had arrived.\n\"You...\" Stark's eyes widened.\nIts appearance was terrifying.\nA humanoid figure with pale, luminescent skin.\nIts body was thin but unnaturally tall, towering at over three meters.\nLong, flowing hair, silver like starlight, trailed behind it.\nIts eyes glowed with a cold, lunar brilliance, locking onto Stark instantly.\nA long robe covered its body, decorated with intricate patterns of moons and stars.\nBehind it, eight crescent-shaped blades floated in perfect symmetry, spinning slowly.\nThe atmosphere grew heavier with every passing second.\n[Aphex, Lord of the Moon, Level 600, Immortal-Level]\n\"…\"\nThis was the true form of the [Crimson Moons Trio].\n\"You're lucky, human, you get to see my true form before dying,\" he laughed like a maniac, \"The moon is calling for your soul.\"\n\"Shut the fuck up,\" Stark glared at him.\nHe could sense that this thing was stronger than he was, he could sense its stats and skills were way better than his.\nAnd yet... he didn't feel like backing down.\nBecause everything they went through in this trial was because of him.\nSo if he wanted to finally get out of here, and also complete the second line of the [ApostleDex], he needed to get rid of it.\nThe first thing he did as he saw Aphex slowly descend toward him was point his fingers at him.\n\"Flow...\" he decided to instantly use his perk\n[Flow: Your focus is unwavering, and by focusing on an enemy for 10 seconds, grasping their movements and flow of aura, you are able to see their attacks coming at least a second before they come.]\nIf its speed was overwhelming, then all he needed was to give himself a chance to counter.\n[Flow initiated.]\n[1...]\n\"Do you really believe anything you do matters, human?\" Aphex glared at Stark after stopping his laughter.\n[2...]\n\"In the end, Lord Godless will soon descend, and humanity will be doomed!\"\n[3...]\n\"With your current strength, I can assure you that you can't beat me.\"\n[4...]\n\"And neither can you beat any of the apostles ranked above me.\"\n[5...]\n\"In less than a year, I can assure you that the world will be ours.\"\n[6...]\n\"Don't worry, I respect your powers, after all you still managed to defeat nine of the fifteen apostles, that isn't no easy feat.\"\n[7...]\n\"But unfortunately, all Lord Godless needs to do is replace them, and with a bit of help from corrupt humans, Rheria will be finally be destroyed.\"\n[8...]\n\"So now, Chosen,\" Aphex said his name, \"What will you do?\"\n[9...]\nGlaring at him, Stark couldn't help but smirk, after all, his flow was about to end, and thanks to it, he would gain a massive advantage.\n\"I think...\" Stark started, \"I think you're an absolute fucking idiot.\"\n\"So be it,\" Aphex pointed one of his crescent blades at Stark, \"You're about to die.\"\n[10...]\n[Flow has been activated!]\nStark's vision became clearer when he saw Aphex, and whatever the apostle did, he could see an afterimage of what he did before it even happened.\n\"But unfortunately for you,\" Aphex laughed, floating above ground, \"I'm not going to be your opponent.\"\n\"Huh?\" Stark was confused.\nThere was nothing else in this crater.\nMaybe [Follower] was going to wake up?!\nBut as he turned around, Stark didn't see any signs of him moving, the black creature still defending him.\nIt seemed to glare at Aphex too.\n\"You need to be more open-minded, Chosen,\" Aphex laughed again, his laughter echoing throughout the entire trial.\n\"Then come down if you're not scared!\"\n\"I don't need to, as I said, your opponent isn't me right now, oh, it seems like they are here.\"\n\"What the fuck are you talking about-\"\nBut as Stark shouted these words... a hand emerged from the ground and grabbed him from below.\n\"Huh?\"\nAs Stark felt the hand gripping his ankle, a chill ran down his spine.\nHe looked down and saw the source of this unexpected assault—a grotesque, disfigured hand, darkened and warped, clawing its way out of the broken ground.\n\"This is...!?\" Stark tried to punch the hand, but it didn't let go of him no matter what.\nCrimson Ball Transmission!\nBut as he was beginning to be pulled down by the hand, which was impossible to liberate himself from, he simply threw a crimson ball.\nSnap!\nThen snapped his fingers to teleport away.\nHe had thought that everything had died, since a spear of this power should be enough to instantly make anybody evaporate.\nBut he hadn't taken into account one thing...\nBecause as the figure emerged, revealing its disgusting red body, he finally saw who it was, confirming his suspicions.\nIt was the [Tormented One].\n\"He cannot be harmed by physical attacks,\" Aphex kept laughing, \"So that spear of yours was useless!\"\nAs the burly creature got up, Stark needed to make sure, and just as expected, that thing in front of him was wearing a cloak made out of its skin, and it had no mouth.\nIt was truly the [Tormented One].\nWhich is why he also didn't get a notification about his death.\n\"So what are you gonna do now, Chosen?\" The moon apostle grinned, \"You're their last hope, but you cannot deal damage to that creature, what is your play?!\"\n\"...\"\nStark's face darkened.\nWas this the end?",

He simply respawned using an item.\n\"He predicted everything,\" Mike Gardenis laughed by himself, \"That kid knew from the beginning that these items could be used to protect the girls, and also revive him!\"\n\"He's still insane though, Elise Gardenis shrugged.\n\"I didn't say he wasn't, but every powerful classifier is a little crazy.\"\n...\nThe overall opinion of Chosen did climb a bit after people realized that he wasn't just some kid who was willing to kill everyone because he was getting ganged up on.\nThough that didn't mean people weren't cautious.\n\"But doesn't that mean we win?\"\n\"Y-Yeah, every monster is dead, humanity wins!\"\nI'll let you imagine the reaction of the world when they saw the vortex in the sky, and Aphex's figure appearing, revealing that he was the true form of the three moons.\nBut a single human against an apostle as overwhelming as this one wasn't really fair to begin with.\n\"He's still going to die.\"\n\"Dude, just look at it...\"\n\"Bye, Chosen.\"\nAnd to add more to the disaster this trial was, Aphex wasn't the only surviving monster.\n\"OH COME ON!\"\n\"Tormented One survived too?!\"\nThey had the proof of the power of the spear, clearly shown by the fact the entirety of Termina was destroyed, yet everyone but Clever had survived?\nSeriously?!\nThis also meant that Stark also would need to face two monsters instead of one.\nOne was an apostle able to destroy whole cities by himself, and the other was an invincible creature that even Clever wasn't able to injure.\nThis seemed unwinnable for humanity.\nNow all they needed to do was brace themselves for the terrible thing that was going to happen when all the participants die.\n\"No,\" Lana shook her head, still looking at the TV with confident eyes, her phone opened up to the internet, where millions of people prayed for the death of Chosen, \"Stark's going to win.\"\nThrough this entire trial, she had never even cried once, her faith in him not faltering one bit no matter what.\nAnd so the camera positioned itself in a way that you could see the Tormented One advancing forward, Aphex in the sky, and the other three unconscious with Stark standing between the two monsters.\nShe knew that her (boy)friend was going to win this.\n[I think Chosen's going to pull another trick!]\n[What trick are you expecting from him at this point, the fucking red monster is invincible!]\n[If Clever couldn't kill him, no one can't.]\n[Clever got killed by the giant spear and no one else did, though, so you can't really doubt anybody in this trial.]\nForums were going wild, more chats appearing every second, people arguing.\nNow all they wanted was to see for themselves what could the boy with the \"Chosen\" name do.\nAnd Stark's family was no different.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nNone of them said anything, observing the screen of the TV, except for the little sister, who kept chatting with her friends.\nThey were pestering her for questions about her brother, but all she would do is say \"I don't know\".\nThe entire world one thing at that moment: who was Chosen, and was he strong enough to save them all?\n...\n\"Hey, Aphex,\" Stark spoke, catching the attention of the apostle and the world as a whole, everyone going silent.\n\"Hm?\" Aphex stopped reading the book in his hands and turned to look at Stark.\n\"Do you truly believe that I don't have a way to kill that thing?\" he pointed Tormented One, his smile growing wider.\n\"I do believe there is almost no way to kill him, yes.\"\n\"But then, how would you do it?\"\nIf Tormented One was truly invincible and couldn't receive damage, then it meant the apostle couldn't kill him either.\n\"That's the funny part, I can't,\" Aphex laughed, \"He was tortured by Lord Godless, so only attacks from him could damage that thing.\"\n\"Damn.\"\n\"Now just exhaust yourself, Tormented One can't get tired either.\"\nBut at this point, Stark had already heard everything he needed to know.\nAvoiding Tormented One whenever he got close, he kept thinking about his options.\nUsing \"that\" skill had major risks, and the chance of it turning back on him was also high.\nBut if there truly was no way, then the risk was the only thing left to take.\n\"Alright,\" Stark decided, \"Then time to end it once and for all.\"\nFwish! Fwish! Fwish!\nStark's crimson aura flared around him as he positioned himself, closing his eyes and sensing Tormented One's steps in front of him.\nHe put quite some distance between the two of them to allow himself to do that.\nBreath in...\n\"Phew...\"\nBreath out...\n\"GOT YOU!\"\nAnd so he decided to activate the skill that could be his saving grace.\nA skill no one could expect someone else to have as it was just too insane to think about, even Aphex probably wouldn't believe it.\nAnd so...\n\"BANISH!\"\n[Description: When the user's feels that their aura surpasses that of an enemy, they can unleash Banish, as a result, both his and the opponent's auras clash in a violent surge of energy, a battlefield of ethereal power.\nIf the user's aura prevails, the enemy is instantly cast into the Void—death is certain and instant, no matter their level or remaining health.\nShould the enemy's aura prove stronger, though, the user is sent to the void instead.]\nThat's right, this was his only chance.\nSuch a skill didn't care about level, power and defense: if you lose the aura fight, you get sent to the void and instantly die.\nAnd so what had to happen happened.\nDing!\n[The Banish Game has started!]\n[Chosen VS Tormented One]\n[Loser gets sent to the void, which is instant death.]\n[Good luck!]\nThe words about in front of Stark and Tormented One, but in front of Aphex and the screens of those in the real world too.\n\"WHAT THE FUCK?!\"\n\"HOLY SHIT!\"\n\"CHOSEN HAD A TRICK UP HIS SLEEVE!\"\nEven the moon apostle was confused.\n\"That is... surprising,\" he mumbled, closing his book, actually interested to see what could happen with that [Banish Game].\nTormented One was confused, but instinctively felt something strange for the first time: fear.\nThe only entity he feared was the [Godless Demon], but now, he could sense that this Banish Game could lead to his actual death.\n\"LET'S FUCKING GO, ASSHOLE,\" Stark shouted, his aura exploding forward, trying to overwhelm the Tormented One's aura.",

      "content": "The Tormented One tilted its head as if mocking him. Its hand twitched, sending ripples through the air.\nStark knew this was a foe beyond brute strength. He had to rely on something else.\nHe steadied his breath, focusing all his remaining energy into his aura.\n'It's time,' he thought grimly.\nIt was time to take the risk.\nSuddenly, the air shifted violently.\nThe ground beneath Stark trembled as his aura expanded, swirling outward like a storm.\n[The Banish Game shall start!]\nA voice boomed in his mind, loud and foreboding.\n[Whoever's aura gets consumed by the other will be cast into the void!]\n[Good luck!]\nThe Tormented One froze in place.\nIts eyeless sockets seemed to narrow, and its hulking frame stiffened.\nIt tried to move, but the rules of the Banish Game bound it. Neither could act outside the clash of their auras now.\nStark gritted his teeth, his crimson aura flaring brighter.\nHe had activated his last resort—a gamble with no second chances.\nWith a deafening roar, the Tormented One's aura erupted, dark and overwhelming.\nIt was a sickly red, dripping like blood, twisting into grotesque shapes as it surged toward Stark's own energy.\nOnce the Banish Game starts, both fighters immediately and instinctively have the knowledge of how to wield their auras.\nIt was to make it as fair as possible.\nThe two auras collided with a thunderous BOOM\n,\nsending shockwaves through the crater.\nStark stumbled, barely holding his ground as the sheer force of the clash pressed down on him.\n\"The... fuck?!\" he didn't expect a useless, ugly monster with nothing going for it except its strength to have such an overwhelming aura.\nPlus, it had actually never used it until now!\nThe battlefield between them became a swirling vortex of light and shadow, a warzone where only their wills mattered.\n[You can form shapes related to your skills with your aura in the Banish Game!]\nThe notification snapped Stark into focus. He had to act fast.\n\"Alright,\" he muttered, sweat dripping down his brow. \"Let's see what you've got.\"\nThe Tormented One wasted no time.\nIts aura twisted and churned, forming a massive, hulking figure.\nThe shape mirrored its monstrous frame but larger, bulkier, and infinitely more menacing.\nThe figure raised a fist the size of a boulder and slammed it toward Stark's crimson aura.\nCRASH!\nThe impact sent Stark flying backward within the aura battlefield.\nHe winced as his energy wavered, shrinking under the relentless assault.\nIn the [Banish Game], you don't push punch or attack your opponent but their aura, and if it's hit, the other receives the damage themselves.\nSuch a weird concept, probably something anyone outside had never seen before.\n\"...?\" even Aphex seemed surprised at the sight.\n\"Damn it,\" Stark growled, forcing his aura to stabilize. \"I'm not losing here.\"\nHe focused harder, his crimson energy reshaping itself.\nIt surged upward, forming a giant fist of its own.\nWith a sharp command in his mind, the aura-fist lunged forward, colliding with the Tormented One's creation.\nBAM!\nThe clash shook the air, but Stark was still losing ground.\nThe Tormented One's strength was overwhelming, its burly aura-figure advancing relentlessly.\nIt slammed its fists again and again, breaking through Stark's defenses inch by inch.\nHe kept creating [Crimson Aura Shields] to defend himself, but it didn't work too much.\nStark clenched his fists tighter, \"You want a fight? Fine. Let's make this interesting.\"\nEven the aura fight against Olikar, the apostle of the Colosseum, hadn't been this difficult, so he needed to be better.\nHis crimson aura twisted and shifted, forming multiple smaller figures, each a copy of himself.\nThe doppelgängers darted forward, surrounding the Tormented One's massive aura-being.\nThey launched a flurry of strikes, their combined efforts forcing it to slow down.\nFor a moment, it seemed like Stark was regaining control.\nBut the Tormented One wasn't done.\nIts aura roared, the grotesque energy shifting into new shapes.\nMassive burly fists emerged from its sides, slamming into Stark's clones with terrifying force.\nCRASH! CRACK!\nOne by one, his aura constructs shattered, their energy dispersing into nothingness.\n[Warning! You are getting overwhelmed! A bit more and it's game over!]\nStark's crimson aura flickered dangerously, struggling to hold its form.\n\"No,\" Stark hissed, his breathing ragged. \"Not yet.\"\nThe spectators that were watching this were flabbergasted: what the hell was this?\nAuras were powerful, sure, but since when could they form such shapes and fight one another?!\n\"This is absolutely insane...\"\n\"This has to be some of the best fights in years, not gonna lie.\"\n\"GO CHOSEN! KICK HIS ASS!\"\nStark poured more of his focus into his energy, drawing upon every ounce of his willpower.\n\"FUCK YOU!\" he shouted at the top of his lungs, his form getting taken over by the crimson color.\nHis aura began to glow brighter, more intense.\nIt surged upward, reshaping into a colossal figure—a demon-like entity with horns and blazing eyes, an embodiment of his [EGO].\nThe demon let out a guttural roar and charged forward, slamming into the Tormented One's hulking figure.\nThe impact was deafening, sending shockwaves through the battlefield.\n\"...?\"\nThe Tormented One's aura reeled, its monstrous form staggering backward under the force of Stark's attack.\nBut it wasn't defeated yet. Its energy pulsed violently, reshaping into a massive wall of spikes that shot toward Stark's aura-demon.\nThe spikes struck true, piercing through the demon's form.\nStark cried out in pain, feeling the backlash as his aura weakened further.\n[One more attack and you're done.]\nThe crimson energy wavered, flickering like a dying flame.\n\"Damn it,\" Stark muttered, falling to one knee. His body trembled, his strength waning. \"I can't… lose here…\"\nThe Tormented One's aura surged forward again, victory seemed inevitable for the skinless creature.\n\"...\"\nBut Stark didn't give up.\nHe closed his eyes, focusing deeply.\nBut instead of what many could believe, he didn't think about his fights or hardships.\nHe didn't even think about Sora, Lilith and Lana.\nInstead, his mind was clouded by pure hatred.\n\"Not today,\" Stark growled, forcing himself to stand.\n\"...?!\" and yet again, for the second time, the Tormented One backed way, even it somehow feeling fear when looking at the human boy.\nHis crimson aura flared violently, burning brighter than ever before.\nAnd then... it turned blue, changing colors.\nThe only time this had happened was during his fight with [Judicator], and though Stark couldn't understand what this meant, he could still feel the power.\nHis aura reshaped itself once more, this time into a massive spear—a towering weapon crackling with raw, destructive energy.\nIt was an embodiment of his [Heaven's Spear], and it radiated power like nothing else.\nThe spear shot forward, piercing through the Tormented One's monstrous aura-figure.\nThe creature's energy recoiled, its form destabilizing as Stark's spear drove deeper.\nOf course, the Tormented One tried to push it away, but with his new power, it was too late.\nStark's blue aura surged forward, engulfing the entire form of the Tormented One.\nTormented One dropped to its knees now, the balance had changed.\nAnd so with a final attack, he simply created the demon once more, who held Tormented One's aura in its hands, and crushed it.\nThe last remnants of its grotesque aura dissolved into nothingness.\nIn front of it appeared a panel.\n[You have lost the Banish Game!]\n[Winner: Stark Heartsouls]\n[You are going to be sent to the void.]\n\"???!\"\nThe Tormented One for the first time in years wanted to get out and run, or maybe try to be saved by someone.\nBut there was nothing that could stop it, for the call of the void is impossible to avoid.\n\"COME ON, BITCH, WHERE'S ALL THE CONFIDENCE?!\" Stark laughed as he pointed at the Tormented One, \"GET RID OF HIM!\"\nThe aura-demon, still there, rushed forward, and as Tormented One's aura was gone, there was nothing that could stop it from directly interacting with him.\nIf it had a mouth, it would probably say something like, \"NO, PLEASE!\" begging for its life just like Olikar.\nBut Stark was merciless.\nSnap!\nHe snapped his fingers and a dark portal appeared under the Tormented One.\nAnd so, mimicking Stark's movements, the demon stumbled back before throwing the skinless creature into the portal with all its strength.\nFwish!\n\"Nice shot, demon,\" Stark kept laughing as he saw the monster try its best to hold on into the edge of the portal, \"You can go now.\"\nThe demon disappeared as the Banish Game was finally over, and Stark marched toward the portal.\nThe human boy spoke, still smiling, \"Look under you.\"\nTormented One did as told, and all it saw was, well, nothing.\nIt was pitch black.\n\"This is where you're going to go,\" Stark laughed like a maniac, kicking Tormented One's hand off the edge.\nAnd even though the monster was sturdy, without its aura defending it, it was as defenseless as a sheep in front of a wolf.\n\"...\"\nIt tried as hard as it could, but... it was useless in front of the demon that Stark was.\nAnd so it fell, the portal closing behind it, erased from this world and cast into the void.\nDing!\n[You have killed \"Tormented One\", gained 70,000,000 experience points!]\n\"You're last,\" Stark groaned, pointing at Aphex.",

Ding!\nIn his hands were the two cards, with their usual style.\nOne had the drawings of a falling meteor, while the second was... an axe cutting off the right arm of a stickman figure.\n\"Huh.\"\nStill making sure to keep an eye on Aphex and the weird black demon protecting Follower, he decided to read the descriptions of his newly acquired skills.\n[Skill: Meteor Crash (Mythical)]\n[Description: Summon a blazing meteor from the heavens to crash at a designated location, dealing catastrophic damage to all enemies within a 30-meter radius. The impact creates an intense shockwave that stuns nearby enemies for 3 seconds and leaves a fiery zone behind it, has a 5 minutes cooldown.]\n\"Nice,\" that was actually pretty damn good, and very useful with enemies as it added another skill that he could use from long range.\nPlus, this one seemed very powerful even from far, the description itself saying it was devastating damage.\n\"Basically,\" Stark mumbled as he eyed Aphex, \"It's perfect for my situation...\" he smiled.\nIt was as if his class itself had realized what his problem was and answere accordingly.\nBut then, what could the other skill potentially be?\n[Skill: Limb Sacrifice (Godly)]\n\"Huh?\" Stark's pupils shook a little, and a sweat dropped from his brow as he saw the name and rank.\nWhy are the words limb sacrifice put next to one another, and why was that considered a godly level skill?!\n[Description: To awaken the skill's full potential, one must sever one of their arms using the cursed axe that comes with the skill. The axe appears in your hand upon activation.]\n[Note: In sacrifice, power blooms. The arm lost shall be the spark for an inferno untamed.]\n\"What the actual fuck?!\"\nSacrificing one of his arms?\nThis is pure insanity! He wasn't going to do that!\nThough, when he read the note, he became skeptical.\nCutting off his arms basically meant cutting his speed and power in half, but to be honest, doesn't he have four more available arms with [Asura's Arms]?\nThe problem with that was that his normal arms were those he was used to the most, meaning that cutting one of them off was... overwhelming, to say the least.\nHe would only do it as a last resort if anything happened, but until then he could manage just fine.\n\"Are you done?\" Aphex yawned, spinning in the air, \"We don't have all the time in the world, you know.\"\n\"Well,\" Stark sighed, \"There's nothing but us, and I don't think the others are going to wake up anyway, so no, we in fact have all the time in the world.\"\n\"Plus, you're the one supposed to go down,\" he completed, glaring at the [Moon Apostle].\n\"No can do,\" Aphex laughed, \"I'll just wait for you to sleep, get tired or hungry, and it's my win instantly.\"\nIn contrast to all other apostles, Aphex was the type to just wait for the perfect opportunity to sneak attack someone.\nHe had immense strength, yet still didn't feel like taking any risks.\n\"You can always try that Banish Game on me, though,\" Aphex suggested for the second time, seemingly really eager to try it.\nBut Stark simply sighed.\nAphex probably already expected every single one of his skills, and from this distance, even if he tried to throw his crimson fists or spears, a simple move would be enough for him to avoid it.\nDomination Soul can't reach that distance either, and neither can Domi-Chains Restrain.\nAnd though he could climb out of the crater if he wanted, leaving the two girls in there would potentially mean Aphex attempting to kill them.\nThen if he tried to get them out with him, the moon apostle could also attack him from afar.\nBasically, there was no real solution to leave without putting Lilith, Sora or himself at risk.\nAt least, that would be the case if he hadn't just unlocked the perfect skill for this situation.\nAnd so, he simply pointed his finger at the sky, channeling his aura to try and use [Meteor Crash] for the first time.\nFwish! Fwish!\nHe sensed an energy ball in the sky, forming slowly from his aura, and once he looked up, a meteor, the size of a building, appeared.\n\"What the fuck?\" he hadn't expected it to be this big!\nBut in the end, he simply did what he needed to do to keep himself and his friends safe, and so with a single swing of his arm downward, the meteor finished forming and immediately crashed down.\n\"Are you stupid, human, you can't use the spear anymore-\" Aphex laughed, but his sentence was cut as he suddenly heard, and felt, a massive presence behind him.\nWhile floating, he turned around, just to see the massive meteor, five times his size, coming.\n\"Oh, I guess I didn't expect that,\" he mumbled, the eight crimson crescent-shaped blades around him twitching.\nCRASH! BOOM!\nHe was hit straight on, unable to avoid something this big even with his speed.\nThe meteor kept falling though, and Aphex was taken with it toward the crater, crashing down in a massive explosion that shook Termina again.\nStark made sure to place himself in front of Sora and Lilith to defend them, but thankfully enough they were safe.\n-2,377,983!\nThe damage number appeared, and Stark smirked.\nIf he kept going like this, then maybe it could be manageable.",

You have many tricks, but they're all shallow in the end.\"\nHe smirked, his hand swaying lazily. \"Doesn't matter. You'll die before you even realize it.\"\n\"Perception,\" Stark whispered, the crimson vortex in his eyes spinning faster.\n...\n[Name: Aphex, Lord of the Moon, Godless Demon Apostle]\n[Level: 600]\n[HP: 22,622,017/25,000,000]\n[Strength: 37,948]\n[Stamina: 44,381]\n[Speed: 41,059]\n[Defense: 38,982]\n[Skills: Crescent Barrage, Lunar Shield, Gravity Flux, Moonlit Surge, Void Pierce, Lunar Genesis (Mythical), Spectral Crescents (Mythical), Moonfall Eradication (Godly), Moonscourge Storm (Godly), Crescent Oblivion (Godly), Eclipse Dominion (Godly), Lunar Cataclysm (Immortal), Moonlit Obliteration (Immortal)\n...\n\"...Shit.\"\nThat thing had just too many powerful skills, like seriously?\nTwo Mythical, four Godly and two Immortal skills, this was insane.\nAphex tilted his head, the crescent blades surrounding him picking up speed.\nEach blade hummed with power, leaving trails of light as they rotated.\nThe Apostle moved his hand slightly, and two blades shot forward like lightning bolts.\n\"You're not even worthy of me using any of my real skills!\"\nBut Stark saw it coming easily thanks to [Flow], the blades grazing past him and embedding into the ground.\nThe force of their impact sent sharp gusts of wind slicing through the air.\n\"Fast,\" Stark muttered, raising his guard. \"But predictable.\"\nThe blades then reversed direction, rushing back toward him.\nStark activated [Invincible Dodge], narrowly avoiding the attack as he flipped backward, his invincibility frames saving him.\nIt seems like [Flow] couldn't detect attacks that he wasn't seeing, as the two blades that tried to sneak him weren't given the 1-second warning advantage.\n\"Impressive reflexes,\" Aphex remarked, his voice carrying a casual malice.\nHe waved his hand, and the remaining six blades began spinning faster. \"But let's see how long you can keep dancing.\"\nWith a flick of his wrist, Aphex used [Crescent Barrage].\nAll eight blades shot forward in a spiraling pattern, leaving little room for escape.\nStark's eyes widened, his [Focus] skill kicking in.\nThe world seemed to slow as he analyzed the incoming trajectories.\n\"Too tight to dodge completely,\" Stark muttered, his hands glowing crimson as he summoned [Crimson Spears].\nThe ten materialized around him, blocking the first wave of blades.\nSparks flew as the weapons clashed, the sheer force of the attack pushing Stark back several meters.\nOne blade slipped through his defenses, nicking his shoulder and drawing blood.\n-7,987!\nStark winced but didn't falter.\n\"Not bad,\" he muttered, \"but you're not the only one who can multitask.\"\nBefore the next barrage could strike, Stark snapped his fingers too, using up 25 skills points on [Crimson Ball Transmission].\nDoing such a thing would be stupid and grant you a beating from any teacher, as everyone knows you shouldn't upgrade your skills mid-fight.\nBut honestly, who even cares?\nDing!\n[You have upgraded \"Crimson Ball Transmission\" to level 30 (Gold-Max Tier)]\n\"Merge them,\" he said instantly, not waiting for the panel to ask him.\n[Very well.]\nDing!\n[You have gained a new mythical perk!]\n[New Perk: Crimson Ball Barrage]\n[Description: You have gained the ability to summon up to 10 crimson balls at the same time, perfectly aiming them around your opponent.\nEvery time you snap your fingers, you will teleport to one of the ten balls at random, giving you the ability to simply just hit your opponent over and over.]\nIn retrospect, this might not seem like that big of a deal, but to Stark, this could actually work really well.\nIn fact, it could work so well, he decided to instantly test it out.\n\"You think leveling up one skill will save you?\" Aphex scoffed. \"It won't matter. I'll crush you before you figure out how to use it.\"\nStark smirked, his lips curling upward in defiance. [Crimson Ball Barrage] was ready, and the timing couldn't be better.\nAphex waved his hand, activating [Spectral Crescents], one of his mythical skills.\nThis time, the eight crescent blades didn't simply spiral—they fragmented, multiplying into countless shards of moonlight that swirled in a chaotic storm.\nThe air trembled as the shards honed in on Stark like a swarm of meteors, each one humming with lethal energy.\n\"Die!\" Aphex roared, the ground cracking beneath him as he poured more power into the attack.\nStark's instincts screamed.\n[Flow] painted the storm in slow motion, but the sheer number of blades made escape impossible.\n\"Not today,\" Stark growled, summoning [Asura's Arms] in a burst of crimson light.\nFour massive, glowing arms erupted from his back—two from his shoulders, and two from below his natural arms.\nEach arm radiated raw power, their fists crackling with crimson energy.\nAphex's crescent shards closed in, but Stark's new limbs moved faster than the eye could follow.\nThe Asura's Arms swatted the incoming shards like flies, shattering them mid-air in an explosive display of power.\nSparks flew, and the battlefield erupted in chaos.\nDust swirled around Stark, but he didn't let up.\nHe raised a hand, crimson energy pooling around him as he activated [Crimson Ball Barrage], and using his arms threw them all.\nThe ten crimson spheres materialized instantly, circling Aphex like vultures eyeing their prey.\n\"What is this?\" Aphex snarled, his eyes narrowing as he tried to track the spheres.\nBut then, Stark snapped his fingers—and disappeared.\nIn a flash, Stark reappeared near one of the spheres, his Asura's Arms striking out simultaneously.\nThe force of the blow sent Aphex staggering, his black armor cracking under the impact.\n-572,493!\nBefore Aphex could retaliate, Stark snapped his fingers again, teleporting to another sphere.\nAnother devastating punch landed, this time from behind.\n-621,774!\n\"Enough!\" Aphex growled, lashing out with a crescent blade, but Stark had already teleported to the next sphere.\nThe pattern continued, Stark appearing and disappearing in rapid succession, his attacks relentless and unpredictable.\nEach teleport brought a new attack: punch, a kick, or a devastating aura-infused strike from one of his six arms.\nAphex's crescent blades struggled to keep up, whirling around him in a desperate attempt to block the onslaught.\nSNAP!\nHe snapped his fingers.\nFWISH!\nAnd then teleported away right as Aphex was about to reach him.\nBOOM!\nThen, finally, he would hit the apostle.\n-732,892!\nAt this pace, he would be able to deal with Aphex easily.",

He needed a new strategy, and he needed it fast.\nHe was pretty much one shot away from certain death.\n\"You talk too much,\" Stark muttered under his breath, his body shaking with exhaustion.\nHe was probably the participant in this trial that took on the most monsters, and pretty much clutched the entire thing with Father Hugo, Eternal Regret, Tormented One, Heartless One and many more.\nStark's aura wasn't infinite.\nHe had to act. He couldn't wait any longer.\nStark raised his hand, summoning one of the most powerful weapons in his arsenal.\nThe [Spear of Judgment] materialized in a flash of crimson light, its gleaming shaft humbling even the battlefield around it.\nStark wasted no time, hurling it directly at Aphex with all his remaining strength.\nThe massive spear shot through the air, a comet of destruction, heading straight for Aphex's chest.\nIt was a precise, direct assault, one that would pierce through any armor and break through Aphex's defenses.\nBut Aphex, quick and ruthless, anticipated the strike.\nWith a slash of his crescent blades, the spear was deflected, spinning off course.\nStark's eyes widened.\nHis attack had been easily avoided. He'd expected the Apostle to evade, but not with such swift ease.\nThe [Spear of Judgment] came back from the other direction, but Aphex cut it in half.\n\"Nice try,\" Aphex taunted, his voice cutting through the tension. \"But you'll need more than that to stop me.\"\nBefore Stark could react, Aphex raised his arms high as it was his turn to act.\nThe air grew heavy as the eight crescent blades shifted in an eerie synchrony.\nWith a flick of Aphex's wrist, they transformed into spectral copies, creating a deadly swarm of thirty-two glowing blades.\nSpectral Descents... Second Form!\nHe too had perks for his skills, after all!\nThese Spectral Descents attacked without mercy, each one moving with pinpoint precision, seeking Stark's flesh with relentless intent.\nThe moment the blades lunged forward, Stark's heart skipped a beat.\nHe could sense the precision, the inevitability of their strike.\nIf they hit him, there would be no escape.\nHe needed something now, something that would keep him alive.\nThe answer came in an instant.\nWith a snap, Stark activated Dodge Control.\nHis body twisted and warped unnaturally, moving beyond the limits of human possibility.\nIt was as if the very fabric of space around him bent to his will.\nStark's form flickered, almost vanishing, as his body teleported from one spot to the next, narrowly avoiding the spectral blades with impossible precision.\nEach time a blade came near, Stark's body would twist and shift, his movements so fast that they defied the laws of physics.\nFor the next fifteen seconds, Stark was untouchable.\nThe Spectral Descents flew past him, missing by mere inches each time, their deadly edges whizzing through the air as Stark danced between them.\nBut he didn't have time to savor his success. He knew that the next few moments were critical.\n[10 seconds left.]\nAs the final spectral blade passed by him, Stark didn't wait to catch his breath.\nWith a swift motion, he threw a series of crimson punches, his fists crashing into Aphex's form.\nHis blows landed with a resounding force, sending the Apostle stumbling backward.\n-238,319! -194,905! -213,281!\nIt wasn't enough to bring him down, but it was enough to shake his confidence and bring back his eight blades to him.\nAphex growled, his eyes flashing with malevolent determination. \"Then let's see how you handle this.\"\nThe atmosphere grew thick with an oppressive presence.\nStark's vision blurred as the light around him was devoured, fading into total darkness.\nThe air became heavy, suffocating.\nEclipse Dominion.\n[Description: Aphex creates an impenetrable field of darkness, completely nullifying enemy healing, mana regeneration, and aura-based skills for 20 seconds.

His body felt weak, his strength waning.\nAphex's voice echoed from the void, chilling and triumphant. \"Welcome to despair. No healing. No aura. No escape.\"\nStark gritted his teeth, but he couldn't deny the overwhelming pressure that crushed him.\nHe was at the mercy of Aphex, and it felt like there was no hope left.\n\"NOW DIE!\" Aphex lunged forward, ready to end it all.\nNow that Chosen was inside of his domain, there was no chance he could escape.\nEven other apostles feared this attack of his, and so that meant he had won.\nHe knew of Stark's revive abilities since he had seen them himself before, and trapped inside of this domain, he would easily eliminate him as soon as he got up.\nBut then, something happened.\nOut of nowhere, a sensation—a flicker of divine energy—radiated from deep within Stark's equipment.\nHe could feel it pulse, glowing faintly in the darkness.\nThe [Priest's Cross], the item he had acquired from Father Hugo, flared to life.\n[Priest's Cross: If overwhelming darkness is sensed, then the cross will completely cancel it, transfering all of it back to the attacker, dealing devastating damage to them.]\nIn the instant the cross activated, a burst of holy light erupted from it, the darkness around Stark being repelled like a tide retreating from the shore.\nThe void shattered, the dark energy that had been sapping his strength and sense of self was torn away, and all of it was funneled back toward Aphex in a single, earth-shattering explosion.\nBOOM!\nA massive shockwave pulsed outward, and Aphex screamed as the pure, blinding light of the cross consumed him.\nThe damage counter surged wildly.\n-5,849,282!\n[Aphex HP: 11,336,606/25,000,000]\nThe force of the attack was so immense that Aphex was sent staggering, his body wracked with pain.\nHis form, usually so impervious, seemed to crack under the weight of the explosion.\nHe coughed, his face contorted in anger.\nHis once-imposing stature wavered for a moment as the explosion dealt unimaginable damage to him.\n\"YOU FUCKING BITCH,\" Aphex hissed, his voice filled with unrelenting rage.\n\"Damn, are you going crazy,\" Stark backed away, his pupils shaking a bit as he sensed the aura emanating from the apostle.\n\"KILL YOURSELF!\"\nWith a roar of fury, Aphex summoned one of his two final trump cards.\nHe raised his hands to the sky, and the heavens themselves seemed to respond.\nThe moon above began to shimmer, glowing with a sinister red hue.\nLunar Cataclysm (Immortal Skill).\nThe moon itself seemed to break free from the sky, descending toward Termina.\n[Lunar Cataclysm: Aphex calls upon the power of the moon itself to summon a massive, ghostly projection of the lunar surface. The projection descends onto the battlefield, crushing everything beneath it]\nThe sheer size of the moon's reflection was terrifying, casting the entire battlefield into a dark, ominous glow.\nStark watched in horror as the lunar orb descended, its sheer weight creating shockwaves that rattled the earth beneath him.\nThe reflection of the moon cast everything in deep shadows.\nStark felt his heart pound as he watched the cataclysm unfold before him.\nThis was it.\nIf he didn't act, there would be no escape from the coming doom.\nThe moon's descent was the final judgment—an unstoppable force descending upon him.",

though Stark didn't care about himself since he could revive, the others couldn't.\nIn the crater, Aphex hovered above, his arms crossed, his laughter echoing like thunder.\nBut then he suddenly remembered something: there were still items available besides his, weren't there?\nEvery single item on the bodies of the other participant was disintegrated by the spear, but those on Lilith's, Sora's and Follower's should still be good to go... right?\n[Stark Items: Cooldown Gem, Double Power, Blood-Sainted Amulet and Clarity Orb]\n[Lilith Items: Teleportation Sphere]\n[Sora Items: Armor Reinforcement Shard]\n[Follower Items: ???, ???, ???, ???, ???]\nAt least that is what he knew.\nHis brain directly went to the [Teleportation Sphere] though, with it, they could definitely survive!\nInstantly, Stark dashed toward Lilith, wanting to grab the sphere and teleport all of them out of the falling moon's way.\nIf he could manage that, then not only would he get out of the crater, but there was a bigger chance at victory since he would also kill Follower!\n\"...\" the black demon that hovered around the unconscious man looked up, seemingly unbothered.\n\"COME ON,\" Stark shouted, reaching Lilith's body and trying to see if he could acquire the [Teleportation Sphere] somehow.\n[Teleportation: Teleport you and all the people close to you in a 1-meter radius to a location you pinpoint.]\n[In an unconscious state, you can steal the items of the other participants!]\n\"YES!\"\nStark was ecstatic, it meant his plan could actually work!\nBut of course... with Stark, every time something good happened, something far worse needed to balance it out.\n\"You really think I'm going to allow you to do that?\" Aphex laughed out loud, beginning to float in the air and then pointing at Stark right as he was about to use the item, \"GRAVITY FLUX!\"\n[Gravity Flux: Manipulates gravity to control the battlefield and slow enemies.]\nHe had already tried to use it two times before, but both time it was simply to slow down Stark.\nThis time though...\nFWISH!\nUsing his gravity powers, Aphex sent Stark flying in the opposite direction to the two girls, and though he tried to run forward and even use [Domi-Chain Restrain] to bring them to him, it was useless.\nNow only 1 kilometer above ground, the giant moon kept coming down.\nThe crater stretched by dozens of kilometers, so the moon perfectly fit inside.\nIt felt like [Heaven's Spear], but in this case it would be [Heaven's Moon]...\n\"Insanity,\" Stark whispered, rage building up inside of him.\n\"Enjoy, kid!\" Aphex, sensing that the kid didn't have any chance to save his companions, began floating out of the crater left by the spear, as he wasn't immune to his attack either.\nFollower's demon did the same thing, grabbing the body of the priest and seemingly teleporting out of existence, only reappearing out of the crater in a black flash of aura.\nThat thing was REALLY adamant on keeping Follower alive for some reason.\nAnd now, Stark, Lilith and Sora were the only people left in the crater, facing the wrath of the [Lunar Cataclysm] skill.\nThe [Teleportation Sphere] was still in Stark's hands, but he didn't have the time to reach the two girls, as Aphex also seemed to observe him from above, ready to use [Gravity Flux] again.\nNow he needed to make a decision: does he teleport out by himself, dooming the two girls for sure, or does he just stay back to take the gamble?\n\"...\" Stark's face turned cold, but the fury inside of him kept growing more and more, the vortex in his eyes intensifying.\n[Make your choice.]\n...\nIn the outside world, people were absolutely baffled, too.\nThe fight had been intense, sure, but this was on a whole other level.\nThe broadcast made sure that everyone could understand what was happening by showing it to everyone.\nWhen the description of the [Teleportation Sphere] appeared, people felt hopeful as they thought Stark could survive.\nBut once [Gravity Flux] kicked in and stopped him from saving them, most people felt perplexed.\nAnd to make it even more interesting, the words [Make a choice] didn't appear in front of Stark, not at all, but on the screens of everybody.\n\"This is insane!\"\n\"What the fuck?!\"\n\"Save them!\"\nOn one hand, the camera turned toward the girls, with the text [Stay back and try to save them] appearing on the right, and then once Stark looked down, the camera would zoom on the [Teleportation Sphere].\nAnd the text that appeared sent shivers down the spine of many: [Leave them to die, save yourself.]\n\"...\" Mike Gardenis, Sora's father, went pale with nervousness.\n\"...\" and the rest of the family as well.\nIn fact, most of the world was silent at that moment.\nThe words [Make your choice] didn't disappear as Stark darted his pupils from the two girls to the [Teleportation Sphere] repeatedly.\nThe risk of the choice was the following for Stark: either he saves himself and doesn't lose his only revive, or he tries to save the two girls, with a major chance of it failing, and all of them losing their lives.\nThough of course, no one knew that Stark could revive.\n\"Come on, just use the teleportation sphere,\" people shouted.\n\"You have to try, stop wasting time,\" the rest also shouted.\nThe world was split between the two choices, though the most logical one was obvious: to save his own life.\nEven Mike and the Gardenis family knew very well that no one would risk their lives for two people, especially in such a deadly trial.\nStark's gaze kept lingering on the [Teleportation Sphere] more and more.\n\"...\" Elise Gardenis, Sora's mother, as well as her father and two siblings all stood silent, tears streaming down from their eyes.\nThey were sure that they could say goodbye to their daughter now.\nEveryone was sure, in fact, that Stark would choose the smartest option out of the lot.\nAnd so, the time came where he needed to choose.\n\"Alright,\" Stark mumbled to himself, opening his eyes and the aura in them burning brighter than ever before, \"I know what to do now.\"\nBut instead of looking at the [Teleportation Sphere] or even [Lilith and Sora] options, he looked up at the falling reflection of the moon.\nA third option appeared at that moment.\nOne that was so impossibly foolish to do that no one could understand how Stark could even think of doing that.\nThis was his final choice, and even if he failed, he could proudly say he gave it his all.\n\"Trying to play hero? How quaint!\" Aphex sneered, his outstretched hand glowing with gravitational energy.\n\"I'm not leaving them!\" Stark growled, his crimson aura flickering in defiance.\n\"Well, then get ready,\" Aphex laughed, \"It's too late now.\"\nThe reflection of the moon was right above Stark, and he needed to do what he wanted to do now, because if he didn't at least try, he knows he would regret it.\nPlus, Lana would probably insult him with every name in the book.\nAnd above all else... he didn't want them to die.\nHe chose the third option without hesitation.\n[Third Option: Face the Lunar Cataclysm head on.]",

It knew what was expected. Stark could feel its understanding without words.\nHis [Asura's Arms] were still on cooldown, destroyed earlier in the fight, leaving him with nothing but this desperate gamble.\nSo instead, he put his entire focus on [EGO].\n\"You're final hope, EGO,\" he mumbled, staring at the demon with such intensity even it knew it couldn't fail.\nEGO's massive arms rose as the moon bore down, the air vibrating with unrelenting force.\n\"Are you serious?!\" Aphex roared. \"You think you can stop that?\"\nThe world watched in stunned silence as EGO raised both arms, catching the reflection of the falling moon.\nA deafening shockwave erupted on impact, flattening everything within miles.\nEGO strained under the immense weight, its monstrous body trembling.\nStark stood below it, blood trickling from his mouth as the pressure threatened to crush him.\nHe refused to move.\n\"Hold it!\" he growled, his voice hoarse but commanding.\n\"Unbelievable,\" Aphex muttered, his expression one of both shock and rage.\nThe broadcast caught every moment, every bead of sweat on Stark's face, every tremor in EGO's frame.\n\"C'mon, Chosen!\"\n\"Don't give up!\"\nDespite the overwhelming support, the struggle was far from over.\nIf he wanted to truly win, he needed to completely erase this attack from existence.\nAnd there was only one way to do it: [Negate Explosion], one of [EGO]'s perks!\nFor three agonizing minutes, Stark and EGO held the moon at bay, the celestial body spinning violently as if attempting to force its way down.\nThe ground beneath Stark buckled, his knees trembling but unyielding.\n\"NEGATE EXPLOSION!\"\nA panel appeared before him.\n[Negating an immortal skill may take some time...]\n[Do you want to use your two \"Negate Explosions\" to shorten the time required to negate this skill?]\n\"No.\" Stark growled through clenched teeth.\nSurprisingly, Stark refused, wanting to keep his second in case anything else similar happened, and to take Aphex off guard.\n[Very well, then hold on, master.]\nIt was the first time EGO ever spoke to him, even it sensing that this attack was danger.\nAnd while holding down the moon with Stark, it began to channel its energy to completely eradicate it.\n\"OH, NO, YOU DON'T,\" Alphex shouted, activating [Moonscourge Storm] around Stark.\n[Description: Aphex summons a massive vortex of lunar energy that traps all enemies within a 100-meter radius. The storm rains down energy crescents every second, they don't deal damage but weaken the enemy.]\nA whirlwind of energy crescents descended upon Stark.\nThe crescents didn't deal damage, but each one sapped his strength.\nStark's muscles burned, and his vision blurred, but he didn't falter.\n\"Keep going, EGO!\" Stark roared.\nThe outside world was a cacophony of shouting, pleading, and cheering.\nAnd right as the climax is about to happen, both EGO and Stark about to give up as they couldn't hold it any longer...\n\"HE'S GOING TO DIE!\"\n\"CHOSEN, KEEP GOING!\"\n\"Fuck, it's over...\"\nIt finally happened.\nNEGATE EXPLOSION!\n[The perk has been charged up, do you want to use it?]\n\"YES!\" Stark shouted at the top of his lungs, \"GET THIS SHITTY ASS THING OUT OF HERE!\"\n\"???\" Aphex and everyone else were confused.\n[Very well.]\nAn explosion emanated from EGO at that moment, covering the entirety of Termina, and cancelling every single skill in it.\nThe moment the energy touched the moon's reflection, it flickered and began to dissolve.\nThe [Lunar Cataclysm] skill was eradicated, the silver glow faded, and silence followed.\n\"HE DID IT!\"\n\"HOLY SHIT!\"\n\"I LOVE YOU CHOSEN!\"\nThe entire world went in an uproar, absolutely baffled that yet again, that black-haired boy somehow managed to find his way out of this situation!\nActually, Stark's fan club probably had millions of people by now.\n\"This is insane,\" Aiden Heartsouls had a hard time understanding the situation, \"This isn't normal.\"\n\"Dad, what the actual fuck,\" Jay gritted his teeth, HE was supposed to be the strongest sibling!\nHE was supposed to get all the praises, have a fan club and get beauties to join him.\nWhy was the little brother luckier than he was?\n\"...\" Lara and Nissa didn't say anything, none of Nissa's friends even texting her anymore, too absorbed in the broadcast, not wanting to miss a single second.\nOn the other hand, the Gardenis family was having a party.\n\"LET'S GO KIDDO!\" Mike Gardenis shouted, jumping in excitement, \"DAMN RIGHT, YOU STAYED BACK FOR THEM!\"\nElise chuckled beside him, \"He must love her very much to stand back and take that...\"\n\"Yeah,\" Mike sighed, \"I don't even know anybody crazy enough to do what he did.\"\nWhen you think about it, those outside the trial could only understand one thing: Stark was given a choice, one that could extremely easily protect his life, but in exchange for the two girls'.\nAnd yet, Stark just refused to take any of the options, creating a third one out of nowhere, and one that was infinitely more dangerous than the other two.\nOnly someone that cherished the other party very much would do that.\nMeanwhile, Aphex stared at the scene below, stunned.\nStark stood amidst the crater, bloodied and barely upright, but alive. The two girls, Lilith and Sora, remained unharmed.\n\"Chosen...\" Aphex gritted his teeth, \"You're about to fucking die, looks like you forced my hand.\"\nBut you know what's worse than just surviving an immortal-skill, being exhausted yet still forced to keep fighting?\nWell, it was to survive ANOTHER Immortal-Skill.\n\"Huh?\" Stark barely had time to catch his breath when he noticed something: the moon above shimmered again.\n\"If you survive this, I'll kill myself,\" Aphex mocked as he used the entirety of his power into this next attack.\nMOONLIT OBLITERATION!\n[Moonlit Obliteration: Aphex channels the entirety of his power to unleash a devastating explosion of lunar energy that annihilates everything within a 1-kilometer radius. The explosion leaves behind a barren wasteland where no skills or abilities can be activated for 20 seconds.

The explosion leaves behind a barren wasteland where no skills or abilities can be activated for 20 seconds. This skill halves Aphex's current HP upon use.]\nAs Aphex unleashed his most devastating ability, a sickening cough tore through his chest.\nDark blood splattered the ground as the backlash of the attack ravaged his body.\nHe gritted his teeth through the pain, his glowing form flickering like a dying star.\nBut to him, it was worth it.\nBOOM!\n-5,668,303!\nHe received the damage, which was half of his current health.\n[Aphex HP: 5,668,303/25,000,000]\nAphex was on the brink of death, but even then he couldn't give up.\n[Kill the Chosen One.]\nThis panel was omnipresent, always following him wherever he looked.\nThis was the task that the Godless Demon had given them, and he wouldn't let him down.\n\"NO MATTER WHAT,\" Aphex shouted.\nBOOOOOM!\nThe devastation he sought to unleash was already forming.\nA beam of raw lunar energy descended from the heavens, growing wider and brighter as it neared the Earth.\nThe sky split with a deafening roar, the ground trembling violently beneath its might as it threatened to consume everything.\n\"...\" Stark looked up, unfazed.\nHe was going to die, this was a certainty now.\nBut even then, he didn't care at all.\nHe was too far from the girls to hope to use the [Teleportation Sphere] on them while inside the radius of the attack.\nThe best thing he could do now was to save them and hope.\n\"Time Flow,\" he whispered, activating one of [Focus]'s perks to slow down time for three seconds.\nDuring these three seconds, he put his plan into action.\nThe lunar energy was right above him, slowed down, and he couldn't afford to waste a single second.\n\"Come on, help me for once,\" He looked down at the [Sculk Necklace] he was carrying.\nStark had realized that for a [Domination] user, equipment never really mattered: they advanced way too fast to even hope of keeping a single equipment or gear.\nThat is why none of those he met until now had used them, and that could be the same for Stark.\nSculk, though it annoyed him a lot in the second trial, could now easily be broken through by monsters and humans at his level.\nBut there was one more use for it: he could control the sculk, meaning that he was able to do some things even from a large distance.\nAnd that is what he planned to do now.\nGripping the [Teleportation Sphere] in his hand, he activated it.\n[Whisper your location into the sphere, then tap it once more to teleport all people in range instantly.]\nHe did as told, whispering the words \"at the edge of Termina\" into the item.\n[Coordinates found, please tap again to teleport.]\nBut he didn't activate it for himself, though he could, instead he immediately threw it at intense speed toward Lilith and Sora.\nAnd that's when the sculk would come into play: he could control it from far.\n\"COME ON,\" he repeated, extraction the dark blue liquid from the necklace and sending it forward, creating a hand made out of sculk, one of its fingers pointed as it dashed forward.\nThe sculk hand followed the teleportation sphere closely, and when it reached the appropriate distance to the two unconscious girls, Stark tapped the sphere with the hand.\n\"...\" he didn't know if it would work, but it was his best bet.\nAnd...\nDing!\n[Teleportation successful!]\nIn a flash of light, Sora and Lilith vanished from the battlefield, their unconscious forms transported far beyond the crater, out of danger.\n\"LET'S FUCKING GO!\" Stark wanted to shout and dance, but he quickly remembered about his situation and saw what was above him.\n[Time Flow deactivated.]\n\"This is gonna hurt,\" he muttered with a resigned sigh as the time resumed normally, \"But oh well.\"\n\"HAHA, DESPERATE NOW, ARE YOU?!\" Aphex had abandoned every single thought besides this battle, he truly wanted to get rid of Stark now.\n\"Well,\" Stark smiled as he looked at Aphex directly in the eyes, \"I guess I'll be back in 30 seconds,\" he shrugged.\n\"Huh, what do you mean by that-\"\nBOOM!\nHe didn't have the time to finish his sentence.\nThe beam struck, engulfing the crater in an unrelenting torrent of energy.\nThe broadcast cut to silence as the beam erased everything within the crater.\nThe ground, the air, and even the light seemed to vanish under its destructive force.\nThe world outside the trial watched in stunned horror.\n\"CHOSEN!\"\n\"NOOOO!\"\n\"And here we thought he had a chance...\"\nPeople in the outside world were terrified: there was no chance Chosen could survive this.\n\"After all of this?\"\nAnd to make things worse, and also more misleading for everyone involved, the screens displaying Stark's status went dark, the red cross marking his square as deceased.\nOnly Sora, Lilith, and the silent Follower remained.\nEveryone else was dead.\nThe audience erupted into chaos.\nThey saw in their screens through the bright lunar energy that Stark's body was disintegrated, turning into nothingness, and many couldn't fathom that truth.\nThey only knew that kid for a few hours now, but even then, it was insane to think about.\n\"This is...\" Arthur and Louise Moonless, Lana's parents, were shocked, \"What the hell...\"\n\"...!\" even Aoki Moonless, her brother, was terrified.\nHe didn't like Stark as he saw him as someone that could steal his sister, but still, it was insane to think about.\nDid he just die? Like this? Not even trying anything out?\nOr maybe he abandoned, sensing that Aphex was too powerful?\nThe Gardenis Family was no different either, their jaws hitting the floor.\nAnd it wasn't because Chosen had died or because of the intense power of this attack.\nNot at all.\nInstead...\n\"This kid...\" Mike couldn't help but look down, tears dripping from his eyes.\nAs said before, all of Sora's family were all really expressive, she was the only one that wasn't.\n\"He...\" Gardenis continued, her pupils shaking, \"The last thing he did was... save them...\"\nThat was the conclusion everybody could reach by simply watching.\nInstead of trying to find another solution or escape himself, Stark instead decided to give it his all, activating the [Teleportation Sphere] and sending it toward the two girls while using some weird liquid power to activate it from a distance.\nSora and Lilith were saved, as the camera showed them at the edge of Termina, very far from the danger.\nBut even then... that kid sacrificed himself.\nDid he love Sora that much? Would anyone be this crazy?\nIf Mike and Elise knew about him before, and if Sora had told them about him, then maybe they would have accepted him as a son-in-law.\nBut now it was too late.\nAnd finally... Stark's family.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nNone could say anything, they just looked down.\nWasn't this what they wanted from the start?\nThe moment they kicked Stark out of their home, they expected him to either come crawling back or just die.\nThey preferred the latter, simply because it wouldn't tarnish their family name any longer if the weakest link was done for.\nAnd now that it was done.\nSomehow, they felt a bit sad.\nIt probably because of the context, though, and because they knew the entire world was watching Stark's powers.\nHe probably had no idea he was being watched by millions, yet he still did all of that cool shit regardless.\nHe still saved those girls because he wanted to, not for validation.\nTruly fascinating: he was completely different from them.\nThey kept watching, though, none of them saying anything or shedding a single tear as what was done was done, they couldn't change it.\nNow the world needed to watch for what would happen.\nWith Chosen dead; and Lilith, Sora and Follower unconscious, though the latter was protected by some black demon, every participant was out.\nIt was over, and so now they needed to figure out what the \"horrible thing that would happen to humanity\" was.\nIn every household, every school, every hotel, every building, every restaurant, everyone watched.\nEven those in rifts took the time out of their day to stop their trainings and fights to observe.\n[Chosen's Dead?!]\n[Nooo, he was my favorite!]\n[Fuck Aphex!]\nThousands of discussions on forums and private messages spread, the news hitting everybody in mere seconds, even those that said they \"didn't want to watch this useless shit\".\nThe only person that was truly unfazed by all of this was Lana Moonless, who was still patiently waiting in their apartment.\nNot a single tear, not a single bat of an eye.\nShe knew that Stark hadn't truly died after all, so why would she care.\nShe also was the only one who knew of his \"other\" ability, so no wonder.\nBack in the trial, the massive beam of lunar energy kept coming down for 30 additional seconds, blinding everything in the surroundings.\n\"Haha...\" Aphex laughed, \"HAHAHAHHAHAHA!\"\nHis sheer determination in killing Stark and completing his task, as well as his insanity and the blows he received, made him forget of the most crucial thing of all.\nBut right as the beam stopped, the trial going quite again, he suddenly reminisced Stark's words.\n\"See you in 30 seconds.\"\nAnd at that very moment, he finally remembered about the revive, thanking himself for remembering it at such a crucial time.\n\"IDIOT!\" Aphex kept laughing, ready to descend and end it once and for all, as he still had more than enough time to kill Stark the moment he reappeared.\nWhich meant...\nThat Aphex and the apostles had won.\nIt was game over for the boy.",

      "content": "Aphex floated above the glowing crater, his laughter booming across the barren wasteland left behind by Moonlit Obliteration.\n\"Alright, time to die,\" he declared, his voice full of triumph and disdain.\nThe devastation he'd unleashed had reduced everything within a kilometer radius to nothingness.\nStark's annihilation seemed absolute.\nThe Chosen One was dead—his body obliterated—and Aphex's victory appeared certain.\nHe descended slowly, preparing to confirm Stark's death and possibly kill him again if he revived, his mind racing with the possibilities of what awaited him after this victory.\nHe knew that Stark had the ability to revive himself; he'd seen it firsthand before.\nBut this time, it felt different. This time, he was sure Stark had no way out of this as Aphex would be waiting for him.\nThe moon apostle sneered.\n\"Idiots,\" he muttered to himself, thinking of his fallen comrades.\nHow had they failed to recognize Stark's revival ability in the heat of battle?\nTheir incompetence had paved the way for him, Aphex, to claim glory.\nThe Godless Demon's task echoed in his mind: Kill the Chosen One.\nAphex could already see himself promoted as the one who fulfilled this divine quest.\nThis was his moment—his ascension.\nBut just as Aphex began to descend into the crater, ready to strike if Stark managed to revive, he felt it.\nClink. Fwish.\nA sudden weight pulled on his leg, accompanied by the cold, metallic clatter of a chain binding him.\n\"What the—?!\" Aphex whipped his head around, his eyes narrowing as a familiar voice rose from the shadows.\n\"Finally,\" the voice said, venom dripping from its tone. \"Now that he's gone, it's my time to shine!\"\nAphex looked down to see a dark chain coiled tightly around his ankle, pulsing with a sinister energy.\nHis pupils dilated as he traced the chain to its source.\nFollower.\nThe man stood below, a wide, feral grin on his face, his posture relaxed but his eyes burning with unbridled intent.\nThe dark demon that was protecting him at all costs had seeped back into his body, waking him up when he noticed that Stark was dead.\n\"Did you really think I'd just sit back and let you have your way?\" Follower taunted. His voice was sharp, cutting through the air.\nAphex's shock turned to anger as he yanked against the chain, attempting to free himself. \"What the hell is this?!\" he barked.\nFollower tilted his head mockingly. \"What does it look like, you overgrown lunatic (pun intended)? It's your death sentence.\"\nDark energy rippled across the chain as Follower pulled hard, dragging Aphex toward him.\nThe apostle stumbled mid-air, his once-commanding presence faltering.\n\"Follower…\" Aphex growled, his voice dripping with malice. \"Do you honestly think you can stand against me?\"\nFollower's grin widened. \"Oh, I don't think, I know. Now that the other asshole's gone, it's just you and me!\"\nAphex shot a blast of lunar energy toward Follower, aiming to sever the chain binding him, but the attack dissipated harmlessly against its dark surface.\nThe chain pulsed again, its dark glow intensifying.\nFollower yanked Aphex down, closing the distance between them in a heartbeat.\n\"You've gotten cocky,\" Follower sneered. \"But let's see how that arrogance fares against me.\"\nAphex countered with a swipe of his crescent-shaped blades, slashing at the chain itself.\nSparks flew, but the chain held firm.\n\"Tch. Annoying pest,\" Aphex spat, his rage building.\nHe channeled lunar energy into his blades and struck again, this time forcing the chain to loosen slightly.\nFollower's eyes narrowed as he tightened his grip on the chain. \"You're not getting away that easily!\"\nThe two clashed, exchanging blows with a ferocity that shook the ground beneath them.\nFollower's dark magic swirled like a storm, each strike aimed at overpowering the weakened apostle.\nAphex, though injured and drained from his ultimate attack, fought back with a relentless fury.\nFor a brief moment, they seemed evenly matched, their attacks canceling each other out.\nBut after 30 seconds, Aphex's patience snapped.\n\"Enough of this!\" he roared, gathering an immense amount of lunar energy into his hands.\nThe air grew heavy as a silver glow enveloped him, his power threatening to explode outward.\nMoonfall Eradication!\nFollower didn't flinch.\nHe lunged forward, his chains, which were a new perk he got, were snaking through the air like vipers, aiming to entangle Aphex completely.\nChains of Darkness!\nThe two collided, their powers clashing in a blinding display of light and dark.\nThe battlefield trembled, the ground cracking under the weight of their struggle.\nBut just as Aphex began to gain the upper hand, his rage boiling over, Follower noticed something strange.\n\"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!\" Aphex's voice thundered, filled with a mix of fury and desperation.\nFollower blinked, momentarily caught off guard. \"What?\"\nAphex's eyes blazed as he struggled against the chains binding him. \"YOU FUCKING IDIOT! CHOSEN'S NOT DEAD!\"\nFollower froze, his grip on the chains faltering for just a moment.\n\"What… did you just say?\" Follower's voice was low, almost disbelieving.\nAphex's expression twisted into one of frustration and panic. \"YOU'RE A FUCKING DUMBASS!\"\nFollower's mind raced as he processed the apostle's words.\nCould it be true? Could Stark still be alive even after enduring Moonlit Obliteration?\nAphex seized the moment of hesitation to break free, shattering the dark chains with a surge of lunar energy.\n\"You've doomed us both, you idiot!\" he snarled, his blades slicing through the air as he advanced on Follower.\nFollower barely managed to dodge the attack, his confidence shaken.\nIf Stark truly wasn't dead, then everything he'd planned—the betrayal, the fight against Aphex—was pointless.\n\"I don't believe you!\" Follower shouted, though his voice lacked its usual conviction. \"That attack obliterated everything. There's no way he could've survived!\"\n\"Then why the hell do you think I'm so desperate to kill him now?\" Aphex barked, his movements growing erratic.\n\"Your bluff won't work on me, you lunatic-\"\nFollower tried to argue and continue his fight, after all, no one can survive being completely disintegrated like this.\nAnd yet...\nHe was instantly proven wrong, not even able to complete his sentence.\nBecause then, the impossible happened.\nA blinding light pierced the heavens, illuminating the barren battlefield like a divine beacon.\nIt was not the silver glow of Aphex's lunar energy nor the oppressive darkness of Follower's magic.\nThis was something else.\nSomething holy.\nBoth combatants froze mid-attack, their gazes drawn upward.\n\"No,\" Aphex whispered, his face contorting in disbelief.\nAbove them, the sky had begun to crack and splinter, like a glass dome struck by an unseen force.\nThrough the fissures, a radiant figure emerged, its presence suffused with an overwhelming, divine aura.\nIt was Heaven's Spear.",

There's no way he could've survived!\"\n\"Then why the hell do you think I'm so desperate to kill him now?\"\n\"Your bluff won't work on me, you lunatic-\"\nAnd at that moment, Stark felt that the moment was right.\nHe raised his hand upward, channeling all of his energy into his next attack.\nHEAVEN'S SPEAR!\nThe sky split open as the [Angel of the Spear] appeared for the fourth time in this trial, ready to kick some ass.\n\"What the fuck...\" Follower looked up, his eyes widening and pupils shaking: why was this thing back?!\n\"I TOLD YOU ALREADY, CHOSEN'S NOT DEAD!\" Aphex shouted again, he had missed his chance because of this idiot.\nAnd now that Stark was back, his strongest attack, akin to a legitimate nuke, available, he knew it was over.\nIn fact, Stark didn't even wait a single second, he didn't even want to see them or talk to them, neither did he want to make himself look superior.\nRight now, he just wanted to win this and get out of this trial, no matter what.\nAnd so he did the most logical thing.\n\"Angel of the spear,\" he whispered, smiling.\n[Yes, master?]\nThe giant angel in the sky looked down at the trial, his gaze lingering on the two insects before it.\nFwish!\nIt used its power to summon the giant spear in its hands, ready to eradicate anything and everything.\n\"Throw that spear into them, I want them dead, but make sure to not throw it with so much power as to kill me or the girls too.\"\n[Very well.]\nThe angel perfectly and immediately understood what Stark wanted from it as it had perfect control over the spear.\nAnd so... what had to happen happened.\nFwish...

Did he use any tricks?\nNo, the screens clearly showed him being disintegrated out of existence, even Aphex confirming it.\n\"This is insane...\"\n\"I knew Chosen wouldn't die!\"\n\"That's why he was so confident...\"\nAcross Rheria, in every country and city, people watched.\n\"NICE ONE, KID!\" Mike Gardenis nodded.\n\"Hm, as expected,\" Arthur Moonless sighed.\n\"...\" Aiden Heartsouls stared at the screen, shocked but not willing to say anything.\nAnd so, the first video played.\nIt displayed the fight between Judicator and Stark.\nBut the fight wasn't what interested Aphex, instead...\nIt was the part where Stark was cut in half.\nYou could clearly see that his body was split in half by the weapon, and even a panel came to confirm it.\n[Chosen has been killed.]\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Wait, that seems familiar...\"\n\"Those powers...!\"\nPeople slowly began to associate Chosen with the black-haired guy with crimson powers that had taken the media by storm thanks to his fight recordings.\nPreviously, Stark's face was hidden by [Aura Camouflage], but now in this trial he didn't bother using it, everyone seeing his real face in full view.\nOne minute after being killed by Judicator, the camera focused on Stark's body.\n\"What the...\" Follower's eyes widened.\nBetween Stark's upper and lower half, a crimson link was formed, and only a few seconds later, the two halves regrouped.\n[Chosen has been revived.]\nHe was back to normal, at full health and without any injuries.\nThis was beyond any resurrecting power even a saint or artifact level item could produce.\n\"Let's move,\" Aphex groaned, clapping his hands to make the first screen disappear.\nThen he snapped his fingers again, this time focusing on the second.\nIt displayed the fight between Stark and the Guardian Ape.\n\"Wait a minute, wasn't that the monster from the execution that went viral?\"\n\"You mean the one where the monster was immortal, and that guy used the sword of the ape to decapitate it?\"\n\"Shit was so cool...\"\n\"So it was Chosen, huh.\"\nSlowly, more and more similarities between the two appeared.\nBlack hair? Check.\nSame body size? Check.\nCrimson aura? Check.\nExact same powers... CHECK!\nIt was now confirmed, no one could deny it: Chosen WAS that powerful guy that took the world by storm!\nOn the other hand, Jay Heartsouls, Stark's brother, was absolutely furious.\nWhile entering his very first secret realm, he had met with that guy, who was wearing a bunny-mask at the time.\nHe looked weak and without his place with all these strong people.\nAnd yet, remember how he had fucked him and his [Wyvern's Wrath] group over?\nJay still held a grudge to that guy after all this time.\nAnd now, he was finding out that it was his very own brother all this time?\nIt meant that Stark was the one that had humiliated his group by outsmarting and outpacing them, even though they were supposed to be the strongest.\nPlus, he stole the boss kill from them and got all the recognition from the other powerhouses.\n\"THAT FUCKING ASSHOLE...\" Jay couldn't believe it, his pupils shaking, his eyes mad with fury.\n\"Wow, what's happening?\" Aiden raised his eyebrows, surprised to see his son this mad.\n\"Stark is the one that... that... THAT FUCKED US OVER!\"\nHe couldn't believe it, and immediately contacted his group to tell them about the news.\nThey were just as surprised.\nAnd yet...\n[Well, there's nothing we can do.]\nThey all answered.\n[Huh? What do you mean there's nothing you can do?]\n[Jay, that guy got us fair and square, plus, do you not seem him right now? He could kick our asses with his eyes closed...]\n[That...]\nThat was true.\nJay was currently level 430, but if Stark managed to take on monsters at level 600 and even, as Aphex could actually be comparable to a level 750 if not more.\nThen it meant he stood no chance if he fought him.\nHe was too weak to do anything.\nPlus, even if he was level 900, confident he could take on Stark, couldn't his little brother just... you know... tactical nuke him and the entire city to win?\nHe needed more power...\n'I need... more... power...' a vortex of spinning aura and insanity appeared in his eyes.\nAnd at that moment, a crimson panel appeared before him.\n[Do you want more power?]\n[Join me, and you will gain so much of it you'll become invincible!]\nNo one but him could see that panel as his parents and sisters kept looking at the screens, which displayed some of the fight between Stark and the Guardian Ape.\n[You'll always be in the shadow of your brother, and in the shadow of everybody else.]\nA holographic crimson hand appeared before Jay, urging him to take it.\n[Take my hand, and we'll become strong.]\n\"...\" Jay's eyes widened at the sight, it was beautiful, \"I... I... I wanna defeat everybody...\" his expression was of pure hatred.\n[Then we will.]\n\"Very well,\" Jay took the hand of the entity, accepting its conditions.\n[Then let us become stronger.]\nDing!\n[You have initiated the \"Godless Demon Curse\".]\n[You will rise higher than all of your peers.]\nJay was ready to take his revenge and prove to the world that he was the true winner.\nHe was the one that was about to get his harem of beauties and have them agree to all share him.\nHe was the one... that would go farther than Stark ever could.\n...\nBack to the screens, the battle finally reached the moment where the Guardian Ape crushed Stark, destroying all his bones and organs.\nBut just like before, after less than a minute, and the Guardian Ape thinking he had won, Stark's body suddenly began to reform.\nIt was a gruesome sight, but the bones reformed and all his crushed limbs went back to normal.\n[Chosen has been revived.]\nAnd so what followed was obviously what all the classifiers had been fantasizing of doing: an execution.\n\"Still as cool as ever.\"\n\"Chosen's so cool~\"\n\"Marry me!\"\nFwish!\nHe pulled the blade that pierced the guardian's neck and used it to decapitate it.\n\"Do you see now?\" Aphex clapped his hands again, the second screen disappearing.\n\"So he can just... come back?\" Follower thought, \"This doesn't seem believable...\"\n\"Who knows, now just watch what actually happened inside that crater,\" Aphex snapped his fingers.\nThis time, even he would discover at the same time as everyone else the contents of the third screen.\nIt showed Stark's body get erased from existence by the [Moonlit Obliteration] beam, that made sense.\nBut then... while they were fighting, less than 60 seconds later...\nFwish! Fwish! Fwish!\nCrimson energy began to crackle in the air around the location Stark had been killed.\nAnd then...\nFwish! Fwish! Fwish!\nSlowly, Stark's body to reform.\nHis cells, which were erased, began to appear again to create his body.\nFirst it was his legs, then his stomach, and his torso, arms and finally, his head.\nAnd just like that, Stark was back to before.\nPrevious, Stark's revive only put him at one hp, but maybe because of his upgrade in aura, this revive brought him back to max hp.\n\"Do you understand now?\" Aphex looked down, gritting his teeth, \"You fucked us both,\" he pointed up at the angel.\n\"No... this doesn't make sense...\" Follower shook his head, \"So he can just revive himself an infinite amount of times?!\"\nAphex shook his head, \"No, Lord Godless went as far as to use an artifact altar to check out his talent, and all it says was that he can revive himself once.\"\n\"So basically, he revived himself once with the token, then again with his talent, huh.\"\n\"Pretty much.\"\nAt that moment, Stark had felt that the moment was right as he didn't like wasting any more of his precious time in this place.\nAnd so that brings us back to before:\n\"Throw that spear into them, I want them dead, but make sure to not throw it with so much power as to kill me or the girls too.\"\n[Very well.]\nFwish... BOOM!\n\"HOLY SHIT!\"\n\"...\"",

CHOSEN!\"\n\"LET'S GOOO!\"\n\"HE'S BACK!\"\nPeople outside the trial were all celebrating Stark's survival, but as he didn't even know he was being watched, he simply kept looking, his aura still flaring around him.\n[You have slain \"Aphex, The Lord of the Moon\" and gained 100,000,000 experience points!]\nThat was the confirmation he needed.\nHe had won!\nDing!\n[The boss of the trial has been slain by Chosen.]\n[The Third Domination Trial has ended.]\n\"Phew...\" Stark smirked.\nWith that, only he, Sora and Lilith survived that hell\n15 at the start, 3 at the end, it was a good ratio considering this trial was from the [Death] difficulty.\nDing!\n[All alive participants have been healed.]\n[All effects have been removed.]\n[All skill cooldowns have been reset.]\nThis meant that it truly was the end of the trial.\nTermina was destroyed, all the commanders were dead and the moon apostle was defeated.\n\"Hopefully that's the last one,\" he groaned, unsure what could possibly be worse than what they went through.\n[This trial had been broadcasted to the entire world, say \"Hello\" :)!]\nA screen appeared before Stark, showing himself from the point of view of an invisible camera in front of his face.\n\"...\"\n[Say \"Hello\"! They've been watching you since the beginning!]\n\"...\"\n[You... don't want to greet them :)?]\nStark's pupils were shaking, the vortex of aura in his eyes intensifying.\nWhoever controlled this trial just told him that all this hardship had been recorded and transfered for the whole world to see?\nEvery death of his, every skill he displayed... were shown?\nBut he knew he couldn't do anything about it, no.\nAnd so he did the only thing he thought at that moment.\nWhile winking, closing one of his eyes, the second emitting a powerful and intimidating crimson trial, he smiled:\n\"Did you have fun watching us?\"\nThat's all he said before reaching for the invisible camera, punching it and cutting off the transmission.\nOutside the trial, everyone was left in shock.\nStark's gaze and aura at that moment sent chills down the spine of millions, and his eyes made it look like he could actually see them through their screens.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nNo one dared to say anything, even the most powerful of classifiers sweating a bit.\nLilith and Sora, at the edge of Termina, began waking up thanks to the [Status Effect Removal], both of their bodies fully healed, looking at one another.\nThey had been asleep since the very first heaven's spear was thrown in the square, meaning they had no idea what happened.\nAll they knew was the panel indicating their victory has appeared.\nWhich meant... Stark had actually done it!\n\"Or maybe Chosen's dead and someone else finished the job,\" Lilith joked, though that was unlikely.\nThe moment she uttered that joke though, Sora lost her composure, grabbing Lilith by the collar, \"Never said that again, you idiot.\"\nIt was the first time in her life she got mad, she didn't know why herself, she just didn't want to imagine that Stark was dead.\n\"W-Well, let's go back to the center and see...\" Lilith mumbled.\n\"No need,\" Sora went back to her emotionless self, \"Look\".\nShe pointed at a massive panel that appeared in the sky, visible to all.\n[Sending you back to reality in one minute, you will all be teleported to the same spot :)]\n\"To the same spot?\"\nUsually when faced with a Domination Trial, you would reappear where your body previously was.\nWhat changed this time?\nBack to Stark, he was still surrounded by the mist of the aftermath of the spear throw, observing his experience gains from killing Aphex.\n100,000,000 experience points were no joke after all!\nDing!

Will they reveal themselves as the protector of Earth all these years?\n[4...]\nThey will surely get millions of fans.\n[3...]\nPeople will wonder how to get the domination class.\n[2...]\nThose who have it will bask in fame.\nBut to be honest, why did none of the domination users reveal their powers even until now? Why did nobody try to flex?\n[1...]\nIn the end, though it did matter, Stark just sighed.\n[Teleporting all participants, congratulations on your victory!]\nBut the panel that appeared in front of him shattered all of that relief.\n[Winners: Sora, Lilith, Chosen and...

Follower.]\nStark's eyes widened as he saw that.\nThe brilliant light of teleportation enveloped Stark, Sora and Lilith, transporting them from the battleground to the bustling capital of Fellarburg.\nThe moment Stark appeared, the square erupted with gasps, shouts, and frantic whispers.\n\"HOLY SHIT!\"\n\"That's them?! Chosen?!\"\n\"WHAT?!\"\nCameras flashed in quick succession, capturing the trio as they stood amidst the chaos.\nStark stood unmoving, his gaze locked onto the ground.\nHis usually sharp eyes were wide and unfocused, his pupils trembling with the weight of the name he had seen on the panel.\nFollower.\nHow had he survived? Stark clenched his fists, his thoughts spiraling into a chaotic whirlpool.\nWas it another trick?\nThat aura of his… it felt familiar. Could it be?\nA horrifying possibility gripped his mind: Godless Demon.\nStark's expression darkened, his crimson aura beginning to flare around him, flickering like a warning beacon.\n\"Let's go,\" Sora said softly, tugging at Stark's arm.\nShe clearly disliked the attention, her discomfort not visible though, \"We should head home, Stark.\"\nLilith, standing beside them, sighed heavily. \"Can I come with you two? I don't live in this country, and I don't exactly have anywhere to go.\"\n\"Fine, but don't be an annoyance!\"\nDespite their conversation, Stark didn't answer.\nHe didn't move. His aura continued to intensify.\nInstead, through all the noises and flashes of the camera, he looked up, his face completely covered by his crimson aura, intimidating everyone who was watching.\n\"What the…\"\n\"Chosen being… chosen, huh?\" one onlooker muttered nervously.\nThe Darkness Appears\nJust as the teleportation light dissipated entirely, the uneasy murmurs turned into shouts of confusion.\n\"Wait a minute… what is that?!\"\n\"W-Why is he alive?\"\n\"THE FUCK!\"\nStark's gaze followed the direction of their shouts.\nHis aura flared as his eyes landed on the figure emerging from the light, and there, he saw him... no... IT.\nFollower.\nBut this wasn't the human he had fought in the trial.\nThe figure standing before them was transformed, his form twisted and unrecognizable, he looked exactly like the dark entity that was protecting him in the trial.\nHis entire body was shrouded in an undulating darkness, the edges of his form rippling like smoke.\nTowering horns spiraled upward from his head, and his glowing red eyes pierced through the gloom like beacons of malevolence.\n\"Lord Godless has given me a chance,\" Follower whispered, his voice distorted and reverberating unnaturally.\nHe dropped to one knee, as though bowing to an unseen master, charging up energy at the same time, \"I shall take it.\"\nBefore him, a crimson panel hovered in the air, its sinister commands etched in glowing letters:\n[Kill them all.]\n[I do not care about Chosen anymore; he will mean nothing upon my descent.]\n[Just kill the maximum amount of classifiers possible. Avoid any and all danger. Do not engage directly in a fight.]\n[The human race will disappear, birthing a new, superior one.]\nFollower rose to his feet, the panel vanishing. \"Yes, Lord Godless,\" he said, his dark aura crackling to life.\nStark's instincts screamed at him, his vision flooding with dozens of warning panels:\n[Warning! Warning! Warning!]\n[Avoid!]\n\"...!\"\nWithout hesitation, Stark summoned his Asura's Arms, the crimson limbs materializing in a blaze of energy.\nHe lunged toward Sora and Lilith, scooping them into his arms before leaping into the air.\nThe instant he left the ground, Follower's energy reached its peak.\nAfter activating [Godless Demon Transformation], he had finally done everything Godless wanted him to do, now all that was left was chaos.\n\"DARKNESS BLAST!\"\nThe shockwave tore through the square like a hurricane of destruction.\nBlack energy, sharp as a legendary blade, radiated outward in every direction.\nHundreds of classifiers and spectators caught in the blast had no time to react.\nTheir bodies were shredded, reduced to lifeless husks as the wave cut through flesh, stone, and steel alike.\nBuildings crumbled, their foundations obliterated by the sheer force of the attack.\nThe once-proud square was reduced to a smoldering ruin in a single instant.\nStark landed atop a shattered wall, holding the two girls tightly.\nHe gritted his teeth as he surveyed the devastation. Hundreds dead. All because of Follower.\nFollower stood in the epicenter of the destruction, his twisted form glowing with an unholy light.\nHe turned to Stark, a grin stretching across his shadowy face.\n\"Chosen, do you not realize?\" Follower's voice echoed mockingly. \"You can't even hope to hurt me now. My transformation is complete.\"\nStark released Sora and Lilith gently, his crimson aura flaring with unrestrained fury.\n\"Run,\" he ordered, his voice cold and unwavering. \"I'll deal with him.\"\n\"But—\" Sora stammered, her voice trembling.\n\"I SAID GO!\" Stark bellowed, his tone leaving no room for argument. \"You'll die if you stay here!\"\n\"Oh?\" Follower tilted his head, his grin widening. \"Do you truly believe I'll waste my time on you, Chosen?\"\nFollower's red eyes flickered, recalling the command from Godless's panel: Do not engage directly.\nWith a burst of speed, Follower leaped onto the roof of a nearby building, summoning a Darkness Blade into his hand.\nHis aura crackled with destructive energy as he scanned the city below.\n\"Goodbye, Chosen,\" he sneered, his voice filled with disdain.\nThen, with a laugh that echoed like a death knell, he dashed forward, slicing through anything in his path.\nStark's eyes narrowed as he watched Follower rampage across the city.\nFires erupted in his wake, and screams filled the air as civilians and classifiers alike fell victim to his blade.\nThe Godless Demon's influence had spilled into the real world.\nThis wasn't just a personal vmatter anymore—it was the beginning of something far worse.\nStark clenched his fists, his Asura's Arms blazing brighter. He couldn't let this continue.\nThis ends here.\nHe leaped from the wall, his crimson energy propelling him toward Follower.\nThe air around him crackled with power as he prepared to unleash everything he had.\n\"You think you can run from me?\" Stark roared, his voice cutting through the chaos as he reached Follower, faster than the transformed human.\nFollower turned, his red eyes gleaming with amusement.\n\"Oh, I'm not running,\" he replied, his tone dripping with mockery. \"I'm simply following orders. But if you're so eager to die, Chosen…\"\nThe darkness around Follower surged, his blade growing larger and more menacing.\n\"…I'll be happy to oblige.\"\nThe capital, now a battlefield, trembled as the two forces prepared to collide.\nThe clash between Stark and Follower would determine the fate of more than just this city—it would mark the first battle in the war against the Godless Demon's descent.\nAnd Stark, the Chosen One, wasn't about to lose.",

Only Chaos!]\nFollower chuckled, his twisted grin widening as he read the commands.\n\"I already know, Master,\" he muttered. \"But I am stronger than he is right now, meaning that our fight will create a massive amount of destruction.\"\n\"And what if I use Heaven's Spear to destroy your ugly face?\" Stark gritted his teeth, so mad that it almost felt like he was about to explode.\n\"Then I'd thank you, Chosen. You'd do more damage to this city than I ever could.\" He laughed, the sound sharp and biting.\nThis was true, because if he was asked to cause havoc in the capital as a warning of the Godless Demon's arrival, then Stark's spear, which at minimal power could destroy a massive amount of buildings and kill hundreds of thousands of people, then it would be their victory.\nBasically, Stark couldn't utilize his strongest skill right now.\nOr at least...\n'Until I make sure Sora, Lana and Lilith are safe,' he mumbled, 'But that's the last solution if everything fails.'\nEven so, he raised his arms.\n\"HEAVEN'S SPEAR!\"\nThe skies split open with an ear-splitting crack, revealing a gargantuan angelic figure, its towering form nearly blotting out the sun.\nIts divine presence filled the battlefield, its calm, yet imposing demeanor, a stark contrast to the chaos below.\nThe angel extended one colossal hand, summoning a spear of crimson energy so massive it dwarfed mountains.\n\"If I die for real, and the three girls I mentioned are within a safe range, throw the spear at Follower with the minimal amount of power possible.\"\n[Very well.]\nThe angel poised itself, the spear ready to launch. The sight sent shockwaves of terror through the already panicked crowd.\n\"OH MY FUCKING GOD!\"\n\"CHOSEN'S HERE?!\"\n\"SHIT! SHIT! WE'RE GOING TO DIE!\"\nIn addition to allowing him to kill Follower even if he died, the angel of the spear served as a warning, meaning that most people would probably leave the capital to save themselves.\n\"Very smart,\" Follower applauded, \"But it just won't be enough.\"\nWith a smirk, Follower raised his Darkness Blade, the twisted weapon extending unnaturally until it towered above the tallest buildings.\nAs said before, Follower had gained five new perks in addition to all his previous ones, and he wasn't about to let himself get trampled over by a kid.\n[Darkness Blade: Summons a dark blade that can extend up to a kilometer, it's one of the sharpest weapons ever, able to cut through anything.]\nAnd of course, Stark wasn't going to let that slide.\n\"Crimson Spears,\" he summoned his ten spears, launching them at Follower.\n-0! -0! -0!\nBut they did nothing.\n\"...Another one of those,\" he groaned, thinking about [Eternal Regret] and [Tormented One], who couldn't receive damage either.\nStark knew that his aura was weaker than Follower's though, so he wasn't going to try the [Banish Game] on him, and he could easily avoid [Heaven's Wrath], meaning that both solutions won't work.\nChosen wanted to kill Follower. But he also didn't want to die.\nFollower, on the other hand, didn't care if he died as long as he could cause destruction around Fellarburg.\n\"Are you not scared of death?\" Stark continued, eyeing the growing blade.\nFollower laughed, his voice warped and menacing.\n\"Why should I fear it? Lord Godless has promised salvation even in death. Besides, Chosen…\"\nHe stepped forward, the ground beneath him cracking under the weight of his aura. \"You can't hurt me. My body has adapted to all your attacks. You. Cannot. Win.\"\nBefore Stark could reply, reinforcements arrived, after such chaos, it was normal many classifiers would come.\n\"Hold it right there!\"\n\"We're here!\"\n\"Shit! Shit!\"\nSeveral classifiers, around fifty of them, regrouped around Stark and Follower, some of them wielding bows, other magic staffs, some with giant beasts around them, and overall just multiple powerful classifiers with different classes.\n\"Don't you dare move,\" one of them said, a massive snake surrounding his body\n[Alphons, Level 794, Beast Tamer]\n\"You're about to be executed,\" another, with a mask covering her face, said, holding a crucifix.\n[Eva, Level 810, Priest]\n\"Oh, if that's not Stark!\"\n\"It's actually him...\"\n\"To think he would grow so much.\"\n\"...!\" Stark's eyes widened.\nThe members of the [Crimson Moon Squad] were all here.\nIf you don't remember, they were the small team Stark joined when he entered the first secret realm, where he fought Judicator.\nHe hadn't seen them again until now, and he enjoyed their company, but in this context, it was bad.\nVex, Thorn, Lance, Stella, Olivia and Max.\nThey were all here.\nDuring the past year and so, they had grown from a meager level 100-120 team to a staggering level 500-600 each.\nAll the people around Stark and Follower were some of the most powerful classifiers that were nearby, ranging from level 500 all the way to level 900.\n\"More fun, more sacrifices,\" Follower whispered, his grin widening.\nAnd at that moment, Stark realized just how fucked everyone was.\n\"LET'S GO, ALL AIM AT HIM!\"\n\"Archers and Magus, stand back, those who attack from close-range rush!\"\nAll the classifiers did their job, those from the warrior and assassin classes dashing forward, while the rest stood from a distance, casting their own skills.\nYet despite their strength, Stark knew they didn't stand a chance.\n\"NO! YOU FUCKING IDIOTS,\" Stark shouted, \"YOU WON'T WIN!\"\nBut it was too late, his warnings falling on deaf ears.\nThe aura around Follower grew strong and stronger, corrupting the air around it, and before anybody could react, he unleashed another one of his new skills.\n\"Total Annihilation!\"\nHe swung the 1KM long blade, which flared with aura thanks to [Total Annihilation]\n[Total Annihilation: Can only be used thrice per day, buffs the Darkness Blade to its max, whoever it hits will be instantly killed as the blade ignores defense and level, but to make up for it, it is extremely easy to dodge if you know about it.]\nUnfortunately, though, no one knew about it, even Stark.\nAnd so what had to happen happened.\nFwish...\nFollower swung the [Darkness Blade] around him, hitting every single one of the classifiers, even those that were on top of the buildings.\nHe even hit Stark.\nFor a moment, there was silence, as if the world was waiting for someone or something to save them.\nYet... nobody came.\nBOOM!\nThe impact of [Total Annihilation] destroyed the entire street, killing every single one of the classifiers there.\nStark felt the blade slice through him, his vision blurring as he registered the damage.\n-99,999,999!\n[Your \"Crimson Barrier\" has broken.]\n[Your HP have reached 0, activating \"Crimson Healing\"...]\nDing!\n[You have been fully healed.]\nThe ultimate perk of [Crimson Healing] activated, saving him, but not everyone was so lucky.\nEverything in a one-kilometer radius was destroyed, every building disintegrated; every citizen and classifier dead.\nAll that was left was destruction and chaos, the ground now black from the explosion of aura.\nAnd the only person that stood amidst all of it was Stark, who was looking at the ground, his pupils shaking, his aura flaring stronger than ever before.\n\"...\"\nThe devastation was absolute, the ground charred and lifeless.\nFollower stood at the epicenter, his figure illuminated by the glow of his dark aura.\n\"You idiots…\" Stark whispered, his voice trembling.\nHe fell to his knees, his aura flaring uncontrollably as his rage consumed him.\nFollower chuckled, stepping forward. \"What did I tell you, Chosen? You're nothing. Weak. Useless. And now, everyone around you is dead. How does it feel?\"\nStark remained silent, his head bowed.\n\"Oh, don't sulk,\" Follower sneered. \"This is only the beginning. Lord Godless's plan is already in motion. You'll lose more than just these fools by the time it's over.\"\n\"...\"\nHe extended his arms, his darkness twisting into jagged wings.\n[Wings of the Devil: Summon two wings to enable flight.]\nThe wings erupted from his back with a burst of energy, casting an ominous shadow over the ruins.\n\"You're not even worth my time, Chosen,\" Follower spat. \"I have more important things to do, like slaughtering the rest of this pathetic city.\"\nAs he turned to take flight, Stark's aura surged violently.\n\"You can't escape me,\" his tone was neutral, even though his aura was shaking so violently it could knock out people.\nIn an instant, crimson chains erupted from the ground, ensnaring Follower's leg.\nDomi-Chains Restrain!\nThe chains burned with holy energy thanks to [Holy Infusion], tightening around Follower's limb and halting his ascent.\nStark's eyes glowed fiercely, his aura twisting and surrounded his entire figure until he resembled Follower himself,\n\"You're not going anywhere,\" Stark continued, unfazed.\n\"Are you not sad?\" Follower turned around, eyeing the human boy.\n\"I don't care, all I want is for you to die.\"\n\"You...\" Follower's eyes widened, and for the first time, he actually sweat a little bit as he saw Stark's aura.\nIt wasn't that he became emotionless, all of his rage and emotions simply went toward his aura, who became stronger than Follower's.\n\"You won't leave, you won't do anything, now just wait for your death,\" Stark finished, smirking.\n\"Forgive me, Lord Godless,\" Follower joined his hands together in response, \"I will get rid of this fool then finish the work, but I'll try to cause the maximum amount of damage while fighting to make up for it.\"\nWhile flapping his wings, Follower dashed toward Stark, ready to finally get rid of the Chosen One.",

You can't win. I don't even need to kill you right now. I can just leave you to wallow in your failure.\"\n\"...\" Stark didn't respond, and seeing his nonchalance, Follower lost his composure a little.\nHe raised a hand.\nDark energy coalesced around him as dozens of star-shaped projectiles formed in the sky.\nIt was one of his newly gained abilities.\n[Nightmare Stars: Makes dozens of star projectiles fall from the sky, destroying everything.]\nThe stars began to rain down, each one a harbinger of destruction.\nBuildings crumbled instantly under their weight, reduced to rubble and dust.\nFires erupted across the city, spreading rapidly as screams filled the air.\n\"...\" Stark was unfazed, using [Invincible Dodge] every time a projectile or Follower's blade got too close, \"Spear of Judgment!\"\nThe spear shot toward Follower, but he casually batted it away with his colossal blade.\n\"You're not even scratching me,\" Follower taunted, slashing his [Darkness Blade] through a line of classifiers attempting to regroup.\nTheir screams were cut short as the blade cleaved through them effortlessly.\nOnce a dozen level 800 or more classifiers grouped, Follower would then extend his blade again and use [Total Annihilation], killing every single one of them.\n\"Dodge Control!\"\nHis movements became a blur as he weaved through the carnage, dodging falling stars and Follower's relentless swings.\nHe closed the distance, his fists glowing with crimson energy, but as he struck, Follower's body shimmered with a dark aura.\n[Attack Negation: Able to cancel an attack from an enemy if you hit them.]\nStark's punch dissipated into nothing, the energy dispersing harmlessly.\n-73,941!\nWhich meant that physically touching Follower wasn't an option either.\n[Stark HP: 136,059/210,000]\n\"Pathetic,\" Follower sneered, slamming his clawed hand into Stark's chest and sending him hurtling through a row of buildings.\n-58,059!\nStark coughed, blood staining his lips as he staggered to his feet.\n\"...\" Yet he didn't feel like talking.\n\"Give up!\" Follower, the more he saw that Stark was ignoring him, became angrier.\nUntil now, he had been given all the attention, and he enjoyed seeing Stark so mad, so why was he so neutral now?!\nStark drew a circle in his palm, then pointing at the sky above Follower to summon [Heaven's Wrath].\n[Heaven's Wrath: Summons a giant beam from the sky capable of obliterating everything in its path.]\nA blinding beam descended, its power enough to shake the earth.\nBut Follower merely laughed, his wings carrying him out of the beam's path with ease.\n\"You think I didn't see that coming?\" Follower jeered, his claws transforming into grotesque extensions of darkness.\n[Demon's Grasp] enhanced his perception, allowing him to anticipate Stark's every move.\n\"Let's kick it up a notch!\" Follower laughed, losing more of his sanity every passing second, this was truly getting to him, \"CRIMSON CORRUPTION!\"\n[Crimson Corruption: Corrupts the air around him and enhance his fists with a dark aura.]\n\"Double Assault,\" Stark answered with his own skill.\nHis aura flared, doubling his strength and speed, and he lunged at Follower with everything he had.\nCrimson fists and spears shot out in a frenzy, each one powerful enough to level a skyscraper, though he made sure to stay far from the transformed human to not get hurt.\nBut Follower danced around them, his movements fluid and effortless.\nHe countered with his [Chains of Darkness], which erupted from the ground and wrapped around Stark, holding him in place.\n\"Is this it?\" Follower mocked, tightening the chains. \"This is the Chosen? The one meant to stop the Godless Demon? You're a joke!\"\n\"...\"\nStark's aura exploded outward and shattered the chains.\nThen he activated [Domination Soul], slamming his hands against his chest as his crimson heart emerged, glowing with an intense light.\nIf physical attacks didn't work, then maybe this would be useful.\n\"ANSWER ME YOU LITTLE SHIT-\" Follower shouted.\n[Hey, what are you doing?]\n[Do not engage!]\n[Go back to destroying the city!]\nYet Follower didn't listen.\nStark's soul heart shot forward, slamming into Follower's chest.\nFor a brief moment, Follower staggered, his grin faltering.\n-1!\n\"Ouch...\" it did cause him pain, but no actual physical damage. \"You're resilient, I'll give you that,\" Follower said, his grin returning. \"But you can't stop me. None of you can.\"\nHe raised his blade once more, the kilometer-long weapon glowing with malevolent energy.\nWith a single swing, he obliterated another section of the city, leveling hundreds of buildings and killing thousands in an instant.\nClassifiers rushed in, desperate to stop him, but it was futile.\nFollower's [Demon Devouring] activated, his claws piercing through a high-level 800 warrior's chest after taking him by surprise.\nHe held the warrior in place for five seconds, the man's screams echoing before he fell lifeless.\n\"Another sacrifice for the Godless Demon,\" Follower said, tossing the body aside.\nEven level 800 classifiers couldn't lay a finger on him.\nTheir attacks bounced off his dark aura, and their lives were snuffed out in an instant.\nThose that got close and actually hit him didn't cause any damage either, whether it was physical or magical.\n\"...\"\nStark stood tall, his breath shallow, his body battered. His crimson aura flickered weakly, barely clinging to life. Yet his expression remained calm, unwavering.\nNone of the deaths were getting to him.\n'Yes... get angrier...' but on the inside, he was smirking, 'Come on...'\nFollower's grin twisted further into madness. \"Why won't you break?!\" he roared, slamming his claws together.\nThe air around them darkened, suffocating and cold.\n\"...\" Stark didn't answer.\n\"You're nothing but a toy! A useless puppet pretending to stand tall!\" Follower screamed. His body pulsed with power as he activated his ultimate ability.\nHEART OF DARKNESS!\n\"This world will be plunged in darkness and chaos.\"\n[Heart of Darkness: The ultimate skill of destruction. Unleash a concentrated burst of pure hatred to obliterate everything in its path.]\nDark energy gathered at Follower's chest, forming a swirling mass of chaos.\nThe very ground beneath them cracked, unable to bear the weight of his power.\nStark's knees wobbled, but he remained standing, meeting Follower's gaze one last time.\n\"You're not even trying to run!\" Follower spat. \"Fine. Die in silence.\"\nThe energy erupted from Follower's body, a massive surge of pure destruction aimed directly at Stark. There was no time to dodge, no space to counter.\n\"See you in 30 seconds,\" Stark spoke for the first time since the start of the real battle, repeating the exact words he told Aphex, the moon apostle.\nThe beam struck Stark head-on, engulfing him completely. His body disintegrated under the pressure, leaving nothing behind.\nDing!\n[You have died.]\nA panel appeared in front of him as the world turned dark, finding himself in that \"space\" again.\nIn the real world, though, Follower hovered in the air, breathing heavily, his rage still boiling.\nHe wiped the blood from his lips, his grin returning as he muttered through gritted teeth:\n\"Game over, Chosen,\" Follower smirked, his voice dripping with venom. \"No distraction, no nothing. The moment you come back from death, you're dead, I'll destroy your heart with my claws.\"\nHe would wait for Stark from behind, then pierce him using [Demon Devouring], causing a very painful death to the Chosen One.\n\"IT'S OUR VICTORY!\"",

      "content": "[You have died.]\nStark woke up inside the dark space that represented his mind after death.\n\"Hm.\"\nIn front of him appeared a screen displaying the outside world, it was a way for him to not be spawn-killed and be ready.\nThough, he was sure that it wouldn't really matter with someone like Follower as his opponent: there is little chance he's going to survive after reviving.\nIn fact, there is almost none.\nThe destruction around the two of them was terrifying, and Follower must be happy to have been doing his job well until now.\n[60 seconds left to revive.]\nHe had 60 seconds to think.\nHis initial plan of angering Follower worked, as now, instead of actually continuing to destroy and kill, he would rather just stay by Stark's side until he came back.\n\"Kill him then,\" Soul Wielder appeared, grinning.\n\"Don't really have a way, I can't hurt him.\"\n\"How about using my potions for once, then?\" Alchemist continued.\n\"If he wasn't stunned by the crimson fists, the crystal potions won't work either.\"\n\"If he's a demon, then a good cross smack should work!\" Exorcist laughed.\n\"Can he truly be compared to a demon? Looks more like a human in demon form, otherwise he wouldn't get so angry.\"\n\"I won't even bother giving a solution in my case,\" Incubus shrugged.\n\"It's fine, not like you have any use even outside battles either.\"\nAnd finally...\n\"I think you forgot about something,\" Domination appeared too, smiling more than all the others.\n\"...\" Stark already knew what it was.\n\"The ApostleDex's second line should be completed now that you killed the moon apostle, meaning that you can get a [Godly] reward from it.\"\nThis was true.\n\"Can I use it here?\"\n\"Why not try and find out :).\"\n\"Alright.\"\nStark snapped his fingers, summoning the [ApostleDex] before his eyes.\nAnd it indeed worked.\nSeems like he could actually summon his panels inside his mind.\n[30 seconds left.]\nHis time was limited, but he needed to do what he could.\nOtherwise, he would just die, leaving the world to rot.\nHe wasn't the type of person to act like a hero and say that he was the savior of everything, but in that case, wasn't he the only one fighting Follower on equal grounds?\nAnd wasn't he the one that, since the beginning, kept killing those apostles over and over?\n[25 seconds left.]\nStark shook his head to focus on what was before.\nThe first line of the [ApostleDex], which still contained 15 squares, was completed:\nMalakar -> Judicator -> Sierra -> Lother -> Reaper.\nAnd now that he had defeated the [Crimson Moons Trio], which's real name was Aphex and only one entity, the second line was also completed.\nCerberus -> Valgorth -> Malthus -> Olikar -> Aphex.\nHe had gone a long way, but now that the second line was completed, it could only mean one thing: reward.\nDing!\n[You have completed the second ApostleDex line, granting you a \"Godly\" level skill.]\nThere was a flash of light around Stark, but less than 5 seconds later it disappeared, leaving him with a new panel in front of him.\nDing!\n[To aid you in this situation, your talent \"Chosen One\" has granted you some of its holy luck.]\n[You have gained the skill \"Counter\".]\n\"Perfect,\" Domination was the one to speak, \"That's quite literally the best skill you could get at that moment.\"\n\"...?\" Stark was confused, and so he decided to check out the description.\n...\n[Skill: Counter]\n[Rank: Godly]\n[Description: Upon activation, Stark gains a fraction of a second where any attack that connects with him is reflected back to the attacker, dealing identical damage regardless of the source. However, this skill requires precise timing. If the timing is off, Stark will take the full brunt of the attack.]\n[Note: one hour cooldown.]\n...\nStark read the description carefully.\nThe implications of the skill made his heart race. This was perfection.\n\"Not bad,\" Domination smirked. \"Now you've got a fighting chance. Barely.\"\n\"...If I mess up, I'll just die again, and for real this time,\" Stark said flatly.\n\"Then don't mess up.\"\n[10 seconds left.]\nStark closed his eyes. He had no room for error. Follower's attacks were relentless and lethal, and a single mistake would mean the end.\n\"Revive,\" Stark said calmly.\n\"Good luck :),\" all the classes said before disappearing.\n[Revenant's Fury: 3/3]\n[Conditions for activation have been met, but it's not the right time.]\n\"Fair enough, wasn't planning to use it anyway.\"\nThe dark space shattered around him as his body reformed in the ruined city.\nThe smell of ash and death hit him immediately, but he focused on the figure standing a few meters away.\nFollower grinned, his twisted claws already outstretched. \"Welcome back,\" he sneered. \"I didn't think you'd come back so soon. I thought you'd wait longer to gather your courage.\"\n\"...\" Stark said nothing, his gaze locked on Follower.\nFollower's grin turned savage as he moved in a blur, appearing behind Stark almost instantly.\nHis claws plunged forward, piercing through Stark's back and gripping his heart.\n\"Now you can't escape anymore,\" Follower laughed, \"It's the end of the line for you!\"\n\"Demon Devouring!\"\nFollower had activated his skill, which he had used against all these monsters and people before, able to instantly kill them in a gruesome way by destroying their hearts.\nAnd he was about to do the same to Stark.\n\"Once I hold your heart, there is little to no chances of escape!\"\nThat was true, even though Stark tried to get out of his grip, he truly couldn't move: he was stuck.\nYet, Stark still stood there, unfazed by Follower's attack.\nAfter all... a panel appeared in front of him.\n[You already know what to do, don't you?]\n'Yes.'\n\"COME ON, BEG FOR YOUR LIFE!\" Follower continued, \"SHOW GODLESS AND THE WORLD YOUR WEAKNESSES!\"\n\"...\"\nStark looked at the time, dozens of helicopters with cameras were pointing at the city, and specifically at him and Follower.\nYet again, most of the world was watching.\nThe destruction of the capital of Fellarburg, as well as the deaths of hundreds of classifiers, as well as tens of thousands of civilians, would obviously attract the attention of many.\nNow nobody, even classifiers at level 900, wanted to approach Follower and Stark, fearing for their lives.\nVideos of Follower cutting through everyone and everything spread like wildfire, and so they left it to the \"powerhouses\" to deal with the issue.\n\"The world is going to watch you die, Chosen!\" Follower didn't stop, his madness growing more as Stark didn't answer, \"How does it feel?!\"\n\"...\"\nThe cameras up granted full visibility of the battlefield and the two figures.\n\"Follower's using that trick of his?!\"\n\"He got Chosen's heart!!\"\n\"And Chosen already revived, it's so over...\"\nChosen had proven to be incredible, but even then, at this point he couldn't do anything, everyone had seen what Follower could do when he pierced an enemy: instant death.\nFollower could also kill level 800-900 classifiers, there was just no chance someone like Chosen could defeat him now that he couldn't escape.\nIt was over.\nThe Godless Demon won.\n\"Why won't you say or do anything?!\" Yet even though victory was obvious, Follower couldn't help but be nervous, \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\"\n\"...\"\nStark kept looking at the cameras with a neutral expression, sending shivers down the spine of many.\nWhy was he so calm? Even though he was about to die?\nDid he have more revives? Probably not, that was unlikely, so why?\n\"STARK!\" Lana shouted, this time actually scared.\n\"...\" Sora was still running toward their apartment complex, looking at the many different giant screens around her to see what was happening.\nAnd Lilith was following Sora closely behind, also nervous.\n\"Alright, you don't want to speak,\" Follower gritted his teeth, \"Then die, Chosen.\"\n[Initiating 'Demon Devouring'!]",

Any last words before I tear your heart out?\"\n\"You really shouldn't do that,\" Stark replied with his usual smirk, the confidence in his voice unshaken.\nFollower's laughter boomed through the battlefield. \"Haha!

They had been reluctant to interfere, watching helplessly as Stark faced off against the monstrosity alone.\nNow, dread settled over them as the countdown began.\n\"He's actually going to kill him...\" one of the observers murmured.\n[3...]\nSora and Lilith, who had been running for safety, stopped in their tracks, their instincts screaming at them to turn back.\n\"No… Stark!\" Sora gasped.\nLilith clutched her chest, her crimson aura flickering in distress.\n[2...]\nAcross the world, countless screens broadcast the battle.\nPowerhouses from the Domination Association, guilds, and even ordinary civilians sat glued to their screens.\nThe sight of Follower crushing Stark's heart sent shockwaves across the globe.\n[1...]\nAt that moment, Stark opened one eye, his smile growing wider. His crimson aura rippled faintly, and his breathing steadied, as though he were completely at ease.\n\"Time to play,\" he muttered.\nActivating [Time Flow], Stark slowed the world to a crawl. The final second stretched out, giving him an eternity to act.\nWithin this bubble of slowed time, his mind raced. His new skill was about to be tested, and he couldn't afford for it to fail.\nThe aura around his heart surged, creating a faint, shimmering barrier of crimson energy.\nAnd then…\n[0...]\nCOUNTER!\nA deafening silence fell over the battlefield. The world seemed to hold its breath.\n[Death.]\n[Chosen's heart has been destroyed.]\n-99,999,999!\nThe notification flashed above their heads, stark and undeniable.\nFollower cackled maniacally, pulling his claws free from Stark's chest.\n\"HAHAHA, I WIN!\" He spread his arms wide, basking in his supposed triumph. \"DID YOU SEE THIS, GODLESS? APOSTLES? THE WORLD? I WIN!\"\nStark staggered, falling to his knees.\nBlood dripped from the gaping wound in his chest, staining the ground beneath him.\nAnd yet, his smirk never disappeared. His aura crackled faintly, like embers refusing to die.\nFollower turned, addressing the classifiers huddled nearby, their weapons trembling in their hands.\n\"And now,\" he declared, \"enjoy the show.\" He gestured to the live cameras.\nHe raised his [Darkness Blade], its edge pulsating with malicious energy.\n\"Your execution, Chosen, broadcast live for all to see. A fitting end for a pathetic hero.\"\nThe classifiers recoiled, their fear palpable. None dared to move closer.\nAs Follower approached Stark from behind, his steps deliberate and heavy, he paused.\n\"But before I finish you off, I have a question.\"\n\"What is it?\" Stark replied, his voice weak but still carrying a hint of amusement, almost as if he was faking it.\n\"Why are you still smiling?\" Follower's grin faltered slightly. \"You know your heart was destroyed, right? You've got maybe thirty seconds left to live. The only thing keeping you upright is that pitiful domination aura of yours.\"\n\"...\"\nFollower raised his blade, \"I'll decapitate you the moment you feel the immense pain of [Demon Devouring], as killing you right now would make it too easy and merciful for your kind.\"\nEveryone in the outside world was at the edge of their seats: what Follower was saying was true, Stark's heart was supposed to be destroyed, and the -99,999,999 damage text even appeared above them to prove it.\nSo why was the boy so confident?\n\"Thirty seconds? I'll give you ten before you realize your mistake.\" Stark coughed, a thin line of blood dribbling from his lips.\n\"It's already starting,\" Follower's confidence returned as he saw the blood, \"How foolish, now let's begin... Chosen's execution.\"\n\"Five seconds,\" Stark continued, the vortex of aura in his eyes growing more and more.\n\"Huh.\"\n\"4.\"\n\"I'm going to murder your two girlfriends after having them watch me decapitate you,\" Follower's confidence wavered a little.\n\"3.\"\n\"I'm going to make sure they suffer as much as possible, more than you could ever imagine.\"\n\"2.\"\n\"You have no future. Forget having a house, a wife or even children, none of that will happen to you.\"\n\"1...\"\nStark turned his gaze toward Follower's, and when he saw it, the fanatic's entire confidence wavered, sweat dripping from his brow and his pupils shaking.\n\"Why aren't you afraid?!\" Follower roared, his composure crumbling.\nStark leaned forward, his voice a low whisper. \"One. Enjoy your death, dumbass.\"\nChosen was supposed to die, so why is he smiling? Why is his smile this wide? Why am I not the one that's smiling?\n'What's happening?!'\nFollower's hands trembled on the hilt of his blade, sweat trickling down his temple. Stark's smirk had grown into a full-blown grin, his eyes burning with crimson energy.\nIn the end, Follower felt like causing suffering to that boy was not necessary if it meant continuing his chaos, and so he raised his [Darkness Blade] more.\n\"THIRD AND FINAL TOTAL ANNIHILATION,\" he shouted, ready to destroy everything around him.\nDarkness engulfed him, his corrupted aura swelling to catastrophic levels. The classifiers scattered, screaming in terror as the ground split and the air twisted unnaturally.\nHe truly wanted to end Chosen, no matter what.\nAnd then... he swung.\n\"HOLY SHIT!\"\n\"Watch out!!!\"\n\"RUN!\"\nBoth the classifiers around Stark and the people outside, all across the globe, were in shock, terrified at the sight.\nStark on the other hand didn't even bother moving, he didn't have any tricks this time: he simply waited.\nPeople thought he was insane.\nBut suddenly... before the [Darkness Blade] reached him... Follower's body suddenly froze mid-swing.\n\"Goodbye, Follower,\" Stark said softly.\n\"Huh?\" Follower was still conscious, able to move his face, but his other limbs weren't responding, and his hands, which were holding the darkness blade only a few centimeters away from Stark's face, wouldn't budge at all, \"WHAT IS HAPPENING.\"\nStark stepped forward, brushing dust off his shoulder. \"You're dead, that's all.\"\n\"That's nonsense!\" Follower roared, but a violent cough interrupted him. Blood splattered the ground as he glanced down.\nAt that moment, Follower finally understood what happened.\n\"There's no way...\" the priest was too scared to look down, as it would mean accepting the reality of the situation.\n\"Look down,\" Stark spoke, \"You already know there's nothing anyway, you can't move.\"\n\"Shut... up...\" he tried as hard as he could to move, but with no results whatsoever, he was truly stuck, his body not responding to his commands.\nThat new form, granted to him by Lord Godless himself, wasn't responding.\nAnd the only way such a form, which was invincible normally, wouldn't work anymore... was that it's heart was destroyed.\n\"...\" and so, Follower looked down.\nTo his horror, a gaping hole now marred his chest where his heart should have been.\nAs expected, it wasn't there.\n\"No... way...\"\nIn Stark's vision, a panel had appeared.\n[Counter successful, dealt 99,999,999 damage as counter to opponent.]\n\"No… no way...\" Follower gasped, collapsing to his knees.\nFollower's aura was dying, and so that meant Stark could easily overpower it.\nAnd so Stark didn't stop there. His grin turned almost cruel as he raised his hand, \"Banish Game.\"\n\"NO!\" Follower tried to reach for Stark, but all he did was lay himself flat on the ground, \"DON'T!\"\n\"Sorry, can't hear you from down below.\"\n[Banish Game initiated.]\n[Loser gets sent to the void.]\n[You already know the rules, good luck.]\nThe match ended almost immediately: Follower tried to control his aura, but the little from it that was left was NOT enough to even make Stark's budge, meaning that Stark's crimson aura easily overwhelmed him, surrounding the godless fanatic.\n[Winner: Chosen.]\nBut that wasn't enough for Stark, not even close.\nAnd so he continued the torture.\nChains of crimson light erupted from Stark's aura, binding Follower's limbs and dragging him into the air. Then with a flick of his wrist, Stark created a massive crimson cross.\n\"You...\" Follower cough more blood, sensing that his end was near after his heart got destroyed, even in his new transformation, \"...\"\nHe nailed Follower's arms to the cross with sharp spikes of crimson energy.\n\"My masterpiece,\" Stark smiled, looking at the crucified Follower, \"And now you go!\"\nUnder the corrupted priest appeared a dark portal: the void was calling for him now that he lost.\n\"NO! NO! NOOOO!\" Follower screamed as the void began to consume him, dragging both him and the cross downward, just slow enough for him to see Stark's grin on full view.\n\"Bye bye,\" Stark said with a mock wave.\n\"YOU WON'T WIN, CHOSEN, GODLESS WILL PREVAIL!\"\n\"Sure thing.\"\nHe didn't even have the time to reply that the portal closed with a deafening crack, silencing Follower's cries forever.\nAnd so with that, all of Stark's worries were over.\nDing!\n[You have slain \"Follower, Godless Fanatic\", gaining 500,000,000 experience points!]\n\"Wow, that's a lot.\"",

It was incredible, actually.\nBy basing his assumptions on the level of the opponents he could now fight, Stark guessed the maximum for his class was between 200 and 250, though there was no guarantee there even was a limit.\nBasically, Stark was getting close to becoming one of the strongest.\nStill, when he thought back to the sheer power of Follower, Stark was sure that thing could be described as at least a level 750 threat.\nAfter checking out his panels and realizing he wouldn't get a new class and skill until he leveled up three times more, Stark took a deep breath and looked around.\nAll of it was destroyed.\nAlmost no buildings remained intact, and the classifiers who had been watching from afar had fled the moment they saw the [Darkness Blade] glowing.\nStark stood amidst the ruins, the desolation surrounding him a stark contrast to the storm of power that coursed through his veins.\nThe air was heavy with ash, debris scattered as far as the eye could see, and the remnants of Follower's rampage echoed in the distance.\nHe had truly caused utter chaos in the capital.\nAnd he said it himself: \"It's only the beginning.\"\nIf no classifier, even those at level 900 and above, couldn't do anything, then who was the one that needed to act?\nWould it be Stark again?\nThe boy looked up at the sky. It was dark. The [Angel of the Spear] hovered above him, its colossal form still holding its weapon, ready to strike at any moment.\nStark had wanted to recall the spear after defeating Follower, but seeing the sheer number of people still around him, he decided to keep it ready. Who knew what might happen next?\nAnd then came the classifiers.\nThey revealed themselves, emerging from behind shattered buildings, from the shadows of the streets, and even from the wreckage itself.\nDespite their numbers, none of them had dared to act during the chaos.\nWhat would have happened if Stark died? Would they have fought, or run away to another country to save their own skin?\nThey were cowards, but in the end, were those that died from Follower's attacks any better?\nIn the end, the true winners were those survived, weren't they?\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nAll those classifiers approached Stark, looking at him with fearful looks, yet the boy was unfazed.\nHe just wanted to go home and check if the girls were alright.\n[Kill them to go home quicker :)]\nA panel appeared in front of Stark at that moment, one that was... weird.\n\"Huh?\"\nBefore he could process the strange notification, it vanished.\n\"Am I going crazy?\" he tilted his head, \"Well, I guess it doesn't matter...\"\n\"Stark Heartsouls!\" someone called his name, and once he turned around he saw... Arthur Moonless, the archer.\n[He's annoying, get rid of him :)]\nAnother panel appeared, covering Arthur's face, but Stark shook his head.\n\"Arthur...\" Stark mumbled, looking at the man directly, \"Why are you here?\"\n\"Are you serious? Do you not see the chaos around us?\" Arthur exclaimed. \"Everyone was watching, ready to intervene if anything went wrong.\"\n[Then why didn't they intervene when you were about to be killed by Follower? :)]\n[They're liars... :)]\nAnd at that moment, Stark understood: these panels weren't some strange entity that appeared before him and took control of his body.\nThey were his true other classes' thoughts, materialized in the form of panels.\nAt this point in time, Stark had no idea that the whole world had been watching the trial.\n\"Well, that crazy guy came out of nowhere and I had to intervene, I was just walking around here,\" he smiled, and at those words, everyone looked at one another, confused what the hell was he talking about.\n\"Stark, so that's his name,\" another classifier advanced, it was Mike Gardenis.\n[Annoying bastards, I could trash you all whenever I want.]\n\"...\"\n\"Drop the gig, Stark, everyone knows.\"\n\"[Everyone knows of what? :)]\"\n\"Of the Domination Trial.\"\n\"Oh?\"\n[We better kill anyone who knows, then, can't let all those people who could become Godless Followers like that fanatic know of our secrets.]\n\"It was broadcasted to the whole world, there's no need to deny it,\" Mike Gardenis smiled.\n[Forget it then, just kill the whole world :)]\nWas it because Stark was exhausted that these thoughts were appearing in front of him? Or was it a new passive perk gained from leveling up or defeating Follower?\nAt that moment, though, the real Stark understood the implication of what the trial wanted to tell them.\nSince the moment they reached the square and those panels appeared before them, everything had already been set in stone.\n\"Now the whole world will know\" was literal, it meant that everyone outside would be watching the trial and know of what's happening there.\nIt was bad, probably, but at this point there was nothing he could do except but get stronger.\n\"Very good to know all of this,\" Stark smiled warmly, \"But I have better things to do than to [sit around and talk to a bunch of cowards].\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"The fuck is he saying?!\"\n\"[I said what I needed to say, problem?]\"\nStark was actively letting some of his classes' thoughts take over: he could control them, that was easy, but the fact he was saying them himself was from his own doing.\nHe truly despised all of these people.\n\"Calm down, Stark,\" Arthur, who previously acted all high and mighty because of his overwhelming strength, was now cautious after realizing that Stark was stronger than he was, \"We can talk about this, you like my daughter don't you?\"\n[...Is he seriously trying to do that :)?]\n\"I'm calm, don't worry, I want to go home to...\"\n[...Fuck your daughter :)]\n\"...See if the girls are alright,\" he finished, though he really was about to let it slip.\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\n\"...\"\nAll the classifiers looked at one another, sweating from their brow.\n\"I'm sorry, Stark, but you can't leave, not now, especially when you're one of the three survivors of this hell we witnessed.\"\n\"Hahaha!\" Stark laughed, not able to keep it in, and at that sight, many classifiers backed away, \"Do you... truly think you can stop me, Arthur?\"\nThe man had no answer to that question.\nBefore Stark could push further, someone appeared behind him, moving faster than even his heightened senses could detect.\nA sharp tap hit the back of his neck.\n[Stark has been knocked out.]\nEverything went black.\nThe last thing Stark heard before succumbing to unconsciousness was Arthur's voice, fading into the distance:\n\"What are you doing?!\"\nJust like that, Stark was sent out cold, too exhausted to realize it, as otherwise he would have surely noticed and countered.\n\"We'll be taking him with us,\" the man that knocked out Stark bowed, and while holding the boy, vanished out of everyone's vision.\n\"WHAT?!\"\n\"SOMEONE FIND HIM!\"\n\"HE TOOK CHOSEN! GET HIM!\"\nThe classifiers scrambled, but it was too late. Stark was gone.",

      "content": "As Stark's unconscious body vanished with the mysterious figure, chaos erupted among the remaining classifiers.\nThe collective panic was palpable, the air thick with unease and tension.\n\"What just happened?\" Arthur Moonless exclaimed, his voice cutting through the commotion. He clenched his fists, glaring at the spot where Stark had disappeared. \"Who was that?!\"\n\"We didn't even sense them coming,\" Mike Gardenis muttered, his face pale. \"That... wasn't someone ordinary.\"\nThe classifiers exchanged uncertain glances, their earlier bravado crumbling.\nDespite their overwhelming numbers and strength, none had dared to take action when it truly mattered.\nStark's words, veiled in sarcasm but sharp as a blade, still lingered in their minds.\n\"Mike,\" Arthur barked, pointing at the man, \"Spread the word. We need to know who that was and why they took Stark.\"\nMike hesitated. \"And if they're connected to the Godless Demon?\"\n\"Then we've got bigger problems,\" Arthur replied grimly. \"Stark might be the only one capable of handling this madness. If we lose him, we're all as good as dead.\"\n...\nMeanwhile, Stark's consciousness drifted in a void-like state. His body felt weightless, his mind trapped in a swirl of fragmented thoughts.\n\"That's so lame, you got captured,\" Domination sighed.\n\"You're not a princess. Wake up and kick their asses!\" Alchemist laughed.\n\"I say we try to find out what they want first...\" Exorcist mumbled.\nStark was stuck in that space, unable to wake himself up for some reason.\nNormally, he would come here whenever he was knocked out or asleep.\nBut this time was different: he hadn't entered on his own accord, nor had his body simply given out. He had been forcefully put down.\n\"Hm, maybe I'm finally going to die,\" he grinned, looking at the dark void.\n\"Would be surprising if you did,\" Domination replied. \"That guy's aura was familiar. He was definitely from our class.\"\nBy that, the crimson figure meant that it sensed the same aura any other [Domination] user let out.\nAnd so with that information given, the answer was now clear: Domination Association.\nIf what Arthur and the others said was true, the entire trial, or a huge chunk of it, had been broadcasted. That meant the gig was up.\nThe Domination Association, whose sole purpose was to prevent issues involving classifiers of their type from becoming public, must be in shambles.\nStark recalled how they had once tried to recruit him into their ranks, only for him to refuse.\nIf the person who captured him was from their ranks, then they were likely stronger than him, at least in some capacity.\nYet, Stark knew one thing: [Angel of the Spear] was still watching, ready to strike.\n\"Sorry to disappoint you,\" Domination interrupted Stark's thoughts, \"but the guy that knocked you out used a skill that cancels [Heaven's Spear].\"\n\"Damn.\"\nWith his defenses neutralized, Stark could only wait.\nTime in the void felt endless, each moment stretching into eternity.\nEventually, though, the space began to shift.\n\"Oh?\"\nThe manifestations of classes that often bickered or joked within his mind, suddenly froze mid-action, staring at him.\n\"Looks like it's time,\" Stark mumbled.\nIn an instant, Stark's perception fractured, and his consciousness was pulled back into his body.\nWhen Stark woke, the world around him was dark.\nA blindfold covered his eyes, and his wrists were restrained by something cold and heavy.\n\"What the hell are you doing, Alexis?!\"\n\"Shut the fuck up, it's difficult to do this effectively,\" a woman snapped.\nStark could feel the sensation of handcuffs tightening around his wrists, draining his aura.\n[You have been put in Domination Handcuffs.]\n[It is impossible to break free, and all your skills are canceled.]\nEven through the blindfold, Stark could see the panel appear, likely generated by the restraints themselves.\nThese were no ordinary bindings; they had been specifically designed to neutralize classifiers like him.\n\"He's awake,\" a man's voice said.\n\"You just realized?\" a woman replied.\n\"Then I guess there's no need to keep waiting any longer. All of you, take your seats,\" another voice commanded, this one more authoritative.\nA snap echoed through the air, and the blindfold over Stark's eyes vanished.\nAs his vision adjusted, Stark found himself in a massive chamber.\nThe room was cold and metallic, illuminated by rows of screens and holograms that displayed information about monsters, classifiers, and global events.\nDirectly in front of him was a circular table where five individuals sat.\nTheir expressions ranged from calm to indifferent, their presence radiating immense power.\nOn one of the largest screens, bold text appeared:\n[Domination Association Commanders]\n\"Like my animations?\" one of the commanders quipped, adjusting his glasses with a grin. \"I made them specifically for this.\"\n\"...\"\n[What a bunch of losers :)]\nThe panel appeared before Stark, his classes' unfiltered thoughts as blunt as ever.\nOne of the commanders leaned forward, his sharp eyes locked onto Stark.\n\"Stark Heartsouls,\" he began. \"Do you know why you're here?\"\n[Because you're all terrified of me? :)]\n\"I can guess,\" Stark replied dryly.\n\"Good. That saves us some time.\"\nThe commander gestured to one of the screens, which began displaying footage of Stark's battle with Follower.\nThe chaos, the destruction, and the overwhelming display of power played out before them in vivid detail.\n\"This trial,\" the commander continued, \"was broadcasted to every corner of the world. Do you realize what that means?\"\n\"It means the existence of the Domination Class is no longer hidden,\" another commander interjected, his tone sharp. \"And you, Stark, have become the face of it.\"\n\"Congratulations,\" a woman added sarcastically, leaning back in her chair.\nStark smirked. \"Well, glad I could help. Can I leave now?\"\nThe room fell silent, the commanders exchanging glances.\n\"No,\" the first commander said firmly. \"You're too valuable. And too dangerous.\"\n\"...\"\nBefore Stark could respond, the restraints on his wrists pulsed, sending a jolt of energy through his body.\nHis aura, which had been simmering beneath the surface, was completely suppressed.\n\"We didn't bring you here for a conversation,\" the glasses-wearing commander said, adjusting his frames again. \"We brought you here to ensure that what happened today doesn't spiral out of control.\"\n\"And what does that mean for me?\" Stark asked, his voice calm despite the situation.\n\"It means,\" another commander said, rising from his seat, \"you're under our custody until further notice. Your power, your class, they're a threat to the balance we've worked so hard to maintain.\"\nStark's smirk widened. \"Balance? You mean the cowardice of classifiers, too scared to step up when it mattered?\"\nThe commander's expression darkened, but before he could respond, Stark leaned forward as much as the restraints allowed, his eyes blazing.\n\"If you think these little cuffs and fancy chairs make you my captors, you're mistaken,\" Stark said, his voice low and dangerous. \"I'll fucking get out of here, and you know it.\"\nThe room fell into tense silence, the commanders visibly unfazed.\n\"No you won't,\" the leader of the association, a dark-skinned burly man with sharp teeth responded, \"No one can escape these cuffs.\"\n[They should be afraid. Because once I'm free, they'll regret this :)]\nThe thought flickered in front of Stark, and for the first time, he found himself agreeing with it wholeheartedly.\nFor now, he was stuck in this place, but he was sure they wouldn't kill him.",

      "content": "Stark leaned back in the chair they had forced him into, his wrists bound tightly in the Domination Handcuffs.\nThe cold metallic restraints drained his aura, suppressing every ounce of his power.\nYet, even in this vulnerable state, Stark's smirk lingered, a deliberate thorn in the sides of the commanders seated before him.\n\"You seem awfully confident for someone who's powerless,\" the glasses-wearing commander said, his voice calm but laced with irritation.\nStark tilted his head. \"Powerless? You mean restrained. There's a difference.\"\nThe atmosphere in the room was tense.\nThe five commanders of the Domination Association, seated at their circular table, exchanged glances.\nEach of them exuded authority and overwhelming presence, but none had yet dared to approach Stark directly.\n\"Let's not waste time,\" said the leader who had first spoken, his deep voice cutting through the room.\nHe gestured to the holographic screen behind him, where footage of the Immortal Trial replayed on loop.\n\"You understand the situation, don't you, Stark? The trial was broadcast to the entire world. That wasn't supposed to happen.\"\nStark raised an eyebrow. \"Not my problem.\"\n\"Not yet,\" the woman among them said sharply. \"But it will be.\"\n[So your big secret's out. Boo-hoo.]\nThe sarcastic thought flickered in Stark's mind, and although the commanders couldn't hear it, his expression conveyed the sentiment perfectly.\n\"And now, there's more,\" the glasses-wearing commander continued.\nHe tapped a button on the console in front of him, and the screen behind him shifted.\nThe room fell silent as the image of a massive, grotesque creature appeared.\nIts body was twisted, an amalgamation of flesh and shadow.\nIts eyes burned with an unnatural light, and its aura was so dense that even through the screen, it seemed to suffocate the air.\n\"This is what's left of the participants who died in the trial,\" the glasses-wearing commander said grimly.\nStark's smirk faltered slightly.\nOf course, he already knew about this because it had made the news during his first trial: all the participants that died transformed into Calamity-Level monsters.\nThe second trial didn't make the news though, maybe the [Domination Association] were able to kill them all before they reached the cities.\nAnd for the third...\n\"Every single one of them,\" the commander continued, \"has transformed into one of these... abominations. Our radar detected them to be Immortal-Level monsters at least.\"\nThe screen shifted again, showing one of the creatures tearing through a group of classifiers.\nDespite their best efforts, the classifiers' attacks were useless.\nThe creature absorbed their blows and retaliated with devastating force, leaving nothing but destruction in its wake.\nStark's gaze sharpened. \"How strong are they?\"\nEvery one of these monsters was one of the participant that died during the trial.\nAnd Stark perfectly remembered that when Orasio, the shield domination user, transformed, his transformation kept the same powers as his class, meaning a shield.\n\"Each one of these monsters has the aura equivalent to a level 150 Domination user or a level 800 monster,\" another commander said, his tone grave. \"We've already lost multiple Domination users trying to contain them. They're unlike anything we've faced before.\"\n[Level 150? That's insane.]\nStark's mind raced, calculating the implications.\nLevel 150 Domination users were incredibly powerful, above Stark himself in terms of strength.\nRemember Clever, the old man with his [100-Golden Arms Statue]? Well, he had only died because of the sheer power of [Heaven's Spear].\nOtherwise, he would have destroyed Stark, and dominated the entire trial actually if it wasn't for the Tormented One.\nAnd now you're saying that he was transformed into a monster that had the same powers as he did?\nPlus, don't forget the 10 others that were also there, their powers also enhanced by their transformations.\nTo have an army of monsters at that level was a nightmare scenario\n\"And let me guess,\" Stark said, his smirk returning. \"You brought me here because you think I can clean up your mess.\"\nThe commanders exchanged glances again, their silence confirming Stark's suspicion.\n\"We didn't bring you here for that, we're strong enough to handle it,\" the woman said coldly. \"We brought you here because we needed to control you. But now, it seems we'll all have to fight.\"\nA loud chime interrupted their conversation.\nThe holographic screen flickered, and a new message appeared.\n[Alert: Immortal-Level Monsters detected across several countries!]\n[Number of threats: 11]\n[Source: Death-Level Domination's Trial Participants]\n[Presence of all commanders required immediately!]\nThe room was plunged into silence as the weight of the message settled over them.\nThe woman stood abruptly. \"We need to get this done quickly.\"\n\"And more of our people are dying,\" another commander, one that never spoke until now, added. His calm demeanor cracked slightly, a flicker of urgency in his voice.\nThe only people who could handle them were the commanders, as they were the strongest, each above level 150 and having completed their third trial.\n\"Looks like you're in trouble,\" Stark said, feigning indifference. \"Better get out there before your precious organization collapses.\"\n\"You're coming with us,\" the lead commander said, getting up from his chair.\n\"Wait!\" the man wearing glasses stopped them, \"I got something perfect for this occasion, sit back on your seats please!\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Introductions!\"\n\"Introductions at a time like this?\" one of the two girl commanders sighed.\n\"He needs to know who we are, after all,\" he grinned.\nThe other girl groaned loudly. \"Three minutes. That's all you get, Ed.\" She dropped back into her chair with an audible thump.\n\"Three minutes? I only need two!\" Ed grinned, tapping at the console in front of him.\nScreens descended from the ceiling, lining up behind each of the seated commanders. As they clicked into place, the circular table began to rotate.\nStark, who was bound to a chair that was a bit far from the circular table in the center, could only watch.\n[This is stupid.]\n\"Yes.\"\nHe was answering his own classes' thoughts, was he going crazy?\n\"Let's get started!\" the man announced, tapping another button and setting the table spinning to its next stop.\n[Domination Association Introductions!]\nThe holographic text projected beside the first commander glimmered faintly, spelling out a name that Stark had already partially guessed as he heard it when blindfolded.\n[Commander #1: Alexis]\nThe table rotated to the tanned blond-haired man.\nTattoos spiraled down his arms, peeking out from beneath his tank top. Despite his casual attire, Alexis exuded a quiet intensity.\n[Domination Power: Bullet Fists]\n\"Pleasure's all mine, champ,\" Alexis said with a lazy smirk.\nHe cracked his knuckles, and faint sparks of aura energy pulsed along his fists. \"If it were up to me, we'd skip the show and go straight to seeing how long you'd last against these.\"\n[This guy's all bark.]\n\"Next!\" the glasses-wearing man chirped, hitting the button again before Stark could respond.\n...\nAfter the table spun for a few seconds, it stopped, revealing a slender, orange-haired woman in a flowing pink dress.\n[Commander #2: Tia]\nBeside her chair rested a massive hammer, nearly as tall as she was.\n[Domination Power: Hammer of Elements]\n\"Do we really have to do this?\" Tia complained, resting her chin on her palm.\nHer sharp, aggressive tone completely clashed with her refined appearance. \"We've got bigger problems than babysitting a kid.\"\n\"Relax, Tia,\" the man chimed in. \"This is important!\"\nStark tilted his head.\n\"[Cute dress. You always bring a hammer to tea parties?]\"\nHer eyes narrowed dangerously. \"Say that again, and I'll show you why this hammer's famous.\"\n[Sheesh, sensitive.]\n...\nThe table rotated once more.\n[Commander #3: Unity]\nStark found himself staring at a white-haired woman with a sleek bob cut.\nHer hazel eyes were sharp, and her futuristic outfit shimmered faintly under the room's lighting.\n[Domination Power: Mega Static]\nFrom her ears protruded two small USB-like ports, faintly glowing.\nStark blinked at the odd detail but chose to keep his thoughts to himself.\n\"Behave yourself,\" Unity said, her tone icy. \"We don't have time for your antics.\"\n\"Antics? I'm literally tied up,\" Stark replied, gesturing with his bound wrists. \"What do you think I'm going to do? Escape mid-introduction?\"\nUnity's gaze didn't waver. \"I'd put money on it.\"\n...\n[Commander #4: Ed]\nFinally, the table stopped in front of Ed himself.\nHe was practically bouncing in his seat, his green shirt and pants giving him a carefree, quirky vibe.\nHis grin widened as the holographic text beside him displayed his information.\n[Domination Power: Domi-Mechanician]\n\"And here I am, the genius who makes it all work!\" Ed announced, spreading his arms theatrically. \"Anything mechanical? I can dominate it. Drones, mechas, weapons, you name it, I build it!\"\n\"Keep going,\" the lead commander said, clearly losing patience.\n...\n[Commander #5: Oliver]\nThe table made one final rotation, stopping before the towering figure of the lead commander.\nOliver stood as the holographic screen displayed his name and power.\nDark-skinned and built like a fortress, Oliver's presence alone seemed to command respect.\nHis muscles rippled beneath his bare chest, and he radiated an aura of raw strength.\n[Domination Power: Universal Strength]\n\"Stark,\" Oliver said, his voice steady. \"I'll keep this simple. You're no ordinary domination user. And whether you like it or not, you'll be fighting alongside us. Understand?\"\nStark didn't respond immediately. His gaze flicked to the hologram, then back to Oliver.\n[This guy's not messing around.]\nAs the table clicked back into place, the holographic screens faded, and Ed clapped his hands together.\n\"See? That wasn't so bad!\"\n\"Can we focus now?\" Unity snapped, her USB-like ports sparking faintly. \"We're wasting time!\"\nThe holographic screen behind them suddenly flickered, drawing everyone's attention.\nIt displayed live footage from another city under siege.\nA massive creature, its body an unholy amalgamation of flesh and shadow was fighting a bunch of classifiers.\n\"That's Claire, Domination Power: Monster,\" Ed informed.\n\"One of the trial participants who didn't survive,\" Oliver said grimly. \"Their transformation's power is tied to their class, amplified to Immortal-Level monsters.\"\n[We already know, dumbass.]\nThe screen shifted to another city, where yet another monstrosity wreaked havoc.\nThen another.\n[Alert: Immortal-Level Monsters converging on cities.]\n\"We're out of time,\" Oliver said, rising to his feet. \"Ed, I'll take Stark, each of you focus on the monsters you want.\"",

      "content": "\"Make sure to follow your [Domination Detection Watches]; there's not a single minute to lose after that shitty introduction,\" Oliver groaned, throwing a pointed look at Ed.\n\"I'll work twice as hard, boss!\" Ed snapped into a mock military pose before activating his boots.\nWith a burst of energy, he sped toward the next room, the door sliding open for him automatically.\n\"See you all in two hours,\" Tia said nonchalantly, grabbing her hammer and heading toward the same door.\n\"Give me thirty minutes, and I'll be done,\" Alexis added, his confidence radiating as he followed suit.\n\"...\" Unity just shook her head, then began flying.\nStark watched them go, his curiosity piqued. They were all heading in the same direction, toward the same place. Why?\n\"That's the [Teleportation Room],\" Oliver informed him as he grabbed Stark by the arm.\n\"...\"\nOliver hoisted Stark effortlessly, as though he weighed nothing.\nStark didn't resist, not because he couldn't but because he wanted to observe what was happening.\n[Yo.]\nThis time, his classes weren't answering one of the others' talk, but were speaking to Stark himself.\nAs he was being transported to the [Teleportation Room], a figure appeared in his vision.\nIt was a familiar one: a mix of every one of his classes, its color a mix of red, golden and blue.\nThat figure was wearing a lab coat, had the [Soul Heart] in front of it, an incubus tail and horns, a golden halo on top of its head and a vortex of color in its eyes, with pupils the shape of a crucifix.\n[These cuffs are capable of restraining a normal Domination user,] the figure said, its voice smooth and confident, [But there are five of us in here. We can break free whenever you want.]\nThe figure's lips curved into a knowing smile.\n'Good to know,' Stark thought, his expression neutral.\nAt least now he understood that he wasn't entirely powerless. Still, Oliver was a level 200 classifier, far above Stark's current level.\nEven if Stark could break free, there was no guarantee he'd survive the fallout. For now, patience was the smarter choice.\nThe commanders were clearly gearing up for something major, and despite his usual snark, he knew this situation was far from ordinary.\nEven the other commanders looked perplexed, as if this didn't happen often.\nAs Oliver carried him toward the [Teleportation Room], Stark raised an eyebrow, \"Do you often have to intervene, doesn't look plausible to me.\"\nOliver ignored the comment, his focus unwavering.\nThe [Teleportation Room] came into view, and Stark's eyes widened.\nThe chamber was enormous, filled with intricate machinery that pulsed with faint, rhythmic energy.\nGlowing runes adorned the floors and walls, humming with a quiet, mystical power.\nAt the center of the room stood ten large circular platforms, each one surrounded by delicate mechanical arms and glowing conduits.\nAbove each platform, a screen displayed a destination:\nFellarburg, Ostount, Lampod, Veldoria, Crystoria, Braemont, Avaris, Durathal, Myrelis, Zendorra.\nThe commanders were already preparing to deploy.\nEach one of these platforms led to one of the countries in Rheria.\nIn fact, Stark didn't even know about any of these beside Fellarburg, as he was there all the time since he came to this world.\nBut the world was truly bigger than he thought.\n'Something's not making sense, though,' he spoke to the figure that appeared, which floated in the air, following him and Oliver.\n[Hm?]\n'If there are so many countries, why were all the rifts where the apostles are located in Fellarburg.'\nThis couldn't be a coincidence.\n[...]\nNo answer came, though the classes did smile.\n[Plot armor, maybe?]\n\"Wow.\"\nOr maybe Fellarburg was connected to the descent of the Godless Demon.\nStark shook off the thought for now.\n\"Alright, I'm going!\" Alexis's voice snapped him back to reality.\nHe stepped onto a platform marked Lampod, offering a casual wave before disappearing in a flash of light.\n\"My robots will wipe these dumbasses out in seconds,\" Ed laughed as he headed toward the Braemont platform.\nOne by one, the commanders moved to their respective destinations, each vanishing in bursts of light.\n\"For your information, kid, check this out.\" Oliver raised his arm, revealing a sleek device strapped to his wrist.\nIt resembled a high-tech watch.\nWith a tap, a holographic display materialized, showcasing a detailed report:\n[Entities: 11]\n[4 in Fellarburg]\n[2 in Lampod]\n[3 in Ostount]\n[1 in Braemont]\n[1 in Veldoria]\n\"So I guess we're heading to…\" Stark began.\n\"Veldoria,\" Oliver finished for him. His tone was grim. \"That's where Clever's transformed form is. He's the strongest among them all. Even the other commanders wouldn't stand a chance against him.\"\nClever was already extremely strong in his human form, regarded as one of the strongest in the real world with his giant golden statue.\nBut now in his transformed form, where he didn't care about anything but chaos and death; it was a disaster.\n\"And to answer your earlier question,\" Oliver continued as they approached the Veldoria platform, \"we don't usually intervene. Most monsters come from first- and second-domination trials, and the classifiers can handle those on their own.\"\nThis meant that, usually, the monsters could be easily dealt with by classifiers that had completed their respective trials.\n\"So this is… different?\" Stark asked, though he already knew the answer.\n\"Yes, only around 3 to 4 third domination trials happen every year, meaning we have an extremely low number of people who have the power to deal with those.\"\nRemoving the high amount of deaths from these trials, you shouldn't forget the fact that in the majority of cases, every classifier inside dies.\n\"The power of the transformed monsters depends on the level of the trial, and thus, participants that were transformed inside a Death-Level trial are world-ending abominations.\"\nRemember during the first trial, when the participants were transformed?\nThey were only level 15, meaning around level 100 classifiers.\nYet, as they were coming from a Death-Level Trial, their power and strength had been boosted to the point where they could cause havoc.\nIt was scary to think about, and Stark didn't want to end like those... things.\n\"Anyway, we have to deal with the strongest one, try not to die,\" Oliver laughed for the first time, and he looked demonic.\nStark frowned. \"How am I supposed to fight if I'm restrained?\"\nOliver smirked, his expression darkly amused. \"You'll figure it out.\"\nBefore Stark could protest further, Oliver stepped onto the platform, dragging Stark with him.\n\"Launch,\" he commanded.\nA burst of blinding light enveloped them, and Stark felt the world around him shift.",

      "content": "The blinding light of the teleportation portal subsided, Stark momentarily disoriented.\nHe blinked, his vision adjusting to the stark contrast of their new surroundings.\nThe capital of Veldoria was now in full view.\nThe sky was blue, and at first glance, everything seemed to be normal.\nThat is, if you ignored all the screams.\n\"RUN!\"\n\"LOOK AT IT, FUCKING HELL!\"\n\"SOMEONE HELP!\"\nVeldoria was NOT a country where powerful classifiers usually stayed.\nOf course, it still had rifts and academies, but in comparison to Fellarburg, it was nothing.\nWhile everyone was running in the opposite direction, Oliver, who was still carrying Stark in his arms, suddenly looked at the sky.\n\"Heh, this is more insane than I thought, I haven't seen something like that in my entire life.\"\nWhat he said meant that through all these decades of being the commander of the [Domination Association], a thing of this scale had never happened before.\n[Oh boy :)]\nThe \"Classes Figure\" materialized beside them, looking at the sky too, it was seemingly able to follow Stark wherever he went.\n\"So, where the hell is he—\" Stark began, still cuffed, but his voice trailed off as his eyes looked up.\nA colossal figure dominated the horizon, towering so high it seemed to scrape the heavens.\n\"…Oh,\" Stark muttered, his throat suddenly dry.\nIt was unmistakably a statue, but this wasn't like the decently-sized one Clever was known for in the real world.\nThis one was different, terrifyingly so.\nInstead of shimmering gold, its surface was a dull, menacing dark gold, like corrupted metal that had absorbed centuries of despair.\nIt was as though the statue itself rejected light, devouring any radiance that dared approach it.\nThe statue's form was unnerving.\nIt was at least ten times as big as Clever's golden counterpart, and it still had one hundred arms, all raised toward the sky.\nThis statue exuded a feeling of dread, an oppressive weight that pressed against Stark's chest even from miles away.\nOliver nodded grimly. \"That's him.\"\n\"Why isn't he attacking,\" Stark asked, confused.\nWith the sheer size of that thing, it should be easily able to defeat level 900-1000 classifiers, destroying entire cities by itself.\n\"No idea, I'll have to try and take it down, though.\"\n[I think now should be the right time to leave that loser and go our separate ways :)]\n'Not yet,' Stark's eyes burned with aura as he answered the Figure. 'I want to see.'\n[Damn. Playing the long game, huh?]\n'What's your way out, anyway?'\n[Well, we actually have two ways, but we'll explain later. Just say \"do it\" when you're ready. No backing out after that!]\n'Alright.'\nOliver dashed toward the statue, dodging panicked citizens, crushed vehicles, and destroyed buildings.\nStark bounced uncomfortably in his arms, the cuffs around his wrists still clinking.\nThe closer they got, the worse the destruction became.\nBodies of civilians and classifiers alike littered the ground, some crushed beyond recognition.\nThe ground was flat, scorched black by the statue's power.\nThe statue looked giant from everywhere, but he still had to run for a while before arriving to its location.\n[Clever, Immortal-Level (Transformed)]\n[Level: 180]\n[Domination Power: 100-Golden Arms Statue.]\n[Attributes: ???]\n[Skills: ???]\nStark checked from afar, but alas, he was simply given basic information, the skills and attributes hidden from him.\nThough the sole fact Clever was level 180 meant he would be insanely strong.\nAt the level of level 900 classifiers, if not more, especially with that power of his.\nThankfully enough, though, Oliver was level 200, meaning that it should be fairly easy to deal with it: the sole problem was the destruction that would occur.\nThe sheer weight of the statue's aura suffocated the air, and the figure only seemed larger now, its arms casting shadows over the broken streets below.\nAt its base, the devastation was absolute. Buildings no longer stood; they were piles of rubble.\nIn the center of it all, Clever sat.\nHe was no longer the frail old man Stark had once seen.\nHis appearance had been twisted, grotesquely enhanced by his transformation.\nHis body was now unnaturally tall and broad, clad in sleek, dark gold armor that shimmered faintly under the dim light.\nHis face, once lined with age, was hidden beneath a jagged mask that seemed to fuse with his flesh, only his crimson eyes glowing through the gaps.\nClever floated a few feet above the ground, legs crossed in a meditative pose.\nDespite the carnage surrounding him, he exuded a calm, almost serene energy, his dark aura swirling lazily around him.\n\"Here it is,\" Oliver said, grinning as he finally set Stark down.\nClever's eyes snapped open, glowing brighter.\nHe regarded Oliver and Stark with mild interest, then spoke in a voice that echoed unnaturally, as though a dozen others spoke alongside him.\n\"You're here.\"\n\"My statue warned me.\"\nOliver cracked his knuckles. \"I hope it warned you that you're about to die, too.\"\n[Cringe one-liners,] the Classes Figure whispered beside him. \"[Need help?]\"\n\"Not yet,\" Stark replied, watching the scene unfold.\nClever unfolded his legs and rose slowly, his feet still hovering above the cracked ground.\nHis crimson eyes burned brighter, and the statue above him finally stirred, its hundred arms lowering in synchronization.\n\"Destruction and chaos,\" Clever said, his voice eerily calm. \"That is all I want. I simply waited for a worthy opponent to appear. Otherwise, it would all be meaningless.\"\nNone of the transformed participants were under the influence of the Godless Demon, don't get it twisted.\nIt was simply their appearances becoming more grotesque, their powers growing stronger, and more importantly, their urges for violence reaching their max, forcing them to kill and destroy.\nClever seemed to be the only one strong enough to actually endure it a little bit, though he still wanted to fight and kill.\nThese things mimicked the original personalities.\n\"And now that you're here,\" Clever continued, a wicked smile spreading across his grotesque face, \"this country will burn as I rip your body apart.\"\nClever raised an arm, and the dark gold statue above him responded instantly, its massive arms descending toward the battlefield.\nEach arm carried enough force to flatten an entire city block, and even the faintest brush would mean death.\nThe crushed bodies of dozens of classifiers surrounding the area were evidence of that.\n[A bunch of idiots :) They thought he was level 180. Adorable.]\nStark frowned.\nThese classifiers, and more specifically the ones that had a perception skill, probably saw level 180 on Clever's status windows, thus thinking that he was an easy target and that his statue was all for show.\nEven after witnessing the Domination Trial, it was impossible for anybody to truly know about how the class worked after all.\nIt was only after hundreds of losses that they realized that this thing was in fact NOT level 180, as it was able to defeat level 900+ classifiers easily.\nBut as Clever laughed and the statue's arms began their descent, Oliver moved.\n\"Destruction!\" Clever roared, his laughter echoing.\nThe statue's eye sockets flared with dark flames, its arms ready to strike.\n\"Sorry to disappoint you, old man,\" he grinned, \"But I'm about to do something only a handful of domination users know of.\"\n[...?]\n\"...?\"\nStark was confused, and so right as he was about to ask for the classes to let him go, he suddenly stopped.\nWas there such a thing? Or was Oliver bluffing?\nThere was no real way to stop the destruction that would happen, and even though Oliver was level 200, thus able to defeat Clever with time, he would still have to endure the assault of arms from the statue.\nOr at least... that is what he believed.\nOliver stood firm, the air around him crackling with energy. \"Pay attention, kid,\" he called over his shoulder.\nStark narrowed his eyes.\n\"That's something you only get after reaching level 200 of the domination class.\"\nClever's smile faded slightly, his eyes narrowing.\nOliver grinned wider.\n\"DOMINATION EXPANSION: ARENA SHOWDOWN!\"",

Interesting.\"\nOliver grinned, cracking his knuckles. \"Guess I'm full of surprises.\"\n\"Hmm,\" Clever muttered, his grotesque form floating slightly above the ground. \"This doesn't change anything. You've merely confined your death to another stage.\"\nOliver and Clever faced each other in the heart of the obsidian arena.\nStark could only watch from the sidelines, his mind still reeling from the absurdity of the situation.\nOliver rolled his shoulders, his aura crackling like a storm on the verge of breaking. His eyes were sharp, calculating.\n\"So,\" Oliver began, his voice steady, devoid of the bravado Stark was accustomed to hearing. \"You're aware of the rules now, Clever. No running, no tricks. Just raw power and endurance.\"\nClever tilted his head, a mocking smile curling his lips. \"It's amusing, really, you've forgotten who you're dealing with.\"\nClever's golden statue behind him shifted, the hundred grotesque arms lowering slightly as if preparing to strike.\nHis own aura darkened, a shadowy gold that pulsed with malevolence.\n\"You think you can endure me?\" Clever's voice was low, almost a whisper, but it carried the weight of a predator toying with its prey.\nOliver raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. \"Stop talking and show me.\"\nClever's grin widened. \"As you wish.\"\nWithout warning, the air exploded with movement.\nThe statue's arms came to life, each one moving with terrifying speed and precision, striking toward Oliver like a volley of spears.\nOliver didn't flinch.\nHis aura surged, and he stepped into the attack rather than away.\nWith a sweep of his arm, he redirected one of the statue's arms, the impact shaking the ground beneath their feet.\nAnother arm came from above, and Oliver ducked, pivoting fluidly to avoid it.\n[Domination Power: Universal Strength]\n'I guess the name of his power didn't lie,' Stark mumbled.\n[Want to get out of the cuffs now?]\n\"Yeah, why not,\" Stark sighed, finally feeling ready even though he was in Oliver's domain.\nHe didn't want to die by a stray statue hand, after all.\n[Here goes nothing...]\nOn the other side of the domain, the clash was relentless.\nOliver closed the distance, his movements precise and efficient.\nHe slammed his fist into Clever's midsection, his knuckles glowing with a crimson light.\n-6,721,949!\nClever grunted, the force of the blow pushing him back a step, but he quickly recovered, retaliating with a sharp kick that Oliver barely dodged.\n'Strong,' Oliver thought.\nEven though Clever was supposed to be at level 180, his talents and domination powers were still seemingly superior to Oliver's.\nThe golden statue's arms moved in unison now, creating a coordinated assault that forced Oliver to stay on the defensive.\n[Name: Clever - Transformed]\n[Level: 180]\n[HP: 93,278,051/100,000,000]\n[Skills: Divine Pulverizer (Mythical), Thousandfold Destruction (Mythical), Zenith Eruption (Mythical), Shimmering Collapse (Mythical), Monumental Devastation (Mythical), Eternal Divide (Godly), Wrathful Annihilation (Godly), Crushing Infinity (Godly), Golden Tempest (Godly), Titan's Fury (Godly), Heaven's Rainfall (Immortal), Supreme Execution (Immortal), Zero Hand (Immortal++)]\nThis guy only had skills from the [Mythical] category and above, including three fucking Immortal ones.\nThe transformation had made Clever, a beast in the battlefield, into a whole demon.\nAnd what the hell is Immortal+? Was it the next form of Immortal?\nHis [Zero Hand] from his human form was Immortal, but the + had just been added.\nIt didn't matter to Oliver, though, who simply got ready to fight with all his might, as in this space, the worse that could happen is for him to die.\nThough he knew it was unlikely, even with the massive HP pool the transformed Clever had.\n'Come on,' Stark groaned as the Classes Figure was busy dealing with the cuffs.\n[On it, just be patient.]\nThe battle raged on, each clash of power shaking the obsidian arena like a thunderstorm.\nOliver darted forward, weaving between the relentless strikes of the golden statue's arms.\nHis aura flared, a blazing shield of crimson light that deflected one of the statue's fists inches from his face.\nClever's grin widened as he effortlessly commanded the grotesque monstrosity, its movements fluid despite its size.\n\"You're faster than I expected, Oliver,\" he said, his voice calm and condescending. \"But speed won't save you here.\"\nThe golden arms launched another barrage, this time coordinated to trap Oliver.\nTwo came from the sides, one aimed to crush him from above, and another stabbed forward like a lance.\nOliver's eyes narrowed.\nWith a deep breath, his crimson aura surged, and he leaped straight into the onslaught.\nOliver spun mid-air, his aura condensing around his leg.\nWith one decisive kick, he cleaved through two of the statue's arms, sending fragments of shimmering gold scattering across the arena, destroying them completely.\nThe remaining arms closed in, but Oliver moved faster than Clever anticipated, rolling beneath them and striking at Clever himself with a devastating punch to the chest.\n-8,455,372!\nClever stumbled, his grin faltering for a moment. The golden statue reeled, as though sharing its master's pain.\n\"You're persistent. I'll give you that,\" Clever muttered, regaining his composure. \"But let's see how long you last.\"\nWith a snap of his fingers, the shattered arms of the statue reformed instantly, their golden hue gleaming brighter than before.\nThe sheer speed of their regeneration was staggering.\nStark watched from the sidelines, his jaw tightening. \"He's just regenerating them? That's insane!\"\nClever laughed, his tone mocking. \"Surely you didn't think you could destroy my creation so easily? These hands are limitless, Oliver. No matter how strong you are, you'll fall eventually.\"\nOliver wiped the sweat from his brow, a confident smirk playing across his lips. \"Limitless, huh? Let's test that.\"\nOne of the golden arms launched at him like a spear, faster and more forceful than any of its previous strikes.\nThe air around it warped as it tore through space, aimed straight at Oliver's chest.\nBut Oliver didn't flinch.\nAs the arm closed in, he extended his hand and caught it mid-thrust.\nThe force of the impact sent shockwaves rippling across the arena, the ground beneath his feet cracking under the strain.\nFor a moment, the world seemed to hold its breath.\nThen, with a roar, Oliver's aura erupted, and he crushed the golden arm in his grip. The limb shattered into a million pieces, golden dust scattering like glittering rain.\n\"You're weak,\" Oliver taunted, his voice cutting through the tense silence. He tossed the remnants aside like trash, his smirk widening.\nClever tilted his head, unbothered.\nTrue to his words from before, the golden fragments began to reform, pulling themselves back into shape with a metallic hum.\nClever's grin returned, broader than ever. \"Please, keep trying. I enjoy the effort.\"\nOliver tightened his fists, his aura crackling. \"Then I'll just have to destroy them faster than you can fix them.\"\nThe two locked eyes, the tension between them palpable. And then, in a blur of motion, the next assault began.\nThis time though... they started using their skills.\nOn the other hand, Stark was simply waiting for the classes to do their only job: liberate him.",

      "content": "Stark clenched his fists, feeling the weight of the cuffs dragging down his energy like anchors.\nHis gaze burned toward the [Classes Figure], which hovered silently, studying the restraints.\nIt extended a shimmering, translucent hand toward the cuffs, its movements precise and deliberate.\nA faint light emanated from its touch as it probed the crimson runes etched into the metal.\nFor a moment, Stark felt a flicker of hope as the cuffs grew warm.\nThe warmth turned to heat, then pressure.\nSuddenly, the runes flared violently, a shockwave of red energy forcing the [Classes Figure] back.\nStark winced as the recoil sent a stinging jolt through his arms.\n\"Not working?\" Stark gritted through his teeth, struggling to keep his tone even.\nThe [Classes Figure] straightened, its form rippling faintly as if absorbing the feedback.\nWithout a word, it returned to the task, this time pressing its other hand against the cuffs.\nThe glow intensified, a low hum building in the air as the runes flared again, brighter than before.\nThe resistance was palpable, an invisible force pushing back against the [Classes Figure]'s efforts.\nThe cuffs emitted a sharp, metallic screech as the runes writhed under the strain, refusing to give way.\nSeconds stretched into what felt like hours, Stark's patience wearing thin.\nThe sound of distant battle reached his ears, explosions, the clash of power, and the guttural roar of the regenerating golden beast.\n\"Enough!\" Stark growled, his aura flaring uncontrollably. \"Put more into it!\"\nThe [Classes Figure] didn't respond, but its presence grew heavier.\nIt dug its fingers into the cuffs, the translucent edges of its form hardening like steel.\nThe hum grew deafening, the air around Stark vibrating with energy.\nThen, with a blinding flash, the runes cracked.\n[Now it's time,] The Classes grinned, backing away, [Domination skill won't work on it, but we have other classes, which means it's gonna be easy work.]\nAnd so, all the [Classes Figure] did was summon the giant crimson/golden cross from [Wielding Cross].\n\"Hey, what are you doing with that thing-\"\nStark didn't have the time to finish that the figure smashed it onto the boy.\nBAM!\n-6,281!\n[Calm down, it's your own power, it won't hurt much.]\n\"YOU LITTLE-\"\nStark wanted to shout, but... it worked.\nThe sound of shattering metal echoed through the chamber as the cuffs fell away, breaking into fragments at Stark's feet.\nThe moment they were gone, Stark felt his power surge back, a wave of energy rushing through him like a long-lost part of his soul.\nHe flexed his fingers, the crimson aura around his hands flaring to life.\nWithout looking at the [Classes Figure], he muttered, \"Finally.\"\nThe translucent being hovered quietly, its task complete, before fading into the shadows.\n\"At least I can defend myself now.\"\nStark turned toward the battlefield, his expression dark.\nOliver and Clever were staring at one another.\nOn one hand, a guy that could destroy divine hands with his sheer strength, and on the other, an old man that could destroy entire cities in mere instants thanks to his statue.\nAnd they were both stuck inside of that domain.\n\"You angered me, now the world will perish as soon as I deal with you.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever,\" Oliver grinned, positioning his fists.\nRemember how every domination's power works different?\nWell, Oliver was one of those.\nIt would be way too simple to just have him have different skills with his [Universal Strength] domination power, so instead, the system or whoever decides about those things gave him a new \"mechanic\".\nStark activated his [Perception], and the result was quite shocking.\n...\n[Name: Oliver]\n[Level: 200]\n[Class: Domination - Universal Strength]\n[HP: 1,500,000]\n[Strength: 99,999]\n[Stamina: 56,821]\n[Speed: 47,859]\n[Defense: 78,273]\n[Skills: 10%, 20%, 30% (Legendary+), 40% (Legendary+), 50% (Mythical), 60% (Mythical+), 70% (Godly), 80% (Godly+), 90% (Immortal), 100% (Immortal+), 200% (Immortal++), 300% (Immortal+++)]\n...\n\"Huh.\"\nEach of his skills were percentages, and for some reason, even his third skill was ranked as legendary.\nIn addition to that, he also had those + signs beside the ranks of his skills.\nThese were the indicatives given to skills when they were strong enough to be beyond their rank, but not quite at the next one.\nIt was a middle-ground.\nThe most shocking of all, though... was the [Immortal+++] one.\nImmortal skills were already a death sentence by themselves, as they were the highest ranked ones, but if you added even a single + sign, it was terrifying.\nAnd yet, you're telling him that his highest skill had three +'s?\nThe sole reason it wasn't beyond Immortal was because it was just straight up impossible, since there's nothing...\nJust how powerful could it be?\nFour immortal skills, with increasing percentages and plus signs next to their ranks.\n\"...\" Stark decided to watch for now, preserving his own life inside that domain, as he couldn't escape even if he tried.\nThe atmosphere in the domain grew thick, the air buzzing with raw energy as Oliver cracked his knuckles.\nAcross the battlefield, Clever stood with his regenerating golden statue looming behind him, its hundred arms twitching with restrained fury.\nThe statue's radiant golden aura clashed against the fiery crimson of Oliver's power, creating a dazzling storm of light and heat.\nOliver smirked, his muscles flexing as a faint golden glow enveloped his body.\nHe raised a single finger and tapped his temple.\n\"Alright, let's keep this interesting,\" he said, his grin widening. \"I'll start light, 10% should do.\"\nOliver enjoyed doing this in every single one of his fights: using one skill after the other, as the percentages displayed were the actual increase in his strength.\nHe really liked seeing just how far an opponent could take it before falling.\nAs the words left his lips, Oliver's aura intensified ever so slightly, and the ground beneath his feet cracked.\nWithout hesitation, Clever commanded his statue to move.\n\"Thousandfold Destruction,\" Clever intoned, his voice cold and calculated.\nThe golden statue blurred as its hundred arms moved with unthinkable speed, delivering a hurricane of punches.\nEach strike carried the weight of a mountain, the air around them screaming with the sheer force of the blows.\nA storm of golden energy formed, tearing through the domain in a vortex of destruction.\n\"Holy shit...\" Stark could handle it as he was pretty far, but their power was terrifying.\nOliver didn't flinch.\nAs the first punch reached him, he twisted his body slightly, dodging with millimeter precision.\nAnother punch followed, then another, but Oliver flowed through the onslaught with ease, his movements effortless.\n\"You call this a warm-up?\" Oliver mocked, his voice carrying over the cacophony.\nSuddenly, Oliver ducked low and launched forward with explosive speed.\nHe didn't have any fancy skills: the only thing that he could do was increase his strength, then everything else was up to him and the mastery of his domination power.\nHis fist connected with dozens of the golden arms, the impact shattering them into fragments of light.\nThe statue recoiled, its remaining arms forming a barrier around Clever.\n\"Zenith Eruption,\" Clever commanded, unfazed.\nGolden pillars erupted from the ground in rapid succession, each one detonating in a cascading burst.\nThe blasts were relentless, the battlefield a sea of explosions.\nOliver skidded to a halt, his grin fading slightly. \"Alright, this is more like it.\"\nHe stomped the ground, launching himself into the air to avoid the next eruption.\nAs he descended, his fist began to glow with a brilliant light.\n\"Let's bump it up: 20%.\"\nWith a thunderous roar, Oliver slammed his fist into the ground.\nThe resulting shockwave annihilated the remaining pillars, the force ripping through the domain and sending Clever sliding back.\n-3,837,271!\nEven the shockwave of the attack dealt damage.\nClever scowled, \"Radiant Meteorfall.\"\n[Description: Golden hands launch into the sky, transforming into radiant meteors that rain down upon the battlefield. Each meteor strikes with the force of a celestial object, leaving fiery golden craters and stunning impact zones.]\nThe statue's golden hands shot into the sky, transforming into blazing meteors.\nThey rained down upon Oliver with devastating speed, each impact shaking the domain.\nOliver planted his feet firmly, his aura flaring brighter.\nHe raised both arms, deflecting meteors with precision strikes. Each one exploded on contact, but none managed to faze him.\n\"Not bad,\" Oliver admitted, his tone still playful. \"Let's go 30%.\"\nThe domain trembled as his power surged, cracks forming in the air itself.\nClever narrowed his eyes, realizing Oliver was only getting started.\nAnd waiting until Oliver was at full power to use his strongest skills was stupid.\nSo instead...\n\"Supreme Execution,\" Clever declared, his voice echoing ominously.\n[Description: Clever summons five giant golden arms, each delivering a devastating attack in sequence before merging into a final cataclysmic strike. The final blow creates a golden shockwave that decimates everything within its radius.]\nHe decided to use one of his immortal skills immediately.\nFive colossal golden arms materialized around the statue, their size dwarfing the battlefield.\nEach one drew back, preparing a strike that could level entire mountains.\nOliver's grin returned, wider than ever. \"Now this is a fight.\"\nThe five arms launched forward simultaneously, the sheer force of their movement distorting the space around them.\nOliver clenched his fists, his aura blazing like a sun.\nThe screen of energy exploded outward as Oliver met the first arm head-on, his punch colliding with its golden surface.\nThe shockwave that followed was deafening, shaking the domain to its core.\nAnd then—darkness.\nWhen the dust settled, Oliver stood unharmed, the shattered remains of one golden arm falling around him like glittering ash.\nThe remaining four arms hovered ominously, preparing their next attack.\n\"Still holding back, Clever?\" Oliver taunted.\nClever's eyes burned with fury as he uttered three words: \"You'll regret this.\"\nThe four remaining arms prepared to attack.\nOliver's grin finally faded, replaced by a look of pure exhilaration. \"Guess I'll have to kick it up to 50% after all.\"",

      "content": "The battle raged on, the battlefield glowing with the remnants of golden light from Clever's Supreme Execution.\nFour golden arms still loomed, each brimming with energy, poised to strike Oliver down.\nOliver stood his ground, his aura growing thicker and more menacing as his strength continued to rise.\nHis focus remained unshaken, his movements precise as he prepared to counter Clever's relentless assault.\nClever wasted no time, commanding the four remaining arms to attack in quick succession.\nThe first arm swung down with the force of a collapsing mountain, but Oliver sidestepped with uncanny precision, delivering a crushing blow to the golden construct.\nThe arm cracked, shards of golden energy scattering into the air.\nThe second and third arms attacked together, attempting to pin Oliver between their massive strikes.\nOliver, now at [70%] power, caught one arm mid-swing, his raw strength stopping it in its tracks, while he unleashed a devastating punch that shattered the other into golden fragments.\nThe force of his counterattack sent ripples across the battlefield, the ground beneath them crumbling under the sheer intensity of their clash.\n\"You're not keeping up, Clever,\" Oliver taunted, his grin sharp despite the sweat on his brow.\nClever snarled, his golden statue emitting a low, resonating hum as the fourth arm charged forward.\nThis time, the attack was swifter, imbued with an aura-infused burst of speed.\nOliver didn't dodge.\nInstead, he braced himself, his aura flaring to its peak at [80%].\nThe arm collided with his crossed forearms, but because of Oliver's incredible defense and strength, it wasn't him that was moved, but the arm that broke.\nHe was just that strong.\nYour [Domination] power completely depended on how you wielded the one you got, and [Universal Strength], even though it wasn't considered as one of the \"strongest ones\", was still really good.\nEspecially in the hands of Oliver, who perfectly handled it.\n\"Damn you!\" Clever roared, his statue trembling with fury.\nWith all four arms destroyed, he activated the final phase of Supreme Execution.\n\"HANDLE THIS, THEN!\"\nThe energy from the shattered arms surged back into the statue, condensing into a single cataclysmic strike.\nThe golden hand grew massive, radiating destructive energy.\nIt was no longer just a weapon, it was a force of nature.\nClever commanded it forward.\n[You should move :)]\nStark was warned, and so the boy immediately backed away, preferring to simply watch for now.\nIf Oliver could win, then it would be good as he was able to leave, but if he did in fact die, Stark would simply nuke Clever again.\nOliver planted his feet, his aura now reaching [90%].\nHe raised his fists, ready to meet the strike head-on.\nThe collision was apocalyptic.\nThe golden hand slammed into Oliver with enough force to obliterate everything within its radius.\nA golden shockwave erupted outward, consuming the battlefield in a blinding flash.\nWhen the dust settled, Oliver stood at the epicenter of the destruction, battered but unbroken.\nHis aura had risen to its full normal capacity, [100%].\nThe golden hand was gone, shattered into oblivion by his sheer power.\n\"You little shit...\" Clever roared with all of his might, \"Your confidence will be your downfall!\"\n\"You can't beat me, and I still have two more transformations, each just as strong as the previous ones combined,\" Oliver smiled, absolutely certain this was his victory.\nThough the difference between level 180 and level 200 was large, it didn't meant that one couldn't defeat the other.\nBut Clever wasn't done.\nHis statue, though visibly damaged, roared to life once more.\nClever's expression twisted into one of pure determination as he prepared to unleash his ultimate skill: Zero Hand.\nIf Supreme Execution and nothing else worked, then Zero Hand, the skill he used in the trial to protect himself from [Heaven's Spear], was his only solution.\nThe golden aura surrounding the statue began to condense, shrinking and compressing into a single point.\nThe energy became crystalline, forming a massive diamond hand.\nThe air grew heavy, every molecule vibrating with the overwhelming pressure of the attack.\n\"Zero Hand!\" Clever declared, his voice echoing across the battlefield.\nThe diamond hand hovered in the air, shimmering with unmatched power.\nIt was, in fact, even bigger than the one he used to protect himself in the trial, a result of his transformation into a monster.\nIt was no ordinary strike, this was the culmination of Clever's strength, a technique that sacrificed all his aura to create a singular, unstoppable force.\nOliver's eyes narrowed, his body tensing as he prepared for the incoming attack.\nBut Clever had other plans.\nThe diamond hand surged forward.\n\"200%,\" Oliver grinned, \"Now you can't even hope to hurt me, fucker.\"\nAnd at that moment, Oliver committed his greatest mistake.\nHe was all-powerful, he was extremely strong, almost no one could beat him.\nAnd yet, even being outsmarted once could mean the end of his life.\nThis was that moment that every classifier feared.\nHe got positioned to handle the giant diamond hand, the size of a big city block, deflecting it or destroying it.\n\"Idiot...\" Clever whispered, knowing that he had won at that moment.\nBecause instead of striking, the \"Zero Hand\" veered off course.\nIn a split second, it suddenly opened and reached out to Oliver, wrapping around him like an unbreakable cage.\nThe immense strength of the hand locked Oliver in place, its crushing grip rendering him immobile.\n\"I GOT YOU, DUMBASS!\" Clever shouted, his voice filled with triumphant glee.\nOliver's expression shifted from confidence to shock.\nHe struggled against the grip, his muscles straining as he pushed his power to its limits.\nBut the diamond hand didn't budge.\n\"What the-?!\" Oliver exclaimed, his voice tinged with disbelief.\nThe grip tightened.\nOliver could feel the full weight of Clever's aura bearing down on him, amplified by the power of the statue. It was unyielding.\nZero Hand was too powerful, and restrained like this, even his current strength didn't make it budge.\nIt was the entirety of Clever's aura and the full power of the statue too, it just wasn't breakable.\n\"You thought you could handle everything, huh?\" Clever sneered, leaping onto the diamond hand.\nHe crouched down in front of Oliver, staring directly into his restrained face. \"How does it feel? You're a fucking idiot, and now you're about to be squeezed to death.\"\nOliver's eyes widened, his composure cracking under the sheer impossibility of the situation.\nThis wasn't something he could simply break free from. Zero Hand wasn't just powerful, it was absolute.\nAnd there was no \"haha you think I'm weak, but I have a comeback\", Oliver was genuinely fucked, you can't escape Zero Hand.\nHe tried to push back, summoning every ounce of his strength.\nHis aura flared wildly, reaching [300%] for a brief moment, but it wasn't enough.\nThe system itself seemed to mock him.\n[You cannot in current position.]\nFrustration filled his gaze as he struggled in vain. He was truly trapped.\nClever smirked, savoring his victory.\n\"What's wrong, old man? Out of tricks already?\" He leaned closer, his grin widening. \"You're done. And when you're dead, I'll destroy this country like I should've done from the start.\"\nWith a commanding gesture, Clever ordered the statue to tighten its grip.\nThe pressure increased, the diamond hand beginning to crush Oliver's form.\nSlam!\nClever delivered a sharp kick to Oliver's face, though it had little effect beyond hurting his own foot. \"Damn it,\" Clever hissed, clutching his throbbing leg. \"Your face is like a damn rock.\"\nHe shook off the pain and turned back to the statue. \"Crush him already! I've got better things to do than play with this guy.\"\nThe statue obeyed, its massive form leaning into the diamond hand as it applied even more pressure.\nThe ground beneath them cracked and groaned under the immense weight of the attack.\nFor the first time in the battle, Oliver seemed truly defeated.\nThe indomitable force that had carried him through countless fights now appeared powerless against Clever's ultimate move.\nThe battlefield grew silent, the only sound being the creaking of the diamond hand as it closed in on its prey.\nOliver's fate seemed sealed.",

      "content": "\"Damn, level 200 and he still got caught,\" Stark grinned.\nHe stood at a distance, his sharp gaze locked onto the battlefield where Oliver was trapped, struggling desperately against the crushing grip of the massive diamond hand.\nThe once-unshakable confidence on Oliver's face was gone, replaced with an expression of grim determination as he fought against what seemed like an impossible force.\nBut it wasn't working.\nFor the first time, Oliver's raw strength had failed him.\nThe diamond hand, formed from Clever's ultimate skill, Zero Hand, was unyielding, and Stark could see that Oliver's aura was flickering under the immense pressure.\n\"I guess levels don't mean shit when something like this happen,\" Stark mumbled, \"I should have known after using Heaven's Spear this much, though.\"\n[Not gonna do anything :)?]\nThe classes figure appeared again, staring at the giant statue holding Oliver with all its might.\n\"The only thing I could do is use [Heaven's Spear], which would kill Oliver too.\"\n[Heh, who even cares?] It shrugged.\nAnd at that sentence, Stark's eyes narrowed a little.\n\"That's...\" Stark put his hand on his chin, scratching it, \"That's actually true.\"\n[He's gonna die if you don't do anything anyway, might as well let him be experience points for us :)]\nStark looked to the void above, focusing his energy as he prepared to summon the weapon that had saved him countless times before.\nHeaven's Spear.\n\"I hope it works even in Domination Expansions.\"\nThe atmosphere shifted as a colossal rift tore open in the sky above the arena, revealing the radiant figure of the angelic being.\nIts form glowed with divine power, its massive wings spread wide as it carried a spear that radiated an overwhelming holy energy.\nThe sight alone was enough to make even the most hardened warriors falter.\nThe angel gazed down with cold, piercing eyes, its very presence exuding an aura of judgment.\nClever's eyes widened in pure terror.\n\"No... not again,\" he whispered, his voice trembling.\nIn an instant, memories of his death as a human flooded his mind.\nHe had faced this before—the same spear, the same overwhelming force.\nThe pain, the helplessness, the inevitability of it all, it all came rushing back.\nHe instinctively released Oliver, the diamond hand moving back as Clever focused all his energy on defending himself.\nHe brought the Zero Hand to him, its immense size and power returning as it hovered between him and the angelic figure.\nBut as the energy condensed into the hand, another memory surfaced, one that froze Clever in place.\n\"Wait a minute...\" he looked at the diamond hand, \"I... Did this before, didn't I?!\"\nWhen transformed from a trial, you only retained your core memories, so things like this weren't remembered.\nThis attack was impossible to avoid.\nHeaven's Spear didn't miss. It didn't stop. It didn't forgive.\nStark didn't hesitate.\nHe raised his hand, his expression cold and unyielding, and sent the massive spear hurtling toward the battlefield.\nHe didn't care if Oliver got caught in the blast. This was the only way.\nThe spear descended like a falling star, its radiant energy growing brighter and hotter with each passing second.\nThe angel's form vanished as the spear reached terminal velocity, a beam of pure divine energy trailing behind it.\n\"NO!\" Clever roared, his voice echoing across the battlefield as he thrust Zero Hand forward in a desperate attempt to block the attack.\nBOOOOOOOM!\nThe impact was cataclysmic.\nThe moment the spear collided with the ground, an explosion of light and sound erupted, blinding everyone within miles.\nThe sheer force of the blast tore through the earth, ripping apart the arena and sending shockwaves that shook the very air.\nA deafening roar drowned out everything as the divine energy consumed everything in its radius.\nThe golden statue shattered instantly, its once-imposing form reduced to nothing but fragments of glowing debris.\nClever, caught in the direct blast, let out one final, agonized scream before his voice was silenced, his monstrous form obliterated by the overwhelming power of the spear.\nEven Oliver, despite his immense durability, was caught in the blast.\nStark, standing far at the edge of the arena, shielded himself with a protective barrier of aura, watching as the divine light gradually faded.\nHe had poured an incredible amount of his own power into the spear, not holding back for even a moment.\nAs the dust began to settle, the arena was left in utter ruin.\nThe once-imposing battlefield was now a smoldering crater, the air thick with heat and the faint hum of residual energy.\nEverything in the center of the explosion had been completely vaporized.\nNothing remained.\n\"...\"\nThen, a system notification flashed before his eyes:\n[You have slain \"Clever - Godless Transformation\", gaining 600,000,000 experience points.]\nStark froze, his eyes wide as he read the notification.\nSix hundred million?\nHe blinked, rereading the number.\nThe sheer magnitude of it left him momentarily stunned.\nIt was the largest amount of experience he had ever received in a single moment, far surpassing anything he had encountered before.\nBut then again, it made sense.\nClever wasn't just any opponent, he was a level 180 domination monster, transformed into a Godless entity, with power leagues above most classifiers Stark had faced.\nDing! Ding! Ding!\nAnd so the level-up notifications flooded in.\n[Your level has increased to level 148, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Your level has increased to level 149, granting you five skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Your level has increased to level 150, granting you six skill points and a boost in stats.]\nDing!\n[Level 150 Reached!]\nBut of course, this wasn't the end.\n[Your level has increased to level 151, granting you six skill points and a boost in stats.]\n.\n.\n[Your level has increased to level 156, granting you six skill points and a boost in stats.]\n[Experience: 34,545,000/84,000,000]\nOnce reaching level 150, the increase of experience between each level is at 4,000,000.\nSoon enough, even those 600,000,000 experience points would only result in Stark leveling up four to five times if this kept going like this.\nAnd of course, reaching level 150 meant crossing one of the most important milestones Stark had reached yet.\nDing! Ding! Ding!\nSeveral panels appeared around him to confirm that fact.\nNow that he was alone in this place, there wasn't any need to worry.\nBut...\n\"Wait a minute.\"\n[:)]\n\"Why didn't I get experience from killing Oliver? He's level 200, I should have gotten around a billion, shouldn't I?\"\n[...]\n\"Then maybe...\"\nStark turned toward the crater, and in the distance, the figure of the domination association leader rose up.\n[Oliver HP: 1/1,500,000]\nHe was bloodied and most of his bones were broken, but he had survived.\n\"...\"\n[How about we kill him while he's low?] The classes figure grinned, [Easiest experience points ever.]\n\"Hm...\"\nThat idea was actually kind of good for Stark.\nThe fact he could gain around 8 to 10 more levels was extremely appealing.\nAnd so, putting aside the several notifications and panels that prompted him to read them, he advanced forward, toward Oliver.\nHe didn't know what his intentions were yet, but it was surprising that he survived [Heaven's Spear], even though he was a level 200 classifier.",

Crack!\nCracks began to appear all over the arena.\nOne of the rules of this [Arena Showdown] Domination Expansion had been met: for someone to die, meaning that it was soon going to break.\n\"Oliver, do you think you can beat me in your state?\" Stark smiled.\n\"...\" and at those words, Oliver's expression darkened, \"Yes, I would still kick your ass if I was blinded with my two legs amputated.\"\nThe determination in his gaze was unwavering.\n[Hm...] the Classes Figure appeared beside Stark, analyzing Oliver, [I don't know, I'll give it a 50/50, maybe you shouldn't try.]\nIf even the classes didn't approve of that, then it meant he truly should watch out.\n\"Alright,\" Stark nodded, letting go of the intimidating aura around his body, \"How did you survive.\"\n\"Talent, what else.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nStark believed that he was the only one that had gotten a talent, but it seems like though they were extremely rare, some other individuals did too.\n\"The talent's name is [Sturdy Body].\"\n[Description: If on the verge of dying and you get hit by a powerful attack, your sturdy body will use its aura to block up to three attacks, dropping your health to one hp instead of dying.]\n\"Oh.\"\nThat was pretty much a triple revive, if you could consider it that.\n\"Don't get it twisted,\" Oliver sighed, getting up, \"There are a lot of rules for this talent, so it's not like I can abuse it.\"\n\"Alright,\" Stark mumbled, looking around at the arena, which was breaking apart, \"You'll tell me more, I hope.\"\n\"No problem,\" Oliver though he was back up, knew he couldn't afford to let his guard down.\nHe felt that Stark was extremely unstable, able to do anything if it meant getting more levels and grow stronger.\nBut maybe... they could use that...\nThe Domination Association had several missions that were incomplete as nobody, even the commanders, wanted to deal with them.\nAnd also because getting to them or completing them in the first place is too difficult.\n\"Don't run, kid, we won't handcuff you anymore,\" Oliver marched forward, looking around, \"Well, not like you won't just break them apart anyway.\"\n\"...\"\nStark wanted to check his panels now, but he needed to wait for the domain to break, and for him to go somewhere safe.\nAfter some time, there was an ominous sound in the arena, and a panel appeared in front of the two.\n[Domination Expansion: Arena Showdown.]\n[Status: Completed]\n[Reward: None, since didn't do anything.]\n\"Oh.\"\n\"You get rewards based on the rules of your domination expansion, and if you make it too overpowered, you may even receive permanent debuffs,\" Oliver grinned, \"As mine is simply a way to lock down an opponent and fight fairly in a 1v1, then it greatly helps.\"\nIt explained why Oliver's strength was at 99,999+ now: every time he fought an opponent at equal level or just slightly lower.\n\"Don't get twisted, the reward is based on the level of the opponent I fight, and as you see, I get nothing this time since you did the work,\" Oliver sighed, \"Too bad, these rewards are always useful.\"\nThe arena groaned, the cracks widening with each passing second as the energy sustaining the Domination Expansion began to unravel.\nStark and Oliver both stood still, their gazes fixed on the crumbling surroundings.\nThen a sharp, ominous snap echoed through the air.\nThe ground beneath them shimmered, the once-solid battlefield fracturing into countless shards of light.\nThe dome that had encased the area started to dissolve, its edges fading into nothingness.\nWith one final, deafening crack, the domain collapsed entirely.\nStark and Oliver found themselves back in the capital of Veldoria.\nThe air was thick with the stench of ash and scorched stone.\nThe once-bustling streets were unrecognizable, reduced to a smoldering wasteland by the battles Clever had with the other classifiers.\n\"Back to reality,\" Oliver muttered, adjusting his stance, \"I just need to get healed now, and we're done.\"\n\"...\" Stark didn't say anything.\nHe had survived an entire death-level domination trial, killed an apostle, fought a godless demon transformed human and now used another skill to kill another transformed human.\nWith all of that in quick succession, anyone would be exhausted.\nIt was already a miracle he wasn't dead, but what can Stark say, it was just his destiny as the Chosen One.\n\"Kid,\" Oliver said, breaking the silence, \"we need to move.\"\nStark glanced at him, his expression unreadable. \"How?\"\nOliver sighed, leaning heavily on his uninjured leg. \"Grab my shoulder and endure. It might feel... odd the first time you travel with a Multi-Task Watch.\"\nWithout waiting for a response, Oliver tapped the sleek device strapped to his wrist.\nIt shimmered faintly, the embedded runes lighting up in sequence as he adjusted its settings.\nStark hesitated for a moment, then placed a hand on Oliver's shoulder.\n\"Brace yourself,\" Oliver warned, the faintest grin tugging at the corner of his lips. \"This isn't like your typical teleportation spell.\"\nWith a final tap, the Spatial Watch activated.\nThe world around them blurred and twisted, as though the very fabric of reality had been yanked sideways.\nStark felt his stomach lurch, the sensation unlike anything he had ever experienced.\nIt was as if his body was being compressed into a singular point before being stretched across an infinite void.\nThen, as suddenly as it began, the sensation ended.\nThey reappeared in the Teleportation Room of the Domination Association's headquarters.\nA faint hum of energy filled the space, emanating from the teleportation platforms scattered throughout.\nOliver staggered slightly but caught himself, grimacing as he straightened. \"Told you it'd be weird.\"\nStark blinked, his senses slowly readjusting.\n\"Invented by yours truly,\" Ed appeared behind them, putting his hands around both Oliver's and Stark's shoulders, \"There's not a single one of my inventions that doesn't work!\"\n\"Oh yeah, concerning that, your domination handcuffs broke,\" Oliver groaned before walking away, \"I'm taking a break after that, call the medics please.\"\nHis body was still aching even though he acted tough.\n\"W-What do you mean, the handcuffs broke?!\" Ed panicked: this would be the first time one of his inventions failed.\nThat guy managed to invent a watch and machines that could teleport people, handcuffs that restrained power shouldn't be difficult to create, at least for him!\n\"Just look at the boy, I wasn't the one that let him go by the way, I'm out,\" and with that, Oliver left, the sliding door automatically closing behind him.\nEd looked at Stark, he thought that Oliver had trusted the boy enough to liberate him, but he had just confirmed this wasn't the case.\nWhich meant...\n\"I broke them, my bad,\" Stark shrugged, \"You got anywhere where I can take a break?\"\n\"...\" Ed couldn't hide his shock, his eyes widening, \"This is... damn...\"\nHe wanted to ask how he did that, but... Ed felt like that it was just that Stark was special.\nHis instincts had almost never deceived him, and this time they screamed that Stark wasn't normal.\n\"Here, take this,\" Ed took one of the watches Oliver was wearing from his backpack and handed it to Stark, \"These watches are so rare and exclusive that only the commanders usually get them.\"\nStark wanted to refuse while saying that he wasn't going to be part of their little group, but to be honest, after seeing what this watch can do, he wasn't about to refuse.\n[Multi-Task Watch (Artifact Item)]\n[Description: Created by the genius \"Domi-Mechanician\" Ed, able to do many things at once, but you should test it out for yourself.]\nHe took it in hand, thanking Ed, then placed it inside of his [Spatial Inventory].\n\"Wow! What kind of technology is that?!\"\n\"A skill.\"\n\"Damn,\" Ed sighed, \"Well, let me guide you to one of our luxurious rooms, where you'll be able to rest as much as needed.\"\n\"Where are the others?\"\n\"Still doing their own missions, I guess, since they had more participants to find and kill.\"\nBoth Ed and Oliver only had one transformed participant inside their respective countries, so it was obvious they would complete it faster.\nKnowing he couldn't do anything more, Stark simply followed the commander, hoping to get a good night of sleep after all this time.\n'I'll check those panels in due time,' he thought.",

      "content": "\"Wow.\"\nStark didn't expect for the [Domination Association Headquarters] to be so... big and luxurious.\nThere were hundreds of rooms that stretched all around, and even Ed seemed to be forced to use the watch on his wrist to navigate.\nSometimes they would see some other members, who would bow at Ed, or back away after seeing Stark in person.\nThere were cafeterias, gyms and everything you needed, almost like a mini-city.\n\"Our headquarters hold enough space and rooms to house around 1,000 people, meaning that most if not all of our members can stay here if they want.\"\n\"So they can go away if needed?\" Stark asked after hearing the last part.\n\"Yeah, we don't restrain them, though many prefer staying here since it makes it easier for missions,\" Ed smiled, \"And probably because it's free...\"\nTo begin with, the Domination Association doesn't even have as many members as you think it does.\nIf you were to really count them, you would realize that there were a maximum of 1,000 people in the association at once.\nRecruiting more was difficult, and though deaths didn't happen often as they always gave missions to the people who could respectively complete them, it didn't mean it was impossible.\nThe [Domination] class was rare to begin with, so let's not add all the people that die in the trials.\n\"We can still handle everything right now, but with the secret revealed, more problems might emerge now,\" Ed sighed, \"I really don't know what was different with that trial for it to reveal it to the whole world...\"\n\"...\" Stark didn't say anything.\nHe still had 5 more apostles to kill, then possibly the Godless Demon himself.\nIf the Domination Association, and especially the commanders, were as strong as he thought, then maybe they could help...\n\"Here, VIP rooms, even more luxurious than the normal ones,\" Ed smiled warmly, \"There's only twenty of those, reserved for the commanders and some other high-class members, you should be proud.\"\n\"Alright...\"\n\"VIP members use their watches to access their rooms, no one else is allowed to, except if you want to bring a girl in to... you know... hah.\"\n\"...I won't.\"\n\"Alright,\" Ed sighed, \"I set your watch as VIP, meaning that you get every single feature there is, enjoy it.\"\nThese [Multi-Task Watches] came in different ranks, and the higher-ranked you were, the more features they had.\nOf course, though, it wasn't because the domination association didn't want to give its members the privilege as it would greatly help in mission: it was more like they couldn't.\nThe [Multi-Task Watches] used aura to function, and only someone with an extremely potent and powerful aura could fully utilize it.\nBasically... only the commanders and very powerful people in the association could.\n\"Spatial Inventory,\" Stark put his hand inside of the inventory void, then pulled out the [Multi-Task Watch] he was given.\nWithout waiting, he placed it in front of the scanner, and the screen above the door suddenly.\nThe name [Stark] was now moving from the left to the right side.\n\"Good job, you now own this room until you either leave the association or die!\"\n\"I'm not part of the association.\"\n\"Who cares? Even if you're not a member, people who help are appreciated.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nThe sliding door automatically opened as the scanner identified Stark.\n[Welcome back, Stark Heartsouls, enjoy your rest.]\nAll of this was extremely technological, probably built by Ed at lightning speed.\nStark eyed the [Domi-Mechanician], wondering just how practical his powers would be in battle.\n\"See you later, kid, there will probably be a meeting after the mission, so take as much rest as needed.\"\n\"Ok.\"\nEd quickly left afterward, off to do some other things.\n\"Here goes nothing...\"\nStark stepped into the room and was immediately struck by its luxury.\nA massive screen TV dominated one wall, seamlessly integrated into the sleek design.\nIn the center stood a plush king-sized bed with crimson silk sheets, exuding comfort.\nTo the side, a modern kitchen gleamed with high-tech appliances, complete with a robot chef ready to cook any dish.\nA bubbling jacuzzi occupied one corner, surrounded by soft ambient lighting, creating a tranquil atmosphere.\nThe room was a perfect blend of comfort and opulence.\nAnd Stark could stay in this room as long as he wanted.\n\"...The association could be useful, so I'll stay a little bit,\" he grinned, jumping on the bed and lying there, \"Oh yeah, first, I need to contact them.\"\nHe opened his [Spatial Inventory] for the third time and pulled out his phone from it.\nImmediately, he opened up his messaging app, just to see dozens of messages from both Sora and Lana.\nThere were even messages from an unknown sender he had never added.\n[Sora: Are you okay? If you need anything, tell me.]\nEven though Sora was probably worried, even her messages gave that emotionless look.\n[Lana: STARK?!]\n[Lana: ARE YOU OKAY??!]\n[Lana: WHERE ARE YOU!!]\nLana's messages were much more panicked, and there were several dozens upon dozens of them.\nAnd finally, it was obvious that the unknown sender was none other than Lilith.\n[Lilith: Hm... Sora and Lana, extremely nice girl by the way, gave me your number to contact you, I wonder what you're doing right now... it's... amazing...]\nShe had only sent one message.\nIn the end, Stark smiled before sending one message to each of them, and soon enough, the replies came.\n[Stark: I'm staying somewhere safe, I'll contact you and come back in a bit, don't worry.]\n[Attached photo.]\nHe took a few pictures of the VIP room by the way, sending it to each of them to show that he was okay.\n[Sora: Alright, you should really come sometime, Lana is extremely nervous after everything.]\nLana was pretty much the only out of the three girls to have not seen Stark all this time, forced to watch through a screen.\n[Stark: I'm fine, you shouldn't be nervous :)]\n[Attached photo.]\n[Lana: STARK?! COME BACK NOW!]\n[Stark: Can't, but soon, I promise, and I'll even give you that reward or whatever once I do.]\nAt the mention of the reward, Lana's face went red.\n[Lana: Alright, but be sure to be back within a week, I wanna see you!]\nAnd finally, Lilith, which probably saw the messages Stark sent from the other two, and also the pictures, instantly send another message.\n[Lilith: Domination Association, huh.]\nStark's eyes widened as he saw that.\n[Stark: You know about them?]\n[Lilith: A little bit, they're nice overall, but the missions they give are batshit insane, so most people quit within their first few months if they don't just die.]\n[Stark: Alright, well, as I said to the other two, I'll come back in a bit, just wait.]\n[Lilith: I'm not worrying, I trust you.]\nAfter all of that was done, and he messaged them back-and-forth for a little bit, Stark finally felt like he needed to rest.\nHe wanted to check the features of his new [Multi-Task Watch], as well as all the panels that appeared when he reached level 150, but exhaustion crept over him, his eyelids growing heavier with each passing second.\nBefore he knew it, he drifted off, sinking into a deep sleep.\nWhen Stark opened his eyes, he wasn't in his room.\nHe was in his mind, but compared to normal, the sight before him was unlike anything he had ever experienced.",

      "content": "Stark awoke slowly, his senses gradually piecing together the strange environment around him.\nAs his vision adjusted, he found himself in a vast, circular space that radiated an otherworldly aura.\nThe air was thick with a kind of holy energy that made his skin tingle.\nIt wasn't just the atmosphere, it was the entire place.\nThe space resembled an ancient temple, the kind you'd expect to see at the start of a game to pick your class.\nPillars surrounded him, towering high into a ceiling that disappeared into a golden glow.\nSoft light illuminated everything, but there were no torches or clear sources of the glow. It was as if the place itself was alive, radiating energy.\nAt the center of the room, Stark stood on a polished marble floor.\n\"What the fuck...\"\nAround him, a red carpet spread out in all directions like the wheel of the [Class Wheel].\nEach path led to a statue, ten in total, arranged in a circle.\nFor a moment, Stark simply stood there, trying to understand where he was.\nHis eyes narrowed as he scanned the room, and finally, he approached one of the statues.\nIt was made of stone but didn't look lifeless.\nCrimson energy pulsed through cracks all over it, but these weren't cracks of destruction.\nInstead, light spilled out from them, as if the statue was barely containing some immense power.\nStark tilted his head, stepping back to take in the full figure.\nThe statue looked just like him.\nIts features were unmistakable—his face, his stance.\nIt had one leg raised, as if mid-step, and its arms were stretched forward.\nStrings ran from its fingers to a heart hovering in front of its chest.\nThe heart wasn't just a shape; it had a smiley face etched into its surface, almost mocking him.\n\"Soul Wielder…?\" Stark muttered, his voice echoing in the temple.\nHe stepped back and turned to another statue.\nThis one also resembled him, but it was different.\nIt wore a priest's outfit, complete with flowing robes and a serene expression.\nIn its hands were two crosses, raised as if in prayer. Golden light leaked out of the cracks on this statue, giving it a holy aura.\nStark's eyes widened. \"The classes…\"\nA panel appeared in front of him to confirm what he thought.\n[Classes Temple]\nEach statue represented one of his classes. The Soul Wielder was clear, and so was the priestly figure, his Exorcist class.\nCurious, Stark walked around, examining the other statues.\nEach one was unique but shared a single theme: they all looked like him.\nThe Succubus statue had horns and a tail, its face twisted in a mischievous grin.\nThe Magus held a staff with a glowing crimson orb at the tip.\nThe Alchemist wore a lab coat, holding two bubbling potions that seemed almost real.\nEach statue pulsed with energy, except for a few.\nStark frowned as he noticed the difference.\nThe statues that represented his current classes—Domination, Alchemist, Exorcist, Soul Wielder, and Incubus—all had cracks glowing with light.\nBut the ones representing classes he didn't have—Magus, Beast Tamer, Assassin, Warrior, and Archer—were untouched.\nThey stood there, solid and silent, with no energy radiating from them.\n\"Something's not right,\" Stark muttered.\nUsually, when he encountered something tied to his classes, his class doppelgängers would appear.\nThey were the mischievous manifestations of his powers, always mocking him or giving cryptic advice.\nBut now? The temple was eerily quiet. Stark realized just how much he'd grown used to their presence.\n\"Guess it's fine,\" he said with a shrug, trying to shake off the unease.\nAs he turned back to the center of the room, a familiar sound rang in his ears.\nDing!\nA notification panel appeared in front of him, its bright light almost blinding in the dim temple.\n[Domination Expansion]\n\"What the…?\" Stark's eyes widened as he read the words.\n[Unlock all of your classes to gain your Domination Expansion.]\n[It will be the most devastating one out of them all.]\n\"How am I supposed to do that?\" Stark groaned.\nHe'd removed Archer, Assassin, and Warrior, thinking they weren't worth it. But now it seemed like a huge mistake.\nIf he couldn't get them all, then did it mean that his [Domination Expansion] would be unachievable?\nIn response, the panel flickered again.\n[You will figure it out in due time, but for now, just live long enough to do it.]\nThe moment the words faded, the temple began to shake.\nCracks formed along the walls, spreading rapidly like spiderwebs.\nOne by one, the statues began to crumble, their glowing energy disappearing into the air.\nStark stepped back as the entire space started to collapse.\n\"...\"\nWithin seconds, the walls, the statues, and even the ceiling vanished, leaving Stark standing in the usual black void.\nOr at least, that's what he thought, because once he looked around, he noticed something: the only thing left was a single door, standing in the distance.\nIt was massive, its surface made of dark, ancient wood. Carved into it were ominous letters that glowed faintly.\n[5 remain.]\n\"Five remain… Are you talking about the apostles? Or the classes?\"\nHe asked the question aloud, but no answer came.\nThe silence was deafening, more unsettling than anything else.\nEven his doppelgängers weren't here to give their usual annoying commentary.\nFor a moment, Stark just stood there, staring at the door.\nThe emptiness around him was oppressive. He couldn't help but miss the chaotic energy his doppelgängers usually brought.\nAt least they made things lively. Now, all he had was the door and its cryptic message.\nWith a sigh, he sat down on the invisible floor.\nThere was no point in rushing. Whatever this place was, it wasn't going to let him leave until he woke up in the real world.\nA new panel appeared in front of him, breaking the silence.\n[You can check your panels in here.]\n\"Wait, really?\" Stark's eyes lit up.\nIf that was true, it meant he could do more than just sit around.\nHe'd never tried accessing his panels while asleep, but this could change everything.\nIf he could train or upgrade his skills in this space, it would be a huge advantage.\nNormally, he used the [Memories Museum] for training in the real world, but this was different.\nGaining hours of practice while his body rested would be game-changing.\nExcited, Stark stood up. \"Panels, come,\" he said, holding out his hand.\nInstantly, a cascade of panels appeared before him, each one representing a different aspect of his progress.\nThere were seven in total—a record for him.\nHe'd gained several new options after reaching level 150, but he hadn't had the chance to fully explore them yet.\nStark grinned. \"Let's see what we've got.\"",

      "content": "The seven panels that Stark could use floated effortlessly around him, their shimmering edges pulsating faintly as if inviting his attention.\nEach panel seemed to hold its own significance, radiating a distinct aura.\nStark studied them for a moment, the flickering lights casting shifting shadows across his face.\nDeciding on a methodical approach, he resolved to tackle them in order: from least important to the most vital.\nReaching out, he grabbed the first panel. With a fluid motion, it zoomed into full view.\nDing!\n[Survey: What are your thoughts on the things happening around this world?]\nStark blinked, momentarily caught off guard by the question.\n\"Oh, the surveys are back,\" he muttered, his voice tinged with both curiosity and unease.\nThe surveys hadn't appeared the previous two times he could get a new class, and their sudden reemergence stirred a nagging feeling of dread within him.\n\"I wonder what the deal with these surveys is...\"\nThere was something unsettling about them, and he couldn't shake the impression that the surveys might be tied to something much darker.\nSomething watching and waiting just beyond his reach.\nStill, Stark resolved to answer it.\n[It's bad.]\n[It's good.]\n[I don't care.]\nThe three options were there, and Stark selected the third.\n[Thanks for your help :).]\nShaking off his apprehension as it disappeared, he moved to the second panel.\nThis one brought a more exciting revelation.\n[You have reached level 150! You can now upgrade your Classifier Rank to Immortal-Rank.]\nStark let out a low whistle, the significance of this milestone settling over him.\nImmortal was the rank right before [Classified], which was considered the highest rank possible by classifiers.\nHis skills would reach level 100 at that time.\n[You can now upgrade your rank and have your skill limit raised to 80]\nYet despite the importance of the breakthrough, Stark had never had the time nor money to go buy a breakthrough stone, since he didn't care about equipment anymore.\nHe felt like it was time to do it though, as he had a ton of skill points to use and there was no better timing than right now.\n\"Those damn [Immortal Breakthrough Stones] though…\" he muttered.\nNot only were they exceptionally rare, but their cost could reach upward of 500 million rher coins.\n\"Maybe I can ask the girls to help,\" he mumbled.\nStark was confident Sora or Lana would gladly assist if he asked. With their help, the stone might finally be within his grasp.\nSatisfied for now, Stark turned to the third panel, which displayed a familiar message:\n[Domination Expansion]\n[Will unlock once all classes have been gained.]\n[Possibly your only chance against him.]\nStark's gaze lingered on the word \"him,\" his jaw tightening.\nIt was an unmistakable reference to the Godless Demon, the shadow looming over everything Stark had faced thus far.\nHe knew the Demon was amassing an army, turning those desperate enough to abandon their humanity into monstrous servants of his will.\nHe saw that happen live with [Follower], and even the dead [Clever] was referred to as a \"Godless Transformation\".\nBut Stark's determination didn't waver.\n\"If I grow strong enough,\" he said quietly, \"then none of them will matter.\"\nResolute, he pushed the thought aside and focused on the next set of panels.\nFour remained, each one holding potential surprises.\nDing!\n[ApostleDex has been updated!]\nStark's eyes lit up as he read the message. \"Finally!\"\nIt meant that he could possibly get new information about the apostles of the third line, like their locations or basic things that could aid him.\nHe planned to go through a complete apostle rush now that he was level 150 and able to kill monsters around level 750.\nOnly a bit more and he would reach the theoretical max level for his class, as well as the one where he would complete the class wheel.\n[You will be able to check out this information once you wake up.]\nThough it seems like something stopped him from checking it out in the void.\n\"It's already a miracle I can do my business here, so I'll take it,\" he grinned.\nMoving on to the top three panels, he selected the next one.\nBut what greeted him was… strange.\n[238 days 20 hours 3 minutes 49 seconds...]\nStark frowned. The timer glowed with a crimson aura, ominous and unrelenting.\n\"A cooldown…?\" he muttered, tilting his head.\nBut to what?\nThere was no answer.\n[238 days 20 hours 3 minutes 17 seconds...]\nThe timer ticked down, its glow pulsing faintly with each second. Stark couldn't help but feel uneasy.\n[You'll get more information later.]\nAnd yet again, he wasn't given everything, probably since he was in this void or too low-leveled.\n\"Maybe it's the Godless Demon's descent...\" he mumbled, theorizing, \"Who knows.\"\nFor now, though, there was nothing he could do but wait.\nShaking off the unsettling feeling, Stark moved on to the second-to-last panel.\n[Level 150 Reached: Please Pick a Card.]\n[Immortal Skill Guaranteed!]\nA wide grin spread across Stark's face.\n\"Now we're talking!\"\nHe had several powerful skills that he had never used, like for example [Limb Sacrifice]and [Revenant's Fury], but it was simply because he didn't need to.\nMaybe soon he would.\n[Revenant's Fury] was already charged up with 3/3 deaths, though it told him before that the conditions were met, but the time wasn't right.\nSo getting a new powerful skill would always be good, no matter what.\nTwenty cards, yes, you heard that right, twenty, appeared around him, each glowing faintly.\n[Each one is different.]\nAnd this time, there was no twist about them all being the same, nope, each skill behind that card could probably make or break Stark's future.\n\"...Heh, who cares,\" he sighed as he instantly grabbed one of the cards, \"If it's bad then nothing I can do.\"\nThe card flipped over, revealing a crude drawing of what appeared to be a bomb: a round object with a fuse sticking out from the top.\n[Skill: Bomb.]\nOh yeah, it definitely was a bomb.\n\"...Bomb?\"\n[Rank: Immortal+]\nHis eyes widened in surprise. It wasn't just an Immortal-rank skill, it was Immortal+, the tier above it!\n\"Wow,\" he murmured, impressed.\nBut then came the catch.\n[Warning: One-time use skill. Don't use it recklessly.]\n\"And of course...\" Stark groaned, \"My luck couldn't be this could, would it.\"\nOne-time use skills were infamous across Rheria for being both rare and frustratingly underwhelming.\nYet something about this skill felt… off.\nThe simplicity of its name, the strange rank, the lack of detail, it all felt deliberately cryptic.\nThe description wasn't much help either.\n[Description: It's a bomb. You take it out and throw it, then the skill disappears.]\n\"Helpful,\" Stark muttered sarcastically.\nStill, he couldn't deny that the skill intrigued him.\nDing!\n[Your next skill will be given at level 175.]\n\"Oh.\"\nThis meant that there were now 25 levels between each skill, and also that between level 150 and 200, he would only be getting two additional skills from leveling up to aid him.\nIt meant that he almost was at the end of his journey.\n\"Well, only one more thing to check out I guess,\" he eyed the last panel, knowing perfectly what it would be.\n[Level 150 Reached!]\n[You can spin the \"Class Wheel\" again!]\nA smirk tugged at the corner of Stark's lips.\nHe had been waiting for this moment.\n\"Class Wheel,\" he called out, and the colorful wheel appeared before him, hovering ahead.\nThough it wasn't as colorful as it was when he started, since there were only 2 options left: Magus and Beast Tamer.\nStark could feel the weight of the decision, even though the outcome wasn't in his hands.\nWould it be [Magus], making him a Grand Mage with countless spells.\nOr would it be [Beast Tamer], granting him a [Domination Pet] or something like that.\nStark stood before the familiar lever, the brass handle gleaming faintly in the void's darkness.\nAbove it were the still the familiar words.\n[Pull me!]\nHe'd pulled this lever countless times before, and every time, it had brought him a new class.\nThis time, however, the stakes felt higher.\nAt his current level, every single skill or perk he could get would be useful for later, meaning that whatever he got, it would be helpful.\n\"Either way, I win,\" Stark said with a confident grin, gripping the lever.\nWith a swift pull, the lever clanged loudly, its sound echoing across the void.\nThe wheel burst to life, spinning with a ferocity that made the air hum.\nIts two remaining segments, one blue for [Magus], the other emerald for [Beast Tamer], blurred into streaks of color as the wheel spun faster and faster.\nSparks flew from its edges, and Stark felt the familiar surge of anticipation coursing through him.\nAfter a while, the wheel began to slow, the segments coming into focus.\nTick. Tick. Tick.\nIt edged past [Beast Tamer], teasing the possibility.\nTick.\nAnd finally, the wheel stopped, the pointer trembling slightly before settling on the blue section.\n[Magus].",

      "content": "Ding!\n[You have unlocked the \"Magus\" Class.]\nThe notification lingered in the air as Stark stood, letting the realization sink in.\nThe wheel had spoken, and the path was chosen: he was now officially a Magus. His sixth class.\nThat meant the last remaining option, [Beast Tamer], was reserved for level 200, the final milestone.\nStark couldn't help but wonder what kind of beast he might have tamed: a terrifying monstrosity, or maybe something unexpectedly adorable.\nA fleeting sense of curiosity tugged at him, but he brushed it aside.\n\"You can't win them all,\" he muttered with a shrug.\nInstead, he focused on his newly unlocked class.\nHe pulled up the details.\n[Magus: Can wield magic and release spells.]\n\"...Huh?\"\nIt was... underwhelming.\nStark's brows furrowed.\nFor any other classifier, the Magus class might have been monumental, a gateway to commanding spells capable of reshaping battlefields.\nBut for Stark, this was redundant.\nIf you don't remember, every domination user's abilities and weapons may be different.\nBut for Stark, his weapons were his [Fists and Magic], and as the latter stated, it meant that he could already use a [Magus]'s magic to begin with.\nGetting this class was in fact not helping at all.\n\"So... what was the point?\" he mumbled, annoyed.\nThen another notification appeared.\n[As this class's power is already granted by Domination, it will be absorbed, offering a boost in power.]\nStark raised an eyebrow, \"Oh yeah, that thing, I guess it could help...\"\nDing!\n[Domination is currently absorbing Magus...]\n[0... 20... 40... 60... 80... 100!]\n[It has been absorbed.]\nThe moment the process completed, Stark felt it, a surge of raw energy coursing through his body.\nHis aura swelled, expanding with a potency that was almost overwhelming.\nIt was like a limiter had broken, releasing a flood of unimaginable strength.\nAnd then, the next notification left him stunned.\nDing!\n[You have been granted the \"Domination Magus\" Passive!]\n[Description: Each skill's damage is now doubled as your aura has become much stronger, the power of a grand mage fusing with yours.]\n\"...?!\"\nHis jaw dropped. \"Damage doubled?!\"\nThis wasn't just good, it was insane.\nEvery single skill he possessed now dealt twice the damage. His already devastating attacks, which could obliterate enemies in seconds, had just been amplified beyond reason.\nStark quickly did the math in his head. \"If I was dealing 5,000,000 damage before... that's 10,000,000 now!\"\nHe clenched his fists, feeling the power radiating from him.\nThe void around him shimmered in response to his rising aura, the very space trembling under the force of his newfound strength.\nThis wasn't just a class, it was an evolution.\nA step closer to becoming an unstoppable force.\n\"And it's a passive...\" he whispered, grinning. \"Always active, no conditions, no cooldowns. Perfect.\"\nAny doubts he had about the Magus class evaporated.\nThis was beyond what he could have hoped for.\nThe fusion of grand magical power into his Domination abilities elevated him to a whole new level.\nThen the void trembled again, signaling his time here was coming to an end.\n[You are about to wake up.]\nStark took one last deep breath, savoring the moment.\n\"Looks like it's time to wake up,\" he said, his grin widening.\nAnd after that a few additional seconds, he suddenly lost consciousness.\nThe last thing he saw in front of his eyes was the door that stated \"4 Remains\".\n\"So it's in fact the classes, heh,\" he mumbled.\nFinally, Stark fell down, hitting the ground of the void.\n...\nAnd mere instants later, Stark's eyes snapped open in the real world.\nHe sat up abruptly, the lingering rush of power from the void still buzzing faintly in his veins.\nShaking off the haze, he instinctively reached for his phone on the small table beside him.\nThe screen lit up, and immediately a flood of notifications bombarded him.\nDing! Ding! Ding!\nHis brow furrowed as he scrolled through countless missed calls and messages.\n[Lana: Where are you?! It's been a week!]\n[Sora: Take your time.\n[Lilith: They told me that you do that often, it's quite surprising.]\n\"A week?\" he sighed, knowing perfectly what it meant.\nSwiping to his clock app confirmed it, seven full days had passed since he entered the void.\nIt had felt like only an hour at most yet here he was.\nHe kept scrolling.\n[Sora: Just call me when you wake up or are available.]\nSora seemed to be the only reasonable one.\nAnd so, without hesitating, he dialed her number.\nThe phone rang twice before Sora picked up, her voice calm.\nIn the background, he could hear Lana and Lilith suddenly get up and shout \"who's that\" or \"Is it Stark?!\"\n\"Stark,\" Sora spoke first, \"Let me guess, sleep?\"\n\"...\" Stark smiled, she knew him well, \"Yeah, I guess so.\"\nThere was a pause. When she spoke again, Sora's voice had softened slightly.\n\"It's fine, the other two are right next to me, they seem... mad, though, I'll explain everything to them.\"\n\"Thanks Sora,\" he was grateful to Sora for always keeping her composure, as having three people scream at him would have probably angered him more than anything, \"I'll try to come today or tomorrow for sure.\"\nEnding the call, he tossed the phone onto the bed and exhaled.\nSeven days gone. His newfound power from absorbing the Magus class still thrummed beneath the surface.\nHe stood, stretching briefly.\nHe will still in the Domination Association's VIP room, so it was confusing why Ed or the commanders didn't try to wake him up.\n\"Looks like I've got some explaining to do,\" he muttered before heading for the door.\nAs Stark reached for the door, a screen descended from the ceiling, hovering just inches in front of him.\nThe sudden motion made him pause, and the screen lit up with a familiar face.\nIt was Ed, the Domination Association's tech expert and occasional nuisance.\n\"Yo, kid,\" Ed greeted with his usual nonchalant grin. \"You've been sleeping for a while, probably from the trial and stuff.\nDon't worry, me and the others are handling things for now. But in the meantime, check out your new toy, your [Multi-Task Watch].\nYou'll be able to connect with us and do all sorts of cool stuff with it.\"\nThe screen flickered off as quickly as it had appeared, leaving Stark staring at the empty space where it had been.\n\"Hm... I guess it was pretty cool...\" Stark muttered, shaking his head.\nStill, curiosity got the better of him.\nReaching into his [Spatial Inventory], he pulled out the sleek, high-tech watch.\nIt gleamed faintly, its design futuristic yet practical, with a smooth black band and a holographic interface visible on the surface.\nHe tapped the screen, expecting it to light up. Yet nothing happened.\nFrowning, he tried again, but a panel suddenly appeared before him:\n[Multi-Task Watch needs to link with your aura to activate.]\n\"Figures,\" Stark sighed.\nWithout hesitation, he slid the watch onto his wrist.\nThe moment it clicked into place, a faint hum resonated through the device, syncing with his aura.\nA soft glow spread across the screen, and intricate symbols lit up as it activated.\n\"Let's see what's so good about it,\" he murmured, flexing his wrist as the watch displayed its boot-up sequence.",

      "content": "The Multi-Task Watch lights up.\n[Do you want the tutorial on how to use it?]\n\"...\" Stark looked at the panel for a few seconds before declining, \"I'm a fast learner, I think.\"\n[Are you sure, most people don't know how to use it once getting it.]\n\"Yeah, I'm sure.\"\n[Alright.]\nThe watch opened up, revealing that it didn't work like a phone, where you needed to look at a screen. Instead, like Stark had seen with Oliver, it projected a holographic display.\nLooking up, Stark saw the main menu, which displayed seven applications: Contact, Missions, Domination Association News, Alerts, Market, Internet, and Info.\nThe first app he explored was Contact.\nIt already had the contacts of every commander in the association preloaded.\n[I made sure to add us all to your contact app, as usually you would have to befriend a member and exchange contacts to be able to communicate, though it's much easier than a phone!]\nEd left a note that popped up the moment Stark opened the app for the first time.\n\"So I guess even when you decline, the tutorial's still here...\" Stark mumbled.\nHe had no messages from anybody, though Alexis, Oliver, Tia, Unity and Ed were all present, and he was able to message them.\nThe app worked exactly like a normal messaging platform on a phone, except now it was conveniently on his watch.\n[You can also add other people you know outside of the Domination Assocation,] another notification appeared.\nThis already felt like a significant improvement over a phone. It was much easier to carry around and could even be used during battles without any hassle.\nNext, Stark checked out Missions.\nHowever, all that greeted him was a simple message:\n[You haven't been given any missions. Maybe later...]\n\"Huh.\"\n\"Huh.\" He wasn't planning on using it for now anyway, so he quickly moved on.\nThe third app, Domination Association News, caught his attention.\nIt functioned like a news outlet, delivering updates about the association's activities to all its members.\nThe top headline, published a week ago, read: [All Transformed Immortal-Level Participants have been taken care of.]\nThese were not articles with dozens of pages of text for no reason, they were straight and to the point, used to give information to the busy members of the association.\nA few other headlines caught Stark's eye:\n[Third Domination Trial: \"Termina,\" which is from the death-difficulty, is being broadcasted. Information on the participants has been released. Please be cautious!]\n[Massive unknown attack on Fellarburg recently. Our team handled it before it became a national issue, but a cryptic message was left: \"1 year before the descent of the demon.\" Be careful.]\nIt seemed the association had a firm grip on handling the threats surrounding the Domination Class and the hidden dangers lurking in the shadows of this world.\n\"Is there only one association...?\" Stark wondered aloud.\nIt would make sense if there were more associations in other countries., each managing their own area.\nAfter all, guilds and similar organizations usually operated with multiple headquarters for maximum efficiency and influence.\nAlternatively, the association might be so short-staffed that there was only one central organization.\n\"I'll have to ask...\" he mumbled before moving to the 4th app.\n[Alerts]\n[This app is primarily used for emergencies. If it triggers, you'll know it's a problem that could affect the nation, if not the entire world. For smaller tasks, you'll simply receive a notification from Missions.]\n[Even if your watch is turned off, the holographic panel will still appear, accompanied by a buzzing sound, to ensure you're informed of an alert!]\n\"...Alright,\" for now, the app couldn't be opened, though.\n[You can only open it upon receiving an alert, otherwise it is locked.]\nA lock symbol was displayed on the app icon.\nEach app had its own distinct icon design, much like apps on a phone.\nContact was represented by a text bubble, Missions featured a notepad labeled \"mission,\" Domination Association News was symbolized by an animated eye that darted around as if observing everything, and Alert was marked by a megaphone.\n\"Alright, next application...\"\nHe moved on to Market, which was represented by a shopping cart.\nOpening it revealed something extraordinary: a massive virtual marketplace containing items from all across Rheria.\nEven those outside of [Fellarburg], you could find anything.\nWhether it was food, furniture, essentials and even weapons, there was everything.\nThere was even a small search bar where you could type in whatever you wanted, and it would immediately show up all results.\nThis was next-level technology.\n[Once you purchase an item—with your own money, of course—the amount will automatically be deducted from your account, and the item will use spatial travel to reach you within the hour.]\n[For furniture, you'll need to confirm the teleportation location, so it might take a little longer. But for most items like weapons, potions, and equipment, the delivery will always take around an hour.]\nThis was insanity.\nInstinctively, Stark searched up an [Immortal Breakthrough Stone], and of course, results appeared for every country.\n[Fellarburg - Immortal Breakthrough Stone - 500,000,000 rher coins]\n[Lampod - Immortal Breakthrough Stone - 510,000,000 rher coins]\n[Braemont - Immortal Breakthrough Stone - 497,000,000 rher coins]\nHe could even compare the prices and select the best deal!\n[This shopping method has been approved by the leaders of the respective associations, so you won't face any issues.]\nIf the general public had access to this app, it would revolutionize commerce entirely. But of course, it was exclusive to Domination Association members.\nStark clicked on the Braemont listing, as it was the cheapest.\nBeep!\n[You do not have the funds to make this purchase.]\n\"Of course...\" Stark sighed, though he smiled. \"Well, I'll keep that in mind.\"\n[Note: You cannot sell your items through this platform.]\n\"Yeah, yeah, makes sense.\"\nThe sixth app was Internet.\nWell, this one was self-explanatory, and Ed only included it so that members of the association could fully utilize their watches instead of phones.\nWith the internet and even videos on, there was no need to use your phone anymore, most of the members dropping their previous ones or even breaking them.\nFinally, Stark opened the last app, Info.\nHowever, a pop-up message immediately appeared:\n[You may have the authority of a commander, but you are not allowed to open this app.]\nThe app locked itself, much like Alerts.\n\"Huh. I guess that's fine, then,\" Stark shrugged, slightly confused.\nAfter exploring all the apps, Stark realized just how ingenious the Multi-Task Watch truly was.\nIt was far more practical and versatile than any phone, and Stark already knew he would be using it regularly moving forward.",

      "content": "After dealing with the [Multi-Task Watch] and discovering its new abilities, the first thing Stark tried was to remove it.\nUnfortunately though...\n[This device is used to send your location to all others in case of danger, please do not remove it.]\n\"Hm.\"\nRegardless, he still tried.\nZAP!\n-10,000!\n\"Holy shit?!\"\n[Don't. Remove. It.]\n\"...\"\nIf he wanted to do that, he would have to cut off his right arm.\nAnd he didn't feel like it doing that for now, especially with everything that was bound to happen.\nSo in the end, Stark decided to enjoy the privilege of this thing.\nHe left his [VIP Room], and the exact moment he did... he saw a familiar figure.\n\"Oh, if it's not the Stark, the man, the legend!\"\n\"...\"\nRemember that guy back then that tried to recruit Stark to the association?\nWell, that was him.\nHis name was Juan, and unlike last time, he wasn't accompanied by the members of his little group.\nThough right now, Stark didn't need to worry, as he was much stronger than Juan.\n\"We meet again,\" Stark sighed, his expression neutral, \"Why do you wanna talk to me?\"\n\"Nothing much,\" Juan's grin widened, \"It was nice to see you.\"\nOther than that, Juan walked away, putting his watch on the scanner, one of the vip rooms opening, meaning that he was probably an important person.\n\"Oh, and by the way,\" Juan stopped before entering, \"People call you the [Chosen One] as an actual nickname now, enjoy!\"\nWith that, Juan entered his room and the door closed automatically behind him.\n\"Chosen One...\" Stark mumbled, \"Doesn't sound too bad,\" he smiled.\nWhile walking in the corridors, lost as he didn't really know where he was going as the place was too big, he saw dozens of other domination users.\nThey all stopped what they were doing, looking at him with cautious eyes.\nThe identity of Stark was known by the entire world at this point, many guilds probably trying their hardest to reach out to him.\nHe was regarded as one of the strongest there were in this world, especially with all the cinematic stuff that happened in the trial, as well as everything he was able to tank.\nBut even then... Stark didn't feel that good.\nHe didn't know why, but the constant feeling of dread that he always had intensified.\nPeople both admired and were scared of him.\nSomeone that can wield a soul heart, magic, has fists that can deal more than 2,000,000 damage per punch, and had the ability to revive, was someone that shouldn't be interacted with.\nEventually, while wandering around the place, he received a notification on his watch.\n[Ed: Looks like you're awake, please come to the commander's meeting room from before, we're hosting one right now regarding future missions.]\n[Stark: Where is it.]\n[Ed: Huh? I mean, just ask the watch, it will guide you, it has many functionalities not specifically said, you know?]\nStark looked at the thing around his wrist.\n\"Guide me to the commander's meeting room.\"\nDing!\n[You have the authority level to do that, guiding.]\nA holographic arrow appeared before his eyes, strangely resembling the one that he got back when he was trying to find [Sierra's Death Path], you know, the one he got from Arthur.\nStark followed the holographic arrow, watching as it hovered in the air before him.\nIt guided him through the sprawling corridors of the Domination Association's headquarters.\nThe place was massive, with halls that seemed to stretch endlessly, punctuated by towering doors and reinforced walls.\nOther users glanced at him as he passed, their expressions wary. Murmurs followed in his wake.\n\"That's him…\"\n\"Be careful. He's insane!\"\nStark ignored them.\nEventually, the arrow led him to a grand double door, embossed with intricate patterns resembling the flow of magic and energy.\nThe doors opened automatically as he approached, revealing a large, oval table surrounded by the high-ranking commanders.\nAmong them were familiar faces: Ed, seated near the center with his usual grin; Oliver, arms crossed, radiating calm authority; Unity, Alexis and Tia.\nStark stepped in, scanning the room before walking to the far end of the table.\n\"Sit down, we put a chair for you,\" Ed smiled.\n\"...\"\nStark didn't like that, but he would rather sit than stand.\nHe pulled out the chair, the sound cutting through the tense atmosphere, and sat down.\nThe room fell silent, all eyes on him.\nStark leaned back slightly, his expression unreadable. \"What's up?\"\nOliver was the one to speak for, his expression just as grim as everyone else's.\n\"Boy,\" he called out to Stark.\n\"...\" Stark didn't answer, instead, he looked down at his own palm, his crimson aura dancing around it.\n\"Remember those tasks that I said were 'impossible', meaning that most people, even us, didn't want to take?\"\n\"Not really.\"\n\"Well...\" Oliver sighed, snapping his fingers, and suddenly, Stark's [Multi-Task Watch] lit up.\nDing!\n[You have received three Impossible-Rank missions!]\n\"Deal with them.\"\n\"...\"\nStark almost wanted to summon [Heaven's Spear] to deal with them all, but he stopped himself.\nThe audacity was insane.\nEd leaned forward, his grin softening into something more serious.\n\"We call them [Impossible-Rank Missions] because no one is willing to take them, everyone who tried never returned.\"\nOliver gestured, and a holographic map appeared over the table, displaying three distinct markers spread across Rheria.\nEach pulsed ominously, radiating a deep crimson hue.\nStark's bored expression didn't change. \"Still not interested.\"\nHe had apostles to take care of, and he wanted to do it before that timer reached zero, as he feared it could be linked to the godless demon's descent.\nIf a single apostle remained by then, they would possibly control an army big enough to wipe out the entirety of humanity.\nWhy was Stark the only one to deal with them? That is the question many may wonder if they looked back at everything.\nWell...\n\"There's an apostle at each of these locations,\" Oliver revealed out of nowhere.\nAnd the moment he did that, Stark's eyes widened.\n\"Do you people know how dangerous the apostles are?\" he asked, his expression darkening.\n\"Yeah.\"\nAll of them nodded, and Stark's rage grew a little more.\n\"You people know they can wipe out countries, right?\"\n\"...\"\nNo one answered except for Oliver.\n\"We don't care, kid, they're linked to us and this world, so we need them out,\" the leader of the Domination Association stared at Stark in the eyes, his gaze unwavering, \"We want you to deal with them.\"\n\"If you want them out so much, then about... I don't know... killing them yourself?\"\n\"We can't.\"\n\"How so?\" Stark's smile widened, raising his eyebrows.\nIf each of these people were supposedly stronger than he was, then what was stopping them?\nOliver with his domination expansion could probably deal with all five remaining apostles, or at least the first three of the fifth line.\n\"We can't,\" Ed repeated the same words, snapping his fingers.\nA holographic screen appeared in the middle of the table, everyone able to see it.\nAnd then...\nBzzzt...\nThe video began playing.\nIt showed a mysterious portal.\nDark, swirling energy pulling at the very air around it. Oliver and the commanders were there, standing before it, preparing to enter.\nBut just as Oliver stepped forward...\n[Conditions not met. Access denied.]\n[Bring the Chosen One.]\nStark's smirk faded slightly.\nThe screen glitched faintly as the message repeated, locking them out.\nIt was clear: no matter how strong or skilled they were, the portal refused their entry.\n\"I don't get it,\" Stark said flatly. \"If something's blocking you, then why the hell did you say nobody comes back alive?\"\n\"Just watch,\" Oliver said quietly.\nThe video continued.\nAs the commanders hesitated whether to return back or not, the ground beneath them began to shift.\nA low rumble echoed through the surroundings, and the skies above turned an unnatural crimson.\nThen, without warning...\nDrip… drip…\nBlood. It began to rain blood.\n\"What the hell…?\" Stark whispered as even the Oliver on-screen tensed, his face betraying a rare glimpse of shock.\nThen it hit, the overwhelming aura.\nEven through the screen, Stark felt it: an oppressive, suffocating energy that sent chills through his core. It was familiar. Too familiar.\n'Godless Demon…' Stark's eyes widened.\nOn the video, the air cracked and warped.\nSlowly, a massive figure emerged, a silhouette that dwarfed everything in sight, its size rivaling even the [Angel of the Spear].\nThe creature's form was shrouded in shadow, its aura blotting out the very light.\nThe commanders froze, terror written across their faces. Even Oliver stood still, unable to react to the sheer power radiating before him.\n\"Another bunch of boring fools,\" the Godless Demon's voice rumbled through the screen, deep and guttural, as though reality itself trembled from its words. \"Goodbye.\"\nThe figure raised its colossal arm, its massive hand casting a shadow that seemed to engulf everything.\nJust as the hand began to descend, Ed on-screen suddenly sprang into action.\nHe activated a small device on his wrist, a teleportation gadget, just in time.\nThe video ended abruptly as the commanders vanished, narrowly escaping annihilation.\nSilence settled over the room.\nOliver's expression turned grim. \"Now you understand. Everyone who went before us likely met the same fate. After encountering that… we gave these missions the [Impossible] rating. No one should go there anymore.\"\nStark exhaled through his nose, his gaze unreadable. \"Why me, then?\" He smiled faintly, though he already knew the answer.\nEd leaned back in his chair, shrugging nonchalantly. \"Well, because your ID literally says Chosen One, duh.\"",

It was as if a weight had been lifted, even if temporarily.\n\"But,\" Stark raised a single finger, his expression turning sly, \"In exchange for completing a mission, I want one request granted to me for every mission I complete. It won't be much, I promise.\"\nThe commanders paused, exchanging glances.\nThree missions, three requests. It was bold of him, but considering the circumstances, they didn't have much of a choice.\n\"Deal,\" Oliver said without hesitation, his deep voice cutting through the silence like a blade.\nHe leaned forward slightly, resting his arms on the table. \"Tell us the first one.\"\nStark grinned, his crimson eyes glowing faintly. \"I want an Immortal Breakthrough Stone. Like, right now.\"\nThere was a collective murmur of surprise around the table.\nAll eyes turned toward Ed, the Domi-Mechanician, who only grinned lazily, seemingly unbothered by the request.\n\"You're in luck,\" Ed said, his voice holding that casual confidence only he could pull off. \"I've got a few in my storage.\"\nHe tapped one of the many small gadgets strapped to his arm.\nA faint hum filled the air as a small, shimmering blue portal materialized beside him.\nMoments later, an Immortal Breakthrough Stone emerged from within and fell to the ground, glowing faintly with ethereal energy.\nWithout missing a beat, Ed pointed another gadget at the stone.\nA holographic hand appeared, grasping it gently and guiding it across the table until it landed in Stark's waiting hands.\nStark inspected it carefully, his eyes narrowing as he confirmed its authenticity.\n[Immortal Breakthrough Stone]\n[Used to reach the \"Immortal\" level and upgrade your skill limit to 80.]\nSatisfied, he took a deep breath, the room falling silent as he placed his hand over the stone.\nCrimson aura surged from his palm, pouring into the artifact.\nStark's muscles tensed as a searing energy coursed through him, every nerve screaming for release.\nHe gritted his teeth, his body trembling slightly under the strain.\n'Damn.'\nThe first [Breakthrough Stones] were light work, but it seemed like the further you went, the harder it became.\nStay calm, he told himself, Stay calm, or you'll deactivate it and lose levels…\nThe pressure built to a crescendo, but Stark held on.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, though it was only a handful of seconds, the stone dissolved into light, absorbed fully into his body.\n[You have reached the \"Immortal\" level, and all of your skills' limit has been raised to 80.]\nStark exhaled slowly, his crimson aura now radiating with an even greater intensity.\nHis power had grown, and the difference was undeniable.\nHe turned his attention back to the commanders, raising two fingers this time.\n\"Second request,\" he said smoothly, \"I want the freedom to leave the association whenever I want, or at least the ability to go to the capital.\"\nTia rolled her eyes, leaning back in her chair with an exaggerated groan. \"To meet with your three girlfriends, huh?\"\n\"Precisely,\" and Stark didn't feel like refuting the claims, so he simply agreed.\nOliver didn't argue. He simply nodded and turned his gaze toward Ed once again. \"Granted.\"\n'Does Ed do everything around this place?' Stark thought to himself, watching the Domi-Mechanician fiddle with his gadgets once more.\nIt was becoming clear that Ed wasn't just some eccentric engineer, he was, in many ways, the backbone of the entire operation.\nWithout his tools and inventions, the Domination Association might have crumbled long ago.\n\"As for the third request...\" Stark paused, closing his eyes.\nThe room seemed to hold its breath, waiting for his next demand.\nAfter a moment, he opened his eyes again, a faint smirk on his lips. \"I'll keep it for later.\"\nOliver sighed heavily, \"Alright, kid. I hope you can handle those missions. If you somehow come back alive, we'll see about rewarding you further.\"\nStark got up from his chair, stretching slightly.\n\"I'll take care of it,\" he said casually, turning to leave, heading toward the [Teleportation Room].\nHe remembered seeing a portal that directly led to Fellaburg's Capital, after all.\nAll of the commanders watched as he exited the room, his footsteps echoing in the silent chamber.\nOnce Stark was gone, the room remained quiet for a moment longer before Tia spoke up.\n\"That kid's dead,\" she said bluntly, crossing her arms. \"No way he's coming back from even one of those missions.\"\n\"I agree,\" Alexis added, his voice colder and more analytical. \"We've seen the apostles' power firsthand. Even with Stark's growth, his odds are slim to none, plus, what if that thing shows up as he wasn't the [Chosen One] or whatever.\"\nUnity remained silent, her expression neutral.\nOliver, who had been staring at the door Stark had walked through, shook his head.\n\"No,\" he said firmly, surprising everyone at the table. \"That kid's winning for sure.\"\nThe room fell silent once more as the others turned to look at him.\nOliver leaned back in his chair, his arms crossed.\n\"I've fought with enough people to know when someone's got what it takes. That kid… Stark isn't like anyone else. He'll win. I'm sure of it.\"\nFor Oliver, someone who had seen countless warriors rise and fall over the years, to say something like that was rare. The others exchanged uneasy glances but said nothing.\nMeanwhile, Stark had made his way to the Teleportation Room.\nThe vast chamber was filled with shimmering platforms and glowing runes carved into the ground.\nHe stepped into the platform that said [Fellarburg], feeling a slight hum of energy beneath his feet.\n\"Capital,\" he said simply, and the runes beneath him flared brightly.\nIn an instant, Stark was enveloped in light.\nWhen the glow faded, he found himself standing outside in the middle of the street, or more like, what remained of it since Follower's rampage.\nIt seemed like a ton of it was already repaired, some buildings back on business and some classifiers even there to witness the chaos.\nStark ignored the stares and whispers of passersby as he made his way through the city.\nHe passed by the familiar gates of the Rift Conqueror's Academy, where he had once been completing these randoms quests.\n'Oh yeah, the second year is supposed to start soon, need to figure things out,' he mumbled.\nIt felt like a lifetime ago now, though it had only been months.\nPushing those thoughts aside, he continued his journey until he finally reached his apartment building.\nStark climbed the stairs to the third floor, his footsteps light as he reached his door.\nHe took out the key from his [Spatial Inventory], and opened it.\nThe first thing he saw was Sora, standing in the center of the room with her arms crossed.\nHer bright blue eyes narrowed immediately, widening.\n\"Stark...?\" she mumbled.\nBefore Stark could reply, Lana appeared from the kitchen, a small smile on her face.\n\"You're back!\" she said cheerfully, her golden hair tied back in a loose ponytail as she jumped to hug him.\nAnd then there was Lilith, lounging on the couch with her legs crossed.\nShe looked up at him with a smirk. \"Look who finally decided to show up.\"\nHe didn't know Lilith as much as the other two, though the battle reinforced their relationship, so it was normal she was the less shocked.\nStark paused for a moment, taking in the sight of all three of them.\nIt was the first time in a while he'd felt a genuine sense of calm, like he was home again, even if only for a little while.\n\"Yeah, I'm back,\" Stark said, closing the door behind him.\n[Not for long though... :)]\n[Get. To. Work.]",

      "content": "\"Starrrkkkk! I missed you so much~!\"\nBefore Stark could react, Lana tackled him in a full-force hug, her arms wrapping tightly around his waist.\nHer golden hair bounced as she buried her face into his chest, her muffled cries of joy echoing through the small apartment.\nStark sighed, patting her head lightly as she clung to him like a child reunited with their favorite toy.\n\"Alright, alright,\" Stark muttered, though the corner of his mouth curled into a small smile. \"I'm back, calm down.\"\n\"You don't understand!\" Lana whined, lifting her head to look at him, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. \"It's been so long! A few weeks!\"\n\"A few weeks isn't exactly an eternity,\" Stark replied, though he let her stay latched onto him a little longer.\nLilith, sitting on the couch, rolled her eyes, though she smirked at the scene. \"Still as dramatic as ever, huh, Lana?\"\nSora nodded.\nOnce Lana's theatrics calmed down, everything slowly settled back to normal, or as normal as things could be when Stark was involved.\nThe four of them lounged around the apartment, chatting like no time had passed at all.\nIt was unique as Lilith was a new addition to their small group, but it seemed like Lana and Sora didn't care that much.\nThe girls even explained to Stark what had happened during the time he was asleep, which was one week.\nBasically, the world went crazy after the trial, everyone both cheering and hating on Stark, one side thinking he is the savior, while the other thinking he is the cause of all of this.\nBut to be honest, Stark already expected this, so he didn't mind.\n\"And uh…\" Lana's voice faltered suddenly, and her cheeks turned a deep shade of red.\nShe fiddled with the hem of her sweater, avoiding Stark's gaze. \"One more thing happened.\"\nStark tilted his head slightly. \"…Hm?\"\nThe room went quiet.\n\"Well…\" Lana began hesitantly, her voice small. \"It's about my dad...\"\nStark raised an eyebrow. \"What about him?\"\n[Oh, boy, here we go :)]\nLana's blush deepened. \"He, uh… announced something. On public TV.\"\nAfter lots of stuttering, with Lilith finding Lana's speech hilarious, Stark understood the whole picture.\nArthur Moonless, that bastard, took advantage of his relationship with Lana to announce to the entire world that Stark was his son-in-law.\nOr, more like, he said that he was Lana's fiancé.\n\"...Ok?\" Stark raised his eyebrows, \"Is that all?\"\n\"Yeah, you're not angry?\"\nTo be honest, it was a bit annoying, but... Stark didn't feel a thing.\nHis mind was too pre-occupied with the missions he was given, and he wanted to check the [Missions] app as well as the [ApostleDex].\nHe didn't want to admit it, but even though he finally met the girls in such a calm setting after so long, he kept glancing at the exit door.\n[Get. Out.]\n[You have work to do.]\n[Don't slack off.]\nSuch panels would constantly appear and disappear from his vision.\nEven he... felt like something was missing.\nWas it the thrill of fighting for his life, or maybe he just felt like having a calm life after all the threats and intense stuff was dull.\n\"That's okay, it's not like he lied,\" Stark simply mumbled to the news as he got up, \"I don't mind.\"\n\"...\" Lana's face almost exploded, it was now almost as red as Stark's aura, \"R-Really?\" her eyes were sparkling, and she was smiling so much it became scary.\nSeeing that Lana got all the attention, though, Sora also reached for Stark's sleeve.\nHer face was as neutral as ever, and without even being embarrassed, she simply asked, \"What about me?\"\n\"Is polygamy even allowed in this country?\"\n\"Yes it is,\" Sora replied without hesitation.\n\"Then it's fine, I guess...\"\n[Who cares about that. Go complete those missions.]\n[You'll play with them later :)]\nHis classes seemed to really pressure him to get rid of the apostles now that he had a way to know where they were.\n\"Three's always better than two, you know,\" Lilith winked too, she was as playful as always, though Stark noticed her face grew a little redder.\n\"...I'll think about it.\"\nHe didn't know how this would play out, but it would be fine as long as he made sure that the girls agreed and were friendly with one another.\nAnd so just like that... a week passed.\nStark didn't spend his time doing anything but enjoying it with Lilith, Lana and Sora.\nThey went out, spoke together, and had fun.\nEveryone would recognize Stark immediately, though, which made things quite difficult.\n\"You're so famous~\" Lana grinned, \"Don't go doing anything with anyone else but us, though, right, I would get very mad!\"\n\"...Sure.\"\nYet even then.\nEven though Stark could feel that he was enjoying himself... he could never get the feeling of dread out of his head.\nIn his vision, the panels that mocked him for enjoying himself kept appearing.\n[Are you serious?]\n[Chosen One, my ass.]\n[Do something!]\nAnd in addition to that, the classes figure appeared again, though this time, it didn't speak.\nIt simply would appear around him and stare until he moved.\nStark couldn't enjoy himself, no matter what, that's what the world was saying.\nLilith, Lana and Even Sora looked very happy, even though the latter didn't let it out, and yet... he was the only one that really wasn't.\nHe wanted to be happy with them, but when you have these panels, the constants visions of the Godless Demon and his apostles, as well as the classes figure, how could he do that.\nAt the end of the week, Lana initiated intimacy while both Sora and Lilith were present.\nShe knew she couldn't avoid them, so she would rather accept them in their lives instead.\nShe started off wrong with Sora, but slowly she became a friend of hers.\nAnd Lilith was easier to interact with as she was just playful, matching Lana's personality and making her laugh.\nSo of course, if Lana tried to do it with these two present, it means she was fine with them joining.\nAnd so for the first time, they did.\nHe didn't know if it was because of his increased endurance or because of the [Incubus] class, but Stark was... much better than before.\nIt was Sora's and Lilith's first times too, so he tried his hardest to make it go smoothly.\nAnd it did in the general sense, at least for the girls.\nHe realized that the only time Sora wasn't emotionless was during intimacy, too, which was a weird contrast.\nAnd Lilith was surprisingly submissive, even though she was pretty playful and dominant in the real world.\nYet... even through all of that...\nWhile the three girls were enjoying themselves, he was the only one sweating, his pupils burning and the vortex of aura in his eyes intensifying.\nIt wasn't that it wasn't pleasurable.\nInstead... once he looked to his left...\n[Are you having fun?]\nThe classes figure's face was right in front of his, their noses almost touching, and the vortex of colorful aura in its eyes more powerful than Stark's.\n[Do you... enjoy yourself?]\n[Or maybe...]\n[...No, it doesn't matter.]\n\"...\"\n[Deal with them.]\nHe still pushed through until morning regardless, but that memory stuck with him.\nAnd now he knew something for certain: he needed to deal with those three missions and the apostles inside them.\nOtherwise... he wouldn't be able to keep going like this.",

      "content": "Once morning came, Stark was the only one still awake.\nHe had been intimate with the three girls all night long, yet he wasn't tired.\nInstead, his mind was clouded with the memories of the classes' figures words: \"Get the job done\".\nHe looked back at the bed, Lana, Sora and Lilith lying there, peacefully resting.\n\"Well, I think it's better to go now,\" he mumbled, \"I'll just send them a message or something.\"\nIf he wanted to complete those three missions, he would need to do it quick while he could.\n[224 days 14 hours 52 minutes 28 seconds...]\nThe timer was still ticking down, too.\nHe went to the kitchen, then ate a bowl of cereal before finally making his choice.\n\"Alright, I'm ready, classes.\"\nWhen he uttered those words, the classes figure appeared before him, finally smiling for the first time.\n[Good, Chosen One.]\n[Let's get rid of these assholes, then we can do whatever we want.]\n\"That's right.\"\nBut first, Stark opened up his [ApostleDex], since he wanted to check out the information he hadn't for a week.\nHe was so busy trying to enjoy himself every second that he had tried to not do anything related to the classes, his [Multi-Task Watch] or the [Domination Association].\nBut now he couldn't run anymore.\n\"ApostleDex, open up.\"\nDing!\nThe crimson panel with the 15 squares appeared before him.\nAll squares of the first two lines were now crossed out, as every apostle there was killed, meaning that only the final line remained.\n[Information on the third line is available.]\n\"Yeah, show it to me.\"\nOut of the 5 squares, four of their figures were darkened, meaning it was impossible for Stark to know what they looked like as he had never seen them.\nOnly one was visible: the [Great Serpent] he had met on the [Sunken Bridge], looking as terrifying as ever.\nAnd of course, the two eyes that probably belonged to the [Godless Demon] were still there.\n[5 remain.]\n[Here's your information on them!]\n\"Yeah, give it to me,\" these things would tell him about their location, so it was all good as it would greatly help.\nDing! Ding! Ding!\n...\n[Line 3, Apostle 1]\n[Name: ???]\n[Level: ???]\n[Location Hint: Domination Association's first \"Impossible-Rank\" mission.]\n...\n\"Damn, as expected,\" Stark sighed.\nLooks like they truly hadn't lied to him about the fact that there were apostles in there.\nAnd the fact the Godless Demon, though he wasn't at his full power, was protecting the portals linked to them was probably to only allow him to enter.\nGodless wanted to see Stark die in the hands of his apostles.\nAnd even if they did die, it didn't matter to him.\nFor in the end, he could always do something very precise to revive them all to continue the chaos.\nStark would never be able to kill him, as that would mean reaching the Godless Demon's level in less than a year.\nFor now, all of this was but a show to the most powerful monster in this world.\n...\n[Line 3, Apostle 2]\n[Name: Great Serpent]\n[Level: 820 - Universal Rank]\n[Location Hint: Domination Association's second \"Impossible-Rank\" mission.]\n...\nHe already knew about this one, so it wasn't news or surprising.\nBut the fact that the second apostle of the third line was already this powerful, and at the [Universal Rank], meant that the ones beyond it would be even more terrifying.\nThere was only one rank beyond [Universal], and it was the [Divine] one, probably reserved for the last apostle and the [Godless Demon] himself.\n...\n[Line 3, Apostle 3]\n[Name: ???]\n[Level: ???]\n[Location Hint: Domination Association's third \"Impossible-Rank\" mission.]\n...\n\"Damn, they REALLY weren't kidding.\"\nThe first three apostles of the last line were ALL inside of one of the missions issued to him.\nThis made things infinitely easier, and with the association's help, he would be able to teleport there without having to find it himself.\nEven with the locations given to him the previous times, some places would still remain unknown.\nThis happened with the [Colosseum] from before, until he eventually realized it was one of the academy's task.\nBut now, there was no \"unknown\", he already had everything he needed.\nExcept maybe... strength.\nStark clenched his fist, looking at it as burned with aura.\n\"No... I'll grow stronger, for sure.\"\nHe still had [258] skill points that he could assign, as well as ask the association to give him some skill stones or something to upgrade them all.\n\"Anyway,\" Stark shook his head as he stared at the final two squares.\nThese two let out an ominous aura, much more powerful than any of the others ones.\nIt was also the apostles he didn't know about, since they wouldn't be in the missions.\n\"Here goes nothing,\" he breathed in as he checked it out.\n...\n[Line 3, Apostle 4]\n[Name: ???]\n[Level: ???]\n[Location Hint: The Final Domination Trial]\n...\n[Line 3, Apostle 5]\n[Name: ???]\n[Level: ???]\n[Location Hint: The Final Domination Trial]\n...\n\"!!!\" Stark's eyes widened so much at the sight that he almost woke up the girls.\nThe... final domination trial?!\nThere's another one!?\nThis is insane! How was this possible!\nWasn't Oliver level 200 himself? Wasn't he at the peak yet didn't have any sort of trial?\nOr maybe... it was exclusive to him?\nDing!\nAnother panel appeared at that moment.\n[The Final Domination is reserved only for the Chosen One, meaning that he will be alone.]\nThis meant no participant killing games: it was simply Stark against the monsters.\nStark against the two apostles, alone.\nThis was all the info he was given about the trial, and though he would have liked more of it, it was still more than enough for him to understand.\n\"Well... I guess I don't have any reason to be here anymore...\" he grinned.\nStark glanced at the sleeping girls one last time, their serene faces bathed in the soft glow of dawn.\nHis gaze lingered on Lana, Sora, and Lilith.\nDespite the chaos ahead, this moment felt like a calm sanctuary he would fight to protect.\n\"See you later...\" he whispered, his voice neutral.\nHe opened his [Multi-Task Watch], typing out a short message to each of them:\n\"I've got some business to take care of. Don't worry about me. I'll be back before you know it. Stay together, okay?\"\nWith that done, Stark took a deep breath, his crimson aura flickering faintly as determination coursed through him.\n\"ApostleDex, close,\" he commanded, the panel vanishing from view.\nThe [Classes Figure] stood silently in the corner, its smile unchanging as it watched him prepare.\nStark opened the door, stepping into the crisp morning air.\nHe clenched his fists, feeling the raw energy pulsing through his veins.\nHis journey was on the verge of ending.\nOnly 5 more.\n\"Alright, Classes,\" he said, his voice steady. \"Let's get to work.\"\n[Good, Chosen One.]\nThe figure's grin widened, and the air around Stark shimmered as the world shifted.\n\"Multi-Task Watch, send me back to the association,\" he ordered as he remembered Oliver doing that.\n[Very well, Stark]\nIn a flash of crimson light, he vanished, leaving behind the quiet room and the three sleeping girls.\nHe had a little more than half a year before it would be all over.\nWithin that time frame, the fate of this world would probably be decided.\nStark would do everything to stop it.",

      "content": "Stark stepped into the crisp morning air outside his room, his mind already set on the daunting task ahead.\nHe had left a brief message for the girls, Lana, Sora, and Lilith, knowing they'd understand when they woke.\nThe time for hesitation had passed. Only five apostles remained, and Stark had no intention of wasting another second.\n\"Multi-Task Watch,\" he said calmly, \"send me to the [Domination Association] headquarters.\"\nIn a flash of crimson light, the world around him blurred and shifted.\nWhen the light faded, Stark found himself standing in the imposing [Commander's Meeting Room] of the [Domination Association].\nThe room was vast and circular, with a high domed ceiling inscribed with glowing runes.\nAt the center stood a grand table made of black stone, around which the commanders were seated.\n\"We need to check out those things, there seems to be at least four ongoing trials,\" Ed informed.\n\"Yeah, and new portals have been discovered too, it's weird, there's been a rise in rift portals lately...\" Unity sighed.\n\"How about we just smash them all,\" Tia laughed.\n\"Doesn't matter, send the appropriate teams to the locations, we'll deal with them ourselves if needed,\" Oliver completed, his voice rough and authoritative.\nThe moment Stark materialized, the conversation came to a halt. All eyes turned to him.\n\"Well, look who decided to show up,\" Ed said with a smirk, leaning back in his chair. \"Took you long enough.\"\n\"Good to see you too, Ed,\" Stark replied dryly, stepping closer to the table. \"I'm here to let you know, I'm heading out to complete the first mission.\"\nThe room fell silent for a moment, the weight of Stark's declaration sinking in.\n\"Oh wow,\" Tia was the first to react, \"So you're actually doing that?\"\n\"...?\" Stark titled his head, confused.\n\"You just lost me 100 bucks kid,\" Alexis groaned, pulling out his wallets and giving two pieces of paper to Ed and Oliver.\nDid they seriously bet about whether he would get cold feet?\n\"Well, kid, you've got guts. I'll give you that,\" Ed said, rising from his seat. \"But before you go, take this.\"\nEd walked over to a storage unit embedded in the wall and retrieved something.\nWhen he returned, he handed Stark a sleek, black suit that seemed to shimmer faintly under the light.\n\"What is it?\" Stark asked, holding it up.\nA panel appeared from his [Multi-Task Watch], providing a detailed description:\n[Submersible Suit]\n[Rank: Godly]\n[Description: A form-fitting scuba suit that becomes completely invisible once worn. Designed for underwater stealth and extreme conditions. Grants enhanced mobility and durability in aquatic environments.]\nStark raised an eyebrow, then placed the suit into his [Spatial Inventory].\n\"…Thanks,\" he said, tilting his head. \"But why?\"\nEd's grin widened. \"You'll see why soon enough. Trust me, you'll be glad you have it.\"\n\"I'll take your word for it,\" Stark muttered, already turning to leave, \"I've got work to do.\"\n\"Good luck, kid!\" Ed called out. \"I hope to see you later.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever,\" Stark replied, waving dismissively as he made his way to the [Teleportation] room.\nOnce inside, Stark paused for a moment to open his [Multi-Task Watch].\nNavigating to the [Missions] app, he examined the three missions displayed on the screen.\nHowever, when he tried to access the second and third missions, notifications popped up.\n[Mission #2]\n[Complete the first mission before accessing this one.]\n[Mission #3]\n[Complete the second mission before accessing this one.]\n\"Figures,\" Stark said with a shrug.\nHe selected the first mission, bringing up its details.\n[Mission #1]\n[Location: Lampod]\n[The Multi-Task Watch will guide you if needed.]\n\"That'll do,\" Stark muttered as he closed the panel.\nHe headed toward the [Teleportation Room], the door closing behind him as the commanders all looked at his back.\n\"500 bucks that he's not coming back,\" Alexis shouted, \"I want my money!\"\n\"You're on!\" Ed grinned.\nBack to Stark, he stepped into the Lampod Teleportation Device, a circular platform surrounded by glowing runes.\nAs he stepped onto the platform, a surge of energy enveloped him, and his surroundings blurred once more.\nIn an instant, Stark was teleported to the capital city of Lampod.\n...\nThe first thing Stark noticed was the light.\nUnlike the bustling metropolis of Fellarburg, Lampod was bathed in a serene, almost ethereal glow.\nIts architecture was a blend of modern design and ancient elegance, with crystalline towers reflecting the golden rays of the sun.\nThe streets were paved with smooth, marble tiles, and the air carried the faint scent of saltwater.\n\"Not bad,\" Stark remarked, taking in the view as a holographic arrow appeared above his [Multi-Task Watch], pointing him in the direction he needed to go.\nHe began to run, his shoes clicking softly against the tiled streets.\nYet despite the vibrant atmosphere, there was an undercurrent of tension. People glanced at him curiously, some even whispering as he passed.\n\"Hey, wait a damn minute... isn't that [HIM]?!\"\n\"IT IS! TAKE A PICTURE! HOLY SHIT!\"\nStark paid them no mind, his focus solely on the glowing arrow guiding him.\nAs he moved deeper into the city, the surroundings began to change.\nThe streets grew quieter, and the buildings took on a more abnormal design, with fewer decorations and more functional structures.\nEventually, the city gave way to the coastline.\nStark found himself standing at the edge of a vast, glittering sea.\n\"Huh,\" Stark muttered, glancing at the arrow.\nTo his surprise, it still pointed forward, directly over the water.\nHe frowned, then heard a familiar ding as a panel appeared from his [Multi-Task Watch].\n[Mission #1 Update]:\n[The first portal is located underwater, which makes us believe that the rift will happen in the same conditions...]\n\"Underwater, huh?\" Stark said, scratching the back of his head.\nHe glanced at the ocean, the sunlight glinting off its surface, \"Figures.\"\nThe message explained why Ed had given him the [Submersible Suit].\nHe briefly considered equipping it but decided to wait just a little bit.\n\"Alright, let's get this over with,\" Stark said, stepping closer to the water.\nThe holographic arrow continued to guide him, shifting as he walked along the shoreline.\nRealizing he had no choice but to swim, Stark reluctantly retrieved the [Submersible Suit] from his [Spatial Inventory].\nThe suit conformed perfectly to his body the moment he put it on, becoming invisible as if it weren't even there.\nTo his surprise, it wasn't uncomfortable at all, it felt like a second skin.\n\"Well, at least it's not annoying,\" Stark muttered, stretching his arms before stepping into the water.\nThe moment he began swimming, Stark felt the suit's enhancements kick in.\nHis movements were smooth and efficient, cutting through the water with ease.\nHis swimming speed, while not groundbreaking, was still impressively fast.\nFor the first several minutes, the swim wasn't too bad.\nThe gentle rhythm of the waves and the quiet expanse of the ocean offered a rare moment of peace.\nBut as time dragged on, Stark began to grow impatient.\n\"Alright, how much farther is this thing?\" he muttered, glancing at the holographic arrow from his [Multi-Task Watch].\nHe kept swimming for what felt like forever, the ocean stretching endlessly in all directions.\nAfter about 30 minutes, with no sign of a portal or any change in the environment, Stark was starting to get frustrated.\nThen, the arrow abruptly shifted.\nInstead of pointing forward, it turned back.\n\"Wait, what?\" Stark stopped, treading water as he stared at the arrow, it meant that he had just passed it!\nThe arrow flickered, readjusting before pointing directly downward.\nStark stared at the water beneath him, the endless blue stretching into darkness.\nHe let out a heavy sigh, realizing what came next.\n\"...Of course,\" he grumbled, taking a deep breath. \"Here goes nothing.\"\nWith that, Stark dove beneath the waves, following the arrow into the depths.",

With a powerful flick of its tail, it darted around Stark, trying to flank him.\nIts glowing eyes locked onto Stark, and its maw opened to release a deafening Abyssal Roar.\nThe shockwave struck Stark like a hammer, sending him tumbling. His ears rang, and his equilibrium faltered.\nDisoriented, Stark struggled to regain his balance.\n\"Annoying,\" he grunted, activating Focus to steady his senses.\nHis perception sharpened, allowing him to anticipate the Leviathan's movements.\nThe Leviathan lunged with Shadow Lunge, its massive jaws snapping mere inches from Stark's head.\nHe twisted and swam out of the way, a trail of crimson energy following his movements.\n\"Fast for something that size,\" Stark muttered.\nThe Leviathan didn't let up, swinging its colossal tail in a Chasm Whip.\nThe sheer force sent a shockwave through the water, tearing apart the water itself.\n\"What the fuck?!\"\nIt was the first time Stark was fighting aquatic monsters, and he was currently in their environment, meaning at a massive disadvantage.\nStark darted upward, evading the attack. He retaliated by hurling three Crimson Spears toward its head.\nThe Leviathan activated Ebon Cloak, its body vanishing into a shroud of darkness. The spears dissipated, their energy consumed by the void.\n\"Tch, figures,\" Stark growled.\nBut before the Leviathan could fully hide, he threw a [Target Set] at it, locking onto the Leviathan's position despite its cloak.\nA glowing mark appeared over the beast's body, visible only to him.\n\"Can't hide from me,\" Stark said with a smirk.\nThe Leviathan charged again, but Stark was ready.\nHe summoned Domi-Chains, the crimson restraints snaking through the water to latch onto the creature's massive frame.\nThe Leviathan thrashed violently, the chains holding firm for only a moment before snapping under its sheer strength.\nThe creature unleashed Hydro Frenzy, spinning water blades shooting toward Stark.\nHe countered with more spears that pulverized the blades. The shockwaves reverberated through the ocean.\nThis kept going for a while, of Stark just avoiding all attacks or countering, throwing projectiles when possible.\nHe even used his [Domination Soul] heart to smash it into the Leviathan's body several times.\nTaking advantage of a brief opening as he noticed the Leviathan getting tired, Stark summoned the massive [Spear of Judgment], its glowing tip illuminating the abyss.\nHe hurled it with all his might, the spear striking the Leviathan's underbelly with a thunderous impact.\n-24,847,371!\nThe creature roared in agony, blood billowing into the water as it recoiled.\nAnd then... it stopped moving, it's HP having reached zero.\n\"Fucking hell...\"\nDing!\n[You have slain \"Leviathan of the Depths\", and gained 35,000,000 experience points!]\nThis wasn't enough to level up, but at least this was done with, and thanks to that thing, Stark was a little more used to fighting in water.\n\"This is more difficult than I thought,\" he muttered, resuming his descent toward the portal.\nAfter what felt like another hour of swimming, Stark finally reached the location indicated by the holographic arrow.\nThe water here was pitch black, the only light coming from his [Multi-Task Watch].\nHe looked around, searching for the portal, when a faint glow caught his eye.\nThere, embedded in the seabed, was a swirling vortex of light.\nThe portal shimmered with hues of blue and gold, its energy radiating out in gentle pulses.\nStark swam closer, the glow illuminating his face as he studied it.\n\"Well, this is it,\" he said, reaching out cautiously.\nHis fingers brushed against the portal's surface, and a message appeared in front of him.\n[Access Granted: Chosen One Detected.]\n\"Great,\" Stark muttered, stepping closer.\nBut before he could fully enter, the water around him began to churn violently.\nStark instinctively looked around, heightening his awareness.\nThe current grew stronger, and a massive figure began to materialize in front of the portal.\nEmerging from the swirling waters was a colossal monster, easily three times the size of the one Stark had faced earlier.\nIts body was humanoid but grotesque, covered in barnacles and seaweed.\nTwo glowing eyes stared down at him with an intensity that made the water feel even heavier.\nIn its hands, it held two massive tridents, their tips crackling with an eerie energy.\nStark tensed, preparing for another battle, but the creature made no move to attack.\nInstead, it spoke, its voice a deep rumble that seemed to echo through the water.\n\"Seems like Lord Godless was right, he truly came...\" it laughed.\nStark blinked, \"You are...\"\nHe immediately understood.\nThe creature didn't respond.\nInstead, it raised one of its tridents and pointed it toward the portal.\nA sudden surge of energy pulled Stark forward, as if an invisible hand were dragging him closer.\n\"Wait, what are you,\" Stark began, but before he could finish, the creature thrust its other trident toward him.\nHe wanted to avoid, but he still hadn't fully mastered [Aquatic Battles].\n\"GARGH-\"\nIt pierced his stomach, and then pulled him directly into the portal, the vortex swallowing him whole.\nStark felt his body being pulled through a tunnel of light, the sensation disorienting and almost overwhelming.\nHe gritted his teeth, trying to regain control, but the energy was too strong.\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the light faded, and Stark found himself standing in an entirely new environment.\nThe first thing he noticed was the air, heavy and humid, with the faint scent of salt and vegetation.\nHe wasn't in water anymore by the way, but on actual land.\nHe looked around, taking in his surroundings.\nLooking around, Stark took in his surroundings.\nHe stood in a vast underwater cavern, its jagged walls adorned with luminous crystals that cast a gentle, otherworldly glow.\nStreaks of moisture dripped from the rocky ceiling, forming shallow pools that rippled softly at his feet.\nAt the far end of the cavern, a wide tunnel descended back into water.\nStark sighed at the sight, realizing he wasn't done swimming just yet.\nBehind him, the portal shimmered faintly for a moment before vanishing completely, leaving him alone in the cavern.\n\"Great,\" he muttered, brushing himself off. \"What now?\"\nHis [Multi-Task Watch] beeped, a new message appearing on the screen.\n[User has been detected inside of the rift!]\n[Mission Updated: Eliminate the Apostle.]",

It would be bad if we were in water, but right now I'm on land.\"\nVoracron grinned, his serrated teeth glinting as he raised both tridents, clearly unfazed by Stark's comment.\n\"Prepare yourself, intruder. Your journey ends here!\"\nIt seems like it wasn't only the apostles that were given the order to eliminate Stark, but every single monster in their army.\nOnly the ones that actually had high-enough intellectual capabilities to speak would register that, though, probably.\nWithout warning, the massive fishman lunged forward, slamming one of his tridents into the ground.\nBOOM!\nA surge of water exploded outward, forcing Stark to leap back to avoid the incoming wave.\n\"Tidal Smite!\"\n[Description: Strikes with overwhelming force, unleashing a shockwave of water that stuns and damages enemies.\nEven though Stark dodged the direct impact, the residual force sent him skidding across the wet cavern floor.\n\"Alright, big guy,\" Stark muttered, shaking himself off. \"Let's see what you've got.\"\nVoracron didn't give Stark time to catch his breath.\nThe fishman spun his tridents with blinding speed, activating Trident Cyclone.\nA roaring vortex of water formed around him, tearing apart chunks of the cavern walls and sending shards of rock flying toward Stark.\n\"...\"\nStark was unfazed by that, his expression neutral as he began to roll repeatedly with [Invincible Dodge], the projectiles flying through him, literally.\n\"What?\" Voracron was baffled.\nSpear of Judgment!\nStark immediately retaliated with his own attack, summoning the massive spear and sending it toward the monster.\nThe spear struck true, but the glowing aura of Aqua Barrier absorbed the impact.\nThe spear dissolved into harmless crimson light before even scratching the scales.\n\"Pathetic!\" Voracron sneered, his webbed hand slamming into the ground, though Stark noticed him sweating.\nWith the passive that the [Magus] class granted Stark, if the [Spear of Judgment] had hit, it would have surely been at least 20,000,000 damage.\nThis was how powerful Stark became.\n\"...\"\nThe water beneath Stark began to swirl ominously, forming shimmering chains that shot upward.\nHydro Chains!\nStark leapt into the air, flipping backward to avoid being bound, but Voracron was ready.\nThe fishman lunged forward with both tridents, aiming to skewer Stark midair.\nCLANG!\n\"Stupid...\"\nStark managed to summon another Crimson Spear in time, blocking the tridents with a shower of sparks.\nThe force of the blow sent him crashing into the cavern wall.\n\"Not bad,\" Stark grunted, pushing himself upright. \"But let's even the odds.\"\nRaising his hand, Stark decided to activate an ability similar to the [Hydro Chains], but much more powerful.\n\"Domi-Chains Restraint: Chains of Judgment!\"\nBlood-red chains erupted from the ground, snaking through the air with unnatural speed.\nThree sets of chains wrapped tightly around Voracron's limbs, binding him in place.\nBut that wasn't all.\nThe air around Stark darkened as a shadowy figure materialized behind him.\nGortox, the Chain Demon.\nThe demonic entity towered over even Voracron, its entire body composed of writhing chains.\nWith a guttural roar, Gortox extended its own crimson bindings, reinforcing the restraints around the fishman.\nVoracron thrashed violently, his scales flashing with bursts of energy as he tried to break free.\n\"What the hell is this...\"\n\"You're not going anywhere,\" Stark growled, clenching his fist.\nHe charged forward, summoning the massive crimson cross of Wielding Cross.\nHoly Combo!\nStark swung the cross once.\n-6,362,839!\nTwice.\n-6,431,954!\nAnd on the third strike, the weapon lit up with a brilliant crimson aura as the effects of the perk activated.\n\"Oh shit...\" even Voracron knew that he was fucked.\nBOOOOM!\nThe final blow struck Voracron's chest with devastating force, sending shockwaves rippling through the cavern.\nThe guardian roared in agony, stunned by the overwhelming power.\n-12,475,553!\nWith Voracron immobilized, Stark unleashed a relentless assault.\nCrimson fists materialized in the air, pummeling the guardian repeatedly, each blow landing with bone-crushing force.\nThe cavern shook as Voracron's health plummeted, his once-mighty roars reduced to desperate gasps.\n\"Let's end this,\" Stark said coldly, summoning the colossal spear again, \"This one won't miss.\"\nSpear of Judgment!\nThis time, he aimed directly for Voracron's head.\nFWISH...

It almost felt unnatural.\nShaking his head, he approached the water ahead.\nThe still, mirror-like surface reflected his bloodied figure. The sight made him smirk grimly.\n\"...\"\n[It's you.]\n\"I know.\"\nWithout hesitation, Stark leapt into the depths.\nThe icy chill of the water enveloped Stark instantly as he plunged beneath the surface.\nThe water was colder than he expected, chilling his skin even through his reinforced clothing.\nThe cavern seemed much deeper than it had looked from the surface; the further he descended, the darker and more foreboding it became.\nThe walls vanished into the abyss below, leaving him surrounded by a haunting void.\nShapes moved in the distance, their silhouettes unclear. Were they harmless fish? Or monsters?\nIt didn't matter to Stark, if they attacked him, he would kill.\nBut his immediate focus was the path ahead.\nHe could feel the faint pull of magical energy emanating from somewhere deep in the cavern.\nAs Stark swam, the water grew thicker, more oppressive.\nThis kept going for thirty minutes.\nThirty minutes of pure silence.\nAt this point in a rift, Stark would have expected to have to fight dozens of enemies, yet this time, maybe because he was in the water, it was quiet.\nToo quiet for his liking, to be honest.\nThe abyss below seemed endless, a black void that could hide anything, or everything.\nIt was easy to imagine some colossal beast lurking in the darkness, its body so massive it would seem like the abyss itself.\nIts mouth would swallow him before he even realized.\n\"...\"\nBut after a while... it happened.\nAs if summoned by his thoughts, the shadows in the distance that kept following him grew larger, their speed and numbers increasing.\nWithin moments, a school of massive creatures emerged from the gloom, their sleek, scaly forms glinting ominously in the dim light.\nThirty monstrous piranhas, the size of full-grown humans.\n[Abyss Piranha]\n[Level: 750]\n[HP: 30,000,000]\n[Skills: Frenzied Bite, Abyssal Swarm Tactics, Enhanced Regeneration, Bite of The Depths, The Lord's Will, Ultra Sonar, King Piranha Merge (Immortal)...]\n\"Thirty?\" Stark whispered, his voice muffled by the water.\nThe creatures swarmed around him, their razor-sharp teeth gleaming and their eyes glowing with primal hunger.\nFor the first time in a while, Stark was the one cornered, surrounded by these things.\nThe sight was overwhelming, the sheer pressure of the abyss and the ferocity of his foes pressing against his mind.\n\"Alright,\" he muttered, \"Let's do this.\"\nThe first piranha lunged at him with terrifying speed, its jaws snapping mere inches from his arm.\nStark retaliated instantly, summoning one of his Crimson Spears and impaling the creature through its midsection.\n-7,234,892!\nThe piranha writhed violently, but its regeneration began almost immediately.\nBefore Stark could land a finishing blow, two more piranhas darted in, their teeth sinking into his leg and shoulder.\n\"Argh!\" Stark growled, feeling the searing pain as blood clouded the water around him.\n-18,372! -13,389!\nThey didn't do that much damage, to be honest, but he didn't like the feeling at all.\nHe spun in place, summoning Aura Smash, and unleashed five crimson fists that pummeled the attacking piranhas.\nThe blows sent the creatures reeling, their regeneration unable to keep up with the relentless assault.\nYet, they didn't die, simply going back to their original positions.\nThere were still so many.\nThe swarm encircled him, glowing eyes flashing like sinister beacons.\nStark gulped as the sheer number of them sank in.\nEven for someone as powerful as him, the sight was overwhelming.\n\"Keep it together, Stark,\" he muttered under his breath. \"You've faced worse.\"\nHe used Asura's Arms, four additional crimson limbs sprouting from under his arms and shoulder.\nHe equipped each arm with a [Crimson Spear].\nIf the weakness of these things was their mouth or eyes, then he should be able to one-shot them if he manages.\nWith his enhanced reach and strength, Stark launched into the swarm, his movements swift and precise despite the weight of the water.\nOne spear pierced through a piranha's head, instantly killing it with a Critical Hit, while the others focused on keeping the swarm at bay.\nThe battle raged on for what felt like hours.\nStark's aura illuminated the abyss as he unleashed attack after attack, his Invincible Dodge saving him from countless bites.\nStill, the piranhas' sheer numbers and relentless regeneration made the fight grueling.\nOccasionally, one would get past his defenses, its razor-sharp teeth tearing into his flesh.\nStark gritted his teeth against the pain, his determination allowing him to continue.\nSlam! Slam!\nUsing his [Domination Soul] also revealed itself to be extremely useful, although the piranhas would try to bite down the chains.\n\"Come on!\" he roared, summoning Spear of Judgment.\nThe colossal spear tore through three piranhas in a single strike, leaving a glowing trail of crimson in its wake.\n[Body exploded, instant death.]\n-38,381,493!\nThe swarm began to thin, the piranhas' confidence faltering as their numbers dwindled.\nStark noticed their hesitation and capitalized on it.\n\"Not so tough now, are you?\" he taunted, slamming two more with [Holy Combo].\nThe stunning third strike obliterated one completely, its body dissolving into the abyssal water.\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, Stark realized that this wouldn't cut it.\nEven though it had been a while, still seventeen of those still roamed around him, waiting for the perfect moment.\nHis [Crimson Barrier] was almost destroyed too.\nSo instead, he decided to use a perk he had never used before, and it was one from [Asura's Arms].\nASURA'S WRATH!\n[Description: Harness the power of the God of Wrath to summon four additional arms, doubling the user's physical power.\nYou can also unleash a devastating attack that annihilates everything in a 100-meter radius.]\nThis second part was the one that he had never used before.\nAnd so... what had to be done happened.\nThe four crimson arms from Asura's Arms pulsed with divine energy, their aura intensifying as Stark slammed them together.\n\"Tank this, bastards...\"\nA blinding light erupted, illuminating the abyss with a crimson glow.\nThe sheer force of his will manifested as an earth-shattering shockwave, tearing through the water and obliterating everything in its path.\nThe swarm of piranhas didn't stand a chance.

      "content": "After what felt like an eternity of swimming through the oppressive abyss, Stark finally reached a massive structure embedded into the cavern wall.\nThe sight was breathtaking: a colossal golden door towering over him, at least 50 meters tall and twice as wide.\nIts surface shimmered faintly in the dim light, decorated with intricate engravings of battles long past.\nClassifiers clashed with monstrous beings, their figures frozen in dramatic poses of struggle and triumph.\n\"...?\"\nStark drifted closer, his sharp eyes scanning every detail.\nAt the center of the door were three circular indentations, their smooth surfaces gleaming like polished glass.\nOne of them glowed faintly, filled with a golden sphere.\n[Defeat all Three Guardians to access the Boss!]\n\"So, that's the deal,\" Stark muttered, his voice low as he stared at the glowing indentation.\nThe orb seemed to pulse softly, its light almost alive.\nVoracron's defeat must have triggered it, marking one of the three slots.\nHe stepped back slightly, his gaze shifting to the paths branching off to either side of the door.\nThe left path descended into darkness, the faint echo of dripping water the only sound emanating from its depths.\nIn contrast, the right path sloped upward, its faint red glow suggesting intense volcanic heat.\n\"So, like a mini-trial,\" he mused, tilting his head to one side. \"Reminds me of the first domination trial I went through with the guardians...\"\nRemember, back when he had to kill all guardians to activate a statue to descend to the final boss.\nThis was oddly similar, almost as if... it was directly taken inspiration from...\n\"No, I must be imagining it,\" he mumbled.\nThe corner of his mouth twitched into a wry smirk.\nAs powerful as he was, Stark couldn't help but feel like he was being toyed with.\nIt wasn't the first time a Rift had thrown him into something elaborate, and it certainly wouldn't be the last.\nWith a sigh, he ran a hand through his damp hair, pushing the blood-matted strands out of his face.\n\"Two more to go. Might as well get this over with.\"\nHis decision was swift.\nWithout a second thought, Stark chose the left path, drawn to the silent promise of darkness.\nHe also felt like the right one was too \"good\", which probably meant the strongest of the guardians was there.\nHe adjusted his stance, steadying his breathing as he plunged deeper into the unknown.\nThe air grew colder as Stark ventured further along the left path, the temperature starkly different from the humid waters of the cavern.\nA sense of unease began to settle over him, the kind of prickling sensation that set his instincts on edge.\nThe tunnel twisted and turned, narrowing at times until it felt like the walls were closing in around him.\n\"...\"\nWithout the scuba suit, he would have never managed to survive long enough, so he could thank Ed for it.\nDespite his outward confidence, Stark knew better than to let his guard down in a Rift, especially one as advanced as this.\nSuddenly, the path widened into an expansive chamber.\nStark stopped in his swim, his eyes narrowing as he surveyed his surroundings.\nThe cavern was vast, its ceiling disappearing into shadow far above.\nStrange, luminescent plants clung to the walls, casting an eerie blue-green light across the jagged stone.\nAnd then, he saw it.\nIn the center of the chamber stood a massive creature, its body coiled and shimmering with a metallic sheen.\nIts serpentine form was easily the length of several buildings, its scales glinting like polished steel.\nTwo piercing yellow eyes glared at Stark, unblinking and filled with malice.\n[You have encountered \"Thalveros, The Abyssal Sentinel!\"]\n[Level: 740]\n[HP: 60,000,000]\n[Skills: Abyssal Coil, Venomous Torrent, Steel Skin, Crushing Depths, Sentinel's Rage...]\n\"...\" Stark looked at the monster from above.\nThalveros let out a low, guttural hiss that reverberated through the chamber, the sound rattling Stark's bones.\nThe creature began to uncoil, its massive body shifting with terrifying grace as it prepared to strike.\n\"Seems like Valcreon was truly not enough to defeat you, Chosen,\" it said, smiling, only it's eyes visible in the darkness below.\n\"...\"\nStark didn't wait for the first move.\nIn an instant, he summoned his Crimson Spears, the glowing weapons materializing around him with a crackle of energy.\nThe cavern was bathed in a crimson glow as Stark hurled the first spear with pinpoint precision, aiming directly for one of the creature's eyes.\nThe spear struck true, but instead of piercing through, it glanced off the creature's scales with a sharp clang, leaving only a faint scratch.\n-0!\n\"Steel skin,\" Stark muttered, his jaw tightening. \"Figures.\"\nWith a roar that sent ripples tearing through the water, Thalveros lashed out with its massive tail.\nThe strike was lightning-fast, the sheer force of the movement creating a shockwave that sent Stark hurtling backward.\nHe managed to regain control just in time, activating Invincible Dodge to avoid the follow-up strike.\nThe sentinel's tail slammed into the rocky floor, shaking the entire chamber and sending chunks of debris floating upward in the disturbed water.\nStark darted to the side, swimming with fluid agility as he assessed his opponent.\n\"Alright, big guy,\" he muttered, gripping his spears tightly with his 6 hands, \"Let's see how tough you really are.\"\n\"Do you truly believe you can defeat me in my domain?\" Thalveros laughed from the abyss, \"You beat all the others on land, I'd love to see you try in water!\"\nThere was a clap from below, and immediately, the way Stark came from closed down by an impossibly sturdy wall of rocks.\n[You cannot leave until defeating the monster or dying.]\n[Though it is possible to destroy that exit if you're strong enough :).]\n\"...\" Stark looked at the tunnel before smiling, \"Do you really think I care? You're the one that's gonna one to escape by the time I'm done.\"\n\"I will use your remains as decoration for my abyss, and showcase you to the lord and all these lowly humans at the surface,\" the Sentinel answered.\nStark was surrounded by darkness at this point, the glow of his Crimson Spears being the only other source of illumination, which was why he kept them.\nStark darted sideways, his six hands gripping his spears tightly.\nHis movements were fluid, calculated, each stroke through the water propelling him with incredible speed.\n\"You talk too much,\" Stark said, his voice cold as he flung two Crimson Spears in quick succession.\nThe spears spiraled through the water, glowing with an intense crimson hue.\nThalveros responded with a swipe of its gargantuan tail, deflecting the projectiles effortlessly.\n\"I guess it's time to get serious,\" Thalveros kept laughing over and over.\nThe water stirred ominously as the Sentinel's laughter echoed, carrying an unsettling resonance through the chamber.\nStark's narrowed eyes were fixed on the looming silhouette before him, but even his enhanced perception had failed to grasp the sheer magnitude of the creature.\nAs a faint mist began to seep from Thalveros' body, it illuminated the surrounding darkness, creating an ethereal glow that bathed the chamber in eerie light.\nThe mist, shimmering faintly with golden flecks, coiled around the beast, accentuating its immense form.\nStark's jaw dropped. His mind raced as he took in the sight before him.\n\"How...?\"\nThe Sentinel was massive.\nIts serpentine body twisted and turned, stretching beyond what he could fathom.\nThe cavern itself struggled to contain the beast, its coils filling the space and wrapping around the jagged walls like an ancient god of the abyss.\nAt this size, Thalveros wasn't just a creature, he was an environment, a battlefield unto himself.\n\"You finally see it, don't you, little Chosen?\" Thalveros' voice boomed, reverberating through the water. \"I am the abyss. I am eternal. You will die knowing the futility of defiance.\"\nStark didn't answer.\nHis Crimson Spears floated around him like orbiting satellites, their glow defiant against the overwhelming darkness.\nHe inhaled deeply, calming the rising tension in his chest.\n\"Size doesn't matter,\" he muttered, his voice steady but cold, \"And if you were as powerful as you say, you wouldn't be the goon of an apostle.\"",

Another oversized freak,\" he muttered, gripping his spears tightly, \"Though this is more manageable.\"\nOrithal's voice boomed, cold and echoing like the depths of the ocean.\n\"Intruder.

I saw that before...\" Stark muttered as he saw the defense, disbelief etched across his face. \"You've got to be kidding me.\"\nNo wonder his attacks weren't working.\nFrom above, Stark hurled another barrage of Crimson Spears into the abyss below.\nThe glowing projectiles pierced the water with precision, each strike carrying enough force to obliterate most foes.\nBut as they disappeared into the blackness, the result was always the same.\n-0! -0! -0!\nEven the [Spear of Judgment] did absolutely NOTHING!\nStark clenched his jaw in frustration. Every single attack was worthless. His sharp eyes scanned the darkness, searching for any hint of Thalveros' true form.\nBut the creature remained hidden, an unseen titan beneath the water's surface.\nThe faint glimmers of movement he caught were massive, far larger than anything he had ever fought before, but even as he descended lower and lower, the Sentinel refused to reveal itself.\n\"Come on, show yourself!\" Stark growled, his six arms poised to unleash another flurry of attacks.\nSuddenly, the water stirred violently. A shadow moved, impossibly large, far below him.\nStark gritted his teeth and dove closer, determined to get a better view.\nHe felt the oppressive weight of the Sentinel's presence, a suffocating aura that pressed against his mind and body.\nAs he neared the abyssal depths, the shadows shifted, and for a brief moment, Stark saw something, teeth.\nEndless rows of them, forming a gaping maw that could swallow a mountain whole.\n\"Holy…\" Stark's words trailed off as he froze in place.\nBefore he could react further, a massive tail shot out from the darkness, crashing into him with the force of a meteor.\n-73,839!\nStark was sent hurtling backward, not expecting that from a creature that had supposedly very low strength and speed.\n\"Damn it!\" he spat, regaining his balance just in time to see the tail whip toward him again.\nThis time, Stark managed to dodge, narrowly avoiding the devastating strike.\nHe retaliated, launching another series of Crimson Fists.\nThe projectiles struck the massive tail and bounced off harmlessly.\n-0! -0! -0!\n\"It's like hitting a brick wall,\" Stark muttered, frustration boiling over.\nThe Sentinel's laughter echoed through the cavern, a deep, guttural sound that made the water tremble.\n\"You are nothing, Chosen. A feeble insect grasping at the impossible.\"\nIgnoring the taunt, Stark pushed himself further.\nHe darted around the battlefield, throwing every technique he had at the creature.\nHe in fact tried to get close enough to be able to punch that thing, but there were too many things defending it, and getting too close to its mouth was a big no-no for him.\nEvery attack was useless against Thalveros' impenetrable scales.\nThe fight dragged on, with Stark dodging the Sentinel's monstrous tail and devastating shockwaves.\nHe was starting to feel the strain. His stamina was running low, and the oppressive weight of the water made every movement a struggle.\nAnd then it happened.\nThe tail came again, but this time, it didn't aim to crush him.\nInstead, it wrapped around him like a massive serpent, squeezing with bone-crushing force.\nStark struggled, his six arms flailing as he tried to free himself.\nHe immediately thought of using [Crimson Ball Transmission], but his arms were caught in the tail too.\n\"Get off me!\" he roared, summoning a Crimson Ball in his hand but unable to do anything.\nA sudden, searing pain shot through Stark's body.\nHe looked down and saw a glowing green liquid seeping into his skin: the Sentinel's poison.\n\"Shit…\"\nThe poison coursed through his veins like fire, his HP dropping rapidly.\nHe could feel his strength fading, his vision blurring as the venom took hold.\n[HP: 1]\nThen, all at once, the pain stopped.\nA warm, crimson glow enveloped Stark's body, and his health was fully restored.\n[Crimson Healing activated: All HP restored upon reaching 1.]\nStark gasped, his body surging with renewed energy. But the relief was short-lived.\nThe Sentinel roared, tightening its grip and hurling Stark across the cavern.\nHe crashed into the rocky wall with enough force to crack the stone, coughing up blood as he struggled to stand.\n-27,949!\n\"This isn't working,\" Stark muttered, his breathing ragged.\nHis mind raced. He needed a new plan, something drastic.\nBut before he could act, the Sentinel struck again.\nA massive wave of water surged toward him, carrying with it a crushing force that slammed into Stark like a tidal wave.\n-121,948!\nThen Thalveros used that distraction to slam Stark against the wall.\n\"IT'S MY WIN,\" he shouted\nBOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\nUsing his tail and even some tentacles that came out of nowhere, he kept hitting Stark over and over.\nA single strike couldn't do more than 30,000 HP, but if repeated over and over, it quickly became too much.\nStark felt his body give out, his vision fading to black as his HP dropped to zero.\nDarkness.\nWhen Stark opened his eyes, he was back in the endless void.\nThe familiar black space he always found himself in after dying.\n\"Damn it…\"\nBefore him, a screen appeared, displaying a countdown.\n[You have 60 seconds to decide.]\n[Do you want to be revived?]\nIn the background, another screen showed Thalveros.\nThe Sentinel's tentacles loomed over Stark's lifeless body, slowly pulling it toward its massive maw.\nThe sight sent a chill down his spine.\n\"You were weak,\" the Sentinel's voice echoed, its laughter mocking him even in death.\nStark clenched his fists.\nHe didn't have time to think.\nHe couldn't rely on his Classes to bail him out. This wasn't a fight he could win by holding back.\nFor the first time, Stark didn't hesitate.\n\"Yes,\" he said, his voice firm, \"Revive me, I'm ending that thing for good.\"\nThe screen disappeared, replaced by a single notification.\nDing!\n[Revenant's Fury's conditions have been met: 4/3.]\n[However, it is not the right time.]\n\"What the hell does that mean?\" Stark muttered, but there was no time for answers.\nThe void began to fade, and Stark's consciousness slipped away.\nWhen he opened his eyes again, he was back in the cavern, his body restored and his health fully replenished as his broken bones were fixed.\nThis time, there was no hesitation, no second-guessing. He knew what needed to be done.\n\"You're going down, Thalveros,\" Stark said, his voice low and determined as he used his strength to get out of the tentacles' grip.\n\"What the...?\"\nThe Sentinel roared in response, its glowing eyes burning with malevolent fury.\nStark summoned his Crimson Spears once more, their glow illuminating the dark waters around him.\nBut this time, he wasn't aiming for the Sentinel's impenetrable scales. He was aiming for something far more destructive.\nHis ultimate skill.\nA tactical nuke for the abyssal beast.\nAnd this time, he wouldn't stop until Thalveros was nothing but a memory.",

The barrier wasn't going to last long.\n\"I won't win like this,\" Stark muttered under his breath.\nHis crimson eyes burned with determination, but he knew the truth.\nHis arsenal of skills wouldn't be enough.

A spark of defiance ignited in Stark's eyes.\n\"YOU CAN'T BEAT ME!\"\n\"No...\" he murmured, a grin creeping across his face. \"But he can.\"\nWithout hesitation, Stark snapped his fingers.\nThe motion was deliberate, filled with resolve.\n\"HEAVEN'S SPEAR!\"\nAbove him, reality itself seemed to tear apart.\nA massive rift opened high above the cavern ceiling, splitting the water and stone as if the heavens themselves had descended.\nFrom within the rift emerged an angelic figure, an ethereal colossus whose sheer presence radiated divine power.\nIts form was impossible to comprehend fully, stretching nearly 50 kilometers in height.\nThe angel's body shimmered with celestial crimson light, and its eyes burned with an intensity that pierced through the abyss.\nWith a slow, deliberate motion, the angel raised its hand, summoning an immense spear of pure energy.\nThe spear was so large it defied reason.\nBut something was wrong.\nStark's grin faltered as he looked up at the rift.\nThe angel... wasn't there.\n\"What...?\" Stark's voice was a whisper, tinged with confusion and dread.\n\"HAHAHA!\" Thalveros' laughter boomed through the chamber, a cruel, mocking sound.\n\"FOOL! AND HERE I THOUGHT YOU WERE ABOUT TO UNLEASH SOMETHING WORTH FEARING!\"\nStark's mind raced, his thoughts spiraling into chaos.\nOf course, the angel was there, it was just that Stark couldn't see it.\n\"Why isn't it working?! Did I mess up the activation? Is it because we're underwater?! Or is it the rift?! Dammit, what's happening?!\"\nThe pressure in the chamber grew unbearable as Thalveros continued his ascent, his massive form nearing the exit.\nStark's eyes darted between the rift above and the monster below. Time was running out.\nThen, a golden panel appeared before him, its shimmering text cutting through the chaos.\n[Aren't you going to ask me to shoot?]\nStark blinked, momentarily stunned. \"You're here?! Where the hell are you?!\"\n[My form is too large for this cavern,] the angel replied, its tone calm and almost amused. [I'm above. Just give the order.]\nRelief flooded through Stark, followed quickly by determination.\n\"ALRIGHT!\" he shouted, his voice echoing through the chamber. \"ANGEL OF THE SPEAR, SHOOT THAT BASTARD WITH ENOUGH POWER TO KILL HIM!\"\nThe moment he heard that, Thalveros' ascent halted abruptly.\nFor the first time, Stark saw uncertainty flicker in the monster's glowing eyes.\n\"What do you mean, human—\"\nHe didn't get to finish.\nThe ceiling of the cavern erupted in a blinding light as the angel's spear descended.\nThe colossal weapon tore through the rock and water with unimaginable force, its sheer size and speed warping the environment.\nThe water itself seemed to scream as the spear plummeted toward its target, leaving a trail of searing crimson energy in its wake.\nStark didn't wait to see the impact.\n\"Invincible Dodge!\" he shouted, activating his skill repeatedly.\nHis body phased through the chaotic currents as he swam frantically toward the exit.\nHe didn't have time to think, to look back.\nHis revives and healing were spent, if he got caught in the explosion, it was over.\nThe spear was about to strike.\nThalveros roared, his voice a mix of rage and desperation.\n\"I'VE EATEN THINGS MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN THIS!\" he bellowed, opening his massive maw wide enough to engulf the spear.\nBut... that was his biggest mistake.\nFor a moment, it seemed as though he might succeed.\nThe spear disappeared into the gaping abyss of his mouth, swallowed whole.\nThen, everything changed once it reached his stomach.\nThe spear detonated.\nFrom within Thalveros' stomach, an explosion of pure, concentrated energy erupted.\nThe force was overwhelming, tearing through his body from the inside out.\nHis scales, once impenetrable, shattered like glass.\nHis monstrous form convulsed as the energy consumed him, disintegrating every fiber of his being.\n-99,999,999!\nThe number flashed before Stark's eyes, a grim testament to the power of the attack.\nThalveros didn't even have time to scream.\nDing!\n[You have slain \"Thalveros\" and gained 150,000,000 experience points!]\nHis body dissolved into nothingness, leaving behind only a faint shimmer of energy that quickly faded into the depths.\nThe shockwave from the explosion rippled through the chamber, shaking the very foundations of the rift.\nStark felt the currents battering against him as he swam, but the reduced force, thanks to the fact Thalveros ate it, spared him from the worst of it.\nFinally, he emerged into the main chamber, gasping for air, though he knew he wouldn't get any.\nHis eyes immediately locked onto the massive golden door before him.\nThe door glowed softly, its intricate carvings illuminated by the light of the second and third spheres embedded within its surface.\n\"Ding!\"\n[You can access the \"Apostle Chamber\" now by opening the \"Golden Door\"!]\nStark let out a shaky breath, a victorious grin spreading across his face.\n\"Three guardians down,\" he muttered, \"You're next, Apostle.\"",

      "content": "No, you can't get refunds, it's not like I care to begin with after all.\nBut I don't wanna do like all those writers that instantly drop the novel and never give news of themselves.\nSo instead, let me write EVERYTHING that would have happened in the story since last chapter.\nI can promise you it is not even more than 60 chapters since the story would have begun to speed up from there.\nSo here we go:\n(Note that everything from there on is a direct continuation of last chapter)\nStark would open the [Golden Door] after waiting for 24 hours, then after that he would simply use [Heaven's Wrath] to kill the apostle.\nAfterward, he would go back to the Association and be congratulated, but Stark wouldn't be happy as he still had two more.\nAnd I'm not even kidding from there on, the two other missions would have happened in only two chapters.\nBasically, each chapter would be a mission, and the entire point of these two would have been that Stark grew so tired of everything happening that he was simply using [Heaven's Wrath] at the start of the battle, instantly killing them both.\nThe second apostle of the third line is the [Great Serpent], which is level 820 and Universal.\nThe third apostle would be a massive wolf that wields thunder, it's name is [Yoru], and it's level 900, Universal too.\nHe would need to accompany the association and its people in one giant suicide mission.\nThat's when he would go past level 175 and reach level 183, unlocking the skill [Blade Rains], which would basically summon hundreds of blades in the sky, each one dealing very good damage.\nOh, and by the way, Stark would also clear that rift, thus gaining another max thing that he would use on his [Meteor Crash], which would reach level 80 and immediately unlock another skill just a little less powerful than [Heaven's Wraith].\nThe academy year is canceled by the way because of all the destruction and deaths, and slowly, the timer that announced the descent of the [Godless Demon] would keep going down.\nWhen there were a little less than two months left, and Stark was level 199, he would meet two familiar people who ambush him.\nThe first is Daniel, the man that bullied him at the start of the story and whom Stark humbled, and the other is his own brother.\nBut technically, since Stark knew nothing about his \"brother\" since he was reincarnated, he kills the two of them without mercy after an intense battle.\n\"There was no grudge between us, you just attacked the wrong person,\" he looked at their dead bodies with the most neutral of expressions.\nAfter that, he would reach level 200.\nDing!\n[You have the maximum level!]\nHe would of course unlock the final class, which was [Beast Tamer], thus getting a small but cute crimson-wolf made out of aura.\nIts name would be [Ember], and it would be at level 200 since it follows its master.\nThe characteristics of Ember would be that it can go from a small and cute pet to a terrifying beast capable of killing level 1000 monsters and classifiers.\nHe would also get the other classes since he's kind of forced to.\n[+Assassin], which would increase his agility to 99,999.\n[+Warrior], which would increase his strength to 99,999 and enhance the power of his [Sword Rain] skill, making it reach level 100, thus making it terrifyingly strong.\n[+Archer], it doesn't give him a boost, but he unlocks the [Crimson Bow] skill, which allows him to summon a giant bow out of his aura, and send [Crimson Arrows].\nAll of this would have happened in 35 chapters by the way.\nAnd so with this:\nStark would have reached his max level, he would have unlocked all his classes, as well as all his skills and possible perks, and he spent all his skill points.\nOnly one thing would be left: The Final Trial, which is where the final battle would happen.\n[Your trial will happen the moment the timer reaches 0]\nAnd so of course, Stark waits, passing the time with his girlfriends and enjoying his life, though of course the feeling of dread never leaving his side.\nBut then, the time arrives, and so the call for the trial also comes.\n\"Goodbye,\" he announces to the girls, smiling, \"Hopefully I'll come back, if I don't, I'll at least take that bastard with me.\"\nWhat Stark didn't know at that moment was that all three girls were pregnant, but as he explained the situation and that the world was at stake, they didn't inform him.\nHe enters the fourth trial, which is immediately broadcast for the entire world to see it, and of course, that includes the association, his family and the girls.\n[The fate of this world will play now.]\nThat would be the first message that appears as the arena reveals itself.\n[Fourth Domination Trial: Fate]\nImmediately, the two other apostles, who are named: \"Yumi\" and \"Yuma\", two angels with wings as big as skyscrapers, would come to stop him, but he would kill them.\nBoth of them are level 999 by the way and from the [Divine] rank, which is above Universal.\nAnd then... he meets the Godless Demon.\nHe was a demon the size of the [Angel of the Spear], but to make it easier, the joins with his true form: it was 10 meters tall, with four arms, and a terrifying face.\n\"Let's end this, chosen,\" the demon would say, pointing his jagged sword at him.\n[Godless Demon]\n[Level 1000]\n[Divine+]\nThere, Stark would use every skill he has.\nThis includes the [Bomb] one-time skill he acquired before, and there would even be an entire cool moment where he believes it's gonna do a lot of damage, but the demon easily sends it flying back.\nEvery attempt Stark would do would end in failure, as the godless demon is just too strong.\nHe's gonna be killed, and [Revenant's Fury] will activate.\n[Grants 5x of all stats for 3 minutes.]\nThanks to that, Stark would destroy the godless demon, not even kidding he would wipe the floor with him.\n\"LET'S GO!\"\nEveryone, including the classifiers above level 1,000 would cheer, knowing even their power wouldn't be able to defeat that thing.\nAnd so, the godless demon's HP drop to zero.\nBut that wouldn't have been the end, far from that, because the moment Stark kills him... the godless demon revives.\n\"I can do that too, you know?\" he grins while Stark is shocked.\n[The Godless Demon has used his revive.]\n[Final Showdown]\nBoth of them were out of revives, it was truly the end, and [Revenant's Fury] effects wore out.\n\"Let's take it to the real battlefield,\" the godless demon would snap his fingers, transporting the two of them to Earth.\nAnd yes, this time, the battlefield wouldn't be in the trial, but in the actual world, which meant danger.\nThey would be fighting in the danger zone outside the countries, no monsters approaching them.\nEven classifiers that tried to be heroes would be killed, and so at some point no one dared to approach.\nNote that all of this would happen in around 15 chapters.\nAnd then after some intense moment where Stark watches back on everything that happened until now... it finally happens: he gets killed, sliced in half by the demon's blade.\n\"AND IT'S MY VICTORY, CHOSEN!\"\nThe Godless Demon would harvest the souls and power of all those that he killed or were killed by monsters, as well as all the power of the monsters and apostles, reaching his true form.\nHis true form:\n[The Demon God].\n\"Goodbye,\" he would bow out of respect for Stark.\nOn the other hand, Stark would be in the black void again.\n[You do not have any revives remaining.]\nHe was fucked, he wouldn't be able to come back.\nBut suddenly, right as darkness was about to take him, he sees the crimson door.\nHe approaches it, his surroundings filled with all doppelgängers of the other classes, each of them cheering for him.\nAnd once he opens the door, he just sees a giant crimson flower, spinning.\n\"Beautiful...\" he mumbles.\n[This is your final chance, Chosen]\nThis was familiar: it was Rher, the god that sent him here.\n[I have enjoyed watching you fight, and it has been a pleasure to see you grow, but now, it's time to end it all.]\n[One more revive, nothing else.]\n\"...\"\n[If you fail... then your soul will be mine, and I'll torture it for a very long time, long enough to atone for your failure.]\n[But... when you will atone, I'll send you somewhere else to retry :)]\n[Good luck, don't make me do that, kid.]\nHe will then be revived one last time, and the moment he does, The [Godless Demon] will turn away, his eyes widening.\n\"No... way...\"\nBut before he can finally end his sentence, instantly trying to kill the weakened Stark, the boy will shouted:\nDOMINATION EXPANSION: ULTIMATE DOMINATION!\nBasically, this is a domain where Stark can use up all of his skills WITHOUT COOLDOWN!]\nAnd so he unleashes everything he has.\nFrom [Aura Smash] to [Crimson Spear] to [Asura's Arms] to [Domination Soul] to [Crimson Bow] to [Sword Rain]: he would use up everything, each one emotional.\nHe would unleash dozens of [Heaven's Wrath] and [Meteor of Hell] (which is the ultimate perk of meteor crash].\nHe would also have [Ember], his pet, repeatedly damage the [Godless Demon], who is unable to do anything.\nAll of this would be shown outside too, everyone else shocked.\nAnd so by the end, the [Godless Demon] will be at one HP.\n\"So this is the end...\" he grins, \"I guess I should have killed when you were level 1.\"\n\"You should have,\" Stark smiles, \"Goodbye.\"\n\"Good fight.\"\nAnd with that, Stark will punch him, ending his life.\nThat's pretty much all.\nFrom there would be the prologue, which would happen 5 years after the incident.\nStark would become worldwide famous and extremely rich, living in a mansion with his three wifes: Sora, Lilith and Lana.\nEach of them had two children with him, meaning that he had six kids, with more on the way because of his [Incubus] class and thus amazing libido.\nEach of Stark's kid resembled him deeply, that is because of the way the [Domination] class works: his genes would quite literally dominate all of the girls', meaning though he had 3 boys and 3 girls from them, each of his kids had black hair and crimson eyes, not ressembling their mothers that much.\nEven [Sora] and [Lilith], even though they were from the domination class too, couldn't beat him in the genes battle.\nThey would live happily, with the girls considering the others' kids as their own too, meaning there was no discrimination.\nAnd so with that, the novel would end.\nAt the end, Rher would look down at this world, a wide smile on his face as Stark was enjoying a dinner with his family.\n[Well... I guess he did a decent job.]\n[I give him an SSS-Rating!]\n[Onto the next...]\n...\nIf you're not happy, deal with it, I earned more than enough money lol",
