    "summary": "Reincarnating into a fantasy world is truly extraordinary, especially a fantasy world with a backdrop of Heroes and Demon Lords; it was a recipe for an exhilarating and incredible adventure.That’s what Damien is experiencing right now, reincarnating into the Tensuraverse.But the first thing that crossed his mind after reincarnating wasn’t whether he was part of the grand scheme of the battle between Hero and Demon Lord, but whether he had reincarnated as one of the weakest creatures in the entire world… a Slime?Fortunately, he didn’t suffer such an unfortunate fate. But as the saying goes, if you're so lucky for no reason, misfortune will be the price you pay. Although he didn’t reincarnate as a slime, he reincarnated as a Hybrid Majin-Human instead.To make matters worse, he was reincarnated in a region that adheres to the anti-monster doctrine of a certain Demon Lord’s church, a perfect recipe for discrimination and ostracism against him.But luckily, it seems the Voice of the World took pity on him for enduring such a fate and granted him [Planeswalker].A Unique Skill that allows him to explore another worlds freely.Incredible, right?But that’s not all. In addition to this skill, he was given a skill that makes him stronger with every powerful familiar he possesses.No doubt about it, with these two skills, his future is bright…Servants, Pokémon, Majin, Beasts, and all the powerful fictional characters he once admired… it seems that building his own kingdom composed entirely of his familiars is the surefire path to becoming the strongest!--[Tensura] [Pokémon] [Nasuverse] [Konosuba] [Highschool DxD] [Kumo desu ga Nani ka?] [Soul Land] [Dungeon Fighter Online] [No Game No Life] [Mondaiji-tachi]... and others.",

The outer sides of her legs were black, the inner sides white, with two green leaves sprouting between her toes.\nFrom her appearance, it looked as though Ogerpon wore a green cloak, with large, thorny black vines growing from its upper edge, the topmost pair resembling horns.\nHearing Damien's question, her tangerine-colored face lit up, her starry eyes squinting happily into slits. \"Bo ne~ Bo ne um! (New world, Ogerpon likes it!)\"\n\"Good to know you like it.\"\nDamien watched the little creature bounce around, letting out cheerful cries, and couldn't help but smile.\nHe gently patted Ogerpon's head before opening her status panel.\n[Ogerpon]\n[Contractor: Damien]\n[Race: Elemental Spirit]\n[Existence Value (Magicule): 6500]\n[Magic: Grass-type Pokémon Magic (Grass-type Moves)]\n[Intrinsic Skills: Element Absorption, Ability Enhancement]\n[Unique Skills: Destroyer (Possesses the power to destroy any material), Grower (Can grow stronger by defeating opponents)]\n\"Destroyer and Grower, huh?\"\nWhat appeared before Damien wasn't a Pokémon status screen but a panel unique to this world.\nA month ago, Damien had awakened memories of his previous life.\nIn this life, he was a farm boy from a village on the outskirts of the Kingdom of Falmuth.\nThe Kingdom of Falmuth, located northwest of the Jura Forest, boasted a population of thirty million citizens, plus another ten million from the Free Guild, making it one of the most powerful nations in the Western Countries.\nHowever, life for ordinary civilians in Falmuth was far from ideal.\nFalmuth was a feudal nation ruled by nobles. Commoners could barely avoid starvation, existing solely to be exploited by the lofty rulers.\n\"So, I've been reincarnated into another world?\"\nFrom initial confusion to excitement upon hearing the Voice of the World, it took Damien mere minutes to grasp the nature of the world he'd been thrust into.\n\"The Kingdom of Falmuth, the Jura Forest... these are straight out of Tensuraverse!\"\nThe boy looked identical to Damien from his previous life, just younger, around fifteen or sixteen years old.\nAs for the reason for his reincarnation...\nDamien's final memory was of a truck, its headlights flashing white.\n\"So, did I soul-transmigrate, or was I reincarnated into this world and only now awakened my past life's memories?\"\nIf it was the former, Damien detected no trace of another soul.\nHis predecessor's memories, from childhood to now, felt as vivid as his own, without the slightest sense of discord.\n\"Either way, getting to live again is a win.\"\nWith a mindset of making the best of it, Damien began to accept his new identity.\nSoon, he realized his status in this world was rather peculiar.\nDespite being a mixed-blood Majin... a hybrid of human and Majinkind... his predecessor had inherited little of the Majin's power and faced discrimination from regular humans, making him an outcast in the village.\nFortunately, Damien wasn't entirely without resources.\nAs a transmigrator, he hadn't awakened a system, which was a slight disappointment, but he did possess a unique cheat.\nBack in the present, Damien closed Ogerpon's status panel.\n\"Open my panel.\"\nWith a slight shift of his thoughts, a new panel appeared in his mind.\n[Damien]\n[Race: Hybrid Majin-Human]\n[Existence Value: 3500]\n[Magic: Energy Cube Creation, Spirit Space, Appraisal]\n[Intrinsic Skills: Adaptability (Your body can adapt to any system's power)]\n[Unique Skills: Planeswalker [Exceptional] (You can open gates to unknown worlds and travel through them), Leader (By gaining followers, you can increase your Existence Value), Capturer (Form contracts with other beings, turning them into familiars)]\n[Familiars: Ogerpon]\n[Marked Worlds: Pokémonverse]\nIn the Tensuraverse, there existed a peculiar force called the Voice of the World. It provided feedback whenever an individual underwent changes, acquired skills, or experienced skill evolution.\nIn short, the Voice of the World could be understood as the rules and system of this world.\nWhenever you gained a new skill or underwent a significant change, as long as it resonated with the world's strings and left a mark, you would receive the world's blessing.\nDamien possessed three Unique Skills: Planeswalker, Leader, and Capturer.\nThe first, Planeswalker, likely tied to his transmigrator status, carried the suffix [Exceptional].\n[Unique Skill: Traveler]\nGrants the ability to leave the Central World and travel between planes or planets within the Tensuraverse.\n[Planeswalker [Exceptional]\nDamien's Unique Skill took Planeswalker further, allowing him to break through world boundaries and visit other universes.\nThe Tensuraverse was vast, divided into three main parts:\n\"The material world, devoid of Magicule.\"\n\"The spiritual world, purely of Magicule.\"\n\"The chaos world, blending material and energy.\"\nAs Damien examined his attributes, he explained the basics of this new world to Ogerpon. \"The chaos world varies based on the concentration of Magicule... high, medium, and low.\"\nEarth, where the original protagonist Rimuru had lived before reincarnating, was a material world without Magicule.\nThe world Damien now inhabited, home to Demon Lords and the Voice of the World, was the pinnacle of chaos worlds.\nKnown as the Central World, it served as the cornerstone and hub of the material, spiritual, and chaos world systems.\nMoreover, because the Central World was constantly bathed in high concentrations of Magicule, its very essence had undergone profound changes.\n\"Bo ne?\"\nOgerpon bent down, her small hands poking at the soil and stones on the ground before tilting her head. \"Ogerpon thinks this place doesn't feel much different from the old world.\"\n\"That's because you've gotten stronger, Ogerpon.\"\nDamien said, \"Every blade of grass, every tree, even a grain of dirt here is far more durable and solid than in other worlds.\"\nTo put it simply, while humans in the Central World and on Earth might look and function similarly, their physical capabilities were on entirely different levels.\nA force that could destroy a kilometers-wide area on Earth might only create a hundred-meter crater in the Central World.\nThis was the confidence that allowed Damien to travel between worlds without fear of instant death.\nThough he was merely an E-rank human boy in the Central World, in the Pokémonverse he'd just visited, he was a super rookie among super rookies.\n\"I get it now!\"\nOgerpon's eyes lit up with realization. She stood and looked at Damien with admiration. \"That's why Damien is so amazing! Zip, zap, zoom... you took down those bad guys for Ogerpon!\"\nWhat Ogerpon referred to was Damien's first journey.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "The Planeswalker's ability to traverse worlds came in two forms: returning to previously visited worlds or opening pathways to new ones.\nThe Pokémonverse was Damien's first destination and, so far, his only one.\nTo prepare for this journey, Damien had spent half a month arming himself as best he could before boldly opening the gate to a new world.\nFor his first crossing, Damien arrived in the Sinnoh region.\nPenniless at the time, he relied on trading Cardinal World minerals, prepared in advance, with the residents of a local town.\nFortunately, his first destination was the Pokémonverse.\nAs widely known, the people of the Pokémonverse were generally warm, hospitable, and straightforward.\nThis made Damien's task of securing travel funds remarkably smooth.\nWith money in hand, Damien began planning his itinerary.\nThe gates opened by the Planeswalker ability had a limited duration. In the Pokémonverse, for instance, they lasted only seven days.\nAfter that, he would be forcibly returned to the Cardinal World.\nThen, a seven-day cooldown would follow before he could open another gate.\nWith just seven days, Damien decided that the most efficient and cost-effective Pokémon to bond with was Ogerpon.\nIn the games, Ogerpon boasted formidable combat abilities and versatile mechanics.\nMoreover, she had a gentle temperament.\nThough a bit mischievous, she was kind at heart, fearful of loneliness, and eager to connect with others.\n'Close by, low difficulty.'\n'Other Pokémon require nurturing and might not even cross my path.'\n'Only Ogerpon's location is certain... go there, and I can start winning her over.'\nWith his decision made, Damien promptly purchased a ticket to Kitakami.\nDamien's luck was truly remarkable.\nHe vividly recalled that day, climbing Oni Mountain and finding, in an empty cave, a pitiful figure clutching a teal mask, alone and desolate.\nWhatever plans Damien had initially held, in that moment, he genuinely wanted to give her a warm home.\n\"Hello, Ogerpon.\"\nAfter some interaction and bonding, Damien earned Ogerpon's trust and helped her reclaim her lost mask. \"Want to come with me and see the world outside?\"\nForget the troublesome folks of Kitakami or the so-called Loyal Three.\nWith his superhuman base-world physique, Damien showed them what true strength meant!\nYes, no Pokémon were needed.\nWith just himself and his fists, Damien single-handedly swept through all of Kitakami!\nOf course, he didn't actually harm anyone.\nAt most, he destroyed the shrine housing the masks and gave Okidogi a solid knock on the head.\nAll in all, Damien's journey to the Pokémonverse was a resounding success.\nHe brought Ogerpon back with him and gained two abilities classified as \"magic\" by the Cardinal World: Energy Cube Creation and Spirit Space.\nAs the name suggested, Energy Cube Creation allowed Damien to transform fruits into energy cubes of various flavors.\nAdapted by the world's rules, these energy cubes were suitable not only for Ogerpon but also for regular humans.\nThey were akin to the compressed rations of Damien's previous life, packing substantial nutrition into small cubes.\nAs for Spirit Space, it was the result of the Voice of the World analyzing the Poké Balls Damien brought back.\nThe Poké Balls vanished, replaced by a personal spatial pocket where Damien could store his familliars.\nThese were the full extent of the benefits Damien gained from the Pokémonverse through his Planeswalker ability.\n\"It's time to leave.\"\nDamien turned, glancing at the distant village with little attachment in his eyes.\nThis land belonged to the Kingdom of Falmuth.\nHaving read the original novel, Damien knew how deplorable this nation was.\nThe nobles extorted relentlessly, living in decadence and excess, utterly indifferent to the plight of commoners.\nMoreover, the humans here harbored a deep-seated hatred for monsters, which naturally extended to mixed-blood Majins like Damien.\nDamien's race, mixed-blood Majin, stemmed from the union of a Majin and a human.\nHowever, perhaps due to the passage of time, the Majin blood in Damien's veins was too diluted.\nBefore awakening his memories, he exhibited no traits distinct from ordinary humans.\nEven so, life in the village was far from pleasant.\nThe notion that monsters were evil was deeply ingrained in Falmuth, and mixed-blood Majins like Damien faced the same discrimination.\nThis had been his life until a month ago.\nThat day, Damien suddenly awakened his past-life memories and heard the Voice of the World.\nThe Voice of the World bestowed upon him the Unique Skills: Planeswalker, Leader, and Capturer.\nBeyond the exceptional Planeswalker, the Capturer skill allowed Damien to form contracts and take on familliars.\nThis skill was somewhat akin to a \"beast tamer\" profession, but far more convenient and powerful.\nAs for Leader...\nIt complemented Capturer perfectly.\nWhenever Damien gained a familliar, their Existence Value would, to some extent, feed back into Damien, boosting his own.\nLikewise, as Damien's Existence Value increased, his familliars would also benefit.\nExistence Value was a unique concept in the Tensuraverse.\nIt was somewhat like combat power but not entirely tied to strength. Instead, it influenced an individual's total Magicule and their inherent rank.\nTake Ogerpon, for example. Upon arriving in the Cardinal World, the Voice of the World automatically granted her the Unique Skills Destroyer and Grower.\nAlong with these came an energy system collectively known as Magicule.\nHad she remained the original Ogerpon, even as a Pokémon from Scarlet and Violet with mastery over various moves, she would likely only rank as a D-grade in the Cardinal World.\nHowever, thanks to Damien's Capturer skill, a master-familliar bond was formed between him and Ogerpon.\nThis bond earned her the Cardinal World's recognition upon their return.\n\"Existence Value?\"\nOgerpon could also see her status panel. Pointing to one attribute, she asked, \"Is that the thing called Magicule?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nDamien praised her, \"Ogerpon, you're amazing! With 6500 points of Magicule, you've already reached B-rank in the Cardinal World.\"\n\"B-rank?\"\nOgerpon tilted her head, curious. \"What about you, Damien?\"\n\"As for me…\"\nDamien glanced at his 3500 points of Magicule. \"I'm probably around C-rank.\"\nIn this world, aside from regular animals, races deemed harmful to humans were collectively called \"monsters.\"\nAmong them, highly intelligent races were \"Majins.\" while powerful humanoid monsters were \"Majinkind.\"\nBased on their threat level, the Free Guild classified them into simple ranks:\nSpecial S (Calamity Grade): Beyond a single nation's ability to handle, requiring united efforts from multiple nations, a threat to humanity's survival.\nS (Disaster Grade): Can be managed with a major nation's forces.\nSpecial A (Catastrophe Grade): Capable of threatening an entire nation.\nA (Hazard Grade): Can cause severe damage to a city.\nB: Black Spider, Ogre Tribe, etc.... capable of destroying a village single-handedly.\nC: Lizardman Tribe, Pegasus, etc.... slightly stronger than trained professional soldiers.\nD: Orc Tribe, etc.... dangerous enough that three or four average adults could be at risk.\nE: Goblin, etc.... slightly weaker than an average adult, often appearing in groups.\nF: No combat ability.\nBased on Existence Value and Magicule calculations, Ogerpon was roughly equivalent to a B-rank Ogre, possessing the destructive power to wipe out a village of hundreds on her own.\nWhen combined with her Destroyer skill and the potential for further growth through her Grower skill, Ogerpon's actual combat ability and potential were even greater.\nIn short, as Damien put it…\nHe gently patted Ogerpon's head, grinning. \"My Ogerpon has the makings of a Demon Lord!\"\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"Bo ne um…\"\nPraised by Damien, Ogerpon gleefully bounced and twirled around him, resembling an adorable little girl.\nHer curiosity about the new world was insatiable.\nDanger wasn't a concern here.\nThey were at the forest's edge, near a human village where Damien had lived and knew well.\nWhat really caught his attention was how Ogerpon paid no mind to the dirt and grass clinging to her.\nIn just a short while, she'd already gotten herself delightfully messy.\n\"Bo ne Bo ne (Demon Lord, Demon Lord, Ogerpon wants to be a Demon Lord!)\"\nOgerpon had no clue what a Demon Lord was.\nBut if Damien said it was impressive, it had to be true.\n\"To become a Demon Lord, Ogerpon, you first need to master your new powers.\" Damien said, finding a clearing far enough from the village. \"Come on, try out your skills and get a feel for the changes in your body.\"\n\"Bo ne!\"\nWithout hesitation, Ogerpon began her practice.\nOgerpon had the potential to grow into a Demon Lord.\nBut not every Pokémon shared her potential.\nTo earn the Cardinal World's recognition and be granted Magicule, a Pokémon first had to become Damien's familliar through his Capturer skill.\nThe number of familliarsDamien could have was tied to the strength of his Capturer skill.\nCurrently, he could only contract up to three familliars.\nWith such limited slots, Damien was cautious about which Pokémon to bond with.\nKitakami's lonely little Ogerpon was, in his mind, the easiest divine beast to recruit.\nFrom what Damien knew, only Pokémon Gods, and Legendary Pokémon had the potential to grow into Demon Lord-level beings.\n\"Every contract slot is incredibly valuable.\" Damien mused.\nHe hadn't ruled out capturing more Pokémon.\nEven the weakest Pokémon, when brought to the Cardinal World, could be trained into respectable fighters.\nUnfortunately, with his current situation, even if he had more slots, he lacked the means to protect and nurture weaker Pokémon.\n\"I'll have to wait until later to return to the Pokémonverse and catch a Gardevoir…\"\nWhen it came to Damien's favorite Pokémon, Gardevoir was definitely near the top.\nBut reality was harsh, and he had to reluctantly set aside his dream of a psychic queen for now.\n\"Bo ne!\"\n\"Bo ne, bo ne!\"\nUnaware of Damien's wandering thoughts, Ogerpon was swinging her cudgel, unleashing a variety of Pokémon moves.\nWell, they weren't exactly Pokémon moves anymore.\nTransformed by Magicule and the world's rules, Ogerpon's moves had been converted into \"Common Skills.\"\nNo longer powered solely by her innate type energy, they were now fueled by Magicule, making them a form of unique magic... Pokémon Magic.\n\"Ogerpon feels so much stronger!\"\nLooking at the tree she'd just snapped with a single swing, Ogerpon compared Kitakami to this world. \"My strength is way up, and my stamina's gotten a big boost too!\"\n\"It's not just a few times stronger.\" Damien said, gently ruffling her head. \"The physical laws of the two worlds are different.\"\n\"The Pokémonverse is a low-magic chaos world.\"\nThe Cardinal World, on the other hand, surpassed even high-concentration chaos worlds, qualifying as an ultra-concentration chaos world.\nBy a simple calculation, each step up in Magicule concentration boosted an individual's performance by a tier.\nTake Ogerpon now: in the Cardinal World, she could shatter a tree with one swing, earning a D-rank evaluation.\n(A strike capable of breaking a giant tree equates to D-rank, a standard that holds across most worlds.)\nIn a high-concentration world, that same strike would rank as C-grade.\nIf she returned to the Pokémonverse, Ogerpon could probably take down titans like Groudon or Rayquaza with a casual flick of her cudgel.\n\"Ogerpon doesn't totally get it, but it sounds super impressive!\"\nOgerpon wore a look of awed confusion. She wasn't the sharpest, but if Damien said she'd gotten stronger, it had to be true.\nFor the only friend she'd met in centuries, now her family, Ogerpon had absolute trust in Damien.\n\"Get used to your new powers as quickly as you can.\" Damien said, glancing toward the depths of the forest. \"If we want to find a good spot to build our new home, we've got a long road ahead.\"\nHe'd already decided to leave the human village and head to the Jura Forest to forge his own path.\nWith the Leader and Capturer skills, Damien resolved to follow Rimuru's example, turning this unclaimed forest into his own domain!\n\"Ogerpon's super strong!\"\nRaising her cudgel high, Ogerpon chirped, \"Leave building our new home to me!\"\n\"Woo ya~~\"\nSeeing Ogerpon's confident, adorable demeanor, Damien couldn't resist. Before she could react, he scooped her up from behind.\n\"There are some pretty powerful monsters in this forest, you know.\"\n\"Ogerpon's not scared!\"\nDamien lifted her high, and after a moment of initial panic, Ogerpon peered curiously at the Jura Forest ahead.\n'Damien, Ogerpon will protect you!'\nPokémon trainers, Pokémon, traveling, battling... these were things Ogerpon had only seen from travelers visiting Kitakami.\nNow, she had her own trainer and was ready to embark on her own adventure!\n\"Rustle Rustle\"\nWith Ogerpon's protection, Damien had no need to fear monster threats.\nAnd so, he left the village he'd grown up in and ventured into the Jura Forest.\nAlong the way, they encountered numerous monsters radiating dangerous auras.\nFortunately, none were particularly strong. Against Ogerpon, a B-rank whose combat prowess rivaled A-rank monsters, none could withstand even a single blow.\nThese monsters became fodder for Ogerpon's experience (Magicule), fueling her growth.\nThud, thud, thud!!\nSuddenly, as Damien navigated the forest, the ground beneath him trembled. \"Something big's coming, Ogerpon!\"\n\"Bo ne?!\"\nWithout needing further prompting, Ogerpon summoned her cudgel and positioned herself in front of Damien.\n\"Roar!!\"\nMoments later, a massive black figure, nearly four meters tall and resembling a wall, emerged before them.\nIt was a black bear exuding a savage aura.\nIts arms and legs were covered in tough bristles, with faint black energy coursing over its body. A pair of blood-red eyes locked onto Ogerpon and Damien behind her.\nClearly, this beast was coming for them.\nMonsters in the forest typically had keen senses of smell and hearing.\nAnd two obvious targets like Damien and Ogerpon were impossible to miss.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

If Ogerpon could defeat another thousand monsters, she could evolve into an A-rank monster.\n\"Ogerpon got a little stronger just now.\"\n\"It feels like I've been getting so much stronger lately.\"\nOgerpon bounced back to Damien's side, tilting her head curiously. \"Is it because of that stuff called Magicule (EP)?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nDamien patted her head, explaining, \"In this world, Magicule is closely tied to a monster's strength.\"\n\"Generally, the more Magicule a monster has, the stronger they are.\"\nThis didn't quite apply to humans, though.\nHumans relied more on techniques, unlike the skill-based power of monsters.\n\"The Terror Burst Bear we just took down was a C-rank monster.\"\n\"And you, Ogerpon, are B-rank.\"\nDamien shared what he knew. \"After B-rank comes B+, A-, and the higher A-rank.\"\nIn the Cardinal World, Existence Value roughly translated to ranks as follows:\n0–1000: E-rank\n1000–3000: D-rank\n3000–6000: C-rank\n6000–8000: B-rank\n8000–9000: B+-rank\n9000–10000: A–rank\nThen, 10,000 was a threshold. Breaking it meant becoming an A-rank monster, earning the \"Hazard\" designation.\n10000–100000: A-rank\nThe A-rank range was vast, on an entirely different level from lower ranks.\nTypically, an A-rank Hazard monster could single-handedly destroy a city in the human world.\nAt the higher Special A-rank, a monster became a \"Catastrophe\" capable of wiping out a nation.\nBreaking the 100,000 Existence Value barrier earned a Special A-rank designation.\nOf course, Special A-rank had its own spectrum.\nSome Special A monsters, unable to progress further, were labeled Catastrophes.\nBut those who broke their limits and continued evolving, reaching 200,000 Existence Value, became what humans called \"Demon Lords.\" or Demon Lord Seeds.\nIn the original story, Demon Lord Seeds weren't portrayed as overwhelmingly powerful, sometimes barely qualifying as Demon Lords.\nBut in this real world, humans didn't distinguish between Demon Lords and Demon Lord Seeds so casually.\nA Demon Lord Seed was a Demon Lord... a colossal Catastrophe capable of threatening or even destroying a nation.\nThe emergence of such a being could lead to millions of deaths and tens of millions displaced.\nEven in the Cardinal World, let alone a modern society, it would be a global catastrophe.\n\"Ogerpon's gonna be a Demon Lord!\"\nOgerpon's resolve to become a Demon Lord grew stronger. The little creature's thoughts were simple: \"That way, Ogerpon can protect Damien even better!\"\n\"Haha.\"\nDamien's heart warmed. Truly my loyal companion.\n\"Come lend a hand, Ogerpon.\" Damien said. \"I'll make you something tasty!\"\n\"Ohhh!\"\nThe Terror Burst Bear was far too big for Damien and Ogerpon to eat alone.\nBut that was no issue.\nDamien had Spirit Space, where he could store the remaining bear meat without worrying about spoilage.\nThey weren't short on food... Damien's space held plenty of supplies bought from the Pokémonverse.\nBut bear paws? Those were something Damien had only heard of in his past life.\nNow that he had the chance to try them, he wasn't about to pass it up.\n\"Hm?\"\nSuddenly, Damien noticed Ogerpon staring at the fallen Terror Burst Bear.\n\"What's wrong?\" He guessed her thoughts. \"Feeling uneasy?\"\n\"A little, but not much.\"\nOgerpon shook her head. The Pokémonverse had regular animals too.\nShe wouldn't kill Pokémon, as they were her kind.\nBut ordinary animals? She didn't mind.\nIt was much like the relationship between monsters and beasts in the Cardinal World.\nMonsters were intelligent, with their own language, capable of communication and emotion.\nBeasts like the Terror Burst Bear, however, were driven purely by instinct.\nThey weren't even products of natural reproduction.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"Looks like I need to explain where these beasts come from, Ogerpon.\"\nOver the past few days, Damien and Ogerpon had defeated many beasts, including a few monsters.\nBut they hadn't gone for the kill.\nWith the Grower skill, defeating and killing yielded the same amount of Magicule.\nThis made them prefer simply overcoming opponents rather than mindless slaughter.\n\"First off, this beast we call a Terror Burst Bear... don't let its flesh and blood fool you into thinking it's like us, Ogerpon.\"\nDamien explained, \"In truth, its body is entirely made of Magicule.\"\n\"Completely made of Magicule?\"\n\"This world has three main forms of existence:\nOne, the astral body, which houses the soul and is the most fragile.\nTwo, the spiritual body, which stores power.\nThree, the material body, directly connected to the world.\"\nSeeing Ogerpon's 'I don't get it, but I'm amazed' expression, Damien couldn't help but chuckle. \"Alright, alright, I know this is a bit much for you.\"\n\"To put it simply, the beasts in this world, no matter how strong, are products of spiritual bodies fused with Magicule.\"\n\"They don't have souls.\"\nSpiritual bodies are everywhere, intangible and formless. You can't destroy them with the rules of the physical world.\nWhen the Terror Burst Bear died, the spiritual body driving it had already dissipated.\nAll that remained was a pile of Magicule-infused meat.\n\"But creatures like you, Ogerpon, are called monsters.\"\nMonsters have souls, making them fundamentally no different from humans.\n\"Ogerpon's a monster.\"\nOgerpon tilted her head and asked, \"What about you, Damien? Are you a human or a monster?\"\nFrom appearances alone, Damien would definitely be seen as human.\nBut that wasn't the full story.\nDamien was a mixed-blood Majin, the product of a Majin and human union.\nIt's worth noting that a mixed-blood Majin isn't the same as a half-Majin.\nHalf-Majins typically refer to humans transformed into Majins, also called human-Majins, a completely different concept from Damien's mixed-blood Majin status.\n\"Half-Majin, mixed-blood Majin.\"\nOgerpon scratched her head, still not fully understanding but grasping the gist.\n\"I'm not entirely sure myself.\" Damien admitted. \"From what I know, mixed-blood Majins are supposed to be incredibly rare in this world.\"\nThe Cardinal World wasn't some fantasy realm where monsters and humans could easily produce offspring.\nOnly humanoid monsters were classified as Majins.\nWhen Majins reproduce, a significant portion of their Magicule is passed to their offspring through inheritance.\nThis is true for Majin-to-Majin reproduction. But when a Majin pairs with a human, it's no exaggeration to say the Majin parent essentially ceases to exist.\nLosing a large amount of Magicule is akin to losing most of their lifespan, even for the world's ceiling, the Creation God, Star Dragon King.\n'My predecessor's origins are a bit odd.'\n'A mixed-blood Majin, yet I don't know what kind of monster the non-human bloodline comes from.'\nFortunately, Damien wasn't particularly reliant on the power his Majin bloodline might offer.\nEven without awakening it, it didn't affect him much.\n'Having some monster blood is already a win. Why ask for more?'\nIn the Cardinal World, monsters had it better than humans and found it easier to grow stronger.\nThis was evident in the original novel, where the protagonist was a monster.\nThanks to his Majin blood, Damien also had the monster-like ability to grow stronger by increasing his Magicule and evolving.\nHis only regret was not having a convenient ability like Rimuru's.\nTo boost his Magicule, he had to train himself, building it up step by step.\nAlternatively, he could rely on Ogerpon.\nBefore crossing to the Pokémonverse and bonding with Ogerpon, Damien's Existence Value was a mere 300, barely qualifying for an E-rank evaluation, about on par with a forest goblin.\nBut as Ogerpon's Existence Value climbed to 7000, Damien's saw a dramatic leap.\nFrom 300 to 3800 now... a 3500-point increase, roughly half of Ogerpon's gain.\nWith 3000–6000 Existence Value, by Cardinal World standards, he'd reached the level of a C-rank monster.\nAs for actual combat ability...\nUnlike Ogerpon, a Pokémon naturally adept at fighting, Damien, with two lifetimes, had no formal combat training.\nNone of his three Unique Skills... Planeswalker, Leader, or Capturer... offered combat enhancements.\nIn a real fight, he couldn't muster C-rank monster strength, managing only to bully D-rank orcs with brute force.\nAs mentioned before, Existence Value determined the amount of Magicule.\nMore Magicule meant greater magical power.\nThe relationship between Magicule and magical power could be likened to a mana bar's capacity, current mana, and mana recovery rate.\n(While the original work doesn't distinguish magical power, for clarity, we'll separate Magicule and magical power here.)\nFor example, 1000 Magicule versus 10,000 seems like a tenfold difference.\nBut the former recovers 1% magical power per second, while the latter recovers 5%.\nIn numbers, the former can expend 10 points of magical power per second, while the latter can burn through 500.\nThis creates a fiftyfold gap in basic magical output, not counting additional magic, inherent abilities, unique skills, resistances, and so on.\nOf course, combat outcomes aren't solely about stats and abilities. Martial skills and real-world experience also play a role.\nThe best example is Hakurou from the original story.\nHakurou's Magicule was around 100,000, not particularly high.\nYet, with his swordsmanship, he could take on foes with far greater Magicule.\nThat's the boost martial skill and experience can provide.\nCrackle~\nThe firewood ignited, flames greedily consuming dry leaves, popping and snapping.\nSkewered bear meat sat on the grill, its savory aroma quickly spreading through the crisp air.\nThe meat, seared by the flames, turned from bright red to golden brown, with oil dripping into the fire, sparking wisps of smoke.\nGulp~~\nSeeing Ogerpon drooling, Damien picked up a skewer and handed it to her. \"Heh, here, dig in.\"\n\"Thanks! Chomp.\"\nOgerpon took a big bite, her eyes squinting in bliss. \"So yummy~~\"\nDamien grabbed a skewer for himself.\nThe food in this world... whether mushrooms from the forest or animal meat... was incredibly delicious.\n'Is this the effect of Magicule?'\nDamien could only marvel at how extraordinary things were in a high-tier world.\nAs he ate, he didn't idle, using the break to ponder his future path.\n\"Martial skills, magic, combat experience…\"\n\"I've got no way to learn magic or martial skills.\"\n\"And combat experience is too risky.\"\n\"As expected, being a trainer suits me best.\"\nDamien knew his role: a summoner, the kind who stays behind his summoned creatures and cheers them on.\nHis Leader skill paired perfectly with Ogerpon's Grower, making them an ideal team.\nOgerpon could grow stronger by defeating or killing monsters and enemies, gaining Magicule.\nOf course, this growth wasn't limitless.\nFirst, each individual could only be defeated once for experience unless they achieved a major breakthrough.\nRepeatedly defeating the same target wouldn't yield more.\nAdditionally, this Magicule growth had a cap, not an endless well.\nEven so, for a Unique Skill, Grower was impressive, capable of pushing Ogerpon to Demon Lord Seed status.\nTo break through to Special A-rank or even S-rank... a True Demon Lord... Grower would need to evolve further.\nAs for how to evolve it…\nDamien's gaze shifted to his Planeswalker skill, currently on cooldown. \"I wonder if the next world will have a way to make Ogerpon and me even stronger?\"\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "Time passed quickly.\nA week had gone by since Damien and Ogerpon entered the forest.\nOn the morning of the seventh day, they finally found the perfect spot to build their new home.\nDeep in the woods, a clear stream flowed gently, like nature's delicate thread weaving a tranquil haven.\nSunlight filtered through the gaps in the leaves, dancing on the water's surface, sparkling like countless golden gems.\nThe stream's banks were lush with green grass, dotted with wildflowers that released a faint, sweet fragrance.\n\"Are we going to live here from now on?\"\nOgerpon crouched down, her small hands gently brushing the flowers at her feet, clearly in high spirits.\n\"What do you think, Ogerpon?\"\n\"There are lots of fruits in the forest, and fish in the water.\" Ogerpon said. \"Ogerpon loves it here!\"\n\"Glad you like it.\"\nDamien patted Ogerpon's head. It wasn't that he wanted to leave the village.\nHis predecessor had a rough life there, and after awakening his memories, Damien had no intention of enduring others' scorn any longer.\nSo, after preparing thoroughly, he dealt with those who had discriminated against or bullied him.\nBefore drawing the attention of human adventurers, he gathered his supplies and ventured into the Pokémonverse.\nUnlike his predecessor, Damien actually preferred the idea of being part of Majinkind over humanity.\nAfter all, in the Cardinal World, becoming a Demon Lord was the true path to power.\nThe Majin blood in Damien's veins gave him the potential to undergo a monster's evolution ritual, progressing from low to high until achieving Demon Lord awakening.\nTo reach that goal, conquering humans was pointless.\nFor a monster to grow, beyond innate potential, they needed achievements to boost their Existence Value, evolving continuously until reaching Demon Lord Seed status.\nTerritory, followers, and battle records.\nAll three were essential.\nWith his Planeswalker skill, Damien could travel to other worlds to gain power and companions.\nOgerpon's Grower skill was even more straightforward... fighting to grow stronger, naturally reaching unimaginable heights.\nTheir current location was in the western part of the Jura Forest.\nNo powerful monster tribes lived nearby, and with Ogerpon's B-rank strength and array of Pokémon moves, they had more than enough to establish a foothold here.\nEven if they encountered a monster above B-rank, they could abandon the spot immediately.\nRunning wasn't shameful.\nSurviving meant they could always return for revenge later.\n\"I'll go pick some fruit in the forest.\"\nWith a plan in mind, Damien began assigning tasks. \"Ogerpon, can you cut down those trees over there?\"\n\"Those ones?\"\n\"Yeah, from here to there, and that patch on the left.\"\nDamien pointed out the area. \"We're building our new home by the stream. Clearing those trees will give us space to plant crops later.\"\n\"The felled trees can be used to build a house.\" Damien added. \"We'll have more companions in the future, so we need to prepare enough living space.\"\n\"New companions!\"\nOgerpon loved lively environments. \"Ogerpon wants to build a big, big house for lots and lots of friends to live in!\"\n\"But… Ogerpon doesn't know how to build a house.\"\nShe quickly realized she'd always lived in caves and had no idea how to construct one.\n\"Don't worry, leave the house-building to me.\"\nIn his past life, Damien had dabbled in carpentry as a hobby, particularly in building simple wooden cabins, and he remembered the details clearly.\n\"Damien's so awesome!!\"\nHearing that Damien could build a house, Ogerpon's starry eyes widened, brimming with admiration.\nPokémon truly were creatures that could heal the heart.\nOgerpon was practically Damien's perfect companion!\n\"I'm off to gather fruit.\"\nWith his superhuman physique, picking fruit posed no danger.\nEven if a monster appeared, Ogerpon would be at his side in an instant.\nThe two split up to work.\nDamien first gathered various edible fruits he recognized, ones with good flavor, and washed them in the stream.\nHe also caught four plump fish to add to their lunch.\nUnfortunately, they'd already eaten all the Terror Burst Bear meat, or their meal could've been even more lavish.\nDamien decided to conserve the supplies he'd brought from the Pokémonverse.\nHe couldn't be sure future worlds would offer enough resources.\nIf he ended up in a post-apocalyptic or primitive world, he'd have to use his Planeswalker ability to return to the Pokémonverse for supplies... a hassle he wanted to avoid.\nSo, he'd save where he could.\nWith fresh food available, there was no need to dip into their reserves.\n\"Damien, Damien, is this enough?\"\n\"If it's not, Ogerpon can chop more!\"\nOn the clearing by the stream, Ogerpon's small frame hoisted a massive log above her head, one that would take two people to carry.\nWith her Pokémon moves and B-rank strength, trees that would take ordinary people hours to fell were snapped effortlessly by Ogerpon.\n\"That's enough, that's enough.\"\nDamien hurriedly stopped her. \"No rush, take it slow. We've got plenty of time.\"\nSeeing Ogerpon's boundless energy, Damien felt a pang of guilt, like he was exploiting a child worker.\n\"Bo ne!\"\nBut Ogerpon, ignoring his words, heaved the log with force, sending it flying.\nClearly, she wasn't listening, diving into the work with no concept of slacking off.\nBoom!\nIn just half an hour, Ogerpon not only felled the trees but even began basic processing.\nA neat stack of logs now piled high on the grass.\nDespite all this labor, Ogerpon wasn't tired... she was thriving.\nAfter years of solitude on Kitakami's Oni Mountain, she'd finally found someone willing to connect with her in Damien.\nHer fear of loneliness and centuries of isolation meant that, for Ogerpon, even harder tasks were a joy: 'As long as I'm with Damien, Ogerpon's happy doing anything!'\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"You've worked hard. Come eat something.\"\nDamien called Ogerpon to a stop, patting her head with a smile as he pulled freshly washed fruits from a basket.\nAs a Grass-type Pokémon, Ogerpon could theoretically sustain herself with water and photosynthesis to meet her energy needs.\nBut survival alone wasn't enough for a Pokémon to grow.\nA rich, nutritious diet was the foundation for becoming stronger.\n\"Bo ne um!\"\nOgerpon happily took the fruit Damien offered, her two little fangs chomping down with a crunch.\nInstantly, sweet and tangy juice filled her mouth.\n\"Delicious!\"\nOgerpon sat shoulder-to-shoulder with Damien on a rock, her short legs dangling and swinging.\nSavoring the tasty fruit with her family by her side, Ogerpon felt utterly content.\n\"We're running out of daylight today, so we'll just set up a simple tent. Tomorrow, we'll properly build our new home.\"\nAs Damien spoke, he wiped fruit stains from Ogerpon's body.\nHis every gesture was like that of a caring brother looking after an innocent little sister.\nA gentle breeze rustled the trees, their shadows swaying.\nThe two lay under the shade, easing the fatigue accumulated from the day's work.\n\"Let's get started, Ogerpon.\"\nAfter their lunch break, Damien and Ogerpon resumed their tasks.\n\"Bo ne!!\"\nOgerpon sprang up, grabbing a log before Damien could even ask.\n\"Shape this log like this.\"\nDamien planned to build a fence to protect their future home. \"Oh, and we need to dig a deep trench around the perimeter.\"\nOf course, he wouldn't leave all the work to Ogerpon... that would be unfair.\nDamien would join in digging the trench.\nTools weren't an issue. During his time in the Pokémonverse, he'd purchased plenty of construction tools and brought them back to the Cardinal World.\nWorking together, Damien swung a hammer, driving wooden stakes into the ground.\nWhenever he ran out of materials, Ogerpon was there in a flash, hauling over piles of processed timber.\nThe little creature was brimming with enthusiasm!\nRustle~~\nSuddenly, a sound from the jungle snapped the working duo to attention.\n\"What's that noise?\"\nDamien's expression grew serious. \"Something's coming.\"\nA week of forest exploration had given him plenty of experience handling danger.\nInstead of recklessly approaching, he cautiously stepped back.\n\"Bo ne!\"\nOgerpon dropped her log, flashing in front of Damien, her hand summoning a cudgel glowing with green light.\nSoon, a bizarre creature... a mix of centipede and spider... emerged before them.\n\"What kind of beast is this?\"\nDamien had purchased a monster guidebook from the Free Guild back in the village.\nYet he had no recollection of this massive insectoid creature.\n\"Appraisal!\"\nWithout hesitation, Damien cast his Appraisal skill on the beast.\nMulti-Legged Spider Beast\nType: Hybrid Insect Monster\nRank: C (Existence Value: 3800)\nInherent Abilities: Web Spinning, Deadly Venom\nDescription: A monster that recently appeared in the Jura Forest. It poisons its prey before consuming their flesh with its mouthparts.\nThreat Level: Low\n'This is a monster?'\n'Was there anything like this in the original story?'\nThe thought crossed Damien's mind but was quickly dismissed. \"The original story was just a novel. This is a real world.\"\n'The forest has countless species. It can't just be limited to what's written in the book.'\n'And since it's a monster, it should be possible to communicate, right?'\nBut the spider beast didn't look remotely capable of communication... it seemed even more beastly than the other creatures they'd encountered.\nFor now, Damien led Ogerpon back, keeping a safe distance.\n\"Hey!\"\nDamien tried to reason with the creature. \"Can we calm down? We mean no harm.\"\n\"If this is your territory, we can leave.\"\nBoth Damien and Ogerpon were principled at heart.\nIf this area was already claimed, their actions... cutting down trees and building a fence... could indeed be seen as intrusive.\n\"Screech!!\"\nBut the Multi-Legged Spider Beast seemed to understand nothing, spewing a wave of venom toward them.\n\"Damn it!\"\nDamien and Ogerpon dodged swiftly.\nHiss~~\nGlancing back, they saw the trees and ground where the venom landed turn black and reek, as if corroded by acid.\nThere was no doubt... this creature meant to kill them.\n\"Bo ne?\"\nOgerpon awaited Damien's orders. His gaze hardened as he said, \"Watch out for its venom and webs. Stick to ranged moves if you can.\"\n\"Then, take it down!\"\n\"Got it!\"\nOgerpon's lips curled, her little fangs glinting with a mix of cuteness and ferocity.\n\"Bo ne um!\"\nShe swung her cudgel with gusto.\nWith a stomp, a surge of pale green energy radiated from her, covering a ten-meter radius.\nThis was Grassy Terrain, a magic derived from her Pokémon move!\nUnlike the original Grassy Terrain, which benefited both sides, Ogerpon's version only aided her and those she recognized as allies.\n\"Screech!!\"\nThe spider beast was clearly startled by Ogerpon's move.\nThe scattered magical energy disrupted its sensory antennae, stripping it of environmental awareness.\nIn its panic, the beast instinctively sprayed webs forward.\nBut Ogerpon was ready, dodging the attack with a quick flash.\n\"Now's your chance!\"\nDamien shouted, \"Use Seed Bomb!\"\n\"Bo ne!\"\nOgerpon opened her mouth, unleashing a barrage of golden light particles.\nThe particles hit the spider beast, triggering a massive explosion that elicited pained screeches.\n\"Break all its legs!\"\nNo longer hesitating, Damien gave the order for close combat. \"Use Ivy Cudgel!\"\n\"Hya!\"\nOgerpon had been waiting for this. With a mighty stomp that cracked the earth, she shot forward like lightning, her monstrous strength shattering every one of the spider beast's legs.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

It was practically a biochemical weapon.\n\"Biochemical weapon?\"\nDamien used his Appraisal skill on the spider beast again.\nThis time, he activated the skill's 'Appraisal' function.\nAppraisal allowed for targeted analysis of an object. For instance, appraising a sword would reveal its attributes.\nBut basic Appraisal couldn't provide detailed specifics.\nWith Appraisal, you could learn the sword's thickness, length, weight, and material.\nThe precision depended on what you wanted to know.\nWhile Appraisal wasn't as convenient as Rimuru's Great Sage, it covered the basics well enough.\n\"Appraisal: Does this spider beast possess intelligence?\"\n[Notice: No]\n\"???\"\nDamien's eyes widened, wondering if he'd misheard. \"Wait, didn't it say this was a monster?!

It had a soul, but not a complete one... merely soul fragments.\nThe specifics eluded him.\nAll he knew was that this spider beast didn't need to be treated as an intelligent being.\n\"Tch, just a brainless mob, then.\"\nDamien frowned, fanning the air in front of his nose. \"Finish it off, Ogerpon.\"\n\"Bo ne!\"\nOgerpon didn't question why.\nIf Damien asked, she'd act without hesitation.\nThud!\nHer Ivy Cudgel swung, green energy striking from dozens of meters away.\nThe immense force smashed into the spider beast's head, obliterating half its body like a burst watermelon. It was deader than dead.\n[Individual 'Ogerpon' has killed 'Multi-Legged Spider Beast,' gaining 5 Existence Points]\nOgerpon's built-in experience notification let Damien know the Existence Value gained from the spider beast.\n\"5 Existence Points, 2 more than the Terror Burst Bear's 3.\"\nDamien didn't dwell on the Magicule gained from the kill. His focus was on the term 'artificial monster.'\n\"Feels like we're getting tangled in something bad.\"\nDamien shook his head, dismissing the unnecessary worry. \"Power. As long as we get strong enough, no scheme or trick can touch us.\"\n\"Ogerpon, how does this spider beast compare to the Terror Burst Bear?\"\n\"Hm…\"\nOgerpon thought for a moment. \"Ogerpon thinks the spider beast is weak.\"\nDespite her cautious approach... using Grassy Terrain to disrupt its senses and Seed Bomb to lower its guard... these were just strategies she'd developed for safety.\nIn truth, Ogerpon could've taken it down with a single swing.\nThe same went for the Terror Burst Bear.\n\"But Ogerpon still thinks the bear was tougher!\"\nIt was her gut feeling. She couldn't explain why, but the Terror Burst Bear felt more threatening.\n\"Intuition, huh?\"\nDamien trusted Ogerpon's instincts. He looked down at the shattered spider beast. \"It's an artificial construct, after all. Can't compare to a genuine C-rank beast.\"\nOf course, part of it was that Ogerpon had grown stronger since then.\nWhen they faced the Terror Burst Bear, her Magicule was around 7000.\nNow, after a full week, it had climbed from 6500 to 8000.\nOgerpon hadn't held back on this journey.\nAny monster or beast that could provide experience got a taste of her cudgel, whether it was worth it or not.\nDamien treated it like Pokémon grinding.\nFor beasts, Ogerpon minimized damage, knocking them out quickly to meet the 'defeat' condition.\nFor monsters, as long as they surrendered, her Grower skill would absorb the corresponding Magicule.\nPlus, Damien left food for the defeated.\nStill new to his awakened memories, he wasn't yet comfortable with ruthless plundering.\nHe got experience, they got food.\nA win-win!\n\"Ogerpon used this much magic for the Terror Burst Bear.\"\n\"And this much for the bug.\"\nOgerpon gestured with her short arms, though Damien couldn't quite follow.\n\"Basically, fighting the bug took way less magic.\"\nSince arriving in the Cardinal World, Ogerpon had noticed her energy reserves had grown significantly.\nNot just in quantity... her recovery speed had skyrocketed too.\nBack in the Pokémonverse, a single battle would leave her needing a breather.\nBut now?\nOgerpon could handle dozens of those fights without breaking a sweat.\nHigher Existence Value meant more Magicule, which scaled with magical power and stamina.\nCoupled with her incredible recovery rate and unique Pokémon moves, Ogerpon's strength far exceeded a simple B-rank label.\nDamien figured she could even hold her own against A-rank or A+-rank monsters.\n\"Alright.\"\nDamien didn't dwell on it further.\nArtificial monsters were too far removed from their current concerns.\nTheir priority now was burying this mangled spider beast to prevent it from polluting their land.\nIn Damien's memory, insectoid monsters often had ties to the spiritual world's insect tribes.\nOver the next few days, while working, they faced three more waves of insectoid monster attacks.\nDamien had no idea why this area had so many of them.\nBut Ogerpon wasn't one to back down.\nHer Ivy Cudgel earned her the title of the Pokémonverse's mini-Kaido.\nHaving adapted to her Pokémon-based magic, she fought with increasing ease, often taking out enemies before they could even act.\n\"Is there a nest of insectoid monsters nearby?\"\nDamien watched as Ogerpon used roots to drag the remaining carcasses underground for burial.\nHe held a dagger, a pile of materials harvested from the three insectoid monsters beside him.\nDespite the stench, Damien gritted his teeth and cleaned the materials, determined not to waste anything.\n\"Should we investigate?\"\nAs he cleaned, Damien pondered. \"No, it's just me and Ogerpon. Even if we found a nest, it'd take too much time and effort... not worth it.\"\nWith the camp mostly built, Damien decided to let it go.\nHis Planeswalker skill would be off cooldown in a few hours, by tomorrow at the latest, allowing him to cross worlds again.\nThe Planeswalker's travel ability had a cooldown period.\nThe length depended on how long Damien spent in the other world.\nLast time, he stayed in the Pokémonverse for seven days, so the cooldown in the Cardinal World was also seven days.\nThis applied only after returning to the Cardinal World.\nWhile in another world, Damien could return at any time to avoid insurmountable dangers.\n\"Might as well treat it as a monster spawn point.\"\nFor some reason, Damien thought having the occasional spider beast show up wasn't such a bad thing.\nIt saved them the trouble of hunting for monsters.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "Meanwhile, dozens of kilometers from Damien's chosen campsite, a small village of about three hundred inhabitants nestled within the forest.\nThe architecture leaned toward traditional wooden structures, with a distinct aesthetic.\nThe figures moving about were striking: men dressed as warriors, women in flowing garments, all towering in stature with horns protruding from their foreheads.\nIf Damien were here, he'd recognize this as the village of the Ogre Tribe, the same one destroyed by Falmuth's orc army in the original story.\nThe Ogre Tribe, a Majin race close to Majinkind, averaged B-rank strength, capable of leveling human villages single-handedly.\nWith a population of around three hundred, their collective power could easily fend off an A-rank monster's assault.\nBy human adventurer standards, they were a terrifying force capable of razing entire cities.\nYet, despite their fearsome appearance, the Ogre Tribe wasn't prone to destruction or slaughter.\nOn the contrary, though they loved a good fight, they upheld loyalty and honor, never targeting the weak or innocent.\nThey often worked as mercenaries, earning rewards from other monster tribes in the forest or humans outside, sustaining their village's growth.\nOver centuries, the Ogre Tribe had become one of the three dominant powers in the Jura Forest.\nTo the south, the massive Orc Tribe, numbering in the hundreds of thousands.\nTo the north, the Lizardman Tribe, with over ten thousand members, each surpassing C-rank.\nAnd in the west, the Ogre Tribe, only three hundred strong but with every adult wielding B-rank power.\nThese three forces kept each other in check, forming a delicate balance that maintained a superficial peace in the Jura Forest.\nThis equilibrium had held for a long time.\nHuman adventurers rarely ventured deep into the Jura Forest, and the Ogres avoided attacking neighboring nations or factions.\nBut recently, a swarm of mysterious insectoid monsters disrupted the peace in the forest's western region.\nThey slaughtered wild beasts and plundered resources vital to the monster tribes.\nAt first, the Ogres paid little mind.\nThe Jura Forest, steeped in Veldora's Magicule, could spawn all sorts of monsters and beasts... no one could predict what might emerge.\nHowever, not long ago, a group of their tribesmen hunting in the forest was ambushed by hundreds of C-rank insectoid monsters, barely escaping with their lives.\nIf not for the young lord leading a rescue, the group would've been wiped out.\nFor the population-scarce Ogres, every member was precious.\nEven so, two tribesmen perished in the attack.\nOne's body was dragged off by the insects, while the other succumbed shortly after being brought back to the village.\n\"We can't let this continue!!\"\nA burly, red-haired ogre addressed the elderly red ogre in the leader's seat. \"Father, gather the village's warriors. Let's exterminate those disgusting bugs!\"\nThis red-haired ogre was none other than the future Benimaru, who would later serve Rimuru and become the Tempest's marshal.\nBut for now, he, along with Shion, Shuna, Hakurou, Souei, and Kurobe, had yet to receive their names.\nIn the Cardinal World, most monsters lacked names.\nOnce named, a monster became a \"Named Monster.\" gaining a massive boost in potential and life essence.\nUnfortunately, the Ogre village currently had no Named Monsters.\nAfter all, an ogre evolving into an Oni was a legend unseen for a millennium.\n\"What's your take, old man?\"\nThe leader turned to the white-haired elder deep in thought beside him.\nThis battle-hardened, swordsmanship-master elder was revered by the entire tribe.\nIn truth, if he weren't so devoted to his swordsmanship, he would've been the tribe's leader.\n\"I've never seen such insectoid monsters in the Jura Forest. They don't seem native.\"\nUnlike the spider-type insect Damien encountered, the Ogres and other forest tribes faced a variety of insectoids... mantis, centipede, beetle, butterfly... covering nearly every battlefield role, like living weapons.\n\"But I wonder, are these insects truly monsters?\"\n\"By classification, they are indeed monsters.\" The red ogre leader said, equally puzzled. \"But we tried communicating with them. It's impossible.\"\nBeasts were unintelligent, driven by instinct, pure monsters.\nMonsters, however, were sentient, with their own tribes, often capable of peaceful coexistence.\n\"No matter what, the young lord's idea is sound.\"\n\"These insectoid monsters keep appearing endlessly, so there must be a nest or stronghold.\"\n\"Only by finding and destroying it can we eliminate these dangerous creatures at their source.\"\nHakurou's proposal won the approval of the gathered Ogres.\nThe red ogre chief began organizing a team.\nHe assigned the future Benimaru to lead, including Shion, Souei, Shuna, and Hakurou himself, to search the forest for the insectoid nest and launch an attack to wipe out the mysterious threat.\nNight fell, and Damien remained unaware of the insectoids' origins or the Ogre Tribe's preparations to hunt them.\nAfter a full day's work, Damien and Ogerpon completed their first wooden cabin.\nThe cabin resembled a tent, standing one person tall with a triangular structure, spacious enough for both to live in and shield them from wind and rain.\nA campfire burned in front of the cabin, with the two taking turns keeping watch to fend off potential beast or monster attacks.\nThis was temporary.\nOnce Planeswalker's cooldown ended, Damien planned to take Ogerpon to a new world.\nIf luck was on their side, they could find a place to rest and replenish supplies.\nOgerpon took the first half of the night, Damien the second, ensuring she'd have enough energy and focus to handle any trouble in the next world.\nThe campfire crackled, its faint glow flickering in the darkness.\nInside the wooden cabin, Damien felt the serene quiet of the night forest.\nOgerpon rested on his lap, her small body curled up, smacking her lips as if dreaming of delicious treats.\nDespite being in the wild, she slept as if wrapped in the coziest blankets.\nAs long as she was by Damien's side, Ogerpon felt utterly secure.\n'What a little foodie, drooling in her sleep.'\nWiping the saliva from her fangs, Damien gently stroked Ogerpon's hood-like body.\nHis hand brushed over the pointed horns on her head, part of her body rather than mere decoration.\nYet, her texture was surprisingly soft.\nEven her supposedly sharp horns felt plush in his hands.\nLike a caring brother, Damien watched over her until dawn, with no further insectoid attacks.\nAs the first light broke, a faint glow pierced the horizon.\nIn the hazy dawn, mist drifted like gossamer through the forest, soft light filtering through sparse treetops, dappling the damp ground where dewdrops gleamed silver on tender grass.\n\"Bo ne?\"\nWaking from her slumber, Ogerpon rubbed her sleepy eyes, instinctively searching for Damien.\nThe moment she saw him, the worry in her eyes melted away.\nIn its place was pure joy and trust.\n\"Damien, Damien, are we still building the house today?\"\nWith yesterday's experience, Ogerpon had picked up some tricks for construction.\nShe was eager to tackle a bigger cabin, one spacious enough for both of them!\n\"Let's pause for now.\"\nDamien patted her head, then led her to the stream for a quick wash. After a simple breakfast of mushroom stew and a few energy cubes, he announced the day's plan.\n\"I'm thinking of opening a gate to another world to scout it out.\"\nDamien said, \"If the new world's too primitive, we'll use our daily jump to go back to the Pokémonverse.\"\nThe Pokémonverse had advanced technology.\nDamien could import tools and resources from there to quickly set up a proper camp.\nHe had no plans to capture more Pokémon for now.\nPlaneswalker couldn't bring others along unless they were his familliars.\nWith limited familliar slots, Damien wasn't ready to use his remaining two on Pokémon.\n\"But if we hit a dangerous world, we'll come right back.\"\n\"Mm, Ogerpon will protect Damien!\"\n\"Then I'm counting on you, Ogerpon.\"\nStretching, Damien looked at Ogerpon, who was brimming with energy and raring to go. \"Ready?\"\n\"Bo ne!\"\nOgerpon flexed in a bodybuilder pose, signaling she was pumped!\n\"Nice, full of spirit!\"\nWith that, Damien activated his Planeswalker skill, now off cooldown.\n\"Let's go!\"\nA flicker of light, and the campsite was empty, save for the smoldering campfire, its smoke curling into the damp morning air.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "When Damien opened his eyes, he found himself in an indescribable space.\nThe surroundings were pitch black, save for a small illuminated area before him, glowing with a deep, starry radiance.\n\"Bo ne?\"\nOgerpon clung to Damien's hand, her small face etched with shock.\nThe little creature had no idea where they were.\nWhat happened to the promised other world?\nWhy had they ended up in this dark, eerie place?\n\"Hold on, let me figure this out.\"\nDamien was about to ponder where they were and what kind of world they'd entered.\nBut then, beams of light bloomed before his eyes.\n\"Bo ne!!\"\nThe sudden glow startled Ogerpon, who swiftly summoned her Ivy Cudgel and positioned herself protectively in front of Damien.\nDespite her shyness and fear of loneliness, Ogerpon was fearless when it mattered.\n\"Wait a second.\"\nDamien steadied her, focusing on the scene ahead.\nBefore them appeared a chair, a small round table, and a spread of tea and pastries.\nSeated in the chair was a blue-haired girl.\n\"Welcome to the afterlife. Though brief, this gentleman's life has come to an end.\"\nShe looked about fifteen or sixteen, breathtakingly beautiful, surpassing anything Damien could have imagined.\nHow to put it?\nThe moment he saw her, the word \"goddess\" flashed through his mind.\nYes, only a goddess could possess such otherworldly beauty.\nHer clear, water-blue hair gave an ethereal, gentle impression.\nHer perfectly proportioned body... neither too full nor too slight... was draped in a loose, pale purple garment, often called a hagoromo.\n\"Hm?\"\nSuddenly, the blue-haired girl, mid-recitation, seemed to notice something.\nHer clear blue eyes, matching her hair, fixed on Damien and Ogerpon, who stood before him with her mouth agape, showing two tiny fangs in an adorably fierce expression.\n\"???\"\nFor a moment, the girl locked eyes with them.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Huhhh?\"\nGradually, the expression of the beautiful blue-haired girl shifted, as if she couldn't quite grasp the situation.\n\"…\"\nDamien and Ogerpon stayed still, not making any sudden moves.\nEspecially Damien, who felt an odd sense of déjà vu, as if he'd seen this scene before.\nBlue hair, goddess-like beauty, and that outfit…\n\"Hold it!!\"\nBefore Damien could ask, the scatterbrained goddess exclaimed, \"Who are you people?!\"\n\"Did the ascension mechanism break down?\"\n\"And where did you two come from?\"\n\"This is overtime! Overtime!\"\n\"I protest! I firmly protest overtime!!\"\nAqua had clearly noticed something unusual about Damien and Ogerpon.\nAs the goddess overseeing the afterlife for young souls, no matter how dim-witted, Aqua could tell they were still very much alive.\nThis felt more like an isekai scenario.\nBut reversed... people from another world had suddenly appeared in her space.\n\"Ahem, please calm down, great Water Goddess Aqua-sama.\"\n\"Eh?!\"\nHearing Damien call her name, Aqua froze, then broke into a smug grin.\n\"Pfft, pfft, pfft.\"\nThe girl covered her mouth, barely containing her glee. \"I don't know where you're from, but you've heard of the great Water Goddess Aqua!\"\n\"No helping it, then! Fine, I'll graciously acknowledge you!!\"\n\"…\"\nAqua's reaction left Damien, who'd prepared a slew of persuasive arguments, feeling like an idiot.\nYes, he'd deliberately called her name.\nHis goal? To reach the Konosubaverse.\nIts adventuring system and skill points were perfect for someone like him, who had Magicule and attributes but no combat skills.\nBut now…\n\"You want to go to another world to defeat the Demon King?\"\nAqua plopped back into her chair, calmly opening a bag of chips and munching away in front of Damien and Ogerpon.\nIt was hard to believe someone with such a stunning, saintly face could act so rudely.\nEven worse, with that dismissive attitude, why does she still look so beautiful?!\nDamien didn't know where to begin with his complaints.\nThankfully, he'd already known what kind of goddess Aqua was.\nSo, sorry, Aqua!\nNo matter how gorgeous she was, Damien had no interest in getting involved with her.\nAssociating with a dimwit like her was a crime in itself.\nAnd with Aqua's personality, who knew what chaos she'd cause if she tagged along?\n\"Ahem, yes.\"\nDamien said, \"My companion and I are traveling across worlds, facing strong opponents to grow stronger.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nAqua didn't think much of it... her empty head couldn't hold complex thoughts.\nConspiracies and schemes? Far less interesting than Damien's \"great Water Goddess Aqua-sama.\"\nHaving heard her name, they must be her devotees.\nAnd Aqua was quite lenient with her believers.\n\"Sure.\"\nAqua said, \"Nobody wants to go to that world anyway. If you're willing to help, that's great.\"\n\"Then…\"\nDamien went for the kill. \"Great, wise, beautiful, and noble Aqua-sama, could you grant us a small… perk?\"\n\"Hmph!\"\nAqua basked in his flattery, practically begging for more. Keep talking, you smooth talker!\n\"Normally, that's a no-go.\"\n\"But who am I? The great Goddess Aqua!\"\n\"Behold! Accept with gratitude the blessing of the exalted Goddess Aqua!\"\nWith a grand wave, parchments scattered around Damien like falling petals.\n\"Ohhh!!\"\nDamien exclaimed, \"Truly worthy of Aqua-sama!\"\nThis wasn't flattery anymore... it was genuine.\nHanding out perks right off the bat? Aqua, you're a real one.\nSure, she was a bit dim, but when it came to treating others, she spared no expense.\nIn the original novel, Aqua's debts often came from splurging on feasts for entire guilds.\nEven for an outsider like Damien, she was willing to bend the rules and grant a cheat ability.\nFor that generosity alone, Damien silently vowed: If I see Aqua and Kazuma struggling like in the original story, I'll lend you some gold coins, Aqua.\n\"Choose one.\"\n\"But only one.\"\nAqua pointed at Ogerpon. \"Her life composition is unique, tied to you, so she can't receive a cheat.\"\nIn short, by Konosuba's rules, Ogerpon was Damien's summoned creature.\nIf that allowed extra cheats, Damien could summon a hundred skeletons and fleece the gods dry.\n\"Fair enough.\"\nDamien was a bit disappointed, but rules were rules.\nYou can't be too greedy... scoring a free cheat from Aqua was already a win.\n\"By the way.\"\nFlipping through the parchments would take too long, so Damien decided to ask directly. \"Is there a cheat that lets you quickly learn skills?\"\n\"Oh, that one.\"\nAqua, who often read comics and light novels in her downtime, instantly got it. \"That one lets you copy skills from people you touch. The catch is, copied skills start at Level 1, and their effectiveness depends on your own attributes.\"\nThat was Konosuba's system.\nSkill points could be spent on any learnable skill, and you could keep investing to level them up.\nTake Megumin's Explosion magic... it required a ton of skill points to unlock.\nLeveling it up demanded even more.\nMegumin's Explosion was so powerful because she specialized, dumping all her points into it.\nSo, as Aqua explained, if Damien copied Megumin's Explosion, he'd get a Level 1 version.\nAnd if his Magicule wasn't sufficient, he wouldn't even be able to cast it.\n\"So, that cheat's kinda meh.\"\nAqua said, \"You still want it?\"\n\"Hm…\"\nDamien didn't decide immediately, asking about other cheats he thought might suit him.\nBut they all had limitations or thresholds that didn't quite fit him and Ogerpon right now.\n\"Alright.\"\nWith no better options, Damien made his choice. \"I'll take the skill-copying ability.\"\n\"So, uh…\"\nAqua blinked. \"What's your name again?\"\n\"I'm Damien, and this is Ogerpon.\"\n\"Bo ne um!\"\nOgerpon was utterly confused, her mind swirling with Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing here?\n\"Damien-san, and your familiar Ogerpon, you're about to head to another world as a reserve hero to defeat the Demon King. When you succeed, you'll receive a gift from the gods.\"\n\"You can have any wish granted, no matter what it is.\"\nAs Aqua chanted, a glowing magic circle appeared beneath Damien and Ogerpon, lifting them gently upward.\nDamien didn't resist... this was the power of Konosuba's gods, far beyond his current ability to defy.\nOgerpon, ever obedient, stayed quietly in Damien's arms, not making a fuss.\n\"Hero! May you stand out among the reserve heroes and become the one to defeat the Demon King!\"\n\"Now, set forth!\"\nLight enveloped Damien and Ogerpon, Aqua's voice echoing in their ears.\nWhen the light faded, Damien found himself on a medieval European street.\nCarriages clattered over cobblestones, and rows of red-brick houses lined the way. Beastmen with animal ears and elves with pointed ears mingled among the passersby. Without a doubt, this was Axel, the beginner town from Konosuba.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"Did it really go that smoothly?\"\nDamien was still a bit dazed. He'd hoped to gain more advantages in this new world.\nBut he hadn't expected things to go this well.\nSetting aside the power level of Konosuba's world for now, its adventurer skill system and leveling mechanics were undeniably helpful for someone like Damien in his current state.\n\"Not bad, Aqua.\"\n\"Thanks a ton!\"\nDamien quickly examined the divine gift he'd received... the ability called \"Copy.\"\n[Damien]\n[Race: Hybrid Majin-Human]\n[Existence Value: 3505]\n[Magic: Energy Cube Creation, Spirit Space, Appraisal]\n[Intrinsic Skills: Adaptability]\n[Unique Skills: Planeswalker [Exceptional] (Returnable), Leader, Capturer, Learner (Analyzes and copies abilities of others)]\n[Familiars: Ogerpon]\n[Marked Worlds: Pokémonverse, Konosubaverse]\n\"Learner!\"\nSeeing the description of \"Learner\" in his Unique Skills, Damien knew this trip was already worth it.\nThe Voice of the World from the Cardinal World didn't exist in Konosuba's world.\nThe two operated under different frameworks, unable to directly influence each other.\nBut!\nThanks to the exceptional nature of his Planeswalker skill, Damien acted like an anchor cast from the Cardinal World into Konosuba's.\nLike a signal tower, he could interact with the Cardinal World's Voice of the World at any time.\nThis interaction didn't just apply to him.\nIt extended to familliars within a certain range, like Ogerpon.\nSo, the moment Damien gained the Copy ability, the Cardinal World analyzed and reclassified it.\nThe result? His Copy cheat vanished.\nIn its place was the powerful Unique Skill \"Learner.\"\n\"Let's see the purity of this Unique Skill.\"\nDamien focused on the word \"Learner.\"\nSoon, detailed information about the skill flooded his mind.\n\"Learner's replication isn't instant.\"\nDamien mused, \"It takes varying amounts of time to analyze an ability based on its strength.\"\n\"Only after the analysis is complete can I learn the skill and make it my own.\"\nIn theory, as long as the ability wasn't \"Unique\" or \"Physiological.\" Damien could copy it.\n\"Unique\" meant one-of-a-kind in the entire world.\n\"Physiological\" referred to abilities requiring specific physical traits... like a tail, a third hand, or specialized organs.\nHowever, if a physiological ability could be replicated with Magicule... like spider webbing made of magical energy rather than physical silk... Damien could mimic it with his own magic.\nThe exact limits of Learner were unclear since he'd only just acquired it.\n\"Gotta find some targets to test Learner's effects.\"\nAs Damien thought this, Ogerpon gently tugged at his hand.\n\"What's up, Ogerpon?\"\n\"Where are we, Damien?\"\nOgerpon had seen similar Western fantasy architecture before, back in the village at the forest's edge where Damien once lived.\nBut that rural village couldn't compare to the bustling beginner city of Axel.\nCompared to Axel's vibrancy, that village was a backwater.\n\"This is the new world we're exploring next.\"\nDamien patted Ogerpon's head, smiling. \"Don't worry, I know a bit about this place. Just follow my lead.\"\n\"Mm-hm!\"\nOgerpon was brimming with curiosity about this new world.\nThe dazzling market stalls and the varied attire of passersby left her starry-eyed, a sight for someone who hadn't seen much of the world.\n\"Now, let's think.\"\n\"First, we'll head to the Adventurer's Guild and register as adventurers.\"\nDamien recalled Konosuba's plot, knowing that only by becoming an adventurer and getting a skill card could he fully integrate into this world.\nWith his Adaptability skill, Damien wasn't worried about being unable to access Konosuba's power system.\nOgerpon, however, might face some adjustment issues.\nWithout Adaptability to blend into this world, she'd still operate under the Cardinal World's rules.\nAs Damien had noted before, the Cardinal World's power level far exceeded most others.\nWhile Konosuba's world had magical elements... its flora and fauna infused with magic, granting them supernatural strength and resilience... the magic concentration here paled compared to the Cardinal World.\nBy Chaos World standards, it was only medium-tier.\nIn simple terms, Ogerpon, a B-rank in the Cardinal World, would jump two major tiers in Konosuba, equivalent to Special A-rank.\nDamien could do the same by disabling Adaptability, boosting his power to A-rank.\nBut that would cut him off from acquiring Konosuba's power system.\n\"By the way, Ogerpon, you need to control your strength in this world. Don't use more than B-rank Magicule.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nOgerpon looked at Damien, puzzled, as he explained, \"This trip is different from when we went to the Pokémonverse.\"\n\"There, I entered with my real body.\"\n\"This time, it's a bit different.\"\nBy slipping into Aqua's reincarnation process, Damien had exploited a loophole in Konosuba's rules, making the system treat him as a native.\nIn essence, his actions were like sneaking in under a false identity.\n\"I want to gain this world's powers.\"\n\"So we need to keep a low profile and avoid being rejected by its rules.\"\nIf Damien disabled Adaptability and stepped outside this world's framework, Konosuba's rules would blacklist him.\nWorst case, he'd be expelled, unable to return.\nAt best, he'd lose the chance to harness Konosuba's system to strengthen the Cardinal World.\nNeither outcome was acceptable.\n\"Bo ne!\"\nOgerpon raised her hand. \"Ogerpon gets it! Ogerpon will be careful!\"\n\"You don't have to be too careful.\"\nDamien smiled. \"Just keep your power around B-rank, and it'll be fine.\"\n\"If we hit real danger, survival comes first.\"\n\"A world's just a world. There'll be other chances.\"\nWhile staying cautious, Damien saw no harm in keeping things discreet.\n\"Ogerpon has a question!\"\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\"Why B-rank?\"\nOgerpon felt incredibly strong now and wasn't sure what Damien meant by B-rank in this context.\n\"Hm…\"\n\"Let me explain simply.\"\nDamien said, \"It's about power expression. Can you follow, Ogerpon?\"\n\"Power expression?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nDamien elaborated, \"Worlds differ. The Cardinal World is much stronger. A rock there might be tougher than steel here.\"\n\"In the Cardinal World, your normal attack could destroy a house.\"\n\"That's what we call B-rank power expression!\"\n\"Now here's the question.\"\nDamien pointed at the street beneath them. \"If you went all out in this world, what kind of damage could you cause?\"\nEach tier of magic concentration marked a major power gap.\nIn Konosuba, Ogerpon was equivalent to a Special A-rank monster.\nA Special A-rank's full strike?\n\"Everything here is so fragile.\"\nOgerpon wasn't dumb... her battle instincts were sharp, and she quickly judged, \"One punch from Ogerpon could make the whole city collapse.\"\nA Special A-rank's full attack could cause earthquake-level destruction to Axel.\nThat was Special A-rank power expression!\n\"Got it?\"\nDamien said, \"In Konosuba, you need to keep your power expression the same as in the Cardinal World.\"\n\"So, Ogerpon's punch should only make a few-meter crater?\"\n\"Exactly!\"\nDamien nodded. \"That's the idea!\"\nIf you're B-rank in the Cardinal World, you stick to B-rank expression in the new world.\nUnlike his Pokémonverse trip, where Damien entered with his real body and didn't need to worry about power expression.\nBack then, as an E-rank, he jumped three tiers in a lower Chaos World, reaching B-rank.\nThe Kitakami villagers stood no chance against a B-rank Damien... one punch per troublemaker!\n\"Worlds have memories. We can fool them once, but not twice with the same trick.\"\nSo, unless Ogerpon gained something like Adaptability, she'd need to match her Cardinal World power expression in other worlds.\n\"Ogerpon gets it!\"\nShe wasn't the type of Pokémon to cause trouble for her master.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"Excuse me, could you tell me where the Adventurer's Guild is?\"\nDamien stopped a passerby to ask for directions, and with their guidance, he and Ogerpon found the guild.\nThe Adventurer's Guild in the city was an imposing structure. Even before entering, Damien and Ogerpon caught the enticing aroma of food wafting from inside.\n\"Bo ne?\"\nOgerpon sniffed. \"It smells so good! Is this a restaurant?\"\n\"The guild here doubles as a tavern. Adventurers can order meals inside.\" Damien explained as he pushed open the guild's doors.\nStepping inside, they were greeted by a grand hall large enough for a banquet, lined with neatly arranged long tables.\nThough it wasn't mealtime yet, several adventurer parties were already gathered, drinking and boasting loudly.\nThe lively chatter filled the guild with a vibrant atmosphere.\n\"Ah, welcome!\"\n\"If you're looking for work, head to the counter inside. If you're here to eat, there are plenty of open seats... feel free to sit anywhere.\"\nAs soon as they entered, a friendly waitress with short red hair approached them.\nThe arrival of new faces drew the attention of adventurers clad in armor, leather, and mage robes, their gazes settling on Damien and Ogerpon.\n\"What's that?\"\n\"A monster?\"\n\"Probably a familiar or something. It's kinda cute.\"\n\"Yeah, super cute.\"\n\"…\"\nDamien didn't mind... he looked entirely human, nothing noteworthy.\nOgerpon, however, was a bit of an eye-catcher.\nThe Konosubaverse didn't have Pokémon.\nHere, monsters... aside from the Demon King's forces... lacked intelligence, functioning as pure beasts.\nFamiliars in this world were akin to summoned creatures.\nThough some adventurers were summoners, none had ever seen a familiar like Ogerpon.\n\"Bo ne?\"\nOverwhelmed by the stares, Ogerpon shyly hid behind Damien.\nHer reaction only drew more attention.\nEspecially from some of the prettier female adventurers, who instantly fell for the little girl-like Ogerpon.\nBut since they didn't know Damien, they hesitated to approach.\n\"Come on, Ogerpon.\"\nDamien took her hand, ignoring the murmurs and curious looks.\nThe adventurers meant no harm... just curiosity.\nSoon, Damien and Ogerpon crossed the hall to the counter.\nFour staff members were at the counter, two of them women. Damien approached the one he recognized from the anime... a mature blonde woman.\n\"You two…\"\nThe receptionist, Luna, curiously studied Damien and Ogerpon. \"Er, I mean, sir, how can I assist you?\"\nLuna initially mistook Ogerpon for a human girl.\nIt was understandable... Ogerpon was barely over a meter tall, equivalent to a seven- or eight-year-old human child.\nBut up close, though adorable, Ogerpon clearly wasn't human, resembling a sentient monster instead.\nStill, seeing how well-behaved she was, and given this was the adventurers' stronghold, Luna assumed she was Damien's familiar or summoned creature.\n\"I'd like to register as an adventurer.\"\n\"Oh, a newcomer? No problem at all.\"\nLuna smiled. \"For a 1000 Eris registration fee, you can undergo an attribute assessment.\"\n\"Registration fee…\"\n\"Ahem.\"\nDamien realized he didn't have this world's currency.\nUnlike Kazuma and Aqua's frantic situation, he stayed calm and pulled a nugget of gold, mined from the Jura Forest, from his Spirit Space, placing it on the counter.\n\"We've come from far away and spent all our Eris on the journey. Can the guild accept gold for transactions?\"\nGold was a precious metal in most worlds.\nTo prepare for situations like this, Damien had brought plenty of gold, minerals, and gems.\nOf course, this gold nugget had been processed.\nDamien had analyzed and reduced its Magicule concentration by several levels to match Konosuba's standards before offering it.\nOtherwise, it'd just be \"some unknown metal that looks like gold\" in this world.\nDifferent worlds, different physical rules.\nWithout processing, Damien wouldn't dare use it.\n\"Um, please wait a moment.\"\nLuna was startled by the gold nugget. \"I'll grab the testing equipment right away!\"\nSurprised or not, Luna didn't hesitate to do her job.\nAs Damien expected, the Adventurer's Guild was a jack-of-all-trades, even handling appraisals for gold and treasures.\n\"This…!\"\nBut soon, Damien ran into trouble.\n\"Such a strong magical reaction!\"\nLuna stared at the testing device in shock, the curvy blonde receptionist exclaiming, \"It's just gold, but it has more Magicule than a high-grade magic crystal!\"\n\"Unbelievable!\"\n\"Could this gold have come from a magic crystal mine?\"\nNot just Luna, but the gold shop owner called to appraise it was equally stunned.\n\"Er, well…\"\nDamien scratched his cheek awkwardly. Oops! Guess I didn't reduce the Magicule enough.\nI thought I'd brought it down to a medium Chaos World level!\nApparently, even among medium Chaos Worlds, Magicule levels varied.\nKonosuba's world was on the lower end of that spectrum.\n\"Can it be exchanged?\"\n\"It can, it can.\"\nThe gold shop owner adjusted his glasses. \"The question is, how do you want to exchange it?\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Do you want to trade it as gold or as a high-potency magic crystal?\"\nThe owner had never seen anything like this.\nTurning perfectly good gold into a magic crystal? Young people sure were creative.\n\"Ahem!\"\nDamien got it. \"Which is worth more?\"\n\"Magic crystal, obviously!\"\n\"Alright, sell it as a magic crystal, please.\"\nSoon, Damien exchanged the gold nugget for roughly 3 million Eris.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "The initial 1000 Eris fee was waived by the Adventurer's Guild as a minor expense.\nHowever, Damien paid another 1000 Eris for Ogerpon's appraisal.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"An appraisal for this little one?\"\nLuna was puzzled but couldn't refuse since Damien was willing to pay.\nShe handed two cards to Damien and Ogerpon, then explained the essence of being an adventurer.\n\"Look here on the card... see the 'Level' section?\"\nLuna said, \"As you both know, everything in this world contains a soul.\"\n\"Any being that consumes or kills another, ending its life, can absorb a fragment of that being's soul memory... what we call 'Experience Points.'\"\n\"Normally, these Experience Points aren't visible.\" Luna continued. \"But with this card, the Experience Points an adventurer absorbs are displayed, along with their corresponding level.\"\n\"This is the standard for measuring an adventurer's strength, and the number of foes defeated is recorded here too.\"\n\"As Experience Points accumulate, beings can experience sudden rapid growth at certain points, known as breaking through a level-up threshold.\"\nIn simple terms, leveling up brought benefits like skill points for learning new abilities and boosts to attributes.\n\"Ogerpon, do you feel anything?\"\nDamien glanced at his card, noticing its attribute values differed greatly from the Cardinal World's system.\nWithout a reference, he couldn't make sense of it.\nAs for Ogerpon…\nHer card remained blank, showing no reaction even after she touched it.\n\"Hm?\"\n\"Is the card broken?\"\nLuna was baffled, assuming it was a defective card.\nBut even after swapping it out, the new card stayed blank.\nThis shouldn't have been possible.\nEven summoned creatures or otherworldly visitors should have their soul values detected and displayed due to Konosuba's rules.\nOgerpon's case, however, was beyond Luna's understanding.\n\"So strange. I've never seen this before.\"\n\"What exactly is this child?\"\nOgerpon wasn't native to Konosuba... she hailed from the Cardinal World and the Pokémonverse.\nTo put it simply, she was cloaked in the Cardinal World's laws, which Konosuba's rules couldn't penetrate, treating her as an extension of Damien.\nBecause of this, if Ogerpon unleashed her full power, Konosuba's world would hold Damien accountable and expel them both.\n\"Maybe because she's my familiar.\" Damien offered.\n\"Even if she's a familiar, the card should still…\"\nLuna mumbled softly but didn't pry further into Damien's privacy. \"May I see your card, sir?\"\n\"Sure, here.\"\nLuna took Damien's card and, sure enough, found a 'Familiar' entry listing Ogerpon.\nWhile Ogerpon wasn't recognized independently, Damien was seen as a native by Konosuba's rules.\nThrough him, the world easily classified Ogerpon as his familiar.\nThe 'Familiar: Ogerpon' entry on his card was proof.\n\"It seems this little one is quite an extraordinary familiar.\"\nLuna didn't dig deeper... prying into others' affairs was improper.\nAs a guild receptionist, she knew better than to overstep.\n\"Next, please fill out this form with your height, weight, age, and physical characteristics.\"\nWith Luna's help, Damien completed all the required information.\n\"Alright, that's done.\"\n\"Now, please touch this slate to determine your ability parameters.\"\nLuna added, \"Then, based on the values, you can choose your desired class.\"\n\"It's finally time.\"\nDamien's two biggest goals in Konosuba were Aqua's cheat ability and its class system.\nThough he already had the Learner skill, he still craved a class.\nClasses provided attribute boosts.\nThe Cardinal World gave him Magicule, and Learner let him acquire skills.\nBut Magicule only affected Existence Value.\nIt didn't directly tie to physical attributes like strength or speed.\nIn the Cardinal World, aside from natural armor and skin, Majins relied on passive traits, not a system where higher levels meant greater physical prowess.\nFor that, Damien had to seek power in other worlds.\nHis first stop? Konosuba's class system!\n\"Your strength, vitality, magic, dexterity, and agility are all excellent.\"\nLuna recommended, \"With these attributes, you could go straight for advanced classes.\"\nThe C-rank attributes from the Cardinal World translated to elite status in Konosuba.\nBy advanced classes, Luna meant options like Crusader, Swordmaster, Archpriest, or Archwizard.\nDamien didn't choose immediately, instead carefully questioning Luna about the details of each advanced class.\nTrue to her professionalism, Luna patiently explained the pros, cons, and characteristics of each.\n\"You're sure about choosing Martial Artist?\"\nLuna cautioned, \"To be blunt, Martial Artist's defense is weaker than Crusader's, and its attack isn't as strong as Swordmaster's.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nDamien settled on the Martial Artist class, a physical melee profession.\nHe chose it because its level-up bonuses aligned with his current needs.\nVitality, strength, agility, dexterity…\nMartial Artist's boosts weren't as high as other advanced classes in any single area, but they were balanced.\nIn Damien's plan, he could use his familliars like Ogerpon to raise his Existence Value, increasing his Magicule.\nWhen activating the skill card earlier, he'd noticed something.\nEvery adventurer starts with accumulated initial Experience Points.\nAfter all, a person reaching adulthood would've gained some experience.\nTake Aqua in the original story... she had amassed tons of skill points upon becoming an adventurer.\nWhy? Her base level was already high.\nSimilarly, Damien's stored Experience Points totaled over 30,000... roughly ten times his Existence Value.\nConverting Magicule to level up in Konosuba didn't deplete his Magicule.\nIt remained intact, effectively granting him an extra set of attributes and skills layered atop his Cardinal World stats.\nAlso, Konosuba's Experience Point system differed from traditional MMORPGs.\nAccording to Luna, reaching Level 100 required about 1 million Experience Points.\nWhile the max level was fixed, differences in starting points, class choices, learned skills, and growth potential meant the gap between Level 100 adventurers could be as vast as the difference between a human and a dog.\nLeader boosts Magicule, Magicule converts to Experience Points, which raise Martial Artist levels for attribute gains.\nThen, skill points can be spent on the most cost-effective skills.\nSkills gained via Learner started at Level 1 and needed skill points to level up.\nThat's Konosuba's rules.\nI wonder what'll happen when I bring these skills back.\nBut that wasn't Damien's main concern... he didn't choose Learner for Konosuba's skills.\nLearner's true value lay in the worlds he'd visit later.\nCopying Unique Skills from other worlds and making them his own... that was Learner's real potential.\n\"Please keep your skill card safe and choose your skills carefully. For quests, check the bulletin board for ones you like.\"\n\"Thanks, Miss Luna.\"\nIn their short interaction, Damien had already grown familiar with Luna.\nHe led Ogerpon away from the counter, pulling out his skill card to review the Martial Artist's available skills.\n\"Before spending points, I'll copy every skill I can.\"\nWith that in mind, Damien chose a long table, ordered some food, and, while eating with Ogerpon, used Appraisal to scan the adventurers in the hall.\n[Defense], [Steal], [Haste], [Cross Slash], [One-Handed Sword Mastery], [Beginner Magic]…\nA variety of skills, mostly low-level, but some advanced ones requiring many skill points were mixed in.\nThe only downside? This was Konosuba's beginner town, so adventurer levels were generally low.\n\"Hm?\"\nSuddenly, Damien noticed a figure in the guild, his gaze locking onto their profile:\n[Name: Yunyun]\n[Class: Archwizard]\n[Skills: Advanced Magic, Intermediate Magic, Teleport, High-Speed Casting, Multi-Casting, Magic Amplification…]\n\"Advanced Magic?\"\nKonosuba's magic system wasn't like typical fireballs, healing spells, or wind blades.\nIt was more akin to Heroes of Might and Magic's Beginner Wisdom, Intermediate Wisdom, and Advanced Wisdom.\n[Advanced Magic] required 30 skill points and the Archwizard class.\nOnce learned, it allowed the Archwizard to freely acquire powerful destructive spells.\nLeveling up Advanced Magic increased the potency of those high-level spells.\nIn short, it was a one-trick pony that dominated.\nMages didn't need dozens of spells... just Advanced Magic and specialized practice in certain powerful spells.\nThis wasn't a game world. Casting the same fireball multiple times, or choosing when and at what angle, depended on the adventurer.\nFor Damien, this system was perfect!\nNo Archwizard class?\nNo problem!\nLearner: I've got this!\nWithout hesitation, Damien copied every skill Yunyun possessed.\n\"Oh, if Yunyun's here, where's Megumin?\"\nHe hadn't forgotten Konosuba's most powerful spell: Explosion.\nSoon, he spotted a certain chuunibyou Crimson Majin little girl.\nLearner: Copying… Complete!\nDone!\nDamien mentally high-fived himself, thinking this trip was a goldmine.\nDozens of classes, over 100 skills.\nHe even found another Martial Artist in the crowd and copied all their skills, saving himself tons of skill points.\nNo wonder it's Konosuba's beginner town... talent everywhere!\nA new class, Martial Artist, plus a way to convert Magicule into Experience Points for base attribute boosts.\nAnd Learner, the ultimate cheat skill.\n\"Now, which skills should I level up?\"\n\"With over 30,000 Experience Points, I can hit Level 15.\"\nMartial Artist was an advanced class, granting 15 base skill points plus 2 per level.\nBasic classes had no bonus, intermediate classes gave 1 extra point, and advanced classes gave 2.\nThis created a clear gap between adventurers.\n\"45 skill points for leveling skills…\"\nSkills had a level cap, displayed as Lv1, Lv2, up to MAX, where they couldn't be upgraded further.\n\"With limited points, I need to spend them wisely.\"\nDamien scanned his acquired skills, ignoring non-upgradable passives and focusing on percentage-based buffs.\nLike the magic skill [High-Speed Casting].\n[High-Speed Casting Lv1]: Reduces casting time by 10%.\nSimple but brutal!\nIt didn't boost casting speed... it cut time directly.\nA 10-second spell would take 9 seconds with this skill.\nAt Lv10, it'd be instant!\n\"This skill's a must.\"\nSimilar was [Multi-Casting].\n[Multi-Casting Lv1]: Allows casting two spells simultaneously.\nAt Lv2, it'd allow three.\nSeeing this, Damien could already imagine spamming Fireball (Intermediate Magic) with Multi-Casting, unleashing hundreds at once.\n\"Everything's gone so smoothly so far.\"\nDamien had no plans to get involved in Konosuba's plot... he needed to grow quickly, and this world was too relaxed for that.\nIt was better suited for resupplying than power-leveling.\nYou say Konosuba has monsters to fight?\nDamien's answer: Not enough!\nThe monster population here was too sparse.\nIn this world, eating food that granted high Experience Points was the best way to level up.\nKilling monsters was more about solving problems or fulfilling quest contracts.\nEven reaching Level 100 only required about 1 million Experience Points.\nConverted to Magicule, that was roughly 100,000 or less.\nThe exact conversion would only be clear after Damien leveled up here and returned to the Cardinal World.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"Next…\"\nDamien turned his attention to the Martial Artist class skill list. \"Let's see which skills suit me now.\"\nThe Martial Artist class was a hybrid of physical and magical abilities.\nUnlike mages, who focused purely on ranged magic, Martial Artists used magic for support and self-enhancement.\nThis was quite similar to the magic swordsmen often seen in Western fantasy novels.\n\"Passive enhancement skills activate permanently once selected... nice, I'll take those.\"\n\"No need to invest in active skills for now.\"\nDamien mused, \"The Level 1 skills I copied from others are enough.\"\n[Strength Enhancement Lv1]: Increases base Strength attribute by 15%\n[Robust Vitality Lv1]: Increases max HP by 15%, boosts HP recovery speed by 50%\n[Agility Lv1]: Increases base Agility attribute by 15%\n…\nAmong the Martial Artist's skills, Damien favored those boosting strength, HP, agility, and recovery speed.\nThese skills tied to \"base attributes.\"\nBase attributes in Konosuba came from leveling up, with a cap at Level 100.\nOf course, this was just Konosuba's level system.\nDamien planned to visit other worlds to find more ways to convert Magicule into physical strength.\nHe theorized these skills didn't just boost Konosuba's attributes but enhanced his core self.\nFor example, if Konosuba's Level 100 granted 10,000 HP, maxing [Robust Vitality] would increase it by 1.5 times, to 25,000.\nOther skills followed similar limits.\nBut!\nIf these skills enhanced Damien himself, not just the fixed 10,000 HP, then after amassing vitality across multiple worlds... say, 1,000,000 HP... maxed Robust Vitality would add 1,500,000.\nThis was a boost beyond Konosuba's class panel.\nIt applied permanently to Damien, not just a Level 100 Konosuba character.\n\"No hesitation needed!\"\nDamien decisively spent 9 skill points on \"Vitality.\" upgrading it to [Robust Vitality LvMAX].\n\"Whoa!\"\n\"This feeling! Hiss~~ It's something else.\"\nIn that moment, Damien felt a surge of vibrant life force coursing through him.\nHis body's recovery ability also skyrocketed.\nIn numbers, it was a 150% boost to base HP and a 500% increase in base recovery speed.\n\"What a domineering skill!\"\nDamien clearly felt the power of Robust Vitality.\nExclusive to the advanced Martial Artist class, other classes might have similar skills, but their numerical boosts wouldn't compare.\nAmong the many copied skills, one from the Crusader class caught Damien's attention.\n[Life Link LvMAX]: Crusader exclusive skill. Bind to a teammate to share HP.\nSimple and brutal.\nLife Link meant shared HP.\nThe downside? Damage was calculated based on the one attacked.\nA Crusader had higher defense than a squishy mage.\nBut if the mage was hit, the shared HP pool would take a big hit.\nIn other words, it was like giving the Crusader a weak point... attack the mage to bypass the knight's armor and defense.\nThe benefits, though, were clear.\nIt protected teammates, prevented sudden losses, and added extra HP.\n\"It seems like a weakness for the Crusader, but not really.\"\nMages typically stayed in the back, rarely taking hits.\nThe frontline Crusader, meanwhile, gained the mage's HP as a bonus.\nWith good team synergy, this skill was practically god-tier.\nThe front line wouldn't fall, so the back line stayed safe.\nEven in emergencies, it prevented losing key damage dealers, boosting fault tolerance.\n\"Ogerpon.\"\nLife Link immediately made Damien think of his trusty partner.\nAs his familliar, Ogerpon naturally qualified as a \"teammate.\"\nAfter explaining Life Link's effects, Ogerpon agreed without hesitation.\n\"This way, Ogerpon can protect Damien even better!\"\nHer mission was to keep Damien safe. If anything happened to him, she'd lose it.\nNow, with this skill, she wouldn't have to worry about anyone sneak-attacking her Trainer.\n[Link Complete. Target: Familiar 'Ogerpon']\nDamien checked his skill card, noticing his HP hadn't increased.\nIs it because Konosuba's system can't detect Ogerpon's attributes?\nHe considered the possibility but could feel a new connection between them.\nThe HP sharing from Life Link was active.\nIt just worked differently than he'd expected.\nDamien didn't dwell on it.\nKnowing they could protect each other was enough.\n\"Um…\"\nA mage girl in a witch hat, dressed lightly, cautiously eyed Ogerpon. \"Can I… hold her?\"\n\"Ogerpon?\"\n\"Bo ne!\"\nOgerpon could clearly sense others' intentions, good or bad.\nShe didn't mind the people here.\nThey seemed to like her.\n\"Bo ne bo ne!\"\nBut Ogerpon had her own conditions.\n\"What's she saying?\"\nThe mage girl stood nervously, both anxious and excited.\n\"Girls are fine, but men? No way... she'll attack.\"\nDamien wasn't about to let his little buddy be touched by rough-looking guys.\n\"No problem!\"\nThe mage girl patted her chest confidently. \"We'll keep her safe and won't let any smelly guys near!\"\n\"Alright, then it's fine.\"\n\"Bo ne!!\"\nOgerpon raised her hand, her adorable demeanor instantly winning over the female adventurers.\n\"Eek!!\"\nSure enough, the guild's girls had been watching Ogerpon for a while.\nWith Damien's introduction, they swarmed over.\nIn no time, Ogerpon became the guild's darling, showered with affection by the female adventurers.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Refreshing!\"\nWiping the foam from his lips, Damien thought, No wonder Aqua loves this stuff... it's damn good.\n\"Not bad, right?\"\nThe bald, burly adventurer grinned. \"That's Axel's signature fizz ale!\"\n\"Really hits the spot.\"\nAs Damien spoke, other male adventurers crowded around, introducing themselves.\nAxel's adventurer circle was tight-knit.\nEveryone pretty much knew each other.\nWhen a newbie joined, they'd make a point to connect... same as with Aqua and Kazuma in the original story.\n\"Miss Luna!\"\nAfter being offered a third mug of fizz ale, Damien couldn't sit still.\nHe knew what these old-timers were up to.\nThey'd seen him score 3 million Eris and wanted him to foot the bill for drinks.\nBut Damien didn't care!\nHe was a guy, after all.\nWhy sweat the small stuff?\nBesides, those Eris were pocket change to him.\nIf he wanted, he could pull out a hundred, a thousand more magic-infused gold nuggets.\n\"Fizz ale's on me today... drink up!\"\nDamien tossed out a few more diluted-magic gold nuggets. \"The drinks are on me! I'm paying!!!\"\n\"Woooo!!!\"\n\"Long live the newbie!!\"\n\"Damien! Damien! Damien!!\"\n\"Hahaha~~\"\nCaught up in the guild's rowdy energy, Damien joined the boisterous adventurers, drinking and joking.\nMoney flowed like water, but the stress from a month of crossing worlds melted away just as fast.\n\"No… no more… I'm done…\"\n\"I'm… at my limit…\"\nBurp~~\nThe guild was littered with sprawled-out adventurers, but Damien stood tall, downing his final sip of fizz ale.\n\"Hmph.\"\nTossing his wooden mug onto a towering pile, he scanned the room with a smug smirk. \"A bunch of lightweights, huh? That's it?!\"\nSadly, the bald guy who'd started it all was already passed out.\nOtherwise, he'd probably have said, \"Sorry, Damien-sama, for not keeping up.\"\n\"Bo ne~~\"\nWith the chaos subsiding, Ogerpon hopped over from the crowd of girls.\nShe was thrilled.\nThe ladies here weren't just pretty... they were kind and had ordered her tons of food.\nEnergy Cubes were tasty, but nothing beat the satisfaction of chowing down on meat.\nAs a Grass-type Pokémon, Ogerpon could survive on water and sunlight alone.\nBut she could also eat meat or even digest plant fibers to get by.\n\"Full yet?\" Damien asked. \"If not, we can order more.\"\n\"Ogerpon's stuffed.\"\nShe patted her rounded belly, beaming with satisfaction. \"Everyone gave Ogerpon so much yummy food. Ogerpon likes them!\"\n\"Good to hear.\"\nDamien was glad Ogerpon was enjoying this world.\nWhen he took her from the Pokémonverse, he'd promised they'd see countless amazing sights together.\nThe Cardinal World's forest adventures aside, Axel's beginner town had brought her plenty of joy.\n\"Miss Luna.\"\nBefore leaving the guild, Damien settled the tab with Luna. \"After the fizz ale costs, I've got 2.4 million Eris left.\"\n\"Mm.\"\n\"Keep the change. Get some tasty treats for the lovely ladies here.\"\n\"And for you too, Miss Luna.\"\nDamien waved to the crowd. \"Today's on me, everyone! Eat and drink to your heart's content... no need to hold back!\"\nA second batch of gold nuggets had netted him 4 million Eris.\nAfter covering the drinks, 2.4 million remained... more than enough to treat the guild's girls.\n\"Consider it my hello gift.\"\nDamien said, \"See you next time, Miss Luna, and everyone!\"\n\"Bye-bye, Ogerpon~~\"\n\"Thanks for the treat, handsome!\"\n\"Catch ya later~~\"\nGenerous and good-looking, Damien wasn't like Kazuma. In no time, he'd won over nearly every adventurer in the guild.\n\"Let's go, Ogerpon.\"\n\"Bo ne!\"\nLeaving the Adventurer's Guild, Ogerpon and Damien stepped back onto the streets. She curiously asked about their next move.\n\"We'll stock up on supplies here, then head out.\"\nDamien didn't plan to linger in Konosuba's world. He needed Ogerpon to defeat monsters to boost her Magicule.\nSpace bags, lumber, stone, spices, vegetable monsters, fruit monsters, various meats, and daily necessities…\nIt took half a day, until nightfall, for Damien to finish his massive shopping spree.\nThe original 3 million Eris dwindled to 500,000, showing that Eris didn't stretch as far as he'd thought.\n\"Please send two meal sets to our room, thanks.\"\nBack at the inn, Damien ordered food from the front desk, then flopped onto the soft bed, letting out a long breath.\n\"Tired, Ogerpon?\"\n\"Nope.\"\nOgerpon was a bit weary but tried not to show it. \"Ogerpon can keep going!\"\n\"No need to push yourself.\"\nDamien gently stroked her head, pulling her into a hug.\n\"Bo ne~~\"\nOgerpon wasn't actually tired.\nAs long as she was with Damien, she was happy no matter what they did.\n\"Rest well tonight. Tomorrow, we'll take on some extermination quests.\"\n\"Time to fight?\"\nOgerpon perked up, eager. \"Ogerpon will do her best!\"\n\"Whoa, hold on!\" Damien exclaimed. \"Your punches are already scary enough. Any harder, and you'll blow Axel to bits.\"\n\"Bo ne?\"\n\"Ease up, use just a little strength.\"\n\"Okay…\"\nOgerpon listened to Damien. Whatever he said, she'd follow.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"Hey, Damien, my man!\"\n\"Here to pick up a quest, Damien?\"\n\"Morning, Ogerpon!\"\n\"Bo ne!\"\nDamien and Ogerpon exchanged greetings with the crowd as they approached the quest bulletin board.\nAfter yesterday's events, the guild had fully accepted them both.\n\"Mr. Damien, looking to take on a quest?\" Luna asked, approaching.\n\"Yeah.\" Damien replied, glancing at her. \"Got any recommendations?\"\n\"For new adventurers, how about this? Giant Toad Extermination.\"\nGiant Toad Extermination.\nYes, the same toads from the anime's opening where Aqua and Kazuma took on the quest and nearly got swallowed.\n\"Sounds good.\"\nDamien nodded, accepting the quest under Luna's guidance.\nThe god-slaying toads that repeatedly swallowed the Water Goddess Aqua.\nLet's see what you're made of.\nDamien was intrigued by the toads that made Aqua say, \"Up close, frogs are kinda cute, huh?\"\nThud! Thud! Thud!\nOn a lush green hillside, Damien and Ogerpon stood at a vantage point, gazing at the giant toads hopping in the distance.\nEvery breeding season, these toads multiplied rapidly, wreaking havoc on nearby towns and troubling residents.\n\"Appraisal!\"\nDamien didn't act immediately, instead using his Appraisal skill on the giant toads.\n[Giant Toad]\nLevel: 5\nAttributes: [Omitted]\nInherent Abilities: Slippery Body (Damage Reduction), Succulent Flesh\n\"Strange inherent abilities.\"\nDamien didn't know how to comment on \"Succulent Flesh.\" \"But Level 5? Not exactly strong.\"\nRather than the toads being weak, it was more that Kazuma and Aqua in the original story were just that pathetic.\n\"Ogerpon, remember what I told you about controlling your strength.\"\n\"Let's use these toads for a power regulation test.\"\n\"And then…\"\nDamien scanned the area. \"Take out that blue one over there.\"\n\"That one?\" Ogerpon asked.\n\"Yeah, that's the one!\"\nDamien pointed at a blue toad flirting with a pink and a yellow toad. \"Strutting around like that, acting all cocky... I've had enough of it!\"\n\"Get it!!\"\n\"Bo ne!!\"\nOgerpon obeyed without hesitation, leaping into action.\nShe was lightning-fast, darting from the hillside to the hopping blue toad in a blink.\n\"Ribbit?\"\nThe blue toad seemed to notice something approaching.\nIt lowered its head, its nearly ten-meter-tall body looming over Ogerpon like a mountain of flesh.\n\"Ivy Cudgel!!\"\nUnlike the clueless toad, Ogerpon didn't wait for it to react. She summoned her Ivy Cudgel and swung at its belly.\nBoom!\nAs the cudgel struck, a storm of blue fluorescence erupted, distorting the air and ground in an instant.\nA deafening explosion, like dozens of bombs detonating at once, sent a terrifying force surging into the toad's body.\n\"Ribbit?\"\nSplat!\nWith a pained croak, the giant toad's body burst like a popped balloon.\nIn the next moment, its flesh and blood sprayed, coating Ogerpon and painting the cracked ground a vivid red.\nBut that wasn't the end.\nThe shockwave from Ogerpon's strike flattened the hill beneath the toad.\nCaught in the collateral damage were the innocent pink and yellow toads, obliterated alongside their blue paramour before they could even react.\n\"I…\"\n\"Hiss~~\"\nDamien stared, dumbstruck, sucking in a sharp breath.\nHe hadn't expected Ogerpon's first attack in this world to be this destructive.\nOgerpon herself was just as stunned.\n\"Bo ne…\"\nShe felt sticky all over. The giant toad was now a pile of gore.\nThe scene sent shivers down both their spines.\nOgerpon's swing was like a needle popping a water-filled balloon... no difference at all.\n\"You okay, Ogerpon?\"\nDamien rushed to her side, summoning water elements to clean the blood off her.\n\"Ogerpon's not hurt.\"\n\"But… is this okay?\"\nOgerpon worried she'd ruined Damien's experiment. She hadn't expected the toad to be so fragile despite its size.\nIt couldn't be helped.\nAs a B-rank in the Cardinal World, Ogerpon's power in Konosuba scaled to A-rank destruction.\nSpecial A-rank... what did that mean?\nIn the original Tensura story, after being named, Benimaru, Shion, and Shuna evolved from B-rank Ogres to A-rank Oni.\nDuring the war with the Orc army, Shion's casual downward slash could carve a hundred-meter-deep chasm.\nBenimaru's Black Flame Prison could slaughter hundreds of Orcs in one go.\nWith the same power expression, Ogerpon's single cudgel strike obliterating a Level 5 toad and the hill beneath it was par for the course.\nAnd this was with her holding back.\nIf she went all out, she could probably reduce a dozens-meter-high hill to rubble.\n\"Special A-rank monsters are terrifying!\"\nAfter seeing Ogerpon's display, Damien decided she couldn't unleash her power freely in Konosuba.\nHe checked his skill card, noting a 2-point increase in Experience Points.\nThis confirmed something.\nMonsters defeated by Ogerpon still counted toward Damien's Experience Points.\nMade sense... summoners didn't have to let their summons weaken enemies and then finish them off themselves, right?\n\"Take a break, Ogerpon.\"\nDamien had her stay on guard while he stretched and picked his own target.\nThe Giant Toad Extermination quest required five kills.\nBut more was always better.\nDamien didn't want to waste time on low-level quests. His real goal was to calculate the conversion ratio between Konosuba's Experience Points and the Cardinal World's Magicule.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"I've chosen you.\"\nSelecting a pink giant toad, Damien exerted force under his feet, and his entire body shot out like an arrow released from a bow.\n\"Take this!!\"\nDescending from above, Damien crashed down like a meteor, delivering a flying kick to the pink giant toad.\nSmack!\nA familiar scene unfolded before Damien's eyes once again.\nAs his foot connected with the toad's head, he felt no resistance whatsoever, his entire body piercing through the creature as if diving into water.\nBoom!\nThe ground shattered, countless rocks flying in all directions. Damien stood at the center of a massive crater, drenched in blood, his clothes stained with sticky chunks of flesh and innards.\nBehind him lay the obliterated remains of the giant toad.\n\"What's going on?\"\nFeeling the slimy sensation on his body, Damien shuddered. \"I didn't even use magic. Is my physical body really this strong?\"\n\"No, that's not right.\"\nDamien glanced at his status panel, focusing on the new skills, particularly the passive ones.\nIgnoring the magic-based passives for now, the physical ones... Lancer, Knight, Swordsman, Crusader, Dragon Knight, Martial Artist, Fighter, Thief... combined, even at just level 1, provided over a 100% boost.\nAnd that 100% was on top of Damien having converted all his magicules into experience points to enhance his body.\n\"A body reinforced by magicules as the foundation.\"\n\"Add to that the class passives and the Martial Artist's enhancements, and my attributes have been boosted by at least 300%.\"\nWith such physical enhancements, Damien's body, already at an A-rank level, was practically indistinguishable from a Special A-rank.\nIn the Cardinal World, existence value didn't always correlate directly with combat strength.\nThe Storm Dragon, with its 80 million existence value, wasn't necessarily stronger than an True Demon Lord.\nBut Damien was different now.\nWith magicules fused into his flesh and blood, he had already surpassed nearly all monsters.\n\"Alright.\"\n\"I underestimated my own strength.\"\nDamien cast a water-element spell to clean himself, finally feeling a bit more at ease.\n\"Bo-ne?\"\n\"I'm fine.\"\nLike Ogerpon, Damien was in a sorry state, but as their eyes met, they burst into laughter in unison.\n\"Alright, just a bit longer, and we'll head back for a bath.\"\nDamien didn't return immediately, instead continuing to hunt giant toads.\nThis time, he was less reckless, using the basic Fireball spell to attack nearby toads from a distance.\nAfter slaying his 50th giant toad, Damien finally heard the sound of his magicule value increasing.\n\"Fifty toads, each giving 2 experience points, that's 100 points.\"\nAt level 15, fighting level 5 monsters naturally came with an experience penalty, so he only gained 2 points per toad.\nBut what truly shocked Damien wasn't this... it was the conversion rate between experience points and magicules.\nMagicules converted to experience points at a 1:10 ratio.\nBut the reverse, experience points to magicules, was a staggering 100:1.\nThis massive disparity left Damien dumbfounded.\n\"Why?\"\nHe pondered for a long time before arriving at a possible explanation: \"The experience points in the Konosubaverse are low-tier energy. Converting low-tier to high-tier energy naturally comes with a huge ratio.\"\n\"The earlier conversion of magicules to experience points likely faced some kind of interference.\"\nIt was like a bad signal reception... magicules suffered some loss during the conversion process.\n\"If that's the case, then experience points aren't as cost-effective as I thought.\"\n\"Even if I reached max level, that's only 1 million experience points.\"\n\"Converted, that's just 10,000 magicules.\"\nTo reach max level in the Konosubaverse, Damien couldn't even imagine how many monsters he'd need to defeat or how much experience-rich food he'd have to consume.\n\"Whatever, even if it's only 10,000, it's still magicules.\"\n\"It's better than nothing.\"\nDamien shook his head, pushing aside his swirling thoughts, and called to Ogerpon, \"Let's go, we're heading back.\"\nBoom!!\nHalfway back, a dazzling beam of light descended from the sky, landing not far from Axel City.\n\"What's that?\"\nThe familiar sight sparked a realization in Damien, \"Could it be that Advocate of Gender Equality and the Useless Goddess get Isekai'd?\"\nHis thoughts on Kazuma...\nHow to put it?\nPretty bizarre.\nDamien didn't dislike him.\nFor a guy with no cheat powers, dragging along a bunch of problematic teammates and still managing to defeat the Demon King?\nHonestly, that was pretty impressive.\nOf course, Damien had no intention of interacting with the original Konosuba crew.\nHis sole focus was on getting stronger.\nHe had no time to waste on Konosuba's comedic daily antics.\n\"Let Aqua and Kazuma toil at the construction site for half a month first.\"\n\"This way, Ogerpon.\"\nWithout hesitation, Damien grabbed Ogerpon and headed in the opposite direction of Aqua and Kazuma.\nGetting tangled up with those two now? Damien was genuinely worried he'd get dragged into their mess.\nEspecially Aqua...\nEven with the gratitude for his original cheat, Damien didn't dare get too close to her.\nThe two returned to the inn, where they took a bath.\nThe townsfolk along the way didn't pay much attention to their blood-soaked, disheveled appearance.\nAdventurers, after all, were expected to look rough.\nUnbeknownst to them, across the stream, a blonde girl clad in Crusader armor was trembling with flushed cheeks, utterly shocked by the scene.\nHuff~ Huff~\nThe girl named Darkness clenched her fists tightly. \"That man, he doesn't even spare his own familiar!\"\n\"Gufufufu~~\"\nHiss!!\nSuddenly, Damien, on his way to the inn, shivered.\n\"Bo-ne?\"\n\"It's nothing.\"\nDamien scratched his head, puzzled. \"For some reason, I feel like something creepy is watching me.\"\n\"A ghost?\"\n\"No idea.\"\nDamien glanced around but found nothing amiss.\nHe didn't bother using any detection skills... it wasn't necessary.\nIn a place like Axel, nothing could harm them.\n\"No need to worry about it.\"\n\"If someone dares to make a move against us.\" Damien scoffed, \"I'll show them the true might of one-shotting a giant toad!\"\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Damien.. yes Damien.\"\nDarkness repeated Damien's name a few times before continuing, \"I want to join their party.

The camp, which should have had its basic structures completed, was reduced to ruins, leaving Ogerpon... who had no idea what happened... stunned.\n\"Who did this?\"\nOgerpon was furious.\nThe camp might have been simple, but it was built bit by bit by Damien.\nIt was their blood and sweat.\n\"Those jerks who trashed Damien's hard work…\"\nOgerpon wanted nothing more than to summon its thorny vine club and give the culprits a good thrashing.\n\"Calm down.\"\nDamien soothed the enraged Ogerpon, and the two cautiously approached to investigate.\n\"These tracks… they look like they were left by some kind of giant insect.\"\nDamien crouched down, noticing footprints in the dirt. \"Did that bug monster's buddies come looking for us?\"\nSure enough, the air still carried the faint stench of those insect monsters.\nNo mistake... it was them.\n\"Damn it!\"\n\"Ogerpon hates big bugs!\"\nOgerpon felt frustrated, but more than that, it was heartbroken over the camp they had worked so hard to build.\n\"It's alright, don't be mad.\"\nDamien smiled, patting the little creature's head to comfort it. \"At least we avoided the bug monsters' attack, right?\"\n\"Besides, this is a wake-up call.\"\nDamien continued, \"This place isn't safe.\"\n\"What do we do?\"\n\"We either find a new spot for our camp.\" Damien said, \"or we track down those bugs' nest and wipe them out at the source!\"\nNo one threatens our home and gets away with it.\nIf the neighbors were intelligent Majins capable of communication, Damien, not being bloodthirsty, would have been happy to talk and coexist peacefully.\nBut these bug monsters? Forget whether they had brains... they clearly had no intention of negotiating with Damien.\nFrom the start, the multi-legged spider monsters saw Damien and Ogerpon as food.\nThe subsequent attacks were the same, all aimed at devouring them.\nIf that was the case, Damien wouldn't hold back.\nEither he didn't act, or he acted decisively, wiping them out to the last!\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

I want to charge in and wipe out those disgusting bugs.\"\n\"But we don't know their numbers or the strength of their strongest fighters.\"\n\"Rushing in blindly isn't wise.\"\nHearing this, Ogerpon felt a pang of guilt. \"If only Ogerpon were stronger.\"\nThat way, Damien wouldn't have to hold back.\nThey were the ones being targeted, yet they had to swallow their anger.\n\"You're already plenty strong.\" Damien said sincerely. With Ogerpon's B-rank evaluation, she could take on A-rank monsters and hold her own.\nIn the Jura Forest, that put her firmly at the top of the food chain.\nOnly A-rank monsters with a Disaster rating could make Ogerpon think twice.\n\"Here's the plan.\" Damien decided. \"No matter what, we need to find the source of these bug monsters and pinpoint their nest's location and distance from us.\"\nWhether they were relocating to a new base or preparing to counter the bugs' attacks, knowing the target's location was critical.\nPlus, Damien had his eyes on these bug monsters.\nBefore Ogerpon could evolve into a Demon Lord Seed, her Unique Skill Grower required a large number of monsters to fuel its accelerated growth.\nDefeating or slaying them would help Ogerpon level up quickly.\n\"I don't know how many bugs there are, but there's definitely a lot.\"\n\"If we can take them all out, Ogerpon's existence value might break past 10,000, reaching A-rank.\"\nWith an A-rank Ogerpon by his side, Damien's safety in the Jura Forest would be secured.\nIt would also give him more options when traveling to other worlds.\nSo, Damien shared his plan with Ogerpon. \"In simple terms, we find their nest first, then assess their strength.\"\n\"If we can take them, we go all in and turn those bugs into experience points for you, Ogerpon!\"\n\"If we can't, we pull back.\"\nAs the saying goes, as long as you live, there's always another chance.\nIt's not cowardice... it's a strategic retreat.\n\"Once you hit A-rank, Ogerpon, we'll come back.\" Damien added, \"and crush them!\"\n\"Yeah!\" Ogerpon wasn't afraid of a fight. \"Ogerpon will follow Damien's lead!\"\n\"Haha.\" Damien chuckled, patting Ogerpon's small head before crouching down to activate the Ranger class skill Tracking.\nIn an instant, magicules rippled outward from Damien, spreading in all directions.\nTrees, bushes, rocks…\nA flood of information filled Damien's mind.\nHe felt immersed in a grayscale world, his senses carpet-searching for traces of anything and everything.\n\"Got it.\"\nThree minutes later, processing the skill's feedback, Damien opened his eyes.\nHis expression was odd.\n\"What's wrong, Damien?\"\n\"There's a group of presences heading toward the bug nest.\"\nAs he spoke, Damien cast several spells.\n[Stealth]\n[Presence Concealment]\n[Trace Erasure]\nThree Konosuba Hunter skills activated in succession, and Damien signaled to Ogerpon. \"Let's go check it out.\"\n\"Bo-ne!\"\nWith their presences hidden, Damien and Ogerpon followed the bug monsters' tracks.\nThey traveled for about half an hour.\nAt their speed, they covered over 200 kilometers.\n\"Damien, it's the bugs' stench.\"\nOgerpon's nose twitched. \"And another smell I don't recognize... some kind of monster.\"\nBang!\nBoom!\nSkreee~~\nDamien's sense of smell wasn't as sharp as Ogerpon's, but he could hear the sounds of combat ahead.\n\"The bugs are fighting someone.\"\n\"Looks like we're not the only ones in the forest being targeted by these insects!\"\nWithout revealing themselves, Damien remained cautious.\nOgerpon, meanwhile, displayed the stealth skills she honed on Oni Mountain.\nThe two silently climbed into the treetops, using the foliage as cover to observe the fierce clash in the distance.\nThey saw over thirty tall, humanoid creatures with muscular builds, horns on their foreheads, and skin in shades of purple, red, and blue... unlike any human.\n\"The Ogre Tribe?\"\nAlmost instantly, Damien recognized these humanoid monsters.\nThe creatures battling the bugs were none other than the B-rank Ogre Tribe, native to the depths of the Jura Forest.\nHis gaze fell on a red-skinned ogre wielding a blade and a purple-skinned, one-horned female ogre brandishing a long sword.\n\"Benimaru and Shion?\"\nTheir appearances differed slightly from the anime Damien knew, but they were similar enough.\nThat made sense.\nThey hadn't yet been named by Rimuru, so they retained their ogre forms.\nPlus, transitioning from 2D to 3D naturally altered their look.\n\"The ones fighting the bugs are the Ogre Tribe.\"\nNoticing the scattered, broken bodies of ogres on the ground, Damien quickly pieced together the situation. \"The bugs must have attacked their village, so the ogres sent a team to find the nest, and now they're clashing.\"\n\"But…\" Damien frowned. \"Was this in the original story?\"\n\"Or did my presence cause a butterfly effect?\"\nHe wasn't sure which it was.\nNot dwelling on it, he focused on the current situation.\n\"There are at least 500 bugs down there.\"\n\"Over 300 C-rank monsters, more than 100 C+-rank, and a few dozen B--rank.\"\nSeeing the dozen or so mangled ogre corpses, it was clear the ogres were losing this fight.\n\"With so many bugs ganging up on forty ogres, no wonder they're taking such heavy losses.\"\nDamien considered intervening, perhaps forging a connection with the Ogre Tribe.\nHe glanced at Ogerpon, weighing whether to let her join the fray.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5

      "content": "Boom!\nAs more bug monsters swarmed from the distance, Damien hesitated.\nSure, these were characters from the anime, and the Ogre Tribe was known for its bold, straightforward nature. Saving them would likely bring more benefits than drawbacks.\nBut letting Ogerpon jump into the fray... would that be too risky?\n\"Bo-ne!\"\nSuddenly, Damien felt a tug at his sleeve. Looking down, he saw Ogerpon's eyes burning with determination.\n\"You want to fight, Ogerpon?\"\n\"Bo-ne!\"\nOgerpon sensed a kindred spirit in the Ogre Tribe.\n\"Kindred?\"\n\"I see.\"\nDamien understood. After being transformed in the Cardinal World, Ogerpon had become a Elemental Spirit, likely a variant of the Ogre Tribe.\nFinding others with a similar aura, the little creature naturally wanted to help.\n\"Alright.\"\nDamien quickly devised a plan. \"Don't get bogged down in the fight. Get them out of the encirclement as fast as you can. I'll provide support from the rear.\"\n\"Bo-ne!\"\nOgerpon nodded vigorously, then darted out from the tree.\nMeanwhile, the Ogre Tribe, trapped in the bugs' encirclement, was in dire straits.\n\"Damn it!\"\n\"These disgusting bugs must have something commanding them from behind!\"\nThe red-haired ogre, Benimaru, cleaved a centipede-like bug's head with his blade and swiftly retreated to his comrades before it could thrash wildly.\n\"That thing's hiding underground. We can't force it out.\"\nThe blue-skinned ogre, Souei, moved with agility, covering gaps and preventing further losses.\nTheir team of 40 had dwindled to 28.\nTwelve of their kin had already perished.\nFor an Ogre Tribe village of only 300, losing twelve able-bodied warriors was a devastating blow.\nWhile the entire tribe could fight, only about 200 reached B-rank combat strength.\nChildren and elders typically capped at C+-rank.\nOf course, rankings were just that... rankings.\nMagicules marked a monster's evolutionary leap, but a high magicule count didn't always mean superior combat power.\nTake Ogerpon, for example.\nWith just over 8,000 magicules, she was at the upper end of B-rank.\nThe ogres... Benimaru, Souei, Shion, and Shuna... had magicule counts 1,000 to 2,000 lower than Ogerpon's.\nBut the gap in combat ability?\nAgainst the current Ogerpon, this team of 40 B-rank ogres would likely face a one-sided slaughter.\nThat was the difference in skill depth.\nOgerpon wielded at least 30 magic abilities derived from Pokémon moves.\nShe had melee, ranged, defensive, restorative, supportive, and transformative skills.\nAnd that didn't even include her Unique Skill, Destroyer.\nIn a real fight, one Seed Bomb from Ogerpon would force the ogres to dodge or be crippled... if not killed... on impact.\nMonsters with Unique Skills had the potential to reach Special A-rank.\nThat was the weight of a Unique Skill... the mark of a Demon Lord Seed!\nHuff… huff…\nThe purple-haired, one-horned female ogre, Shion, shielded the pink-haired ogre princess while slashing a beetle-like bug with her greatsword.\n\"You okay?\"\nSeeing this, Shuna unleashed a fire magic spell, turning the bug into a massive fireball.\n\"Onii-sama, I have enough magic left for one large-scale illusion.\"\nAs the village's shaman, Shuna was one of the few ogres with spellcasting abilities, staying in the rear to provide support and healing.\n\"There are too many.\"\nShion gritted her teeth. \"These bugs are endless, coming in wave after wave!\"\n\"We can't keep this up…\"\nDespite the frustration, Benimaru knew their current numbers couldn't break through the bug nest's defenses.\nThey needed to return to the village, report the situation, and bring more tribesmen to eradicate this threat near their home.\n\"Watch out!!\"\nAt that moment, Shion yanked Shuna to her side.\nIn that brief moment, a grotesque, mosquito-like bug had slipped through their defenses, closing in on Shuna.\nIf Shion hadn't acted in time, the giant mosquito's stinger would have pierced Shuna's heart.\n\"Die!!\"\nWithout hesitation, Shion swung her greatsword, cleaving the mosquito in two.\n\"Ah!!\"\nBut she hadn't anticipated another bug breaking through.\nAs she dispatched the mosquito, her strength momentarily spent, a mantis-like bug slashed through several comrades and charged at the two women.\n\"Damn it!\"\nSeeing Shuna in danger again, Shion made a snap decision, shielding the girl with her body.\nSplurch!\nA razor-sharp blade struck, tearing through flesh and exposing white bone.\n\"Urgh…\"\nShion felt a searing pain.\nShe tried to counterattack, but the injury to her spine left her limbs weak, nearly dropping her greatsword.\n\"Heal, heal!!\"\n\"I'll heal you right now!\"\nShuna pressed her hands over Shion's wound, pale green healing magic glowing from her palms.\nBut the mantis bug was already too close, and Benimaru and the others couldn't reach them before its blades descended.\nSkreee~~\nAs the green insect blades loomed larger, Shuna's only option was to push her friend away with all her strength.\nAt least one of them could survive.\n\"No!!\"\nShion, sprawled on the ground, could only watch as Shuna faced death.\nDespair overwhelmed the ogre girl.\nShe was powerless.\nIs this the end?\nShuna felt death's breath, but she wasn't afraid.\nHer only fear was for her brother and best friend, dreading their annihilation here.\n\"Bo-ne!\"\nYet, the expected agony of a pierced heart never came.\nInstead, a clear, melodious sound, like a nightingale's song, rang out.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Whoosh!\nThud!\nBut the expected assault never came.\nInstead, a figure darted through the battlefield, accompanied by the agonized screeches of bug monsters from all directions.\nSplat!\nA single swing of the club, and a bug's body shattered into pieces.\nOgerpon dodged the splattering, foul ichor, scanning her surroundings before stomping her foot.\nInstantly, green fluorescent light danced in the air, and blades of grass sprouted from the earth.\n\"What's happening?\"\n\"This is…\"\n\"My body… it's healing?\"\n\"Is someone casting Healing Arts on us?\"\nIn that moment, every ogre on the battlefield felt the effects of the grassy terrain, their wounds slowly mending.\nHiss!\n\"My back… it's so itchy.\"\nShion, whose spine had been injured, was among those healed.\n\"Who is she?\"\nShion and Shuna turned their gazes forward in unison.\nAs the dust settled, Ogerpon, resembling a little girl, stood atop a fallen scorpion-like bug, looking down at the Ogre Tribe.\nShe wore a green grass mask, with three others... blue, gray, and red... floating behind her in a triangular formation.\nThese masks, as if carved from gemstones, gleamed like works of art in the sunlight.\nUnlike her Pokémon days, Ogerpon's Mask Glow ability had evolved dramatically in this world.\nMost notably, she was no longer limited to a single mask's transformation.\nShe could summon four masks simultaneously, using one as the core to form a quad-mask array, gaining the enhancements of all four.\n\"Hah!\"\nUnder Ogerpon's control, the grass-type energy flowed into the Well Mask, Hearth Mask, and Cornerstone Mask.\nWater, fire, rock, and grass... four energies swirled around her, turning the battlefield into her personal stage.\n\"An ogre?\"\n\"And a child at that?\"\nOgerpon's aura felt familiar to Shuna and Shion.\nBut the problem was her size... she was so small.\nStanding barely over a meter tall, she was dwarfed by the Ogre Tribe, whose average height neared two meters, making her seem less than a child.\nYet!\nThe power Ogerpon displayed.\nAnd the immense magicules she radiated silently proclaimed her strength.\n\"I'm here to help.\"\nOgerpon summoned another vine club, adopting a dual-wielding stance.\n\"Help?\"\nBenimaru took notice of her, about to ask more, but she was already charging back into the fray.\n\"Wait!\"\nHe tried to call her back, but Ogerpon was too fast.\nEmpowered by the quad-mask array, Damien's Leader ability, and her own Destroyer Unique Skill, Ogerpon's strength had skyrocketed.\nHer B-rank magicules were her foundation, but in her mask state, she could face B+-rank monsters head-on.\nWith Damien's Leader buffs, supportive magic, and her Destroyer ability, even an A-rank opponent wasn't out of reach!\n\"So strong!\"\nWhat unfolded before the Ogre Tribe was a scene of utter domination.\n\"What kind of monster is she?

      "content": "\"We can't let our ally, who stepped in to help, fight alone!\"\nBenimaru had no intention of retreating without Ogerpon, at the very least.\nBoom!\nBut before he could issue a clear order, the ground ahead began to tremble.\nThe earth collapsed, revealing hidden pits beneath.\nThe next moment, a swarm of bug monsters surged from the darkness like a tidal wave.\n\"Holy... !\"\nThe sheer number made even Damien, watching from a distance, twitch his lips. \"What are these things? There's way too many!\"\nA quick scan revealed no fewer than 5,000 bugs.\nAnd there were likely more underground.\nAs for their ranks...\nThrough his Appraisal skill, Damien noted these bugs were weaker than the first batch they encountered, and smaller in size.\n\"Most are D-rank, with C--rank making up about 20%. There are plenty of C-rank, and around a hundred C+-rank.\"\nDamien dismissed the D-rank monsters.\nFor Ogerpon's Grower ability to gain experience, the monsters couldn't be too far below her level.\nGenerally, killing anything below C--rank wouldn't increase her existence value.\nSo, despite the sheer number of bugs, only about 20%... roughly 1,000... counted as viable fodder.\n\"Even so, taking down this batch should push Ogerpon to a true A-rank monster.\"\nIn the Cardinal World's mechanics, reaching A-rank with a Disaster evaluation meant Ogerpon had a high chance of evolving into a stronger ogre form.\n\"Should we retreat?\"\nDamien wasn't too concerned about the D-rank bugs.\nThey couldn't even scratch Ogerpon's defenses.\nMore importantly…\n[Defeated C-rank monster x1, gained 4 existence points]\n[Defeated C--rank monster x2, gained 3 existence points]\n[Defeated C+-rank monster x1, gained 8 existence points]\n[...]\nSince Ogerpon joined the battle, every kill granted her existence points.\nIn just ten minutes, her existence value had risen from 8,000+ to 8,500+.\n\"At this rate, with the remaining bugs…\"\nDamien calculated silently. \"Over 1,000 C-rank and above bugs should push Ogerpon past 10,000 existence points, securing an A-rank evaluation, right?\"\nA-rank was a dividing line.\nThere was a qualitative gap between A-rank and below.\nEven the weakest A-rank monster could take on a 300-strong Ogre Tribe village single-handedly.\n\"Let's do this!\"\nDamien made up his mind. He wasn't about to let this juicy opportunity slip away.\n\"Ogerpon!\"\n\"Damien?\"\nThrough their familiar bond, Ogerpon heard Damien's voice.\n\"Can you keep fighting?\"\n\"Ogerpon's not tired at all!\"\nOgerpon was brimming with energy, smashing bugs one by one. \"Ogerpon could fight them all day!\"\nAtta girl, you're basically Captain America!\nOf course, that was just a joke.\nIn truth, the Elemental Spirit race's hidden trait was their astonishing physical prowess and bottomless stamina.\nEspecially now, as Ogerpon kept slaying enemies, her Grower talent was voraciously absorbing nutrients, converting them into magicules.\nPer Cardinal World logic, the more magicules, the more energy an individual had.\nSo, after this battle, not only had Ogerpon barely expended magic or stamina, but her surging magicules left her in peak condition.\n\"Got it.\"\n\"Then…\"\nLearning Ogerpon's state, Damien cast an amplification spell. \"Friends of the Ogre Tribe, Ogerpon and I are here to help.\"\n\"That voice?\"\nOn the battlefield, the regrouped ogres, led by Benimaru, looked up to find the source.\n\"Is he talking about Ogerpon, that terrifyingly strong little one?\"\n\"So her name's Ogerpon?\"\n\"Such an odd name.\"\n\"Wait, she already has a name?\"\n\"She's a named monster?\"\nIgnoring his tribe's shock and murmurs, Benimaru waited quietly for Damien's next words.\nDamien had no intention of joining the fray directly.\nHe saw himself as a backline summoner and mage... getting caught in the enemy's encirclement would be foolish.\n\"Next, I'll unleash a powerful spell on the bug nest to force them out.\"\n\"If the nest's forces are beyond our expectations, I'll have Ogerpon retreat immediately.\"\n\"You should do the same... escape with Ogerpon!\"\nDamien's plan was straightforward, and Benimaru quickly grasped it.\nThe nest's numbers and strength were unknown.\nIf Damien's spell drew out tens of thousands of bugs, staying would be suicide. They'd need to return to the village for reinforcements.\nBut if the nest's forces weren't as overwhelming as feared…\nThen the Ogre Tribe wouldn't be needed.\n'I've got my ace, Ogerpon, who can take on armies!'\n\"Everyone!!\"\nWithout much hesitation, Benimaru made his decision. \"Follow the voice's commands!!\"\nShuna was his sister, Shion his childhood friend.\nOgerpon had saved their lives.\nThat debt alone was more than Benimaru could repay.\nAnd abandoning a fighting ally to flee? That would shame the Ogre Tribe!\n\"Not bad.\"\nFrom afar, Damien nodded approvingly at Benimaru's quick formation change.\n\"Let's begin!\"\nIgnoring Benimaru's group, Damien raised both hands, channeling all his magic into them.\nThanks to Ogerpon's slaughter, Damien's magicules had broken past 4,500.\nWith his current magic capacity, he met the requirements to cast Konosuba's strongest spell.\nAnd what was Konosuba's strongest spell?\nNo question about it... the signature move of the quirky Crimson Majin little girl, Megumin: Explosion!\nIn Konosuba, Megumin poured every skill point from leveling up into Explosion.\nThis turned her Explosion into something akin to a miniature nuke.\nWhoosh!\nDamien's Explosion was still level 1, unupgraded.\nBut!\nUpon returning to the Cardinal World, his Mage class had unlocked endless possibilities.\nFreely manipulating magic, stirring the winds, harnessing omnipresent elements... earth, water, wind, fire, light, dark, even time and space…\nExplosion wasn't strictly a fire spell, despite its name.\nIt was, in essence, a destruction spell.\nIt absorbed, compressed, and disassembled surrounding magical elements, then unleashed devastating destruction in an instant.\nJust like what Damien was doing now.\nUsing his Mage abilities, he deeply analyzed Explosion's essence.\nIt was no longer just a shortcut skill but the raw core of its power.\nMagic drained rapidly, but thanks to his Mage class, new magic flowed into him, only to be consumed again.\nThis cycle repeated, pouring ever more energy into the spell.\n\"What's happening?\"\nThe massive disturbance from drawing in magical elements made the air within kilometers of Damien feel oppressively heavy.\nThe ogres, led by Shuna, felt a primal dread welling up inside.\nRun!\nGet out now!\nTheir monster instincts screamed to flee the area immediately!\n\"This magic…\"\nShuna, a spellcaster herself, sensed the atmospheric ripples more keenly than the warrior ogres like Shion or Benimaru.\nIn her eyes, Damien's position had become a bottomless, pitch-black abyss.\nThe abyss devoured all, like a dark sun blotting out the sky, casting a shadow over every heart.\nBuzz!\nColorful magical particles converged toward Damien's palms, forming vibrant, radiant streams.\nTrees swayed, the sky darkened, and a massive star-ring slowly materialized overhead.\nThen, a colossal crimson magic circle appeared.\nBut it wasn't over…\nA second, third, fourth…\nDozens of magic circles layered atop one another, stacking into a towering structure that pierced the heavens, as if roaring defiance at the gods themselves.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Everything within a one-kilometer radius was vaporized in an instant.\nThe earth quaked as if the heavens had collapsed, shockwaves rippling outward in all directions.\nThe militarized nation of Dwargon to the north and the Sorcerous Dynasty of Sarion to the south soon felt the tremors from the Jura Forest.\nHigh-ranking officials scrambled, and word quickly reached the Dwarf King and Sarion's Queen.\nSkreee!\nUnaware of the massive upheaval his strike had caused, Damien was fixated on the bug nest.\nThe layered insect walls were useless.\nFaced with this apocalyptic scene, the bugs could only screech as they were evaporated by the Explosion spell.\nDamien didn't know the full extent of the damage below.\nBut after such a magical bombardment, the bugs had to be devastated. Anything below C-rank lacked the resilience to survive, reduced to ash.\nEven C-rank monsters, if they survived, were left clinging to life.\nOnly B--rank and B-rank bugs might endure.\nBut even they were heavily injured, their strength reduced to a fraction.\n\"Sugoi!!\"\nOgerpon, standing in front of Damien to shield him from the shockwaves, had stars in her eyes, practically radiating \"admiration.\"\n\"Indeed…\"\nDamien was equally awestruck by his own attack. \"No wonder it's Konosuba's strongest Explosion spell.

Per Appraisal's feedback, it allowed survival unless her head was severed, with feats like limb regrowth and organ repair.\n\"Magicule Solidification is probably like mine, converting magicules into 'levels' to boost base attributes.\"\nIn the Cardinal World, magicules and monsters were like a pool and its water.\nThe water didn't reinforce the pool.\nSo, a 100,000-magicule entity versus a 10,000,000-magicule one didn't have as drastic a physical strength gap as one might think.\nBut with Magicule Solidification, it became like a level 50 facing a level 100.\nEven if the level 100 monster exhausted its magic, its base attributes far outstripped a mere level 50's.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

The first was when Master cast Explosion.\"\n\"Watching us?\"\nDamien didn't dismiss it as Ogerpon being paranoid.\nThough a monster now, she retained her Pokémon instincts for sensing danger.\nWho could be spying on us?\nDamien considered several possibilities, like Clayman, one of the Ten Great Demon Lords.\nThe bugs' sudden appearance felt out of place, unlike the original story.\nWithout his intervention, even if Benimaru escaped, the Ogre Tribe would've suffered heavy losses.\nBesides Clayman, there are the Jura Forest's guardians... the Dryads.\nDamien couldn't pinpoint who it was. The Dryads aren't a problem; I have no real conflict with them.\nHis Explosion aimed to eradicate the bugs harming the forest's ecosystem.\nThe Dryads wouldn't hold that against him.\nBut if it's Clayman…\nIn the original story, Clayman seemed like a clown.\nBut he was still a Demon Lord. Damien wouldn't underestimate him.\nPer the novel, a half-awakened Clayman had around 700,000 existence points.\nRight now, he's likely weaker... maybe 300,000 to 400,000.\nThat strength was an insurmountable foe for Damien and Ogerpon.\n\"We'll have to hope the next few worlds help Ogerpon grow stronger quickly.\"\nClayman wasn't an True Demon Lord, just a Demon Lord Seed.\nWith Ogerpon's Grower skill, even as a Demon Lord Seed, she could keep growing.\nWith the Jura Forest as nourishment and abilities from other worlds…\nGiven time, surpassing Clayman would be a breeze for Damien and Ogerpon.\n\"For now…\"\nDamien turned his gaze to Benimaru and the others approaching, a slight smile tugging at his lips. \"It's time for you to lend us your strength.\"\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

The Ogre Tribe was known for their loyalty and pride, disdaining deceit or scheming.\nThey were deeply grateful to Damien and Ogerpon for saving their lives.\nAnd, of course, there was the matter of their strength.\nIf Damien, such a powerful spellcaster, joined the village alongside Ogerpon, an A-rank Oni, the Ogre Tribe's power would skyrocket.\n\"Well, we'll need to think it over.\"\nDamien didn't agree immediately, feigning hesitation.\n\"Onii-sama, you're being rude!\"\nSeeing Damien's reluctance, Shuna quickly took over from Benimaru, suggesting they not rush things and first offer proper hospitality.\nWhether they stayed would depend on seeing the village.\n\"Right, right, my apologies for being hasty.\"\nYet to face the tragedy of their clan's destruction, Benimaru was still a brash, straightforward guy.\n\"Alright, then.\"\nWith the Ogre Tribe's warm invitation, Damien saw no reason to refuse.\nAfter all, he had his own plans to recruit the Ogre Tribe.\nDamien held a fondness for them, knowing their future from the original story and wanting to prevent their demise at the hands of the Orc Lord.\nThree hundred ogres, averaging B-rank.\nSuch a formidable force, if under Damien's command, would allow him to establish a firm foothold in the Jura Forest.\nMoreover, the Ogre Tribe had great potential, capable of evolving into Oni, or even Divine Onis or Soul Onis.\nAn army like that was not something Damien would pass up.\nAnd so, Damien joined the Ogre Tribe's group, preparing to return to their village.\nBefore that, the ogres needed to collect the remains of their fallen kin.\nThey didn't blame Damien's magic for obliterating some of their tribesmen's bodies, leaving many reduced to ash.\nTheir sentiment was, \"Being buried in the Jura Forest isn't so bad.\"\n\"And with so many bugs to accompany them…\"\nThe Ogre Tribe viewed life and death with acceptance.\nIn such dire circumstances, Damien's intervention was already more than they could've hoped for.\nCleaning the battlefield was mainly to check for survivors.\nAs expected, there were none.\nThe bugs' claws carried a potent toxin that even the Ogre Tribe's resilience could only resist briefly.\nShion's survival was nothing short of a miracle.\n\"Rest in peace, everyone…\"\n\"Lord Damien and Lady Ogerpon have avenged you.\"\nSoon after, led by Benimaru, the ogres held a simple memorial.\nDamien and Ogerpon watched silently from the side, not participating, waiting for the ceremony to conclude.\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting.\"\n\"No trouble at all.\"\n\"Please, follow us.\"\nBenimaru led the way toward the village, with Damien and Ogerpon trailing behind.\nAlong the way, Shuna and Shion kept glancing back.\nThey were very curious about Ogerpon.\nBut with Ogerpon sticking close to Damien to protect him, the two girls couldn't find a chance to thank her.\n\"We're here.\"\n\"Welcome to the Ogre Tribe's village!\"\nEmerging from the dense forest, Damien saw a quaint village.\nIt was small, with a distinct Japanese architectural style, featuring wooden structures lined along streets in a grid pattern.\nDamien knew the reason for this.\nThe grandfather of the ogre elder, named Byakuya Araki, had crossed over from Japan 300 years ago.\nHis influence led the Ogre Tribe to wield swords and value loyalty even more than human knights in this world.\nThe Ogre Tribe bowed to no one.\nBut once they pledged allegiance, their loyalty was unwavering.\n\"What happened?\"\nThe village's ogres had noticed Benimaru's return early on.\nThe families of the fallen were stricken with grief, women and children weeping uncontrollably.\nBut sorrow held little weight in the monster world, unlike the self-pity of humans.\nPerhaps they'd long accepted life and death.\nThose who lost kin claimed their loved ones' remains or belongings, burying them in the village's nearby graveyard.\nThroughout, Damien showed no impatience, offering basic respect.\n\"Father!\"\nAfter handling the fallen, Benimaru finally had time to introduce Damien to his father, an older red-haired ogre.\n\"Thank you for your aid.\"\n\"Please accept our heartfelt gratitude!\"\nLed by Benimaru's father, the ogres bowed in unison to Damien.\n\"No need for that.\"\nDamien waved it off. \"I was just passing by and had a score to settle with those bugs, so I lent a hand.\"\n\"Even so.\" The ogre leader said sincerely, \"in such a dire situation, without your intervention, my son, daughter, and the others would likely have perished.\"\n\"Father, how long are you going to keep Lord Damien and Lady Ogerpon standing here?\"\nShuna interjected, \"Both lords fought fiercely and traveled far with us.

      "content": "Splash!\nShuna soon led Damien and Ogerpon to a slightly elevated area.\nHere stood a bathhouse.\nThis particular section, reserved for honored guests, was typically closed off and only opened to welcome distinguished visitors.\n\"Not bad at all…\"\nLeaning against the bathhouse's edge, Damien let out a contented sigh. \"What do you think, Ogerpon?\"\n\"Ogerpon feels all soft and squishy…\"\nBeside him was Ogerpon, submerged in the hot water with only half her head above the surface.\nLogically, the little girl should've used the women's bathhouse.\nBut Ogerpon, worried for Damien's safety, insisted on staying with him.\nWith no other choice, Damien let her join him in the bath.\nIt's not a big deal, right?\nThere's nothing to see anyway.\nNot only was Ogerpon short, but her figure was also unremarkable.\nAside from her soft skin, she looked like a child under ten.\nGiven Damien's tastes, he wasn't about to make a move on such a young girl... she was more like a little sister to him.\n\"Lord Damien, these are clothes for you and Lady Ogerpon.\"\n\"I've left them outside.\"\nHalfway through their bath, Shuna and Shion brought clean clothes.\n\"Thanks!\"\nThough Damien had plenty of supplies in his spatial storage, he couldn't refuse the Ogre Tribe's kindness.\nSoon, cleansed of their fatigue, Damien and Ogerpon donned the clothes prepared by the ogres.\nThe style resembled Japanese yukata.\nGiven the Ogre Tribe's origins, this clothing choice felt fitting to Damien.\n\"Let's go.\"\nLeaving the bathhouse, Damien spotted Shuna and Shion waiting.\nWithout a word, he followed them to the village's central plaza for the banquet the ogres had prepared.\n\"They're here!\"\n\"Is that the legendary Oni?\"\n\"She's so small, but her magicules are terrifying!\"\n\"Don't you think she's adorable?\"\n\"Hey, show some respect! Lady Ogerpon saved us!\"\nCompared to Damien, Ogerpon was clearly the star of the show.\nWho could blame them? She was an Oni.\nOni were the stuff of legend for the Ogre Tribe.\nIt had been countless years since they'd seen an upper-tier Majin of their bloodline!\n\"Go on, Ogerpon.\"\nDamien patted Ogerpon's back, encouraging her to show off. \"Let them see your power.\"\n\"Bo-ne?\"\nOgerpon blinked, then realized what he meant.\n\"Bo-ne!!\"\nShe summoned her green vine club, and behind her, massive gem-like masks glowed brilliantly.\nThis dazzling display instantly captured every ogre's heart.\n\"Ohhh!!\"\n\"What a beautiful figure!\"\n\"Truly worthy of a legendary Oni!\"\n\"Is this Lady Ogerpon's power?\"\nThe village erupted in excitement.\nBut it wasn't over!\n\"Vine Club: Explosive Strike!\"\nOgerpon channeled magic into her vine club and swung it toward the night sky.\nBoom!\nA beam of green, red, blue, and gray light shot upward, bursting into brilliant fireworks under the dark sky.\n\"Wow~~~\"\nThe eyes of young ogre children reflected the vibrant display.\nAdult ogres, meanwhile, felt the unparalleled power in Ogerpon's casual strike.\n\"So… so strong…\"\n\"Onee-chan's amazing~~\"\nUnlike the reserved adults, the kids only knew Ogerpon was awesome.\nSeeing Ogerpon swarmed by children, Damien signaled she didn't need to worry about him.\nTheir life-link ensured that if one was harmed, the other would sense it immediately.\n\"Go have fun, Ogerpon.\"\nDamien then headed toward the ogre leader, who'd been waiting.\n\"Oh, right.\"\nDamien stopped Shuna, who was following him.\n\"Let me add some flavor to tonight's feast.\"\nHe opened his spatial storage, pulling out ingredients and spices from the Konosubaverse.\nAt first, Shuna hesitated.\nBut the aroma and taste of Damien's spices exceeded her expectations.\nThe scent alone immersed her in a flavor she'd never experienced.\nWhen she used the spices on the roasted meat the ogres often ate, an explosive aroma swept the plaza.\n\"This!\"\n\"What's that smell? It's incredible!\"\n\"Is this really roasted meat?\"\n\"So delicious! Too delicious!\"\n\"It's because of these spices? Amazing!\"\nThat night, bonfires lit the village to celebrate their victory over the forest-threatening bugs and to welcome Damien and Ogerpon.\nAt Damien's urging, Ogerpon joined Shuna, Shion, and the other female ogres.\nRooted in the Japanese Momotaro legend, Ogerpon's personality and habits meshed perfectly with the Ogre Tribe, and she quickly bonded with them.\nMeanwhile, Damien sat with Benimaru, his father, and Hakurou.\n\"You must be the village's eldest, right?\"\nDamien poured a cup of wine for the elder, gesturing for him to try it.\nHe wasn't worried about harm.\nWith their life-link, fatal attacks on Damien were nullified, converted to numerical damage, and transferred to Ogerpon.\nBefore, he'd worried about draining Ogerpon.\nNow, with Hyper-Speed Regeneration, she could recover any life loss in moments.\nThis was why Damien could sit calmly with Hakurou, a swordsmanship master.\n\"Thank you, young man.\"\nHakurou smiled, sipped the wine, and his eyes lit up.\n\"What rich, exquisite wine…\"\nEven the stoic elder was captivated by Damien's brew, quietly speculating about his origins.\nRare spices, fine wine, immense strength…\nA reincarnator from another world?\nBut Hakurou harbored no ill will.\nDamien had saved the village's younger generation.\nThat debt was beyond repayment.\nThe danger Damien imagined in the Ogre Tribe's village was impossible.\nBound by loyalty and gratitude, the Ogre Tribe would never harm their benefactor.\n\"Lord Damien, our tribe can never repay your kindness.\"\n\"If you'd settle in our village, it would be our honor.\"\nKnowing Damien was still considering, the ogre leader suggested, \"You and Lady Ogerpon can stay at my home for now. Tomorrow, we'll build you a house.\"\n\"And if you later wish to establish a new home elsewhere, we'll help find a suitable spot.\"\nThough he said this, the leader hoped Damien would stay.\nThis temporary stay was a chance to convince him.\n\"Thank you for the trouble.\"\nThat night, Damien and Ogerpon stayed at the ogre leader's home.\nDespite being in the Jura Forest, Damien enjoyed the comforts of a civilized world.\nWithout a doubt, this was far more pleasant than building a camp from scratch.\n***\nHi guys, I hope you're all doing well!

      "content": "\"Hurry!\"\n\"Bring the materials over!\"\n\"We need to finish the house today!!\"\nThe next morning, the Ogre Tribe, led by Benimaru and Souei, began constructing a new home for Damien and Ogerpon.\nBuilding the wooden house was swift, with the ogres' monstrous strength turning them into a veritable construction crew.\nIn just one morning, a team of dozens completed a two-story house in the style of Japan's Edo period, complete with a small garden outside, filled with wildflowers picked by the village children.\n\"What do you think?\"\nShuna was assigned to liaise with Damien.\nAny requests he had could be raised with her, and the ogres would do their best to fulfill them.\n\"It's great. I'm very satisfied!\"\nDamien and Ogerpon thanked Shuna, appreciating the Ogre Tribe's sincerity and straightforwardness.\nThey repaid kindness with action.\nEfficient and forthright, they were ideal allies.\n\"Hm?\"\n\"Bo-ne!\"\nThat very night, an unexpected guest arrived at Damien and Ogerpon's new home.\nClad in a flowing green dress adorned with sprouts and branches, her stunning beauty left even Damien... who'd seen countless influencers in his past life... momentarily awestruck.\nFortunately, knowing her identity kept him from being swept away by her grace and charm.\nInstead, Damien grew wary, joining Ogerpon in eyeing the visitor cautiously.\n\"It seems you know who I am.\"\nThe guest was Treyni, guardian of the Jura Forest. She gracefully curtsied and introduced herself. \"I am Treyni, steward of this forest.\"\n\"A Dryad?\"\nDamien didn't play coy, directly acknowledging her identity. \"What brings the mysterious Dryad lady to visit us in the dead of night?\"\nHis tension wasn't unwarranted... Treyni's strength was hard to gauge.\nFirstly, her true form was a \"Great Spirit Tree\" in the forest.\nHer current Dryad form was more like a projection.\nIn terms of monster ranking, Treyni was near Special A-rank.\nIn a straight fight, her strength was comparable to Ogerpon's.\nWith cheats like Destroyer and Explosion Magic, Ogerpon had a good chance of defeating Treyni one-on-one.\nHowever, Treyni was unique.\nMuch of her power stemmed from her contracted spirit, the Elemental Lord of Wind.\nWith over a million magicules, the Elemental Lord of Wind rivaled an True Demon Lord. In the original story, it even severed Laplace's arm.\nIf Treyni summoned the Elemental Lord of Wind, Damien and Ogerpon's only option would be to activate Planeswalker and flee to another world.\n\"No need to be on guard. I bear no ill will.\"\nThankfully, Treyni was gentle by nature.\nAs long as the Jura Forest's ecosystem wasn't harmed, she wouldn't intervene.\n\"No worries.\"\nTreyni smiled. \"In fact, I'm here to thank you both for resolving a major crisis for the forest.\"\n\"You mean those bug monsters?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nTreyni then explained the bugs' origins.\nSeveral months ago, they appeared from another world, building a nest in the forest.\nThey multiplied at an alarming rate, beyond even Treyni's expectations.\nUnnoticed, they became a dire threat to the forest.\nHad Damien not intervened, Treyni would've had to seek help from other monster tribes, as she did during the Orc Lord crisis.\n\"Do you know where they came from?\"\n\"Well…\"\nTreyni shook her head regretfully. \"I only know they're not from this world. Beyond that, I'm unsure.\"\n\"Alright.\"\nDamien suspected the bugs were linked to the Celestial Demon, a corrupted version of the Cardinal World's angels, possibly bioengineered weapons for invading other worlds.\nBut such matters were far beyond his current concerns.\n\"No need for thanks.\"\nDamien said, \"I'll be living in the Ogre Tribe's village, making me a part of the forest.\"\n\"I don't mind taking out threats to the forest like those bugs.\"\nThis wasn't flattery but his genuine sentiment.\n\"That's wonderful.\"\nTreyni beamed. \"From now on, Mr. Damien and Miss Ogerpon are our neighbors. I hope we can get along harmoniously.\"\nDamien's indifference was one thing, but Treyni couldn't take it for granted.\nShe began pondering what gift would suit as thanks for their protection of the forest.\n\"Well, I look forward to working together.\"\nConfirming Treyni's lack of hostility, Damien relaxed, taking the chance to ask about the current state of affairs.\nFor instance, how many years remained before the main story began.\nFrom Treyni, he learned the Storm Dragon was still sealed, meaning Rimuru hadn't yet reincarnated into this world.\nFurther details were beyond his ability to discern.\n\"If you need anything, Mr. Damien, just call my name.\"\nTreyni added, \"As long as you're in this forest, I'll hear you.\"\n\"Got it.\"\nHaving connected with a powerhouse like Damien, Treyni's visit achieved its purpose.\nThe Jura Forest was like a neighborhood, and Damien and Ogerpon were new residents.\nKnowing Damien was a courteous, rule-abiding neighbor, Treyni felt reassured.\n\"I won't disturb your rest any longer.\"\nWith a curtsy, Treyni's form dissolved into green specks of light.\n\"Phew…\"\nOnly when Treyni's presence fully vanished did Ogerpon lower her tightly gripped vine club.\n\"It's okay, we can stand down. She doesn't seem hostile.\"\nKnowledge was one thing, but Damien never dropped his guard.\nOgerpon's combat stance was a precaution, just in case.\n***\nHi guys, I hope you're all doing well!

      "content": "\"That woman just now gave Ogerpon a dangerous vibe.\"\nOgerpon couldn't quite explain it. Despite Treyni lacking the oppressive aura of a powerhouse, Ogerpon's instincts screamed that in a fight, she and Damien would be the ones to fall.\n\"Probably because of the Elemental Lord of Wind.\"\nDamien explained Treyni's ability to summon the Elemental Lord of Wind, reigniting Ogerpon's drive to grow stronger.\n\"The path to getting stronger is right in front of us.\"\n\"We need to seize this chance.\"\nDamien was referring to the Ogre Tribe. Ogerpon was now A-rank, meaning only enemies at B--rank or higher could provide her with experience points.\nC-rank monsters, even C+-rank, were no longer viable fodder for her.\n\"Uh-huh, there are lots of strong guys in the village.\"\n\"Ogerpon wants to fight them!\"\nThe Ogre Tribe's village had nearly 300 residents.\nExcluding those who had died, were away on mercenary missions, or were too young, the village could still muster 200 combatants above B--rank.\n\"That's what I'm thinking.\"\n\"But…\"\nDamien mused, \"What's a good excuse?\"\nThey couldn't just have Ogerpon beat up the ogres for no reason, right?\n\"Ogerpon thinks, how about training guidance?\"\n\"Training guidance?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nDamien nodded. \"The Ogre Tribe loves to fight. They must spar regularly.\"\n\"This is the perfect chance for Ogerpon to take them on.\"\nAs an A-rank Oni, an upper-tier Majin, Ogerpon guiding and sparring with the Ogre Tribe while defeating them was entirely reasonable.\nThe outcome was smoother than Damien expected.\nHe didn't even need to propose it... the Ogre Tribe came to him.\nLed by the ogre leader and Hakurou, a group of young ogres visited Damien and Ogerpon.\nThey hoped that during their stay, Damien could guide the village's youth.\n\"Absolutely!\"\nIt was like a pillow delivered to a sleepy head. Damien was still pondering how to suggest a spar when the ogres handed him the opportunity.\nHowever, he didn't want to reveal Ogerpon's Grower ability, which let her level up by defeating enemies.\nHer Grower skill, paired with Damien's Leader, was their shortcut to rapid growth until they hit one million magicules.\nWith other familiars, Damien wouldn't mind sharing.\nBut with the newly acquainted Ogre Tribe?\nCaution was warranted.\n\"Chief.\"\n\"Yes, Lord Damien?\"\nThe ogre leader was deeply respectful, leaving Damien a bit exasperated.\nBut considering the Ogre Tribe's warrior ethos, he went along with it.\n\"Next, I'll have Ogerpon spar with the village's ogres.\"\nTo avoid exposing Grower while maximizing experience gains, Damien decided to scale up the sparring.\n\"They can come one-on-one or team up in groups.\"\nDamien ruffled Ogerpon's hair. \"Don't worry, I'll have Ogerpon go easy. No one will get seriously hurt.\"\n\"Bo-ne!\"\nOgerpon flashed an innocent smile, instantly winning more favor from the ogres.\n\"Is that really okay?\"\n\"Won't this trouble Lady Ogerpon too much?\"\nThe ogre leader was floored by Damien's decision.\nHe hadn't expected such dedication. Not only did Damien agree immediately, but he also ensured everyone could benefit, considering their feelings.\nIn that moment, the leader's resolve to keep Damien and Ogerpon in the village strengthened.\nEven if it meant giving up his position, he'd do it!\n\"I'll gather everyone now!\"\nSetting aside persuading Damien to stay, the leader rushed to share the good news with the village.\n\"What's that?\"\n\"What's going on?\"\nThe Ogre Tribe's central plaza was just a large clearing surrounded by wooden houses.\nA raised platform stood there, used for sparring matches.\n\"It's Lady Ogerpon!\"\n\"She's willing to train us and help us get stronger!\"\nThe Ogre Tribe revered strength and craved power.\nSparring with an upper-tier Majin like Ogerpon, whose strength likely exceeded A-rank, was a dream they'd never dared entertain.\n\"Lady Ogerpon will teach us combat skills?\"\n\"Fighting such a powerful Majin? I can't wait!\"\nIn the dog-eat-dog world of monsters, the Ogre Tribe was slightly better off.\nAt least Hakurou and the elders taught the younger generation swordsmanship and combat skills.\nBut that was it.\nChallenging higher-ranked monsters meant risking death.\nNow, an A-rank Oni... possibly stronger... offered to be their sparring partner.\nNo wonder the ogre leader made such a request.\nExperience against a powerhouse was rare, and the Ogre Tribe had to seize this chance.\n\"How do you want to do this?\"\nStanding in the center of the arena, Ogerpon summoned her vine club, planting it before her. \"One-on-one, or all at once?\"\nBy Damien's side, Ogerpon was a sweet, clingy little sister.\nBut this shy, socially anxious girl transformed on the battlefield, becoming more ferocious than anyone.\nOne swing, one KO; three swings, hearts shattered.\nHer record of leaving a certain peach-themed hero with centuries of trauma wasn't for show.\nI, Ogerpon, the Mini Kaido of Kitakami!\nNo-named foes, taste my Shuron Hakke!\n***\nHi guys, I hope you're all doing well!

Was that spatial teleportation? She has such a skill?\nBut what about that overwhelming force in her swing?\nHakurou's combat experience was vast. In the original story, he'd deduced Rimuru's skill origins from brief contact.\nBut this time, he was stumped.\n\"Young Lord!!!\"\nFinally, some ogres snapped out of it.\nThey rushed frantically toward where Benimaru had landed.\nAfter digging through the rubble, they pulled out an unconscious Benimaru.\n\"Young Lord?\"\n\"Young Lord, are you okay? Young Lord?!!\"\nFortunately, the village had an experienced healer.\nAfter examining Benimaru, they found he was merely unconscious, with minimal injuries.\n\"He's just out cold.\" The healer said. \"Most of his wounds are superficial. With our ogre recovery, he'll heal quickly.\"\n\"Phew…\"\nRelieved by the healer's diagnosis, the ogres relaxed.\nAfter the initial panic, they felt awe for Ogerpon's power and marvel at her precise control.\n\"So strong!\"\n\"Not only is Lady Ogerpon powerful, but her mastery of force is incredible!\"\n\"Unbelievable.\"\n\"Besides Elder, I've never seen anyone do this.\"\nThe \"Elder\" was of course Hakurou.\nYet even he struggled to replicate Ogerpon's delicate balance of injuring without killing.\nIt involved techniques beyond most people's comprehension.\nHakurou didn't know this stemmed from Konosuba's martial arts, transformed by Cardinal World rules into a new class system.\nBefore now, the Cardinal World had no equivalent skills.\nIn terms of martial prowess, Ogerpon stood at the Cardinal World's peak, matched only by a few human grandmasters.\nHakurou's swordsmanship neared that level, but age had sapped his strength.\n\"Don't worry, Ogerpon held back.\"\nDamien said, \"Bring him over.\"\nDespite such destruction, Benimaru's light injuries proved Ogerpon's restraint.\nSoon, the unconscious Benimaru was brought to Damien.\n\"Healing Magic!\"\nDamien raised his hand, golden magicules cascading down. Benimaru's wounds healed visibly.\nThis miraculous sight drew gasps from the ogres.\n\"His injuries are healed. He'll wake up soon.\"\nAfter treating Benimaru, Damien turned to Hakurou. \"With your experience, Elder, did you catch the finesse in Ogerpon's strike?\"\n\"I'm afraid I'm too dull.\" Hakurou shook his head, sighing. \"I couldn't grasp the mystery of Lady Ogerpon's move.

Did her strike just shatter the air and space itself?\"\n\"So that's how it is…\"\nSeeing Damien's silent smile, Hakurou was inwardly shocked, his hand trembling as he stroked his beard.\nOgerpon's spatial movement wasn't a spatial skill but a variant of Destroyer.\nBy breaking space itself, she achieved an ultra-violent instant leap.\nThis method was far swifter than standard coordinate-based teleportation and nearly impossible to disrupt.\nOf course, crossing shattered space would severely damage most bodies.\nOnly someone like Ogerpon, with her monstrous physical strength and bug-level recovery, could dare use such a method.\n\"How reckless…\"\nHakurou's lips twitched, finding Ogerpon's approach absurd.\n\"And what about the force in her strike?\"\n\"Oh, that?\" Damien replied. \"Besides her sheer superhuman strength, it's likely because she used Destroyer to pulverize everything in her path.\"\nAfter her evolution, Ogerpon's Destroyer skill had deepened.\nBefore, it could only destroy what she saw or touched.\nNow, she could obliterate phenomena like air resistance, gravity, light, and sound based on her needs.\n\"A violent strike that shatters space and destroys rules.\"\nHad Ogerpon not held back, letting her vine club land on Benimaru's head, Hakurou and the ogre leader couldn't imagine the outcome.\nAt minimum, his head would've exploded.\nPart of the village behind him might've been obliterated by the shockwave.\n\"This is Lady Ogerpon's power?\"\nShion and Souei, watching the duel, had expected Benimaru's defeat but not his inability to withstand a single move.\nAnd Ogerpon had gone easy.\n\"Cough! Cough, cough, cough!\"\nDamien's healing magic was remarkable. Benimaru soon stirred.\nSitting up dazed, the memory of Ogerpon's strike flashed in his mind, making his heart skip.\nOnly when Souei called out did he snap back.\n\"Thank you for your guidance, Lady Ogerpon!\"\nBenimaru bowed sincerely, utterly convinced of her strength.\nHe was certain her power far exceeded A-rank.\nA-rank was just her magicule level; her combat prowess was likely Disaster-Class (Special A).\n\"Want to go again?\"\n\"Anyone can try, as many times as you like.\"\nOgerpon slung her vine club over her shoulder, scanning the ogres with a challenge.\n\"Don't worry about getting hurt. Ogerpon won't go too far.\"\nDamien didn't mention that, in case of an accident, he could revive them.\nResurrection, the ultimate skill of Konosuba's High Priest class.\nHis version wasn't as overpowered as Aqua's.\nIt had strict limits: the body had to be mostly intact, missing no more than 30%, and death couldn't exceed five minutes.\nThe five-minute limit wasn't absolute.\nIt hinged on the soul. If the soul remained and Damien could reconstruct the body, revival was straightforward.\n\"Uh-huh, I'll go easy.\"\nOgerpon flashed a pure smile.\nPokémon loved to fight, and even as a monster, Ogerpon retained that trait.\nOver the next three days, under the guise of assessing the village's strength, Ogerpon beat up all 250 ogres, including the kids.\nShe was measured, though.\nWith the young ones, she mostly played, even when knocking them away.\nBenimaru, despite his loss, didn't give up.\nThis time, he teamed up with Souei, Shion, and a dozen others.\nThe outcome was predictable.\nAgainst absolute strength, numbers meant nothing.\nWhether facing one, dozens, or a hundred-strong ogre legion, they couldn't touch Ogerpon.\nOnly elites like Hakurou and the ogre leader gave her a slight thrill.\nHakurou's swordsmanship was cunning and elusive.\nBut Ogerpon's perception was uncanny, and with Grassy Terrain, she could lock onto enemies using natural elements.\nThe ogre leader was immensely strong and durable.\nYet he faced Ogerpon's Destroyer skill.\nHer vine club, empowered by Destroyer, was like the mythical Monkey King's staff... one graze caused injury, one hit meant death.\nHakurou's sword merely brushed her vine club and shattered into fragments.\nThe ogre leader fared worse.\nHis arm, grazed by the club, turned to blood mist, half his body reduced to pulp.\nThankfully, Damien's god-tier healing magic saved him, restoring him fully.\nThis battle made the Ogre Tribe fully grasp Ogerpon's terror.\nA-rank magicules, Special A-rank combat power.\nOgerpon earned their respect and awe, claiming the title of the tribe's strongest.\n\"Damien, Ogerpon feels stronger!\"\n\"Indeed.\"\nIn their wooden house, Damien set up a soundproof barrier. He gently stroked the now-teenage Ogerpon's hair, praising, \"Two hundred fifty ogres, the weakest at B--rank, the strongest, Hakurou, at B+.\"\nOn average, each ogre gave Ogerpon about 80 magicules.\nHer magicules surged from 12,000 to 33,000.\n\"Thanks to you, Ogerpon, I can break through to A-rank too.\"\nLeader granted Damien 50% of his familiar's existence points. With his original 1,500, he now had 18,000... well beyond A-rank standards.\n[Detected that individual 'Damien' meets evolution conditions. Evolve?]\nThe Voice of the World had sounded in Damien's mind halfway through Ogerpon's battles.\nBut he held off, waiting for Ogerpon to peak before breaking through.\n\"Ogerpon won't let anyone disturb Damien!\"\nAs she spoke, Ogerpon wove a magic barrier outside Damien's soundproof one to block magicule fluctuations, ensuring his evolution went unnoticed.\n\"I'm counting on you, Ogerpon.\"\nSeeing Ogerpon stand guard with her vine club, Damien silently commanded, \"Evolve!\"\n***\nHi guys, I hope you're all doing well!

      "content": "\"Argh!!\"\nAs evolution began, the vast magicules within Damien surged chaotically.\nA searing pain tore through his body, forcing a cry of agony from his lips.\n\"Damien!!\"\nOgerpon jumped in alarm.\nShe wanted to check on him, but a voice in her mind urged her not to interfere.\nThis was normal... a transformation unique to Damien.\nHe wasn't pure human or Majin but a hybrid of both.\nThis intense reaction was the awakening of his Majinic bloodline!\n[Bloodline Appraisal Initiated…]\nUntil now, Damien had been unaware of his Majinic heritage.\nOnly as the Voice of the World echoed did his Majinic bloodline fully activate.\n[Appraisal Complete: Pseudo-Dragonoid Bloodline Activated]\n[Acquired Exclusive Skill: Stardust Manipulation]\n[Evolution Successful: Individual 'Damien' Gains Race 'Dragonoid (Pseudo)']\n[Skill 'Appraisal' Upgraded to Extra Skill 'Dragon's Eye']\n[...]\nAs the pain subsided, the Voice of the World's prompts flooded Damien's mind, overwhelming him just as he began to recover.\nBut this time, instead of distress, he felt exhilaration.\nStardust Manipulation!\nIt's actually Stardust Manipulation!!\nAnd Dragonoid? Damien never imagined his body's latent Majinic bloodline would be dragonoid.\nMoreover, it stemmed from the Cardinal World's pinnacle, the Star Dragon King!\nIn Tensuraverse, 'Dragonoid' wasn't a race but a designation for a singular entity: Milim, one of the three oldest Demon Lords.\nMilim, daughter of the Star Dragon King and human Lucia, inherited her father's infinite magicules and dragonoid bloodline, making her the unique 'Dragonoid.'\nNow, the Voice of the World had granted Damien the 'Dragonoid' race.\nPseudo-Dragonoid, but still Dragonoid!\nHowever…\nAfter the initial thrill, Damien pondered, Where did this body's dragonoid bloodline come from?\nMilim could be ruled out.\nShe was a little girl, unlikely to have human offspring.\nExcluding natural reproduction, Damien could only think of one explanation: Magicule Contamination.\nIn the original story, the Storm Dragon Veldora's leaking magicules birthed Charybdis.\nPowerful magicules could spawn independent lifeforms, so it wasn't a stretch that they could infuse someone with partial power.\n\"So, my body's ancestors were exposed to the Star Dragon King's or Milim's magicules.\"\n\"And they were lucky enough to survive, passing those magicule factors through their bloodline.\"\nGiven Milim's unique Dragonoid status, Damien doubted any of his ancestors had awakened this power.\nThis aligned with his original body's memories of entirely human ancestors.\n\"The Star Dragon King's bloodline was too potent, preventing my ancestors from awakening it.\"\nDamien wondered, \"So why did I awaken it?\"\nReflecting on his uniqueness, he considered his Planeswalker talent.\nThe ability to traverse worlds was likely the key to activating his dragonoid bloodline.\nA faint dragonoid bloodline, combined with Planeswalker's world-hopping and the Cardinal World's magicules, created this miracle.\nSure, 'Pseudo' was tagged onto Dragonoid.\nDamien estimated he'd need to become a Demon Lord Seed, or fully awaken as a True Demon Lord, to drop the 'Pseudo.'\n\"No matter. It's only a matter of time.\"\n\"Gaining the Dragonoid bloodline opens an evolution path with immense potential.\"\n\"Most importantly, I've acquired Stardust Manipulation early.\"\nEven with knowledge of the original novel, Damien's understanding of stardust was limited.\nStardust, simply put, was highly compressed, concentrated magicules.\nJust as matter consists of atoms and molecules, magicules have a base unit: Spiritons.\nDamien had previously puzzled over magicule values.\nFor example, why was 9,999 magicules B-rank, while 10,000 was A-rank, despite a mere 1-point difference?\nA 10,000-magicule A-rank monster could easily crush a 9,999-magicule B-rank one.\nWas that 1-point gap really so vast?\nShouldn't breaking from B to A-rank cause a massive magicule surge?\nNow, Damien understood.\nThat 1-point difference was a qualitative leap.\nBelow 10,000, magicules were measured in spiritons.\n9,999 magicules could be broken down into 99.99 million spiritons.\nBut upon reaching A-rank, a monster's magicules became a cohesive whole.\nThe base unit shifted from spiritons to pure magicules.\n10,000 magicules were exactly that... 10,000 magicules.\nThey were indivisible unless the A-rank monster chose otherwise, making it impossible for outsiders to break them down into spiritons.\nThis transformation massively increased an A-rank's weight in the Cardinal World.\nWhen A-rank collided with anything below, the latter would shatter instantly.\nA-rank control was also beyond B-rank imagination.\nThey could split one magicule into millions of spiritons for precise manipulation, achieving effects far surpassing their B-rank days.\nThis was the A-rank's voluntary separation.\nOthers couldn't harm you, but you could wield your power with greater finesse.\nThis disparity formed the A-rank divide.\n\"Maybe this explains the difference between Skills, Intrinsic Skills, and Unique Skills.\"\n\"Only Special A-rank monsters possess Unique Skills…\"\nDamien mused, \"Conversely, reincarnators with Unique Skills, if developed properly, will eventually reach Special A-rank.\"\nUnique Skills were likely the product of refined magicules, recognized by the Voice of the World.\n\"So, A-rank to Special A-rank is about finding your path.\"\n\"Find it, and you ascend to Special A-rank, earning the Demon Lord Seed title.\"\nDamien roughly grasped the monster-to-Majin-Lord evolution process. \"I have four Unique Skills: Planeswalker, Leader, Capturer, and Learner.\"\nCapturer and Leader weren't particularly strong on their own.\nCompared to Rimuru's near-omnipotent Predator, they paled.\nCapturer allowed contracting high-potential individuals, waiting for them to grow, then letting the Voice of the World elevate the user.\nThe results were promising but difficult.\nCapturer lacked combat power, making the user vulnerable early on.\nWithout a noble or lordly status to command loyalty, it was nearly useless.\nLeader was easier.\nTheoretically, anyone willing to follow could contribute magicules.\nBut their contribution wouldn't match Ogerpon's 50% yield.\nMost followers offered maybe 3%.\nHow many subordinates would Damien need to amass enough magicules for Demon Lord Seed?\n\"Without a decade or two, building such a force is impossible.\"\nFortunately, Leader and Capturer complemented each other.\nCombined, their effect rivaled Rimuru's Predator.\nPlaneswalker's limitless potential was immeasurable, so he set it aside.\nLastly, Learner wasn't far behind Predator.\nCopying and enhancing abilities was a cheat-tier skill in any isekai novel.\n***\nHi guys, I hope you're all doing well!

Yes, even Lady Ogerpon is A-rank. For her to follow him, Lord Damien must be even stronger.\nSpecial A-rank.\nThat was the most powerful existence Benimaru could imagine.\nBeyond that lay the legendary Demon Lords (Demon Lord Seeds).\n\"Don't be nervous. I called you here to discuss something.\"\nDamien calmed the four, then spoke gently. \"I'd like you to become my familiars. Are you willing?\"\n\"Familiars?\"\n\"Yeah, like Ogerpon.\"\nDamien paused, framing it in terms they'd understand. \"Think of it as followers or 'retainers.'\"\nWith his Capturer Unique Skill and strength surpassing theirs, Damien could forcibly bind them.\nBut he disliked coercion.\nAnd he wanted genuinely loyal subordinates.\n\"Familiars are different from regular followers. They're more like my companions.\"\nDamien didn't mention the benefits, focusing instead on the bond.\nTo him, familiars shouldn't be tied to profit.\nSaying, \"Become my familiar, and you'll get stronger,\" would taint the oath, making it less pure.\n\"I'm willing!\"\nThe first to speak wasn't Benimaru or Souei but Shuna.\n\"It's an honor to be companions with Lady Ogerpon.\"\nShuna added, \"And if not for Lord Damien's intervention, I'd have died to that bug monster.\"\n\"A life debt can't be repaid easily.\"\n\"I may be unworthy, but I wish to serve at your side.\"\nWith that, Shuna gracefully bowed to Damien.\n\"Uh…\"\nDamien hesitated but didn't refuse.\nWhatever her reasons, Shuna's desire to repay him was sincere. That was enough.\n\"No need for that.\"\n\"As my familiar, we're family now.\"\nSmiling, Damien said, \"Welcome aboard.\"\n\"That's not fair!\"\nSeeing Damien accept Shuna, Shion turned to Benimaru apologetically. \"Sorry, Young Lord, but I also want to be Lord Damien's familiar.\"\n\"I understand.\"\nThough called the Young Lord and heir to the village, Benimaru's title was nominal.\nAt least, Shion and Souei hadn't formally sworn fealty to him.\nThe four were childhood friends, not master and servant.\nShion's reason mirrored Shuna's.\nIn that desperate moment, Damien and Ogerpon had saved them.\nA life debt was paramount.\nNow that Damien offered, why would Shion refuse?\nBesides, Damien emphasized he sought trusted companions, not slaves.\nThat sincerity alone could sway many ogres, let alone Shuna and Shion, who owed him their lives.\n\"May I ask, Lord Damien, what are your plans?\"\nSouei, usually taciturn, spoke up. He wasn't opposed to following Damien.\nThe Ogre Tribe often worked as mercenaries across the Jura Forest.\nBeing Damien's retainer wasn't much different from mercenary work.\nThe latter was temporary; the former demanded lifelong loyalty.\nDamien's strength and Ogerpon's power fit the monster world's need to follow the strong.\nBut if that were all, the original story's Gelmud wouldn't have failed with the Ogre Tribe.\nWhat truly moved Souei was Damien's definition of familiars.\nNot servants or underlings, but family.\nFor such a lord, Souei was willing to pledge his loyalty.\n\"My plans?\"\nDamien said, \"Probably to gather strength and become a Demon Lord.\"\nDemon Lord!!\nThe words stunned the four, their faces etched with shock.\n\"You have such ambitions?\" Souei's expression grew solemn, but his tone was earnest. \"I'm willing to be your shadow, aiding you in achieving Demon Lord greatness!!\"\nFinding a lord of such caliber, worth dying for, was Souei's dream!\n\"Shadow, huh…\"\nSeeing Souei's sincerity, Damien nodded. \"Alright, I'll be counting on you.\"\n***\nHi guys, I hope you're all doing well! I want to share that I'm currently working on a new project related to Lord of Mysteries.\nIf you're interested, feel free to visit my profile and start reading. Below is a brief summary:\n[Lord of Mysteries: Incarnation of Chaos]\nHave you ever wondered what would happen if someone from a Lovecraftian world got isekai'd into another world built on Lovecraftian themes? Well, it's absolute chaos.\nMeet Alaric, a human(questionably) survivor of the madness and chaos caused by a certain crawling chaos, who, thanks to the kindness of a certain bubble daddy, got isekai'd into the \"fake it till you make it\" world.\nWhat will he do in this strange new world? Climb the ladder of power to become that impossible god unless you're just a pawn of a certain russian priest or a certain goth mommy?\nOr become a cheshire cat, leaping onto the 4D chessboard to disrupt the schemes and mind games of these bizarre folks?\nFor Alaric, it's not a tough choice. But before he picks either path, he must, of course, uphold the time-honored tradition of isekai'd victims(questionably) that forms the foundation of this world.\nWhat's that tradition?\nKeeping a diary.\n---\n[Alaric's Transmigration Diary]\n[Day 1: I encountered Amon. Used a special technique to summon a projection of the Ancient Sun God, who personally delivered a heavy slap to Amon. Hope Amon appreciates this weighty paternal affection.]\n[Day 2: I received an invitation from the Aurora Order. Told them I want it all... looks, brains, and combat prowess... and invited them to join my newly founded Joker Club.]\n[Day 3: I met Leonard and acknowledged Gramps Pallez. Declined Leonard's enthusiastic suggestion for the old man to move in with me, as I'd rather not have a old man critiquing my every move, even in private moments.]\n[Day 4: I told Klein I plan to pray to a deity named The Fool. Watched his eyes widen in shock and kindly offered him some eye drops.]\n[Day 5: I listened to Medici perform a two-hour comedy routine. Suggested he go professional and invited him to share a meal.]\n.\n.\n.\n[Day 666: I fully absorbed a certain crawling chaos fragment within me. From now on, I am the Fifth Pillar.]",

      "content": "Accepting the loyalty of Shuna, Shion, and Souei, Damien turned his gaze to Benimaru.\nThe red-haired young lord of the Ogre Tribe was visibly conflicted.\nWith his sister and two childhood friends choosing to follow Damien, Benimaru also felt the urge to become his retainer.\nEspecially after Damien declared his ambition to become a Demon Lord.\nPersonally, having been crushed by Ogerpon's overwhelming power, Benimaru already respected Damien.\nServing such a formidable figure brought him no shame.\nBut there was a problem.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\nBenimaru's reluctance was palpable, yet he made his choice. \"I'm the young lord of the Ogre Tribe. I can't abandon the village.\"\n\"So, please forgive me, but I cannot follow you, Lord Damien!\"\n\"I see…\"\nFar from being upset, Damien admired Benimaru's resolve, thinking he was indeed the man who, in the original story, became the Grand Marshal of the Jura Tempest Federation.\nWith such responsibility, Benimaru's presence would allow Damien to venture to other worlds with peace of mind, knowing the Cardinal World was secure.\n\"You've misunderstood.\"\nDamien waved a hand. \"I don't plan to leave the Ogre Tribe's village.\"\n\"What?\"\nBenimaru was stunned, as were Shuna, Shion, and Souei.\n\"You mean…\"\n\"I want to take in the Ogre Tribe!\"\nDamien didn't hide his ambition. \"I'll make this place my stronghold, the foundation for my path to Demon Lord!\"\n\"This!\"\nThe four exchanged glances, momentarily at a loss.\nTaking in the Ogre Tribe was, in essence, conquering it.\nIf anyone else had said this, Benimaru and the others would have fought to the death.\nThe Ogre Tribe would rather die than submit to force.\nBut Damien was different.\nFirst, his life-saving grace... Damien and Ogerpon had preserved the village's younger generation, securing its future.\nThen, Ogerpon had single-handedly defeated the entire tribe.\nNo fancy magic, just raw power.\nWith her vine club and fists, she dominated them in their own domain.\nAn upper-tier Majin of their kin, a savior of their village, combined with Damien's charisma and friendly attitude.\nRather than conquest, it felt like Damien and Ogerpon wanted to become part of them.\n\"Conquest?\"\nShion blurted out, \"It's more like Lord Damien wants to protect us and lead us further!\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nShuna tugged at her brother's sleeve, her meaning clear.\nIf they didn't seize this opportunity, they'd be fools.\n\"Please accept my loyalty, Lord Damien!\"\nBenimaru didn't hesitate, pressing his hands to the ground. \"I can't decide for the village, but I'm willing to follow you!\"\nHe was only the young lord; the true chief was his father.\nBut so what?\nOn the matter of pledging to Damien, Benimaru chose his side.\nBesides, he didn't believe his father was blind to the situation.\nGaining Damien and Ogerpon's protection for the mere cost of leadership?\nShuna and Benimaru locked eyes.\nThe siblings saw the same thought in each other: If Father doesn't get it, we don't mind staging a coup to show him what it means to adapt.\n\"Welcome as my companions.\"\nDamien raised his hand, and four invisible oaths enveloped them. \"I hereby grant you names.\"\n\"Benimaru!\"\n\"Shion!\"\n\"Shuna!\"\n\"Souei!\"\nDamien kept their names as in the original story.\nThe four, receiving his names, were filled with disbelief.\nThey'd thought Damien's call for followers was nominal, never expecting him to name them.\n\"Lord Damien!!\"\nShocked, they worried for him.\nNaming monsters consumed vast magicules, harming the giver's strength.\n\"No need to worry.\"\n\"Feel the changes within you.\"\nTo Damien, magicules were like currency.\nUsing Capturer, he began binding the four as familiars.\nBenimaru's base magicules were 7,500, Shion's 7,000, Souei's 7,200, and Shuna's 6,500.\nWith Leader, 50% of their magicules would bolster Damien.\nThat equated to gaining 14,100 magicules out of thin air.\nNaming required two conditions.\nFirst, a significant magicule gap between the namer and named.\nThus, Hakurou and the ogre leader, both under 10,000, couldn't name each other to reach A-rank.\nIn the original story, Rimuru named the Storm Dragon Veldora via a soul-level equal contract, not standard naming.\nSecond, naming required enough magicules to trigger evolution.\nTo name the four, their magicules needed to reach 10,000+.\nOnly then could they evolve from Ogres to Oni.\n\"10,800 magicules?\"\nBut since Damien would recover half via Leader, the actual cost was only 5,400.\n\"So, I'm gaining 9,000 magicules.\"\nNot only did he avoid loss, but his magicules rose from 18,000 to around 27,000.\nIf 10,000+ was A-rank, then nearing 30,000 made Damien and Ogerpon mid-tier A-rank.\nRecruiting hub-world monsters as familiars was advantageous since Damien knew their ranks and magicule counts upfront.\nUnlike Ogerpon, who was a blind box until brought to the Cardinal World.\nWith potential travel to dangerous worlds ahead, Damien aimed to bolster his forces.\nWith Shuna, Shion, Benimaru, and Souei as familiars, he could take them to new worlds via his spatial storage, like Ogerpon.\nFour low-tier A-ranks and one mid-tier A-rank as escorts boosted his security immensely.\nBoom!!!\nThe simultaneous evolution of four ogres caused a commotion greater than Damien's.\nWithout a barrier to conceal it, the uproar drew the attention of Hakurou and the other ogres.\nSoon, countless ogres swarmed Damien's house, surrounding it.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

A monster is evolving to a higher level!\"\n\"Evolution?!\"\nThe Red Ogre leader was utterly shocked, sensing the auras of Benimaru, Shuna, and others within the Magicules.\nIf his perception was correct, didn't that mean the ones evolving were them?!\n\"Everyone, stay calm and don't disturb Benimaru and the others.\"\nDamien emerged from the wooden house with Ogerpon, briefly explaining what had happened inside to Hakurou and the others.\nUpon hearing that Damien had expended his own Magicules to name Benimaru, Shuna, Shion, and Souei, the Red Ogre leader's expression changed instantly.\n\"Thank you, Lord Damien!\"\n\"Our Ogre tribe pledges to follow your lead and serve at your command!\"\nOnce Benimaru and the others completed their evolution, they would become four new A-rank Kijin.\nThe Ogre tribe's rise in the Jura Forest was now unstoppable, and at such a time, a powerful and wise leader was crucial.\nLike Benimaru and Shuna, the Red Ogre leader chose to submit to Damien.\nSoon after, as the Magicule fluctuations subsided, four figures emerged from the wooden house... none other than the newly evolved Benimaru, Shuna, Shion, and Souei.\nAs in the original novel, their appearances had undergone dramatic changes.\n\"Lord Damien!\"\nBenimaru and Souei knelt on one knee, pledging their loyalty to Damien.\nShuna and Shion, being women, knelt on both knees, bowing gracefully to Damien and vowing their unwavering devotion.\nOf course, such oaths held little practical weight.\nNot only were the four already Damien's subordinates, bound to obey his commands, but the naming system of this Cardinal World ensured that those named would feel a deep, almost familial dependence and obedience toward the one who named them.\nThis change was subtle.\nFor instance, Shuna and Shion now gazed at Damien with eyes full of affection and admiration, a stark contrast to their previous awe.\n\"Rise.\" Damien said, gesturing for the four to stand. He then used his Dragon Eye to appraise their current attributes.\n[Benimaru]\n[Race: Ogre → Kijin]\n[Magicules: A-rank Upper Majin (12000 EP)]\n[Magic: Battlewill, Sorcery, Fire-type Pokemon Magic]\n[Extra Abilities: Magic Perception, Space Manipulation, Tyrant's Flame, Magic Flame Transformation]\n[Unique Skill: Great Marshal (Thought Acceleration, Thought Domination, Predictive Calculation, Army Inspiration)]\n[Special Skill: Magic Solidification]\n[Resistances: Status Abnormality Nullification, Pain Nullification, Physical Attack Nullification, Natural Influence Resistance, Mental Attack Resistance, Holy Magic Attack Resistance]\nBenimaru's Magicules weren't 10,000 but 12,000.\nThe additional 2,000 Magicules had nothing to do with Damien.\nThey were purely a gift from the Voice of the World upon Benimaru's evolution, effectively granting Damien an extra 1,000 Magicules in return.\n\"Great Marshal... indeed, a commanding-type unique skill.\"\nIts emergence confirmed Benimaru's potential to grow into a Demon Lord-class being.\n\"Battlewill and Sorcery must be inherited from the Ogre tribe, variants of Aura Combat and special magic.\"\nMost of the remaining abilities stemmed from Damien or were granted through his naming and subordinate system.\nMagic Perception was a common ability among monsters, nothing remarkable.\nSpace Manipulation likely derived from Spirit Space and Planeswalker.\nDue to Damien's bond with his subordinates, he could replicate most of their awakened abilities, excluding unique skills.\nIndeed, Damien now possessed Space Manipulation as an extra skill.\n\"Tyrant's Flame and Magic Flame Transformation.\"\nDamien recalled that in the original novel, Benimaru had similar abilities, gained from Rimuru devouring an upper Fire Elemental Spirit.\nHowever, Damien hadn't consumed any Fire Spirit.\n\"Could it be due to Explosion Magic?\"\nBenimaru already mastered fire-based Sorcery, making him highly compatible with Explosion Magic.\nTheir synergy awakened these two new skills.\n\"This Tyrant's Flame is quite powerful.\" Damien noted, sensing feedback from the skill. \"Like my Explosion Magic, it can ignite internal Magicules instantly, unleashing power akin to a nuclear blast.\"\nUnlike Explosion Magic's long charge time, Tyrant's Flame allowed control over its release speed.\nShort bursts produced flame projectiles; prolonged compression yielded explosive infernos.\nWith sufficient Magicules, Benimaru would become a terrifying artillery, incinerating all obstacles in Damien's path.\n\"Magic Flame Transformation elementalizes the physical body.\"\nIts effect resembled the Burn-Burn Fruit from One Piece, but it could burn and absorb surrounding matter to replenish Magicules.\nIn Magic Flame Transformation, paired with the overwhelming Tyrant's Flame, Benimaru's strength was so far beyond his pre-evolution self that he seemed like a different species.\nIn this Cardinal World, Magicule quantity didn't directly equate to combat strength.\nBefore evolving, Benimaru's attributes were rudimentary:\n[Benimaru]\n[Race: Ogre]\n[Magicules: B-rank Lower Majin (7500 EP)]\n[Magic: Battlewill, Sorcery]\n[Inherent Abilities: Monstrous Strength, Regeneration]\nLacking extra or unique skills, he relied on the Ogre tribe's passive abilities, barely surviving in the forest.\nDespite having 7500 Magicules, his combat strength was only mid-tier among B-rank beings.\n\"Magicules are the foundation, but skills define the line between the strong and the weak.\"\nGifted by Damien, Benimaru's true combat power now allowed him to defeat tens of thousands of B-rank monsters.\nCompared to his pre-evolution self, the current Benimaru could take on a thousand of his former selves.\nMoreover, his Great Marshal unique skill enabled him to share some abilities with his subordinates, boosting the entire legion's combat strength several-fold.\n\"Very impressive.\"\nDamien was highly satisfied with Benimaru's abilities.\n\"Thank you for your recognition.\"\nBenimaru bowed his head, his face calm but his heart brimming with excitement.\nThe naming bond, combined with the subordinate oath, doubly ensured that Benimaru, Shuna, and the others were bound to Damien... body and soul.\nIn this world, nothing brought them greater joy than Damien's approval.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

This burden is nothing to me.\"\nAfter naming the two, Damien's Magicules didn't decrease.\nLike the others, Akahiko and Hakurou advanced slightly beyond 10,000 Magicules, reaching 11,000 each.\n\"After gaining a few hundred Magicules, I now have 37,000.\"\n\"Subtracting the base 10,000, I have 27,000 Magicules left to name more Ogres.\"\nDamien planned to use this reserve to enhance the Ogre tribe's strength, evolving as many into Kijin as possible.\nHearing Damien intended to name more Ogres, Benimaru and the others were stunned.\nThey urged him to prioritize his health, not to make such immense sacrifices for them.\nThere was no notion of unfair distribution here.\nCommunal monsters were a collective.\nThe successful evolution of Benimaru, Akahiko, and the others meant the entire Ogre tribe's strength had risen.\nWith their leadership and protection, the tribe would prosper, benefiting the whole group.\nThis differed vastly from Damien naming and taking Kijin away, abandoning the village.\nLeaving would drain the village's vitality.\nStaying provided shelter.\nIf Damien had a favorability system, his standing among the Ogres would be at worship.\nPowerful, generous, benevolent.\nHow fortunate the village was to have such an exceptional leader!\n\"It's fine. My situation is unique.\"\n\"Naming part of the Ogre tribe won't affect me much.\"\nDamien didn't mention his unique skill, Leader, which allowed named subordinates and followers to return a portion of Magicules.\nThis meant his actual Magicule loss was less than expected.\n\"But before that, there's one task I need you to handle.\"\nDamien then shared his desire for the entire Ogre tribe's loyalty with the six present.\n\"I'll gather everyone immediately!\"\nHearing it was such a simple matter, Akahiko stood, ready to organize a swearing-in ceremony to make Damien the village's true lord.\n'Excellent!'\nDamien had calculated that the entire Ogre village's submission would yield around 30,000 Magicules.\nAdded to his current 37,000, Damien's Magicule count alone would rank him as high-tier A-rank.\n\"Unable to break through to Special A-rank at once, keeping these Magicules serves little purpose.\"\nNaming feedback wasn't a waste but a way to store Magicules elsewhere.\n\"It's finally over!\"\nThe loyalty ceremony lasted from day to night.\nThroughout, Damien wore an ornate ceremonial robe, seated at the forefront, as Ogre families approached to pay homage and pledge allegiance.\nIt must be said, the Ogre tribe was indeed simple and earnest.\nDamien had estimated ordinary followers would provide 1% of their Magicules, which was already generous.\nAfter all, being recognized as a follower by his Leader skill required genuine loyalty.\nThis, to Damien, wasn't easy.\nYet, the Ogres exceeded his expectations. Despite their fierce appearances, their hearts were remarkably tender.\nDamien's earlier actions had thoroughly won them over.\nThe Magicules they returned averaged the maximum 3% for followers, even from underage Ogre children.\nOgre children, not yet fully grown, had low Magicule counts, averaging C-rank, around 4,000.\nThe tribe totaled 254 members, with 20 away on missions and over 20 lost to the insect monster disaster.\n\"Phew~~\"\nRecalling the Ogres' loyalty pledges, Damien checked his attribute panel.\n[84,000 EP]\nNearly 85,000 Magicules... an impressive sight that filled him with pride.\n\"Benimaru, Souei, Shuna, Shion.\"\nDamien turned to the four: \"Have you found elites worthy of my naming?\"\n\"We have!\"\nThis time, Damien planned to use 64,000 Magicules.\nWith named individuals providing 15% Magicule feedback, Ogres with over 8,500 Magicules would balance the cost.\nBut in the entire village, only Akahiko and Hakurou exceeded 8,000 Magicules.\nEven top warriors like Benimaru, Souei, and Shion had only 7,000+.\nSo, Damien set the naming threshold at 6,500–7,000.\nMost adult Ogre warriors had just over 6,000 Magicules, early B-rank.\nIn this regard, the brute-strength Ogres held a low ecological niche among B-rank monsters.\nOgres with over 6,500 Magicules were the village's elite.\nDamien allocated ten naming slots each to Benimaru and Souei to form the Red Ogre Corps and the Shadow Guard.\nThe Red Ogre Corps, led by Benimaru, would organize the remaining Ogres into squads for hunting and patrolling.\nThe Shadow Guard, akin to a ninja unit, would handle reconnaissance and protection.\nAdditionally, Shion and Shuna each received five slots.\nThe women planned to select female Ogres to form the Purple Corps and Priestess Maidens.\nThe Purple Corps would protect Damien closely.\nThe Priestess Maidens would also manage Damien's daily needs, serving as his personal maids.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "Naming the thirty Ogres consumed over 50,000 of Damien's Magicules.\nWith the remaining 14,000, on Hakurou and Akahiko's recommendations, Damien named five special talents in the village.\nThese were Shirayuki, skilled in medicine; Kurobei, the surviving blacksmith from the original story; Kintsume, a calculating male; Yuki, a highly learned female; and Akahime, from the same Red Ogre lineage as Akahiko and Benimaru, confident in her culinary skills.\nPerhaps reflecting their natures, the extra skills these five gained after Damien's naming aligned with their talents.\n[Damien]\n[Magicules: 26,000 EP]\nTwenty-six thousand... this was Damien's remaining Magicule count after the first wave of naming.\nLess, yet not truly diminished.\n\"My Magicules haven't vanished. They've merely taken another form, staying by my side.\"\nThis wasn't like spending money on virtual companions. Beyond Benimaru and Souei, Shuna and Shion were genuine, charming allies.\nEspecially Shion, who, since becoming Damien's guard captain, stuck to him like glue.\nShuna felt a twinge of jealousy but couldn't afford to be as carefree as Shion.\nAs a Priestess Maiden, she not only served Damien closely but also relayed his decisions to the Ogre tribe.\nAfter taking charge of the Ogre village, Damien began reforms.\nFirst, he restructured the village from a mercenary-based system to one of greater self-sufficiency.\nNext, he ordered the clearing of new land to expand the village's area.\nEvery Ogre was a humanoid excavator, even the children contributing their strength.\n\"The village center will be a plaza, with four zones divided in a cross pattern.\"\nIn a quaint, traditional courtyard, Damien sat under the eaves, Ogerpon... a delicate, fairy-like girl... resting on his lap.\nOgerpon curled up, nuzzling into Damien's chest, her nose gently sniffing his scent, murmuring contentedly.\n\"Residential zone, work zone, entertainment zone, and farming zone.\"\n\"Then, along the cross roads, set up shops to create a market street.\"\nDamien patted Ogerpon's back, lulling her to sleep, while calmly assigning tasks.\nScribble, scribble.\nShuna meticulously recorded Damien's instructions, listening intently and occasionally asking key questions.\n\"Mhm, I see…\"\nShion, too, was scribbling nearby.\nDamien sneaked a glance at Shion's notes, finding boxes of various sizes.\nAs for words…\nHe could only say it was very Shion.\nCompletely illegible.\nThankfully, Shuna was there. The Ogre tribe's Priestess Maiden was brilliant, with a knack for governance.\n\"The residential zone is nearly complete, but isn't it a bit too large?\"\nFollowing Damien's orders, Shuna had the Ogres clear a forest for housing.\nThe number of houses far exceeded the tribe's needs.\nWith fewer than 250 members, even including the 30 away on mercenary missions, the residential zone's houses were less than half occupied.\nThis was impossible otherwise.\nThe Ogres lived in family units, totaling just over 80 households, far fewer than the number of houses.\n\"It's for future plans.\"\nDamien thought of Rimuru's village in the original story, planning to emulate it by recruiting more monster races.\nThis would not only bring new Magicules but also lay the groundwork for establishing a nation.\nTo become a Demon Lord, he couldn't stand alone.\nVassals, armies, and citizens were essential.\n\"Your meaning is?\"\n\"The Jura Forest isn't home to just the Ogre tribe.\"\nDamien said, \"Lizardmen, Goblins, Insect Monsters, Tengu, Orcs…\"\n\"I need their strength.\"\nAs his subordinates, Shuna and the others could now know some of Damien's secrets.\n\"If we can subdue them all, even at 1%, each providing 10 Magicules, that's millions.\"\nShuna's face flushed as she spoke of millions, resembling a wife thrilled at her husband's million-dollar salary.\n\"1% is just the start.\"\nDamien was confident his benevolent policies would increase the Magicule contribution rate.\nThis Magicule feedback wasn't a one-time deal.\nOnce they became his followers, named, or subordinates, their every improvement would grant Damien 1%–3% of their Magicule growth.\nWhen the time came, Damien would use those Magicules to name them.\nThis raised their contribution from 3% to 15%.\nIt seemed like a loss, as Damien spent Magicules to evolve them.\nBut was it truly a loss?\nTake the Ogre tribe: were Benimaru, Shion, and the others, at 12,000 Magicules, at their limit?\nClearly not!\nThey would grow stronger.\nTheir additional Magicules, unrelated to Damien, were returns on his investment.\nThus, with his unique skill Leader, naming wasn't wasteful but a strategic investment.\n'Leader is powerful, but it has limits.'\nOver time, Damien had gauged Leader's cap: 'Its limit is 1 million Magicules. Beyond that, it can't interfere.'\nThis wasn't surprising.\nLeader was just a unique skill, not capable of infinite Magicule growth.\nFortunately, Damien could use these Magicules to strengthen his subordinates.\n'As long as I spend them before hitting 1 million, Leader can keep generating Magicules.'\nThis cycle would elevate both Damien and his named monsters.\nThus, Damien wouldn't harm the forest's intelligent races but would offer them a better future.\n'You're all my precious experience packs!'\nNo killing, just submission, for a steady Magicule stream... what could be more delightful?\n\"Let me go, Lord Damien!\"\nShion eagerly volunteered. \"I'll beat them all into submission!\"\n\"I've already sent Souei and the Shadow Guard to scout.\"\nDamien wasn't rushing to attack. \"Once he returns with intel on nearby races, I'll make arrangements.\"\n\"Ugh…\"\nShion pouted, itching to fight.\n\"Don't worry, you'll get your chance.\"\n\"Really?!\"\nShion was easy to please.\nThe straightforward girl, much like Ogerpon, wasn't the sharpest.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"Phew~~\"\nAfter settling matters in the Cardinal World, Damien returned with Ogerpon to the Konosubaverse.\nHis purpose here was to convert his newly gained 100,000 Magicules into a million experience points.\n\"A million experience points... enough to raise my level to 100.\"\nDamien wasn't sure of the level cap in the original Konosuba novel.\nBut in this real Konosubaverse, the maximum adventurer level was 100.\nAdventurers had a level cap.\nTheoretically, 100 was possible.\nAs for whether anyone had ever reached it…\nWhen Damien asked Luna at the guild, she replied, \"I've never heard of anyone pushing their level to the limit.\"\nBarring surprises, Damien was about to become the Konosubaverse's first max-level adventurer.\n[Experience Points Conversion Successful]\nDamien glanced at his unchanged 100,000+ Magicules and the million experience points newly added to his character card.\nWithout hesitation, he leveled up.\nThe next moment, as a flood of experience points was consumed, Damien gained a massive number of skill points.\nThis was the true reason for his return to the Konosubaverse!\nYes, skill points!\nDamien intended to max out all his mastered skills.\n\"Explosion Magic? Add points!\"\n\"Martial Artist class skills? Add points!\"\n\"Resurrection? Add points! More points!\"\n\"…\"\nDamien's skill points far exceeded his expectations.\nAs mentioned before, skill points gained from leveling depended on class rank.\nThe earlier one unlocked an advanced class, the more skill points they'd gain at max level.\nBut Damien was on another level.\nLike Aqua, returning to the Konosubaverse... even without changes to level or stats... granted him a huge influx of skill points.\nIf Aqua was a goddess descended, Damien was a Demon Lord from another world!\n\"Phew~~~\"\nAfter nearly fifteen minutes, Damien finally maxed out his chosen skills.\nEven then, he had skill points to spare.\n\"Whatever, I'll save them.\"\n\"Maybe I'll copy new skills later.\"\nDamien wasn't stingy with skill points.\nKonosuba was just one world; he had grander horizons and no need to hoard here.\nEven if he missed rarer skills, he wouldn't regret it.\n\"Still, I don't feel much stronger.\"\nDamien clenched his fist, sensing his body's changes.\n\"Maybe I'm already too strong.\"\nAs an A-rank Upper Majin with Magic Solidification boosting his stats, the attribute gains from Konosuba's level 100 were likely a fraction of his true power.\n\"Damien, you got a tiny bit stronger.\"\n\"You noticed?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\nOgerpon gestured with her fingers. \"About this much.\"\n\"…\"\nDamien shrugged.\nOgerpon's descriptions were, as always, abstract.\nHe was used to it.\n\"I'll get accustomed first.\"\nDamien treated his Konosuba travels as a vacation.\nHere, he wouldn't flaunt excessive power.\n\"Let's see what level 100 stats look like.\"\nDamien appraised passing adventurers, using their stats to devise a new attribute system.\nIn the Konosubaverse, each adventurer's attribute limits varied.\nTake Intelligence, for example.\nA note like \"Intelligence: 10 (max)\" meant that no matter how much they leveled, that adventurer's Intelligence wouldn't increase.\nIt was their talent's limit.\nThis explained why, in the original story, Kazuma pitied Aqua after seeing her maxed-out, yet still low, Intelligence.\n\"So, no matter how much she levels, her Intelligence won't improve?\"\nAqua's low Intelligence was permanent.\nTruly living up to her reputation as the dim-witted goddess.\nBack to Damien.\nAll his attributes reached the Konosubaverse's cap.\nNot his personal limit, but the adventurer card's limit.\nIn numbers, that was 999.\nThis conclusion came from Damien's Magic Perception, analyzing all adventurers in Axel.\nEven the reclusive lich Wiz only reached around 800 for her highest stat.\nOf course, Damien's Strength, Agility, and Vitality far exceeded a mere 999.\nHis true stats had long surpassed Konosuba's framework.\n\"But in this world, I'd better stick to the allowed limits.\"\nThat meant all attributes at 999. As long as Damien didn't exceed this, the world's will wouldn't expel him.\n\"You too, Ogerpon.\"\nDamien shared this red line with Ogerpon: \"Keep your power within 999, got it?\"\n\"Mhm!\"\nOgerpon nodded obediently.\n\"By the way, Damien.\"\nOgerpon tugged at his clothes, asking, \"You leveled up and used your skill points. Are we heading back now?\"\nTo avoid trouble, Ogerpon had reverted to her Pokémon form.\nShe didn't mind.\nIn fact, her Pokémon form felt more comfortable than her human guise.\n\"No rush.\"\nDamien patted Ogerpon's head, smiling. \"You've worked hard helping the Ogre tribe with their construction.\"\n\"Ogerpon doesn't mind hard work!\"\n\"I know, I know.\"\nDamien gently ruffled her head. \"But you still need to relax.\"\n\"Don't you think this world is perfect for unwinding and living leisurely?\"\nDamien came here to level up and allocate points.\nWith that done, he could return.\nBut he had no such plans.\n\"Let's stay a couple of days and relax.\"\nDamien's suggestion instantly won Ogerpon's approval.\nOgerpon loved the Konosubaverse.\nThe food was delicious, and the guild members were friendly, playing with her.\nThe little one adored the world's vibe.\n\"Let's head to the guild!\"\nDamien wasn't short on money, and now at max level, he had no need for quests.\nThe Konosubaverse was his vacation spot.\nNo constant fighting or scheming here.\nJust a bunch of quirky adventurers and a dim-witted goddess dragged into mortal life.\n\"Huff! Huff~\"\n\"Put some muscle into it! Get those supplies up here!\"\nOn their way, Damien and Ogerpon passed a construction site.\nThey glanced over instinctively.\nAmong shirtless workers, a boy in a white short-sleeved shirt and green sweatpants was sweating buckets.\n\"Well, well…\"\nDamien paused at the sight. \"A classic scene.\"\n\"What's up, Damien?\"\nOgerpon followed his gaze, spotting Kazuma. \"Is something wrong with that boy? Why are you watching him?\"\n\"Do you know him?\"\n\"No.\"\nDamien said, \"First time seeing him.\"\n\"But I know of him.\"\nAs he spoke, Ogerpon pointed at a blue-haired girl sitting on a wall, plastering cement onto bricks. \"That one! She's…\"\nOgerpon remembered her!\nShe was the self-proclaimed goddess they met during their last trip here!\nOgerpon didn't quite get what a goddess was.\nBut it sounded impressive.\nSo why was such an impressive person laying bricks?\nWas she, like Ogerpon, here to relax in this world?\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Scram, airhead! Begone, brainless!'\n\"So scary!!\"\nOgerpon didn't get it, but if Damien said so, it must be true.\nAlready not the brightest, she trembled at the idea that Aqua could lower others' intelligence.\n\"Ahem.\"\nDamien took Ogerpon's hand. \"Let's not meet her yet.\"\n\"She's a goddess, after all.

Her emerald-green eyes were calm yet faintly cold, perfectly embodying the image of a haughty, elegant Crusader.\n'This girl… could she be…'\nDamien didn't need to guess. Her appearance matched the anime perfectly: 'Darkness?'\nDarkness, one of Konosuba's heroines, was the tank of Kazuma's party, with attacks that never hit but unmatched defense and vitality.\nPlus, she was an extreme masochist.\n\"First Kazuma and Aqua, now Darkness.\"\n\"Just missing Megumin, and the original quartet's complete.\"\nThough he'd spotted another canon character, Damien had no intention of approaching.\nIt wasn't that he disliked Darkness.\nCompared to the dim-witted Aqua or the chuunibyou Megumin, Darkness's quirks were, at most, a bit risqué.\nA Crusader with a touch of perversion? Pretty normal, right?\nAt least in the anime, Damien never saw Darkness flaunting her tendencies toward anyone but Kazuma.\nAll in all, if he could train Darkness to direct her masochism solely at him, it'd be quite amusing.\n\"Too bad.\"\n\"Bwoh?\"\nOgerpon looked up curiously, unsure what Damien was lamenting.\n\"I mean, subordinate slots are limited. I can't use them carelessly.\"\nDamien explained to Ogerpon, \"Even if I like a character, I need to judge their worth first.\"\nUnlike protagonists who could freely bring companions across worlds, Damien's Planeswalker skill was less flexible.\nTo take Darkness, he'd need to make her a subordinate.\nBut that was the issue.\nSubordinate slots were finite, and using one on Darkness wasn't cost-effective.\n'Sorry, my preferences.'\nWith no spare slots, Damien could only silently apologize to his desires.\nBut while he had no plans to approach Darkness, that didn't mean she'd ignore him.\nAs she spoke with Luna, the girl suddenly turned her gaze toward Damien and Ogerpon.\n\"!!!\"\nTheir eyes met.\n\"Uh…\"\nCaught staring, Damien felt a bit embarrassed.\nBefore he could look away, a spark of excitement flashed in Darkness's eyes.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

My party doesn't lack a frontline.\"\n\"Aw…\"\nRejected again, Darkness wasn't discouraged but rather delighted.\n\"However…\"\nDamien paused to think.\nHe had to admit, Darkness was stunning.\nGolden hair, emerald eyes, a curvaceous figure, and noble aura.\nAs long as she kept quiet and didn't show her perverse tendencies, she perfectly matched Damien's tastes.\nUnlike Aqua and Megumin, Darkness was manageable.\nAqua was too chaotic, likely to cause trouble.\nMegumin's daily Explosion Magic urges were a hassle Damien didn't want to deal with.\nHe knew Darkness well enough.\nHer full name was Dustiness Ford Lalatina, the daughter of the noble Dustiness family in the Belzerg Kingdom.\nLosing her mother young, she barely remembered her face.\nAs an only child without a mother's love, her father Ignis spoiled her and rarely disciplined her, leading to her craving strict guidance and becoming an irredeemable masochist.\nIn other words, what Darkness wanted was firm discipline.\nFor Damien, that was easy.\n\"Alright, I'll let you join.\"\nDamien had his reasons for allowing Darkness into the party.\nFirst, he wasn't planning to use a subordinate slot to make her one.\nSecond, he wanted to explore ways to bring someone to the Cardinal World without a subordinate contract.\nDarkness was a good candidate.\nAs for forming a party in Konosuba?\nDamien had decided to play the role of a level 100 Martial Artist here.\nAs long as he didn't reveal secrets beyond this scope, he could share them with Darkness without worrying about leaking other worlds' information.\n\"Really?!\"\nDarkness hadn't expected Damien to accept her.\nShe knew he could see her quirks.\n\"S-So, so, are you willing to discipline me?\"\n\"It's fine!\"\n\"No matter how perverse the demands, I-I'll endure them for you!!\"\n\"…\"\nDamien was starting to regret agreeing.\nHer voice was too loud.\nDidn't she see the adventurers glancing over?\nHey, what's with those looks?\nHe wasn't some creep who enjoyed tormenting Crusader girls, okay?\nBut this made one thing clear.\nHardly anyone in the guild knew about Darkness's tendencies.\nThis was likely her first time exposing her quirks to others.\nNormally, though a clumsy fighter who couldn't hit monsters, Darkness maintained a positive image.\n\"Ahem, we're just friends.\"\nDamien nudged Darkness, signaling her to explain.\nThankfully, she didn't make it awkward, announcing she'd joined Damien's party and apologizing for speaking too loudly.\n\"What, just a couple's game?\"\n\"As expected of Damien, snagging the aloof Crusader so fast.\"\n\"Darkness, huh… Hope Damien can handle her.\"\n\"What? Is there gossip?\"\n\"Nah, I partied with Darkness before. She's so clumsy, she can't hit a thing.\"\n\"…\"\nLearning it was just Damien and Darkness's business, not a dispute, everyone turned back to their own matters.\n\"Looks like we need some ground rules.\"\nDamien said, \"Unless you agree, I won't accept you.\"\n\"It's starting already?\"\n\"Doing this and that, and that and this to me.\"\nDarkness grew more excited, but Damien raised a hand to stop her. \"Wait, wait, calm down.\"\n\"I agree!\"\nDarkness declared, \"As long as I can be your teammate, I'll do anything!\"\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

If you get… excited with others, I'll punish you harshly!\"\nHe dropped the pretense, laying it all bare.\nSince Darkness was throwing herself at him, Damien wouldn't pass up such a beauty.\nBut he was possessive. He wouldn't allow Darkness to...\n\"E-Excited…\"\n\"I understand. I'll behave.\"\n\"This is my first time saying this to anyone. I've always hidden it well.\"\nDarkness was fully prepared.\nShe didn't find anything odd about Damien's serious words.\nYes, this was it!\nTreat her like an irredeemable woman and ravage her thoroughly!\n\"Rule two!\"\nConsidering his situation, Damien said, \"Ogerpon and I have our own matters to attend to. We'll only be here two days a week.\"\nEvery seven days, he'd relax in the Konosubaverse... that was the plan.\n\"For the rest of the time, you're free to act as you wish.\"\n\"My only demand is that you don't reveal your true nature to others!\"\nAt this, Damien emitted a faint aura of intimidation.\nInstantly, Darkness felt an unimaginable pressure.\nHer pupils shrank, her vision blurring.\nThe harmless young man beside her transformed into a terrifying abyss.\nBut this pressure didn't scare her.\nQuite the opposite... it thrilled her more!\n\"Not in front of others, ooh, is this… possessiveness?\"\n\"I understand.\"\nDarkness found Damien's demand reasonable.\nIf she wanted his discipline, she could only have one master.\nThis differed from the original Darkness.\nPerhaps due to Damien's overwhelming presence, she began embracing this duality... cool on the surface, wild in private.\n\"Ahem!\"\nSeeing Darkness lost in her fantasies, Damien felt a pang of frustration.\n'I released such intense pressure.'\n'Why aren't you scared? Why are you getting more into it?'\nHe'd expected her physical and magical resistance to be high.\nBut this mental resilience overturned his earlier judgment of her limited potential.\n'With that willpower…'\nDamien thought if Darkness went to the Cardinal World, she'd have a high chance of becoming an Awakened Hero or Saint.\n\"Rule three, the final one.\"\n\"Our relationship stays private. In public, we're just teammates.\"\nDamien wasn't really going to train her into some frenzied state.\nAs a bit of fun, he wouldn't mind.\nBut treating her as less than human? He couldn't do that.\n\"This…\"\nDarkness hadn't expected this condition.\nHer restless heart calmed.\n\"Damien, you're a good person.\"\nBefore, she'd been wary of him.\nEven if she accepted that dynamic, she'd refuse at critical moments.\nShe loved being disciplined but wasn't truly depraved.\nHer chastity, Darkness would never surrender.\nNow, she felt a spark of fondness for Damien.\nIf this grew, she might genuinely fall, letting him have his way.\n\"No need for the good guy card.\"\nDamien placed a pile of Eris coins on the table, calling Ogerpon and Darkness.\n\"Let's go, Ogerpon.\"\n\"And you, Darkness.\"\nHe stood, leading them out of the guild. \"Let's talk somewhere else.\"\n\"Bwoh!\"\n\"Okay, I-I'm ready!\"\n\"…\"\nDamien's lip twitched. He didn't need to ask to know she thought he was taking her to an inn.\n\"Whatever, enjoy your imagination.\"\nIgnoring her fantasies, Damien led them out of the guild to Axel's real estate agency.\n\"What's this place?\"\nSeeing the agency's sign, Darkness asked, \"Are you buying a house, Damien?\"\n\"Something like that.\"\nDamien had clarified with Darkness.\nNormally, they were proper teammates.\nOnly when she needed it would she call him Lord Damien.\nThen, he'd become the strictest master, disciplining her thoroughly.\nBut now wasn't the time for that.\n\"Staying at inns is too costly.\"\nDamien said, \"So I'm planning to buy a villa in Axel.\"\nYes, a villa.\nOrdinary houses didn't interest him.\nHe had plenty of money.\nEven without quests, selling materials from the Cardinal World could make him richer than kings.\nAdventuring was, at best, a hobby like fishing.\n\"I'm not great with this stuff.\"\nDamien asked, \"Can you help me out, Darkness?\"\n\"No problem, leave it to me!\"\nAs a noble, Darkness was well-versed in such matters.\nWith her help, they toured several properties.\nIn the end, they settled on a sprawling estate... thousands of square meters, with a main building, two side buildings, and a vast courtyard.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Come back tomorrow!\"\nKazuma greeted the seniors, Aqua following suit.\nHearing their replies, the two left the site.\n\"Man, another full day of work.\"\nKazuma could hardly believe that, not long ago, he was a shut-in NEET.\nClutching their earnings, they headed to the public bathhouse.\nThe bathhouse was much like those in Japan.\nThough pricier than Japan's with average wages, post-work bathing was a habit they couldn't break.\n\"Ahh~ I'm alive again~\"\nKazuma soaked up to his shoulders, easing the day's fatigue.\nThis medieval-like world made him think bathing would be a luxury, but that was just his misconception.\n\"Grateful, grateful.\"\nMusing, Kazuma left the bath, meeting Aqua at the entrance.\nTaking longer than a girl might seem odd, but Japanese people loved their baths.\n\"What's for dinner?\"\nAqua, devoid of goddess-like awareness, was embracing this life. \"I want a smoked lizard burger patty and ice-cold Crimson Neroide!\"\n\"I'm craving meat too.\"\nKazuma said, \"Let's hit the guild for two smoked lizard burger patty meals.\"\n\"Agreed!\"\nAqua raised both hands. \"And sparkling wine! A burger patty without it has no soul!\"\nFor the past week, they'd been working on expanding the town's outer walls.\nIn other words, construction labor.\nFar from the adventurer life Kazuma sought.\n'Why is Aqua so unquestioningly okay with this life?'\n'You're a goddess, aren't you?'\nAs if hearing his inner complaints, Aqua said matter-of-factly, \"Duh, no work, no food!\"\n\"You don't like labor? Geez, NEETs are so picky.\"\n\"There's always shop clerk jobs on the main street!\"\n\"No, that's not it!\"\nKazuma was exasperated by Aqua's earnestness. \"I want thrilling battles against monsters! That kind of life!\"\n\"Besides, where's this world's Demon King invasion or crisis?\"\n\"It's so peaceful it's like a fairy-tale village!\"\nThat was Kazuma's biggest gripe. Axel was absurdly tranquil, with no sign of a Demon King.\nChatting, they reached the Adventurer's Guild.\nInside, loud cheers erupted.\n\"All hail Damien!!\"\n\"Sparkling wine forever!!\"\n\"Damien! Damien! Damien!!\"\n\"…\"\nAqua quickly learned the situation.\n\"A rich guy's footing the bill?\"\n\"Free sparkling wine and a meal for everyone?\"\n\"Ahh!!!\"\n\"All hail!\"\n\"Damien forever!!\"\nUnable to resist, Aqua pulled out her fan, casting her party magic.\n\"Flower, Bird, Wind, Moon!!\"\n\"Woohoo!\"\nThe atmosphere grew livelier.\nWhy was Damien splashing cash again?\nBecause he was thrilled!\nRecruiting Darkness and buying a new home... how could he not celebrate?\nMoney was no issue in the Konosubaverse.\nHe could buy all of Axel if he wanted.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Whoever treated was his benefactor.\n\"Damien! Damien! Damien!\"\nThough he didn't know who Damien was, it didn't stop him from cheering.\nAs for Aqua…\nYou couldn't expect a dimwit to remember Damien's name.\nDamien didn't linger, avoiding an encounter with Aqua and Kazuma.\nOver the next two days, he indulged Darkness's various perverse requests, running through every play she desired.\n\"Can't I come with you?\"\nThat morning, Darkness watched Damien and Ogerpon prepare to leave, curious about their destination.\n\"Not yet.\"\nThis time, Damien had fully satisfied Darkness's needs.\nAt least while he was gone, she could maintain her cool Crusader persona, free from masochistic thoughts.\nIn a way, she needed time to process the intense stimulation Damien provided.\nOver these two days, their bond had grown closer.\nHearing Damien was leaving without her, Darkness panicked.\n'Am I being abandoned again?'\n'Of course, useless as I am, I can't help Damien and only drag him down…'\nSnap!\n\"Ow~~\"\n\"What are you thinking?\"\nDamien flicked her forehead, breaking her spiral. \"Ogerpon and I have business to attend to. Think of it as… collecting debts.\"\n\"Debts?\"\nDarkness asked, \"Like collecting rent?\"\n\"Something like that.\"\nDamien likened himself to a landlord with vast fields, checking on them periodically.\nThat explained why he could only be an adventurer two days a week.\n\"I see!\"\nDarkness wasn't foolish; she knew he was brushing her off.\nBut what did it matter?\nHis willingness to explain meant he wasn't abandoning her.\nThey were still teammates.\n\"For the next few days, you can do your own thing, Darkness.\"\nDamien tossed her a set of keys. \"Also, help look after this place.\"\n\"Got it.\"\nDarkness nodded, watching them depart.\nAs for herself…\nShe decided to find Chris, the human form of the goddess Eris, a Thief-class adventurer.\nThey were close friends.\nIf Darkness proposed teaming up, Chris wouldn't refuse.\nConveniently, Chris, like Damien, disappeared periodically, unable to party long-term.\nSo, when Damien was gone, Darkness could team with Chris.\nWhen Chris was away, Darkness could rest a day or two before rejoining Damien.\nAdventuring with a friend, indulging her quirks, and having rest days... what a perfect life!\n\"Ready, Ogerpon?\"\n\"Bwoh!\"\nUnaware of Darkness's thoughts, Damien and Ogerpon used Planeswalker to return to the Cardinal World.\n\"Lord Damien!\"\nSensing their return, Shion burst in. \"And Ogerpon-nee! You're finally back!\"\n\"Bwoh…\"\nHugged by Shion, especially feeling the weight on her head, Ogerpon looked utterly defeated.\n\"You're back?\"\nShuna arrived a step behind, not as idle as Shion, busy with her duties.\n\"Yeah.\"\nDamien nodded. \"Anything happen in the village while I was gone?\"\n\"No, the village is stable.\"\nShuna reported, \"Everyone's strength is steadily improving, and we're following your expansion plans.\"\n\"Good.\"\n\"You've worked hard.\"\nBack from Konosuba, Damien wasn't planning to rest.\nHe was ready to open the gates to a new world.\nThe delay was to consolidate his recent power surge.\nNew worlds were enticing, but biting off more than he could chew was unwise.\nWithout mastering his current strength, adding new systems would muddle his future plans.\nHe needed a clear path to growth, not aimless wandering.\nAfter this period of reflection, Damien felt he'd fully grasped his powers, ready for a new adventure.\nDue to the cooldown, the next trip was set for two days later.\nThis time, he planned to bring Shuna and Shion along.\n[Planeswalker (Cooldown: 0:59)]\n\"Almost time.\"\nOn the third day, watching the one-minute countdown, Damien turned to the girls. \"This time, I'm taking Ogerpon, you, and Shion.\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Awesome!!\"\nShion couldn't hide her excitement, bouncing with joy at being included.\nHer movement drew Damien's eyes to her ample chest.\n\"Ahem!\"\nDamien coughed, looking away.\nShuna noticed, inwardly grumbling about Shion's figure.\nWhy, as fellow Kijin, was she only petite and cute?\n\"What about Onii-sama and Souei?\"\nShuna asked, \"For a new world, is just Shion safe enough?\"\n\"Isn't Ogerpon-nee there?\"\nThough stronger, Shion still revered Ogerpon as Damien's top fighter, her big sister.\nAge-wise, it made sense.\nIn the Pokémonverse, Ogerpon was centuries old.\nShe might even outdate Hakurou, so Shion's title wasn't misplaced.\n\"Ugh, troubling you again, Ogerpon.\"\nDamien patted her head, smoothing her messy hair and putting on her hood.\n\"Mhm!\"\nOgerpon raised her hand, full of energy. \"Ogerpon will smash all Damien's enemies!\"\n\"I'll protect Lord Damien too!\"\n\"Me too!\"\nShion and Shuna, not to be outdone, each grabbed an arm, making Damien both exasperated and secretly pleased.\nPlaneswalker couldn't bring outsiders.\nBut subordinates weren't outsiders... they were part of his power.\nIf he wished, Damien could bring five A-rank or higher fighters to explore other worlds.\n\"Everything ready?\"\n\"All checked!\"\nFor world-hopping, Damien's spatial storage held ample supplies.\n\"Good.\"\nUsing the subordinate link, Damien informed Benimaru and Souei he'd be gone, tasking them with managing the village.\n\"Yes, my lord!\"\n\"Rest assured, Lord Damien.\"\nBenimaru and Souei replied almost simultaneously.\nThey were used to his occasional absences.\nThis time was no different... some subordinates went, others stayed, each with their roles.\nBenimaru also privately messaged Shuna, urging her to care for Damien and ensure he didn't suffer.\n\"Leave it to me, Onii-sama!\"\nShuna, ever meticulous, looked after not just Damien but Ogerpon and Shion, acting as his steward and head maid.\nWith Planeswalker's activation, the four vanished before Benimaru and the Kijin.\nTheir vision blurred momentarily.\nWhen they regained focus, they were met with biting cold winds and the endless expanse of a northern ice plain.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Why does my body feel so light?\"\nShion gave a light hop, and her body shot up hundreds of meters, like a human on the moon.\nThe ground trembled beneath them.\nLooking at Shion, they saw the earth where she'd stood had caved in, leaving a massive crater. The trio now stood in the collapsed pit.\nNo doubt, this was the result of Shion's jump.\n\"What's with this world?\"\nShion, startled by her own impact, grew cautious, fearing another crater. \"Is the ground made of cookies?\"\n\"This world's rules are off.\"\nDamien soon noticed the issue, bending down to pick up a frozen rock.\nCrunch!\nThe rock crumbled effortlessly in his hand. \"The materials are too brittle!\"\n\"Shion, Ogerpon!\"\nRealizing something, Damien warned, \"Control your strength. This world is far weaker than the Cardinal World!\"\n\"Your every move could cause unimaginable destruction.\"\nWithout a reference for comparison, Damien couldn't gauge the exact gap between worlds.\nBut the ground beneath them felt so fragile that a slight push could shatter it.\n\"I'll be careful.\"\n\"Bwoh!\"\nShion and Ogerpon immediately became cautious.\nThey sensed it too.\nThis world's physical rules were bizarre.\nSimply put, compared to the Magicule-saturated Cardinal World, everything here... plants, trees... was like foam to Shion, breaking with a poke.\nShion, an A-rank, could unleash S-rank destruction here.\nYes, S-rank, comparable to an True Demon Lord.\nAnd that was a conservative estimate.\nIn the Cardinal World, a Special A-rank's full strike neared a nuclear blast.\nAt S-rank, a casual move could destroy a nation.\nHigher still, Special S-rank could pierce the sky or sink continents, truly affecting the Cardinal World's stability.\nIn the original story, Milim in a rampage could annihilate star systems or even universes.\nDestroying the Cardinal World was akin to obliterating the Tensuraverse.\n\"The air contains unique energy particles.\"\n\"This energy is far weaker than Magicules, even less than Spiritrons.\"\nA group of A-rank Majin, their bodies forged from refined Magicules.\nIn a world with energy weaker than Spiritrons, the destruction they could cause was staggering.\nForget Shion... Ogerpon could likely shatter this planet.\n\"The gap between worlds is just too vast, isn't it?\"\nDamien genuinely feared the three might accidentally destroy this world.\nIf that happened, he'd likely be forcibly expelled by the world's will, blacklisted, and barred from returning.\n\"For now, everyone, control your strength.\"\n\"Limit it to one percent... no, one-thousandth.\"\nUnsure of the new world's specifics, Damien didn't return immediately. Instead, he led the three to wander the icy landscape.\nAll four had resistances, unfazed by the cold.\nThe initial chill was just their bodies adjusting; Damien could ignore such temperatures if needed.\nResistances were passive but adjustable.\nOtherwise, how could they enjoy hot soup or ice pops?\nRumble!\n\"Hm?\"\nShortly after climbing out of the pit, the ground shook again.\n\"Shion?\"\n\"It's not me, Lord Damien!\"\n\"Then…\"\nBefore Damien could ask, a monstrous head burst from the snow.\nA 20-meter-long centipede, covered in white crystals, exhaled icy breath, its violent blue eyes fixed on the 'humans' causing the commotion.\n\"Hm?\"\nSeeing the ice crystal centipede's hostility, Ogerpon raised an eyebrow, ready to summon her Ivy Cudgel to teach it a lesson.\n\"Wait, hold on!\"\n\"Let me handle it!\"\n\"Ogerpon-nee, leave it to me!\"\nSpotting such a massive beast, Shion stepped forward eagerly, itching to prove herself.\n\"Well…\"\nDamien didn't mind letting Shion act. \"But I think we should try communicating with it.\"\n\"Oh!\"\n\"As expected of Lord Damien, I understand.\"\nShion stepped forward, shouting, \"Hey!! Can you understand us?\"\nWith the Voice of the World's influence, language barriers didn't exist.\nEven for beasts or monsters, Shion could convey her thoughts if needed.\n\"We're travelers who ended up here by mistake.

Even a frog would become a Majin by then!\nSo why?\nWhy was this cow so weak?!\n\"It makes no sense, absolutely no sense!\"\nDamien muttered, \"In any world, lifespan ties to life level.

Charging with her sword, she clashed with the old man.\nNeither used special techniques, relying purely on physical strength, shattering glaciers and carving ravines into the earth.\nThe commotion echoed far, alarming countless powerful soul beasts in the Far North.\n\"Such immense power.\"\n\"Who is it?!\"\nBeneath a distant glacier, a jade-green, emerald-like giant scorpion turned its head.\nIt was the Ice Jade Emperor Scorpion, second of the Far North's three great ferocious beasts...

His true form was a God King.\nThough Douluo Continent's rules were weak... its Dragon God roughly equal to an True Demon Lord in the Cardinal World... that was still an True Demon Lord.\nTang San, currently, was likely on par with Clayman.\nUnless Damien let Ogerpon risk expulsion by unleashing her full power, defeating God King Tang San was possible.\nBut that would get Ogerpon ejected quickly and blacklisted.\nWeighing the cost, Damien hesitated.\n\"Hm?\"\nWhile he pondered, Tang San sensed Damien probing the God-Sealing Platform and stored it in a soul tool for living creatures.\nSnow Empress was a soul beast, but Douluo Continent was Tang San's domain.\nEvery blade of grass, every soul beast, was his property.\nA ferocious beast like Snow Empress was too valuable to waste... perfect for nurturing a chosen one.\n\"Shuna, help Shion and grab that ring.\"\n\"Steal it?\"\nShuna didn't question the God-Sealing Platform's nature; she obeyed Damien unconditionally.\nFollowing Shion's close-combat prowess, Shuna, master of elemental control, assisted while seeking an opening, launching magical attacks on the old man possessed by Tang San's divine sense.\nTheir fighting style defied soul master norms.\nSoul skills, like hotkeys, had intervals and cooldowns.\nBut the girls faced no such limits.\nShion's attacks were brutal, each swing rivaling a demi-god's full force.\nInfused with dark magic, even Tang San had to dodge.\nShuna was another story.\nAs a mage, a powerhouse beyond the original story, she stood behind Shion, an endless artillery of firepower, soon leaving Tang San's puppet battered and scrambling.\n\"Damn it!\"\n\"Where did these women come from?!\"\nIn the God Realm, Tang San's divine sense monitored the Far North battle.\nWatched by the God King of Destruction, he couldn't intervene directly.\nSplitting off a sliver of divine sense to control the old man, pushing him to demi-god strength, was his limit.\nBut Shuna and Shion, even sealed, matched or surpassed demi-gods.\nTwo against one, Tang San's puppet was on the brink.\n\"These people can't be Douluo Continent's soul masters or soul beasts!\"\nTang San knew Douluo Continent like the back of his hand, even aware of the Silver Dragon King hidden beneath Star Dou Forest, plotting to seize the Dragon God's power.\nBut Damien's group were undeniable outsiders.\n\"Chance!\"\nAs Tang San's focus slipped, Shuna seized the moment, using spatial manipulation to sever the hand wearing the storage soul tool.\n\"Ah!!\"\nThe pain of the severed hand, linked by divine sense, struck Tang San in the God Realm.\n\"Damn it!!\"\n\"Martial Soul True Body!\"\n\"Ring Explosion!!\"\nSeeing his puppet falter, Tang San stopped holding back, detonating all the soul power stored in the old man.\nBlack, black, black, black, black, black, black, red, red... nine soul rings emerged behind him.\n\"Got it.\"\nShuna teleported the storage soul tool to Damien, who ignored space to retrieve the God-Sealing Platform.\nTo prevent Tang San from destroying it in desperation, Damien had taken the long route.\n\"Finish him, Ogerpon.\"\n\"Bwoh!\"\nInstantly, Ogerpon vanished from Damien's side.\nA mere demi-god was beneath Damien's notice.\nOnly a fool would wait for an enemy to power up.\nRing Explosion was strong, but would Damien give Tang San the chance?\n\"Ah!!!\"\nIn the God Realm, Tang San, preparing his Clear Sky Hammer's Martial Soul True Body and about to shatter his soul rings, felt a sharp pain in his head.\nOn the battlefield, Ogerpon held her blood-dripping Ivy Cudgel.\nBehind her lay a headless corpse in a pool of blood... the demi-god old man controlled by Tang San.\nIf Shion and Shuna were like Rank 1 Gods limited to demi-god power, Ogerpon was a restricted God King in Douluo Continent.\nHer unleashed power surpassed even Di Tian.\nKilling a mere demi-god was effortless.\n\"Lord Damien.\"\nShion and Shuna felt no resentment over Ogerpon stealing their opponent. The three returned to Damien, eyeing the God-Sealing Platform.\n\"What's this?\"\n\"Our prize.\"\nDamien had considered what he could gain in Douluo Continent.\nAwaken a martial soul? Gain soul rings or bones? Or some rare treasure?\nNone of that.\nHis path was clear: capture powerful beings, make them subordinates, and bring them to the Cardinal World.\nThe Cardinal World would reward them based on soul strength and uniqueness, granting race, Magicules, and unique skills.\nIn Douluo Continent, only ferocious beasts caught Damien's eye.\nSoul masters or gods? He wasn't interested.\nHumans in the Cardinal World remained human, with limited growth potential.\nBut the hundred-thousand-year embryo in his hand held one of Douluo Continent's top soul beasts.\nNo, calling the Snow Empress a soul beast was debatable.\nDamien saw her more like the Cardinal World's Greater Elemental.\nSimilar to Rimuru's Ifrit, the Titan of Flame, second only to the Elemental Lord among fire spirits.\n\"Let's talk to her.\"\nDamien was confident about recruiting Snow Empress.\nProbing the God-Sealing Platform with his mind, he saw a tall girl curled up in a golden cage-like space.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"Who are you?\"\nLong, snow-white hair cascaded to her feet. Sensing an outsider's presence, the girl opened her eyes.\nHer ice-blue eyes were ethereal, as if piercing through all worldly things.\nHer flawless, slender figure, clad in a plain white gown without adornment, exuded purity and stunning beauty.\n\"I'm Damien, the one who saved you from an evil God King.\"\n\"Evil… God King?\"\nThough sealed, Snow Empress couldn't easily sense the outside world.\nBut the fierce battle between Tang San, Shuna, and Shion was so intense that even in her sealed state, she felt the disturbance.\nShe didn't doubt Damien's words.\nShe just didn't understand what he meant by God King.\n\"Remember the soul masters who ascended to the God Realm ten thousand years ago?\"\nDamien quickly explained Tang San, his treatment of Douluo Continent as his personal domain, and his scheme to use her as a pawn.\n\"Grr~~\"\nThe more Snow Empress heard, the harder it was to suppress her fury.\nThough in a mental space, her power seeped out, spreading ice crystals and cracking the space itself.\nShe didn't suspect Damien of lying.\nFirstly, he wasn't human... a critical point.\nUnlike Douluo Continent's soul beasts, Cardinal World monsters were distinct. Snow Empress was certain Damien wasn't her kind.\nBut equally, he wasn't human.\nThat was enough.\nTo her, non-humans weren't automatic enemies.\nThe enemy of her enemy was a friend.\nSnow Empress's logic was simple.\n\"Thank you.\"\nThe Ice Snow Maiden, ruler of the Far North for hundreds of thousands of years, thanking Damien would shock countless soul beasts if word spread.\nBut Damien earned that gratitude.\n\"If you really want to thank me, how about coming with me?\"\n\"With you?\"\nSnow Empress didn't grasp his meaning. Did he want her to serve him, like a subordinate?\nIn the soul beast world, might ruled.\nShe valued her dignity and would never bow to another.\nBut…\nDamien had saved her life.\nRepaying him by helping with tasks wasn't unacceptable.\n\"I won't submit to anyone.\"\nShe quickly added, \"But if you need help with something, I'm willing.\"\nThis was her way of saying she'd work for him to repay her debt.\n\"And in my current state, please wait until I complete my transformation.\"\nShe was helpless about transforming.\nUnable to survive the 700,000-year tribulation, she chose transformation to pursue godhood.\nSuddenly, she wondered if her strength could truly help Damien.\n\"No, not work for me.\"\nAs she puzzled, Damien said, \"Come with me, leave this world, and explore a broader universe!\"\n\"Leave this world?\"\nHis words exceeded her expectations. \"You can take me out of this world?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nHaving read the original story, Damien knew Douluo Continent was a cage for soul beasts.\nSnow Empress's lifespan was nearly spent, forcing her to transform for a shot at godhood.\nBut Damien offered a ready solution.\nLeave Douluo Continent, and she'd break free from her shackles, gaining a new future.\nThe question was: could Damien take her across worlds?\nNo.\nWithout becoming his subordinate, she couldn't leave Douluo Continent. To depart, she'd have to join him.\n\"So, you want me to be your subordinate, like those who fought Tang San?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nDamien said, \"Don't worry, I won't force you to do anything against your will.\"\n\"Our bond is a shared fate. Your strength boosts mine.\"\n\"And as I grow stronger, you gain more!\"\nIn this era of Douluo Continent, soul spirits and intelligent soul rings weren't concepts yet, at least not to Snow Empress.\nFollowing Damien was far better than becoming someone's soul ring, soul bone, or dying in a tribulation.\nBut Snow Empress had her pride.\nShe believed transforming, becoming a god like Tang San, and ascending was a viable path.\n\"Ascend to godhood? Hah, forget it!\"\nDamien doused her hopes. \"You really think anyone can ascend from Douluo Continent under Tang San's watch?\"\nNo ruler would allow an uncontrolled resource to rise.\nUnless Snow Empress served Tang San, he'd never permit such a powerhouse to emerge.\n\"Tang! San!!!\"\nSnow Empress was aloof but not foolish.\nShe fully grasped Damien's meaning.\nWith Tang San overhead, no matter her confidence or talent, she'd be schemed to death.\nLike the Dragon God's shackles... whatever their original intent... under the God Realm's machinations, they doomed countless soul beasts and blocked her path to ascension.\n\"So, leave Douluo Continent, and the tribulation binding you will vanish.\"\n\"If you don't want to follow me, I can take you to another plane to break through.\"\nDamien was serious.\nEven if Snow Empress ascended in another plane, he could still recruit her as a subordinate.\nBut that would leave her owing him a massive debt.\nHer cold, proud nature didn't mean she was emotionless or ungrateful.\n\"Besides, following me has to be better than someone like Tang San, right?\"\nDamien had that confidence. Unlike Tang San's two-faced ways, he was straightforward.\nHe was generous to his own.\nIf he had a bite, his people wouldn't go hungry.\n\"Right, right, Damien's great.\"\nOgerpon's consciousness joined, forming a cute girl's silhouette beside him.\n\"Exactly.\"\n\"Shion and I were just ordinary Kijin from the forest, but Lord Damien granted us immense power.\"\nShuna appeared too, ready to persuade the new ally to join.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"What's the point of such a weak world?\"\n\"Follow the boss, and you'll face tons of strong opponents.\" Shion's words struck a chord with Snow Empress. \"Fight them, keep getting stronger... isn't that way better than being trapped in a tiny world?\"\nShe was right.\nThe trio's genuine gratitude and affection for Damien couldn't be faked.\nMost importantly, following Damien meant growing stronger.\nThat alone left Snow Empress with no reason to refuse.\n\"I can agree to join you.\"\n\"But I have conditions. If you can promise them, I'll fight by your side and never betray you!\"\nSnow Empress was steadfast.\nOnce decided, she wouldn't waver.\nDamien had shown her immense respect.\nIn her embryo state, with their strength, he could've enslaved her without all this talk.\nSelf-destruction only worked when strengths were close.\nBut Damien's group?\nSnow Empress sensed he could forcibly dominate her.\nHe didn't, because he wanted her loyalty, not a resentful servant.\nThat alone sparked considerable fondness in her.\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\"First, you can't force me to do anything against my will.\"\n\"No problem.\"\n\"Second, I want to return to this world someday…\"\nHer voice carried a chill. \"To take revenge on Tang San and those lofty gods!\"\nBeing captured like a toy.\nSuch humiliation was unbearable!\nShe'd grow stronger, return to Douluo Continent, and make those gods... especially Tang San... pay!\n\"Even if you didn't say it, I'd help you.\"\nAs his subordinate, she'd be family.\nHer grudges, Damien would share.\nBesides that, if the chance arose, he wouldn't mind conquering the Douluoverse, making it part of the Cardinal World.\n\"Good!\"\nRelieved by Damien's agreement, Snow Empress grew more satisfied with her new lord. \"What do I need to do to become your subordinate?\"\n\"Just relax.\"\nSeeing her consent, Damien didn't hesitate, activating his Capturer ability.\n\"What's this?!\"\nSnow Empress faintly heard a query, asking if she'd become Damien's subordinate.\nCapturer could forcibly bind or gently ask, as now.\n\"I agree.\"\nHaving decided, she wouldn't second-guess. She chose to trust Damien.\nIf betrayed, it'd be her fault for being naive.\n\"You won't regret it.\"\nThe conversion was smooth. With no resistance, their bond formed naturally.\n\"Rest in my mental space for now.\"\nDamien opened the God-Sealing Platform, releasing Snow Empress, using magic to stabilize her form.\nPale blue magic flowed like a gentle stream, healing the damage from her interrupted transformation.\nFull conversion required returning to the Cardinal World, using its rules.\n\"Thank you.\"\nWithout hesitation, Snow Empress entered Damien's body.\nThe subordinate contract let Damien trust her, and she learned of his origins and intentions through it.\nHe hadn't lied.\nThe bond was like family, sharing honor and disgrace.\nHe wouldn't harm or enslave her.\nShe'd protect and fight for him wholeheartedly.\n\"Lord Damien, where to next?\"\nShuna asked, \"Keep exploring this world?\"\n\"No.\"\nDamien looked up, his tone heavy. \"We can't return here for a while.\"\nBefore the girls could ask why, an intangible pressure descended from the sky, enveloping them.\n\"What's this?!\"\nIn sheer magnitude, the pressure rivaled a Special A-rank monster, though its quality was lacking.\n\"It's Tang San!\"\nIn the mental space, Snow Empress's voice rang out. \"He's been watching this world!\"\nThe evidence was undeniable, erasing her doubts.\nWithout Damien, she'd have been schemed to death by Tang San.\n\"Let's go back.\"\nDamien wasn't keen on clashing with Tang San directly.\nOne Tang San was fine, but facing the five God Kings together would be troublesome.\nRevenge could wait. This trip was a massive win.\nKilling the old man meant Tang San lost a direct puppet, reducing his influence over Douluo Continent.\nTaking Snow Empress gave Damien a subordinate with potential rivaling or surpassing Ogerpon.\n\"Planeswalker…\"\nBoom!!\n\"Damn humans!!\"\nAs Damien prepared to activate Planeswalker, a massive jade-green figure burst from the ice, unleashing a chilling torrent toward them.\nThud!!\nOgerpon moved swiftly, appearing before Damien.\n\"Bwoh!\"\nRaising both hands, she tore through the icy torrent, blocking Ice Empress's long-charged strike with raw strength.\n\"What?!\"\nIce Empress's gem-like eyes widened, stunned that her attack was so easily deflected.\n\"Ice!\"\nSnow Empress instantly recognized the jade scorpion... her rare friend in the Far North, Ice Empress.\n\"Tch, talk about bad timing.\"\nTang San's divine pressure had masked Ice Empress's approach.\nThis put Damien in an awkward spot.\nHe needed to return.\nBut what about Ice Empress?\nLeave her here?\nIf Tang San lost their trail, he'd likely take it out on her.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

You'll have to bear it for a while, Ice Empress.\"\nDamien appeared beside the sisters, unbothered by her sudden attack.\nSoul beasts attacking humans and humans hunting soul beasts were Douluo Continent's norm... nothing to dwell on.\nBut with Ice Empress as his third otherworld subordinate under such a strict contract, Damien felt conflicted.\nThe contract's power was absolute; he couldn't alter it yet.\nOnce he broke through to True Demon Lord, his Unique Skills would evolve, letting him master the contract and convert her servitude into a fair subordinate bond.\nServitude contracts were useful but flawed.\nForced enslavement bred resentment between subordinate and master.\nThis hindered future growth.\nFortunately, Damien wasn't that kind of person and wouldn't exploit Ice Empress.\n\"You… you're Damien?\"\nSeeing him, Ice Empress's first instinct wasn't to accuse or curse.\nThe tiny chibi Ice Empress stepped back, then, feeling unsafe, hid behind Snow Empress, peeking out timidly.\n\"Uh…\"\nDamien understood her state.\nThe servitude contract made defiance impossible.\nTo her, he was like a cruel slavemaster with a whip, his mere presence instilling fear.\nBargaining or pride? Laughable now.\n'I… I'm afraid of this guy.'\n'What a humiliation!'\nShe tried to resist the trembling, but the contract crushed any rebellious thoughts.\n\"It's okay, Ice. Damien's not like that. He won't bully you.\"\n\"Let's get along, Ice Empress.\"\nDamien smiled gently, beckoning her to his side.\nHe didn't use the contract's power, so she could refuse.\nBut would Ice Empress succumb to fear?\nShe'd face the abyss!\nWhen her small hand met Damien's, she felt his genuine warmth and welcome.\nThe sudden conversion had caught him off-guard too.\nBut it happened, and Damien saw it as their fate.\n\"Want to check your new powers?\"\nHe patted her soft head, smiling. \"Ice is way stronger now.\"\n\"Huh?!\"\nCaught up in the shock, she hadn't noticed.\nAt Damien's prompt, Ice Empress discovered her transformation.\nShe shifted from chibi scorpion to a girl with jade-green hair.\n\"What's happening?\"\n\"Subordinate contract? Cardinal World? Skills?\"\n\"I get it now!\"\nThe sudden joy overwhelmed her. Happiness came so fast.\nThe surging energy in her... magic.\nIn quality, soul power couldn't compare!\n\"Magic rivals the God Realm's divine power…\"\n\"No wonder it's so strong.\"\nA thought struck her. \"Does this mean I'm basically a god now?\"\n\"You're not wrong.\"\nDamien glanced at Snow Empress, who was also sensing her changes. \"If you return to Douluo Continent, you might not beat Tang San, but regular gods?

      "content": "[Common Skills]: Ice Magic, Ice and Bug-type Pokémon Magic\n\"Ice Magic likely blends Ice Empress's soul beast abilities with elemental magic from me.\"\n\"Ice and Bug-type Pokémon Magic.\"\nDamien wasn't surprised. His subordinates could awaken Pokémon moves based on their elemental affinities.\nHere, they're called Pokémon Magic.\nDifferent name, same essence.\n[Intrinsic Skills]: Ultimate Attribute, Ice Body, All Melee Mastery, Magic Amplification, Super Regeneration\nThe latter three Intrinsic Skills came from Damien.\n\"Ultimate Attribute. The Voice of the World mentioned new rules earlier.\"\nDamien recalled Douluo Continent's Ultimate Attribute, signifying peak mastery of an element, a mark of talent.\nIn the Cardinal World, it evolved into a passive that amplified same-element attacks and heavily countered others.\nNice, but not groundbreaking.\n\"Compared to Ultimate Attribute, Ice Body is more intriguing.\"\nSimply put, Ice Empress's Ice Body resembled Kuzan's Freeze-Freeze Fruit from One Piece, granting elementalization.\nThis made her immune to most Common Skills and highly resistant to physical Extra Skills.\nDefeating her required magic or rule-based Extra Skills.\nOtherwise, with Ice Body's near-bug-level elementalization, she was nearly invincible.\nOf course, raw power could overwhelm.\nLike Milim's world-destroying Drago Nova... Ice Body or not, Ice Empress would be obliterated.\nIn the Cardinal World, Magicules weren't everything, but they were dominant.\nBrute force trumped all.\n[Extra Skills]: Thought Acceleration, Universal Sense, Ice and Snow Domination, Spatial Manipulation, Multi-Barrier\n\"Most abilities carried over, plus Ice and Snow Domination.\"\nWhat Damien anticipated most was Ice Empress's Unique Skill.\nExtreme Cold Prison reminded him of Ciel's Infinite Prison, the skill sealing Veldora.\nHers was a lesser version.\n\"In purity, Extreme Cold Prison is a lower-rarity Unique Skill.\"\n\"But this ability…\"\nDamien saw its strength and potential, rivaling Ciel's Infinite Prison.\nBoth were sealing, binding, control-type skills.\nWhen used, they enabled cross-tier challenges.\n[Exclusive Skill]: Twin Martial Soul: Eternal Night Radiant Sun\n[Special Skills]: Magicule Solidification (Inheritable), Ring of Divinity (Non-Inheritable)\n\"Twin Martial Soul? Fusion technique?\"\n\"No, not a fusion technique!\"\nDamien analyzed the Exclusive Skill.\nUnique, Exclusive, and Special Skills couldn't be copied or stolen, highly distinct.\nThey were all Unique Skills, just categorized more precisely by the Voice of the World.\n\"Twin Martial Soul: Eternal Night Radiant Sun has two uses.\"\n\"First, Ice and Snow Empresss resonate, with Ice Empress leading, unleashing a Demon Lord-level strike.\"\nDemon Lord-level destruction was terrifying.\nBut the second use intrigued Damien more.\nIt let Ice and Snow Empresss possess Damien, temporarily boosting him a full realm for battle.\n\"So, a transformation skill? Like martial soul possession?\"\nAs expected from Douluo Continent's system, it had that world's flavor.\n\"No wonder it's called Twin Martial Soul.\"\nTechnically, Damien was a soul master now, with Ice Jade Emperor Scorpion and Ice Snow Maiden as his martial souls.\nFinally, Damien focused on Ice Empress's Special Skill.\nSpecial Skills stood out because they diverged from the Cardinal World.\nThey were fragments from other worlds, integrated into the skill system via Damien.\nStardust Manipulation was the Cardinal World's root.\nMagicule Solidification was Konosubaverse's skill tree refined.\nNow, Ring of Divinity followed suit.\nDouluo Continent's hallmark: soul masters had soul rings, gods had divine rings.\nSoul rings aside, divine rings maxed at nine for Supreme God Kings.\nBut Damien's Ring of Divinity allowed ten.\nHe could pre-store ten skills, releasing them instantly in battle without cooldowns.\n\"A godly skill!\"\n\"Ring of Divinity is a game-changer!\"\nIts storage limit tied to Damien's capacity.\nLike the maxed-out Explosion Magic used against the insect monster, he could prepare ten in advance.\nWhenever free, he could stockpile.\nMoreover, divine rings could store magic and any energy Damien controlled.\n\"Skills, energy…\"\nDamien was at a loss for words. This Special Skill was a combat masterpiece.\nThe catch? Ring of Divinity seemed exclusive to Douluo Continent subordinates.\nHe couldn't pass it to Ogerpon or other named monsters.\nBut Magicule Solidification?\n\"The ultimate utility, Magicule Solidification... I crown you the workhorse!\"\nAs a Special Skill, it couldn't be mimicked or copied, ensuring exclusivity.\nYet, Damien could share it among his followers.\nFrom subordinates to named monsters.\nThis vastly boosted their overall strength.\nMagicules equated to physical and mental power; enhancing them meant comprehensive growth.\n\"Magicule Solidification seems unremarkable but creates stat freaks.\"\nWith enough Magicules, it could negate most mechanics.\nBecause Magicules themselves were a skill.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

She never imagined becoming a subordinate would bring such a massive boost.\nPride and freedom were relative.\nIn the soul beast world, might ruled, and survival was king.\nIn the original Douluo Dalu 2, Ice Empress, to survive, accepted Skydream Iceworm's persuasion and became Huo Yuhao's second martial soul.\nNow, facing an impending tribulation and certain death, she was in the same predicament.\nIn such times, becoming a subordinate to survive wasn't a big deal, was it?\nIn the end, both she and Snow Empress became Huo Yuhao's divine beasts.\nSeemingly grand, but still pets of human gods, with no control over their fate.\n\"Sorry, I misjudged you, Master.\"\nIce Empress's \"Master\" carried no resentment.\nIf word spread that becoming Damien's subordinate brought such transformation, countless Douluo Continent soul beasts would fight for the chance.\nShe'd paid with her freedom.\nBut compared to a bright future and survival, what was that cost?\nIt all depended on choosing the right master.\nFor now, Ice and Snow Empresss were lucky, meeting a generous, humane master.\n\"Master, huh?\"\nSnow Empress nodded, viewing her own status panel. \"Calling our lord by name isn't proper. I'll use Master too.\"\n\"Uh, no need for that…\"\nDamien wanted them to just call him Damien, but seeing their resolve, he let it go.\nSubordinate and master.\nIt was a transaction.\nYet Ice and Snow Empresss had won big.\nSome might say Damien benefited too.\nBut to them, he had endless choices, while they had only this one shot to follow him.\nThey were luckier than any other Douluo Continent soul beast.\n\"Please, let Ice and me serve at your side to repay your kindness.\"\n\"Mm-hmm!\"\nIce Empress nodded obediently. If her sister said so, she'd follow.\n\"Alright.\"\nDamien turned to Snow Empress. \"How do you feel?\"\n\"Very strong!\"\nA rare smile, like melting winter snow, crossed her cool, stunning face. \"Perhaps I'm now the strongest under Master's command.\"\n[Snow Empress]\n[Race: Greater Elementals of Ice]\n[Magicules: 86,000 (High-tier A-rank)]\n[Common Skills: Ice Magic, Ice and Fairy-type Pokémon Magic]\n[Intrinsic Skills: Ice and Snow Body, All Sword Mastery, All Melee Mastery, Magic Amplification, Super Regeneration]\n[Extra Skills: Ultimate Attribute, Thought Acceleration, Universal Sense, Ice and Snow Domination, Spatial Manipulation, Multi-Barrier]\n[Unique Skills: Sword Saint (Mastery of swordsmanship and martial arts), Nature's Realm (Absorbs external Magicules to create and transform natural substances)]\n[Exclusive Skill: Twin Martial Soul: Frost Desolation Empress (Linked with Ice Empress as Damien's martial souls, bound as twins, enables martial soul fusion)]\n[Special Skills: Magicule Solidification, Ring of Divinity]\n[Resistances: Physical Attack Immunity, Status Effect Immunity, Mental Attack Immunity, Natural Effect Immunity, Holy-Demonic Attack Resistance]\n\"86,000 Magicules.\"\n\"Sword Saint and Nature's Realm, two Unique Skills.\"\n\"Also has the Exclusive Skill 'Twin Martial Soul,' just with a different name.\"\nWhen Snow Empress leads, fusing Ice Empress's power, she ascends to Frost Desolation Empress, breaking through a major realm.\nThis transformation heavily drains her Magicules, suitable only for brief bursts.\nWhen Damien undergoes martial soul possession, he can enter this state too.\nIn truth, both Exclusive Skills are identical.\nSnow Empress leads for Frost Desolation Empress.\nIce Empress leads for Eternal Night Radiant Sun.\nWhen Damien uses it, he transforms into Frost Desolation Sovereign, gaining the ability to unleash Eternal Night Radiant Sun's ultimate destruction.\n\"Whether Snow or Ice Empress, their fused power has flaws.\"\n\"Only by fusing with me can this Exclusive Skill's true strength shine.\"\nDuring martial soul possession, their Magicules stack.\nWithout qualitative change, it's pure numerical beauty.\nCurrently, the trio's combined Magicules could exceed 200,000 with possession.\nThat's Demon Lord Seed level.\nIn other words, Damien now had the strength to rival a Demon Lord Seed!\n\"Your Sword Saint Unique Skill…\"\nDamien asked, \"You know swordsmanship?\"\n\"Not just swordsmanship!\"\nBefore Snow Empress could reply, Ice Empress, proud of her sister's innate Snowstorm Saint Body, exclaimed, \"Snow Empress excels in sword and palm techniques, the pride of the Far North!\"\n\"Indeed.\"\nSnow Empress didn't feign modesty, nodding naturally.\nDouluo Continent soul masters used soul skills; soul beasts were similar, limited to a few moves.\nBut Snow Empress forged her own path, creating the Snow Empress's Three Absolutes.\nEmperor Sword: Peerless Ice, Emperor Palm: Great Cold Snowless, Emperor Frost Heaven: Snowdance Radiant Sun.\nSword technique, palm strike, and domain.\nThe Cardinal World's Sword Saint wasn't just about swords... it encompassed swordsmanship, bladework, spearmanship, and close-combat fighting.\nThe Sword Saint Unique Skill was granted to those who reached martial mastery.\nSnow Empress lived 700,000 years.\nThat timespan, though inflated, was real. She'd spent those eons perfecting her craft.\nImagine a master honing their art for 700,000 years in the Cardinal World.\nPer the Voice of the World, who could compete for the Sword Saint title?\nNo one!\nThus, Snow Empress claimed it effortlessly, earning the Unique Skill [Sword Saint].\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

With you, we'll never lack resources.\"\nMagic equaled resources, and resources fueled growth.\nNo wonder it was called Nature's Realm.\nSnow Empress alone could sustain Damien's entire crew, with a bright future ahead.\n[Damien]\n[Race: Dragonoid (Pseudo)]\n[Rank: High-tier A-rank (87,000 EP)]\n[Class: Mage]\n[Common Skills: Lifestyle Magic, Healing Magic, Elemental Magic, Pokémon Magic, etc.]\n[Intrinsic Skills: Adaptability, All-Class Mastery]\n[Extra Skills: Dragon's Eye, Explosion Magic, Soul Summoning, Human-Soul Union]\n[Unique Skills: Planeswalker [Exceptional], Leader, Capturer, Learner, Spirit Tamer (Converts subordinates into soul spirits and grants soul spirit space)]\n[Special Skills: Magicule Solidification (Inheritable), Stardust Manipulation (Non-Inheritable), Ring of Divinity (Non-Inheritable)]\n[Exclusive Skill: Twin Martial Soul: Frost Desolation Sovereign (Possesses Snow Empress and Ice Empress martial souls, can summon or possess)]\n[Familliars: Ogerpon, Snow Empress, Ice Empress (3/6); Benimaru, Shuna, Shion, Souei (4/6)]\n[Marked Worlds: Pokémonverse(On Cooldown), Konosubaverse(On Cooldown), Douluoverse(Locked)]\n\"Spirit Tamer, a new Unique Skill.\"\nDamien was thrilled to gain another.\nSpirit Tamer let him convert subordinates into soul spirits, living in a soul spirit space.\nHe already had an Spirit Space.\nBut Spirit Space and soul spirit space were fundamentally different.\nSoul spirit space, based on mental energy, let Damien materialize anything, ensuring subordinates' comfort.\nSpirit Space stored materials and bodies but was cramped and barren.\n\"Could these skills merge?\"\nCombining matter and consciousness could create a portable mini-world.\nBut it was a tough challenge, and Damien had no leads.\nAs for the Douluoverse's lock, he wasn't surprised.\nTang San, Douluo Continent's God of Judgement, wielded significant authority, triggering world rules to bar entry. It made sense.\nDamien didn't care.\nDouluo Continent was in the Unrivaled Tang Sect era; Tang San's growth was limited.\nDamien's progress was beyond Tang San's imagination.\nOnce he could break Douluo Continent's lock, he'd confront Tang San about today.\nMeanwhile, east of the Jura Forest, a castle perched on a cliff, radiating an eerie aura.\n\"The plan failed.\"\n\"Failed, failed~~\"\nLaplace, the pleasure-seeking clown, reported the latest forest intel.\nNearby, a girl named Tear spun circles, giggling as she echoed Laplace.\n\"Hmph!\"\nFootman snorted, \"Those bugs were useless.\"\n\"Just failed experiments.

Probably some nobody from a backwater.\"\n\"Don't underestimate him, Clayman.\"\nLaplace's tone grew serious. \"He's odd.

      "content": "The sun set, casting golden rays over the rural village, blending with the fresh green of the fields to form a serene, harmonious scene.\nSmoke curled from wooden cabins, merging with the dimming sky, a natural bridge between earth and heaven.\n\"Bwoh bwoh~ Bwoh hmm!\"\nA girl in a straw hat, pants rolled up, waded through the muddy paddy, planting rice seedlings.\nOgerpon hummed an incomprehensible tune, releasing a green Grassy Terrain from her body, nourishing the soil and seedlings with Grass-type magic for robust growth.\nBeside her, sturdy Kijin worked in unison, planting seedlings.\nThey cultivated not just rice but vegetables and fruits too.\nThe Cardinal World boasted diverse crops, including unique otherworld varieties and Earth seeds.\nWith skills, creating crops, altering genes, and breeding varieties was far simpler than on Earth.\nThis made the Cardinal World's biodiversity far richer than in the original story.\nSplash~~\nBefore the cabin, a small river, about four or five meters wide, flowed gently, its clear ripples echoing the distant sounds of fieldwork, crafting a tranquil pastoral life.\nThe stream was dug by Benimaru and his crew.\nThe Kijin planted cherry and peach trees along its banks. A breeze sent pink and white petals drifting like snow, turning the village into a hidden paradise in the Jura Forest.\n\"How's it feel?\"\nDamien sat by the river, fishing rod in hand, leisurely awaiting a bite.\n\"It's nice. I like this world.\"\nSnow Empress stood behind him, glancing at Ice Empress playing with Kijin children nearby. \"I haven't seen Ice this happy in ages.\"\nIce Empress seemed aloof but had a childlike streak, much like Ogerpon.\nOgerpon, a kind soul, hit it off with her quickly.\nOh, and Shion too.\nThe trio, like mischievous tomboys, followed Shion's lead to wreak havoc on the forest's dim-witted magical beasts.\nThat was a good thing.\nMagical beasts were endless.\nAs long as Magicules existed, new ones would spawn after each cull.\nUnlike soul beasts, magical beasts were resources in the Cardinal World.\nMonsters and human adventurers alike hunted them.\nMagical Beasts: When can we rise?\nSadly, never.\nThey lacked souls, essential for evolution.\nDamien didn't recruit them because they couldn't provide Magicules.\n\"I've been learning management from Shuna.\"\nSnow Empress saw herself as Damien's deputy.\nTo excel, she needed both intellect and strength.\nShe disliked being second to anyone but refused to leave Damien, choosing the deputy role.\nSeeing a new world, failing to grow stronger would waste his kindness.\nThis hard-won chance, she wouldn't let slip.\n\"Also, Benimaru's swordsmanship has been enlightening.\"\nBack in the Cardinal World, Snow Empress established her authority.\nLike Ogerpon, she first subdued the Kijin, including Benimaru and Shion.\nUnder Damien, only Ogerpon and Ice Empress could challenge her.\nEven Ogerpon, facing Snow Empress's unleashed Frost Desolation Empress, had to evade and stall.\nBut Snow Empress gave no such openings.\nInitially, unfamiliar with Ogerpon's abilities, she took losses.\nAfter that, Ogerpon never gained the upper hand again.\nDamien could only say the Sword Saint Unique Skill gave Snow Empress a massive edge.\n\"And Ogerpon's been improving fast.\"\nHalf a month had passed since returning.\nThe Kijin village thrived, with clansmen returning from mercenary missions.\nNew members brought more Magicules.\nOgerpon's growth remained Damien's top Magicule source, unmatched.\nBut at A-rank, she needed B-rank or higher foes for experience.\nB-rank magical beasts were scarce in the Jura Forest, mostly in Veldora's sealed labyrinth.\nDamien wasn't ready to deal with Veldora.\nHis Dragonoid race urged low-profile growth to avoid dragonkin scrutiny.\nThis slowed Ogerpon's experience gains.\nIn half a month, her Magicules barely hit 48,000.\nThanks to her boost, Damien's Magicules broke 90,000, reaching peak A-rank.\n\"Let's go, Snow.\"\nDamien stored his gear in his space and called to Snow Empress. \"Time for today's training.\"\n\"Mm.\"\nShe followed, daily honing his combat skills and power familiarity.\nDamien's Magicules were vast, his stats high.\nBut his skill synergy and improvisation were lacking.\nWith such power, he barely used 5%.\nSnow Empress saw he wasn't bad at fighting.\nHe had combat talent.\nWhat he lacked was experience.\nSoon, they returned to their cabin.\nThey skipped the village's arena.\nNo need.\nWith the soul spirit space, they could simulate battles mentally.\n\"Hm?\"\nIce Empress, heading to play with Ogerpon, paused. \"Starting again?\"\n\"Good. Let's see Master's progress.\"\nShe split her consciousness, sending a sliver to control her body toward the fields, focusing most on the soul spirit space battle.\nShion, Shuna, and others did the same.\nBesides Ice and Snow Empresss' constant presence, other subordinates, with Damien's permission, could enter as soul spirits.\nThe space was a perfect combat stage, loved by all for sparring.\nOver time, they created a power ranking.\nAmong the seven subordinates, Snow Empress topped the list.\nOgerpon was second.\nShion and Ice Empress were close, trading wins daily.\nBenimaru, with legion-focused Unique Skills, lagged slightly.\nSouei, an assassin, and Shuna, a priestess, couldn't match the combat fanatics head-on.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"How many Goblins can we recruit nearby?\"\n\"Well…\"\nShuna replied, \"The closest Goblin village has maybe a few dozen.\"\n\"That's it?\"\n\"Sorry, Lord Damien.\"\nShuna explained, \"We're too few, and the forest's too vast for a thorough search.\"\nIn the original story, the Jura Forest seemed small.\nBut living here, Damien realized its true scale.\nMore than a forest, it was a diverse landscape of grasslands, swamps, lakes, and hills.\nThese regions, divided by dense woods, formed the Jura Forest's monster ecosystem.\n\"No worries, you've done your best.\"\nDamien wouldn't fault the loyal Kijin.\n\"I know about the Goblins.\"\nAs Damien pondered better ways to scout the forest's tribes, a figure emerged... Treyni, the Dryad.\n\"Miss Treyni!\"\nNearly a month had passed since Treyni witnessed Damien's Explosion Magic.\nShe'd kept tabs on him, occasionally visiting.\nDamien warmly invited her to sample the village's cuisine.\nDryads were the forest's guardians.\nTheir presence ensured its vitality.\nBefriending Treyni was only beneficial.\n\"Here's our new potato chips, Miss Treyni.\"\nShuna presented a bowl of freshly fried chips, instantly capturing Treyni's attention. \"Then, I won't hold back.\"\nCrunch!\nTreyni held a chip, hand on cheek, eyes gleaming with delight. \"Ah, these potato chips are divine.\"\n\"…\"\nDamien didn't quite get Treyni's chip obsession.\nBut knowing her potato fixation from the original story, he used chips to win her over.\nThe effect was undeniable... Treyni was hooked.\nDamien figured with time, he could make her a subordinate.\nYes, a subordinate.\nTreyni and her sisters guarded the Jura Forest.\nIn the original story, she followed Ramiris.\nThat hadn't happened yet.\nDamien had a chance to win her, gaining oversight of the forest.\n'Not yet, though.'\nWinning Treyni's favor wasn't hard.\nEven now, he had a shot at making her a subordinate.\nThe issue? Her monster rank surpassed his.\nDon't underestimate Treyni.\nThat woman seemed unassuming, but her Magicules exceeded 100,000.\nCapturer couldn't convert beings stronger than Damien, a major flaw.\n\"Miss Treyni, would you help us recruit the forest's Goblin tribes?\"\n\"I'm always treated so well here; I'd like to repay you.\"\nTreyni saw potential in Damien to unify the Jura Forest.\nVeldora, the forest's lord, was sealed in the labyrinth, rarely involved.\nA strong monster uniting the forest's creatures would ease Treyni's worries about external threats.\n\"That's a huge help, Miss Treyni.\"\nShuna asked, \"How many Goblins live in the forest now?\"\n\"Goblins breed quickly.\"\n\"When I was young, there was a Goblin calamity... over five million rampaging through the forest.\"\n\"How many?!\"\nDamien was stunned. Classic Goblins.\nBut something didn't add up.\nHe didn't recall Rimuru having that many Goblins.\nIn the original story, Rimuru tamed one Goblin village, maybe sixty or seventy strong.\nEven with later recruits, they never exceeded 2,000.\nYet Shuna suggested Goblins could form a nation.\n\"Indeed, that happened.\"\nTreyni, listening, recalled, \"Back then, Goblins were everywhere, flooding the forest.\"\n\"They expanded recklessly, drawing human adventurers' mass culls.\"\n\"That event slashed their numbers. Many fled east.\"\n\"East is safer?\"\nDamien assumed Goblins migrated, explaining Rimuru's small numbers.\nCommon fantasy Goblins, outnumbered by Orcs? Laughable.\n\"No.\"\nTreyni shook her head. \"The eastern Goblins mostly died out.\"\n\"Uh…\"\nShuna soon clarified.\nThe Jura Forest, nominally Veldora's domain, was recognized by the Demon Lords, Western Nations, and Eastern Empire.\nThe forest teemed with magical beasts and monsters, often culled by nearby nations.\nDuring the Goblin surge, the Eastern Empire and Western Nations drove them back.\nThey thought escaping humans ensured safety.\nBut Milim, Carrion, and Dagruel, unimpressed by weak Goblins, purged them.\n\"Now, only the forest's core has Goblins, maybe 30,000 at most.\"\nNormally, the Jura Forest's Goblins wouldn't be as few as in the original story.\nOtherwise, adventurers would lack Goblin-hunting quests.\nBut the situation was unique.\nWith Veldora's aura gone, forest monsters, unchecked, devoured each other.\nWeak Goblins dropping from tens of thousands to 2,000 wasn't surprising.\n\"Won't Goblins go extinct?\"\n\"No.\"\nTreyni said, \"Monsters are hard to truly eradicate.\"\nMonster factors persisted despite a race's extinction.\nEven if all Goblins died, new ones could emerge.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Damien's Leader skill shared followers' soul energy, fueling his growth.\nBut Goblins had a capped existence value.\nThe more numerous, the lower each Goblin's quality.\nThus, Rimuru's approach... taming a few thousand Goblins... allowed them to evolve into Hobgoblins.\nMillions, even tens of millions, of racial blessing condensed into thousands.\nEach became one-in-a-thousand, or one-in-ten-thousand.\n\"The more of a race, the lower their individual potential.\"\n\"Your Kijin, at around 300, are well-balanced.\" Treyni noted. \"If their numbers grow, they'll lose their status as the forest's strongest.\"\n\"What?!\"\nShuna, Shion, and the Kijin gasped at this revelation.\n\"So, each race's ceiling is predetermined?\"\n\"Yes and no.\"\nTreyni paused, giving Damien a look.\nHe caught on, signaling for more chips.\nSatisfied, she thought him a perceptive leader.\nHer early investment wasn't wasted.\n\"Racial existence value caps at A-rank.\"\nTreyni crunched a chip. \"Beyond that, it's about individuals.\"\nOnce an individual transcended, their race took pride in them, not vice versa.\n\"When a monster race births a Demon Lord Seed, its existence value rises.\"\nIf the Voice of the World was the heavens, breaking racial limits to become a Demon Lord Seed was a path to ascension.\nPioneers paved the way, easing the journey for others.\n\"But weak monsters like Goblins have never produced a Demon Lord Seed.\"\nThis made it nearly impossible for Goblins to evolve that far.\nThey lacked a reference, forced to forge their own path.\n\"That's why Goblins are so weak.\"\nA thriving Goblin population meant lower individual potential.\nTo become a king, a Goblin would first need to cull its kin.\nQuantity versus individual strength.\nThis highlighted the edge of rare races.\n\"So, naming is a superior uplifting the weak?\"\n\"Exactly.\"\nTreyni nodded. \"No path exists, but a strong hand can make it simple.\"\nThe strong set the rules.\nIn the original story, Rimuru turned thousands of Goblins into Hobgoblins, boosting their racial existence value.\nThose Hobgoblins diverged from other Goblins, no longer sharing the same value.\n\"How many Goblins are in the western forest near us?\"\nDamien couldn't cross the forest to recruit scattered southern or northern villages.\nHe'd start with the west.\n\"About 8,000.\"\n\"Not bad.\"\nDamien liked that number.\nHe wasn't fond of weak Goblins, but Hobgoblins, akin to World of Warcraft's green-skinned Orcs, were more appealing.\n\"Miss Treyni, can you guide us to their camps?\"\nShuna offered another bag of chips as thanks.\n\"Of course.\"\nTreyni, softened by gifts, was firmly in Shuna's grasp.\nThe expedition team was small: Treyni as guide, plus a few named Kijin.\nLeading was Sakurako, a gentle priestess.\nTrained by Shuna in diplomacy, she was joined by a ninja and two melee-focused Red Ogres.\nFour A-rank Kijin warriors.\nBefore Damien's arrival, this force could've conquered the western forest, not just recruited Goblins.\nBenimaru and Hakurou's teams also set out, targeting the Tengu mountains to deliver Damien's goodwill.\nIf possible, he wanted the Tengu to bolster his air forces.\nTwo days passed.\n\"Lord Damien.\"\nThat night, Souei contacted him.\n\"You're there, Souei?\"\nDamien asked, \"How's it looking?\"\n\"It's bad.\"\nSouei was sent to scout the Orcs.\nIn the original story, the Orcs, starving, saw their leader... later the Orc Lord... seek hope elsewhere.\nNotably, the Orc leader had the Unique Skill Hungerer before Gelmud named him.\nHungerer, like a curse, spiked the docile Orcs' appetites, exhausting food stores and driving them to cannibalism.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

For now, it would keep its head as low as possible.\n\"Bring your pack here.\"\n\"Yes!\"\nThe Direwolves leader didn't dare defy him and let out a long howl, summoning its pack.\nSoon, nearly 500 Direwolves gathered before Damien.\nMassive in size, each stood nearly a meter tall, proper large wolves.\n\"Submit to me, and you'll be my people.\"\nIn the original story, Rimuru killed the Direwolves leader, yet its son, Ranga, still chose to follow him, leading to the meme of 'a mere father's death.'\nIn contrast, Damien had no real conflict with the Direwolves.\n\"Select the eighteen most outstanding wolves from your pack, and I'll grant them names.\"\n\"!!!\"\nDamien's words stunned the Direwolves leader.\nIt looked at him in disbelief, wondering if it had misheard. \"Y-You mean you'll name us?\"\n\"What?\"\nDamien teased, \"Don't want it?\"\n\"No!\"\n\"Thank you for your grace!\"\nThe Direwolves leader trembled with excitement. \"We, the Direwolves, swear to follow you for generations, defending your authority with our lives!\"\nAs the leader's words fell, the Direwolves behind it knelt one after another.\nThey pledged their loyalty to their great and generous master.\n\"And the goblins.\"\nDamien didn't forget the weaker ones. \"Select 100 of your kind, and I'll grant you names.\"\n\"R-Really?\"\nHearing that Damien was willing to name even weak goblins like them, the goblins were deeply moved, many female goblins even shedding tears.\n\"What a merciful lord.\"\n\"To think you'd shelter even weaklings like us.\"\nThe elderly goblin village chief had thought that being under Damien's protection was already a great fortune.\nWho could have imagined that the goblins would be so lucky as to encounter such a lord?\n\"Come forward and line up.\"\nDamien waved, signaling the village chief to bring the 100 goblins forward.\n\"You stay too.\"\nAs the village chief turned to leave, Damien stopped him. \"At your age, without a name, you probably won't last long.\"\n\"From now on, you'll be Rigurd, leader of the Goblins, serving me.\"\nThese words moved the village chief to tears again.\nDamien even felt that if he ordered Rigurd to 'end himself,' the goblin would unhesitatingly obey on the spot.\nAs for the name Rigurd, at this point in time, the Majin Gelmud hadn't yet visited the goblin village or named Rigurd's eldest son.\n\"For you two, the older brother will be Rirud, the younger Rigud.\"\n\"And the rest of you…\"\nFor the goblins, beyond the initial father and sons, Damien named them more casually: \"Gobta, Gobna, Gobya…\"\nThe naming process was quick. Damien checked his magicule consumption, which had dropped by about 60,000.\nWith over 200,000 magicules, losing 60,000 brought him below 200,000.\nYet, his Demon Lord Seed status remained intact.\nIn fact, even if Damien depleted all his magicules, he'd still be a Demon Lord Seed.\nThe Demon Lord Seed title was the Cardinal World's recognition of a monster's potential to reach True Demon Lord status.\n\"I used 100,000 magicules and got 40,000 back from the goblins, so a net loss of 60,000.\"\nNormally, elevating an E-rank goblin to a C-rank hobgoblin would require around 2,000 magicules.\nFor 100 goblins, that would be 200,000.\nBut Damien had someone upstairs. Violet pulled some strings, giving him a fifty-percent discount, so it only cost 100,000 magicules.\n'Not bad, Violet…'\nDamien mentally gave Violet a thumbs-up. His trusty partner was already saving him resources right after joining.\nMagicules: 205,000 → 145,000\nWith the goblin naming complete, the Direwolves had also selected those worthy of receiving names…\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"Master.\"\n\"These are the finest among our pack's younger generation!\"\nAfter careful selection, the Direwolves leader presented eighteen of the strongest and youngest wolves to Damien.\nAmong them was Ranga from the original story, along with others not named in the novels.\nInterestingly, the eighteen wolves consisted of nine males and nine females.\nDamien had no intention of pairing them up.\nOnce monsters evolved, reproduction became difficult and could even endanger the parents' lives.\nOf course, Damien wouldn't interfere with their freedom of choice.\nThey could pair up or remain single... it was up to the wolves.\n\"Including you, that's nineteen Direwolves.\"\nDamien had his own plans. Unlike Rimuru's collective naming approach for the Direwolves, he chose a different method.\nThe eighteen wolves would represent the eighteen Pokémon types.\nEach would inherit one type, forming their own tribes.\nThe Direwolves leader would serve as the overarching leader of the pack.\n\"From now on, you'll be called Hoshiga!\"\nBesides the leader, Hoshiga, the other eighteen Direwolves were named.\nMales: Ranga, Shiroga, Iwaga, Hagane, Chiga, Raiga, Ryuga, Akuga, Tataga.\nFemales: Honooga, Haruga, Mega, Yureiga, Kokoroga, Koriga, Tsukiga, Hikaga, Dokuga.\nAmong them, Hoshiga inherited some of Damien's traits as a Star Dragon King descendant.\nWhile unable to manipulate Stardusts, Hoshiga gained control over spacetime and starlight power.\nWith Hoshiga as the namesake, the entire Direwolves evolved into the StarDirewolves.\nBeneath them, eighteen tribes were formed, named after their leaders, such as Star Ranga Wolves and Star FlameDirewolves.\n\"Hmm…\"\nAfter the naming, Damien immediately felt a massive drain of magicules.\nFor the first time, he experienced dizziness.\nThis was the consequence of rapid magicule depletion.\n\"Looks like I'll need to rest for a bit.\"\nDamien hadn't expected to share Rimuru's experience. He quickly summoned Violet. \"I'll leave the rest to you, Violet.\"\n\"Please rest well.\"\nWithout needing further words, Violet, in sync with Damien's thoughts, caught him as he collapsed into her arms.\n\"…\"\nThis scene, however, sparked an inexplicable dissatisfaction in the Snow Empress.\nShe didn't understand what this feeling meant.\nIt was simply an irrepressible irritation in her heart.\n\"Who are you?\"\nThe Snow Empress stepped forward, wary of the sudden appearance of this girl.\n\"Violet.\"\nViolet replied calmly, \"I am Damien's other half.\"\n\"!!!\"\nThis sudden declaration left the Snow Empress and the nearby Ogres dumbfounded.\n\"Other half?\"\n\"Isn't that the mistress?\"\n\"What a bold claim.\"\n\"…\"\n\"Nonsense!\"\nThe Snow Empress snapped coldly, \"I wasn't aware he had someone like you by his side.\"\nNormally, the Snow Empress wasn't one to get angry easily.\nBut when it came to Damien's safety and some unfamiliar emotion she couldn't name, she couldn't tolerate Violet's reckless words.\n\"You can ask Damien about that.\"\n\"For now, shouldn't we focus on protecting him rather than arguing?\"\nViolet's words left the Snow Empress with no rebuttal.\nWith no choice, the Snow Empress stood guard nearby.\nShe protected Damien while keeping an eye on Violet, speculating about her identity.\nLeaving aside the silent vigil of the Snow Empress and Violet, the changes in the Direwolves drew the attention of the hobgoblins, goblins, and Ogres.\nThe once-ordinary giant wolves, only slightly larger than typical beasts, now radiated bursts of colorful light.\nRed, blue, green.\nIn an instant, the moonlit grasslands transformed into a dazzling stage under neon lights, leaving Sakurako and the others in awe.\n[Individual evolution successful. Calculating total magicules of followers.]\n[Calculation complete. As the namer, 15% of magicules are shared.]\n[Acquired 900 magicules.]\n[Individual evolution successful…]\n[Acquired 950 magicules.]\n[Acquired 1100 magicules.]\n[Acquired…]\nAs the Direwolves evolved into the StarDirewolves, the power of the eighteen tribal leaders radiated outward.\nThe 500 wolves evolved into their corresponding tribes based on their affinities.\nThis naming had nearly depleted all of Damien's magicules.\nA full 200,000 magicules were consumed in an instant.\nIn return, the nineteen wolves, including Hoshiga, evolved simultaneously.\nHoshiga gained the most, receiving over 50,000 magicules from Damien.\nEven with Violet's backdoor discount, it still cost Damien 25,000 magicules.\nCombined with his existing magicules, Hoshiga, the pack leader, leaped from C+ rank to high-tier A rank.\nThe remaining eighteen wolves each surpassed 14,000 magicules, becoming true A-rank monsters.\nThat was 180,000 magicules in total, reduced to 90,000 after the discount.\nDue to their racial traits, the StarDirewolves was now classified as beastmen rather than mere wolves.\nIn the Cardinal World, beastmen could shift between beast and humanoid forms.\nHoshiga and the other eighteen leaders gained this ability.\nHumanoid form, werewolf form, and their original giant wolf form.\nThey could freely choose their preferred lifestyle among these three states.\nBy this point, Damien's magicules had dropped from 145,000 to 30,000.\nAs for the remaining wolves, they were originally C-rank monsters, only reaching B- rank strength when acting as a pack due to their inherent traits.\nCollective equals individual; individual equals collective.\nThis didn't mean 500 wolves could team up to defeat a single B- rank monster.\nRather, as their numbers grew, each wolf's strength increased from C-rank to B- rank.\nYes, 500 B- rank monsters.\nThat was the true terror of the Direwolves.\n***\n[1] Star Fang: Hoshiga, Storm Fang: Ranga, White Fang: Shiroga, Rock Fang: Iwaga, Steel Fang: Hagane, Earth Fang: Chiga, Thunder Fang: Raiga, Dragon Fang: Ryuga, Vile Fang: Akuga, Fight Fang: Tataga, Flame Fang: Honooga, Spring Fang: Haruga, Sprout Fang: Mega, Ghost Fang: Yureiga, Mind Fang: Kokoroga, Ice Fang: Koriga, Moon Fang: Tsukiga, Glow Fang: Hikaga, Veno Fang: Dokuga\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "In theory, with sufficient numbers, the Direwolves' inherent trait could push them to A- rank, equivalent to 9,000 magicules.\nImagine thousands of A- rank Direwolves surging like a tidal wave.\nThe mere thought was chilling.\nOf course, A- rank was the Direwolves's limit.\nAfter all, this was just an inherent skill (Extra Skill), not a Unique Skill capable of granting them Demon Lord Seed qualifications.\nMoreover, thanks to their 'collective equals individual' trait, when Damien named the eighteen tribal leaders, a significant portion of magicules was distributed to the remaining Direwolves.\nFor 500 wolves, each with an average of 3,000 magicules, reaching B-rank at 6,000 magicules would require at least 1.5 million magicules.\nSuch a massive amount was beyond Damien's reach, even if he included Violet's 200,000 magicules and doubled it, equating to only 460,000 naming magicules (with Violet's discount, the effect was doubled).\n460,000 compared to 1.5 million was a drop in the bucket.\nBut the beauty of the Direwolves's trait was that it drastically reduced the cost of naming the entire group.\nInstead of 1.5 million, only a fifth... 300,000 magicules... was needed to evolve the entire pack into Star Wolves.\n\"Our master's magicules are recovering rapidly!\"\nOn the other side, the Snow Empress noticed the swift rise in Damien's magicules and looked at Violet in surprise.\n\"After the naming, our magicule reserves were down to 80,000.\"\n80,000 magicules was a dangerously low number for both Violet and Damien.\nFor a monster, depleting magicules meant the end of existence.\nHowever, Damien wasn't just spending recklessly; he was investing.\n\"An investment means returns.\"\nThe first return came from Hoshiga, with 55,000 magicules.\nAs a named monster, Hoshiga returned 15% of his total magicules to Damien, equaling 8,250 EP.\nThe other eighteen wolves followed suit: 15,000 × 15% × 18, yielding 40,500.\nIncluding Hoshiga's, that was roughly 50,000 magicules.\nBut this was only from the nineteen leaders.\nWhat truly thrilled Violet was the remaining 500 Star Wolves.\nDue to their pack trait, these wolves skipped the follower tier and reached the named monster tier under [Unity of All Spirits].\nYes, all 500 Star Wolves were classified as named monsters.\nThus, with an average of over 6,000 magicules each, reaching B-rank:\n500 × 6,000 × 15% amounted to a staggering 3 million magicules!\nThis was why Damien went all-in, exhausting his magicules to name the entire Direwolves!\nHe admitted there was an element of gambling.\nBut he won the bet!\nThe once-ordinary C-rank Direwolves had become Damien's greatest source of magicule returns.\nForget Direwolves... they were his treasure trove!\nTalk about striking it rich!\n\"What a pity.\"\nViolet looked at Damien, whose magicule reserves had reached 990,000.\nOf course, the additional 2 million-plus magicules weren't gone; they were stored with Violet.\n\"What?\"\nThe Snow Empress, confused, didn't understand what Violet meant by 'pity.'\n\"He can't yet challenge the True Demon Lord awakening ritual.\"\n\"Why not?\"\nThe Snow Empress recalled Damien mentioning that a Demon Lord Seed needed only enough souls to awaken as a True Demon Lord.\nSouls were easy enough.\nCouldn't a war yield plenty?\n\"No, it's not that simple.\"\nViolet explained, \"To acquire souls, one must break through the Astral Body encasing them.\"\nAbsorbing souls wasn't as straightforward as imagined.\nSouls were protected by a special energy called the Astral Body, shielding them from external interference... one of the Cardinal World's most mysterious, fundamental principles.\n\"Breaking the Astral Body can't be done with magicules. It requires sheer willpower to force through.\"\nViolet didn't know how Rimuru in the original story managed it.\nShe could only say that the remnants of the Star Dragon King and Lucia's souls helped Rimuru cheat his way across that chasm.\n\"But if that's the case, why did so many awaken as True Demon Lords later?\"\nThe Snow Empress remembered Damien saying that Benimaru, Shion, and others had the potential to become True Demon Lords.\nIn the original story, they awakened by absorbing enough souls with Rimuru's help.\n\"Souls and the Astral Body are distinct concepts.\"\nIf it were just souls, direct absorption would suffice.\nIf Damien could obtain 100,000 souls, he could awaken as a True Demon Lord on the spot.\n\"But where would we find 100,000 unprotected souls?\"\nSuch a vast number of souls was something only an ancient Demon Lord like Guy might have stored.\nSouls followed the cycle of reincarnation.\nExcept for those with Ultimate Skills, no one could interfere with their destination.\nMoreover, these weren't souls from killing 100,000 ordinary people.\nThe souls of common folk were too weak.\nIn the original story, during the Falmuth Kingdom's attack on the Jura Tempest Federation, the kingdom's forces were elite humans.\nOnly souls of that caliber could meet the conditions for a Demon Lord's awakening.\n\"Once an ordinary person dies, their soul can't linger in the material world. It immediately moves to the other side and reincarnates.\"\n\"Only those with C-rank or higher combat strength can briefly linger, allowing a Demon Lord Seed to absorb them.\"\n\"And during this process, soul loss is significant.\"\nIf 100,000 people died, a Demon Lord Seed might absorb only 30–40% at best.\nThe rest would be drawn away by the reincarnation cycle, vanishing without a trace.\n\"So, to awaken as a True Demon Lord, Damien must face 100,000 souls wrapped in Star Soul Bodies and forcibly absorb them?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nViolet added, \"Leaving aside whether this act would cause him mental distress, withstanding the impact of the Star Soul Bodies is a major issue.\"\nCould Damien's ordinary human willpower endure the onslaught of so many Star Soul Bodies?\nThe Astral Body wasn't just anything... it was the emotions and memories accumulated through each soul's reincarnations.\nForcing through was possible for Damien.\nBut what would be the result?\nWith so many memories and emotions piled together, could Damien maintain his sense of self, or would he become someone else entirely?\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

As expected.\nFor Damien, magicules weren't just energy.\nThe special skill Magicule Solidification allowed his physical attributes to scale with his magicule count, automatically boosting his base stats.\n\"Master!\"\n\"My lord, you're awake?\"\n\"Thank goodness.\"\nAs the commotion in the room spread, Damien's Familiars rushed in.\nShion was the most excited.\nWithout regard for propriety, she threw herself at Damien, enveloping him in an overwhelming embrace.\nWhat could Damien say?

Snow Empress, Ice Empress, Ogerpon, Shion, and the expected Rigurd and his sons... the remaining figures caught Damien by surprise.\nNear the door stood nearly twenty individuals, all kneeling on one knee, respectfully awaiting Damien's inspection.\nLeading them was a rugged middle-aged man draped in a beast pelt coat, his body covered in thick fur, giving off the vibe of a Viking warrior.\nFortunately, not everyone shared his aesthetic.\nAmong the eighteen others were young men, teenagers, mature women, young girls, and even a cute girl with a moe charm.\nWithout exception, they all had beast ears and tails.\nTheir hair colors varied... red, blue, green, pink... but didn't feel garish like a punk style.\nInstead, the colors complemented their auras and appearances, highlighting each one's unique traits perfectly.\n\"The Direwolves?\"\nDamien sensed the soul bond between them, guessing their identity.\n\"Yes, my lord!\"\nHearing Damien recognize them, Hoshiga lifted his head excitedly, eyes gleaming with joy.\nAs for how his subordinates addressed him:\nThose closest, like Ogerpon, Snow Empress, and Violet, called him by name.\nShuna, Shion, and others preferred \"my lord.\" Treating him like a feudal ruler, forming a lord-vassal bond.\nThis was common among humanoid monsters like the Ogre and goblins, who saw themselves as Damien's subjects.\nAs for \"master.\" Damien wasn't fond of it... it felt too much like slavery.\nThus, the title \"my lord\" became the norm.\nThose calling him \"my lord\" were mostly non-human races, like the Star Wolves.\nCompared to humans, they saw themselves more as Damien's pets, viewing him as the \"master\" of their pack.\nThe title \"Lord Damien\" was universal, except for the Ice Empress.\nShe preferred \"master\" as a sarcastic jab at Damien's forceful contract.\n\"Your transformations are even more dramatic than Rigurd's.\"\nThough he'd anticipated it, seeing a pack of giant wolves turn into beastmen was still astonishing.\nEspecially the fluffy beast ear girls... Damien's gaze lingered on them for a few seconds before reluctantly moving away.\nOf course, it wasn't their beauty he coveted.\nMore than their looks, he wanted to touch their ears and tails.

I'm fine now.\"\nDamien remained in bed, and Shuna naturally took the tray from the shrine maidens, serving him the food.\n\"…\"\nThe indulgent scene made the Snow Empress chuckle. \"Should I join in?\"\n\"Ahem.\"\nDamien caught the teasing in her tone.\n\"Get me a portion too.\"\nThe Snow Empress smiled, shaking her head, and casually took a dish from the tray.\nTogether with Shuna, one on each side, they attended to Damien.\n'This heavenly life feels like a dream…'\nHaving two beautiful women care for him... could there be anything more fulfilling?\n\"Snow Empress, I can handle this.\" Shuna said.\n\"It's fine.\"\nThe Snow Empress didn't mind. \"Caring for our master is what we Familiars are supposed to do.\"\nAmong Damien's Familiars, Ogerpon was like a daughter, Ice Empress a rebellious teen, Shion a goofy older sister, and Shuna a caring younger sister.\nThe Snow Empress's relationship with Damien leaned toward that of an older sister and younger brother.\nTaking care of her \"little brother\" made her happy.\n'Hmph!'\nWith that thought, she glanced at a certain empty spot. 'A mere latecomer, hmph!'\n\"Alright, I'll eat on my own.\"\nDamien halted their affectionate gestures, taking the food himself. \"Violet, come out too.\"\n\"I was planning to appear after you finished eating.\"\nViolet materialized at the foot of the bed. \"Would you like a status report?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nDamien was getting used to Violet's personality.\nMuch like the template of an automatic writing doll, she was cool and detached, a meticulous secretary awaiting her master's orders.\n\"We currently have a total of 3.02 million magicules.\"\nViolet continued, \"Of those, 2.02 million are stored with me, available for your use at any time.\"\n\"Additionally, your forces now consist of 270 Ogres, 8,200 goblins, and 560 StarDirewolves beastmen.\"\nFor convenience, Violet referred to them as the Star Wolves.\n\"StarDirewolves beastmen, huh?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nViolet explained, \"They've collectively evolved into beastmen, gaining the ability to shift freely between giant wolf and humanoid beast forms.\"\nHence, she used \"560 individuals\" rather than \"560 heads\" To describe them.\n\"That's an unexpected bonus.\"\nPairing goblins with wolves to form cavalry, like in the original story, was a good idea.\nBut Damien felt the goblins' potential was limited.\nAside from exceptions like Gobta and Gobya, the Goblins hadn't produced any remarkable figures.\nRather than making them combatants, they'd serve better as logistical support.\nWith their large population, even if their reproduction rate dropped due to evolution, they could maintain C- rank.\n\"However…\"\nViolet added, \"The Star Wolves isn't accustomed to human lifestyles.\"\n\"Some, especially the males, prefer their original forms over human living habits.\"\n\"Is that so…\"\nDamien asked, \"What's the split?\"\n\"Most males prefer their original form, while females tend to favor their beastman form.\"\n\"Hm.\"\nDamien didn't mind their preferences. They could live as they pleased... he wouldn't force Hoshiga and the others to stay in beastman form.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Anything he could think of, the Snow Empress and Violet would have already considered.\nHe didn't need to handle management tasks.\nWhat he truly needed to focus on was how to utilize this vast pool of magicules.\n\"Snow Empress, inform everyone that I'll be naming them.\"\nWith 3 million magicules, minus the 100,000 needed to sustain Violet and the 990,000 for his own strength, the remaining 2 million were surplus.\nWithout breaking through to S-rank to awaken as a True Demon Lord, his magicules couldn't undergo a qualitative change.\nIf these magicules weren't spent quickly, Violet's daily magicule recovery would be stalled.\nNo recovery meant waste... a losing proposition.\nEven with 3 million magicules, Damien was still fixated on the 200,000 magicules Violet could provide every half month.\n'Invest! I must invest heavily!!'\n2 million magicules used for naming equated to 4 million with Violet's discount.\nOnce again, he thanked Violet's 50% off deal, effectively doubling his assets.\n\"Am I living off Violet's generosity?\"\nThe thought crossed his mind, but Damien brushed it aside. \"Generosity or not, being able to benefit from it is the real skill!\"\nOthers might want such benefits but have no access to them.\n\"I'm coming too!\"\nSeeing the Snow Empress leave, Shion hurriedly followed, leaving Shuna to stay by Damien's side.\nAs for Violet, she preferred residing in Damien's soul, quietly observing everything around her.\nAdditionally, Violet periodically connected to the world's core.\nShe monitored the Cardinal World's information, keeping tabs on potential threats to Damien.\n\"What is Lord Damien planning to do?\"\nShuna helped Damien dress, then voiced her curiosity.\n\"Naming.\"\n\"Hm?\"\nShuna paused, then realized what he meant, her face lighting up with disbelief. \"You mean…?\"\n\"I plan to make everyone named monsters.\"\n\"This!!\"\nShuna was stunned by Damien's decision. \"But that will consume a massive amount of your magicules, and…\"\n\"Don't worry, Shuna.\"\nDamien gently patted her head, smiling calmly. \"My Leader skill has evolved, allowing me to designate a monster race as my Familia.\"\n\"And I've chosen the Ogres.\"\nOnce the Ogre were selected as Familia, Damien could gain 30% of their magicules from those not already Familiars, like Shuna or Benimaru.\nCompared to the previous 15%, this was double the return.\n\"But to make the Ogre a Familia, they must first become named monsters.\"\nThis was critical and the reason Damien planned to name everyone.\n\"What about the goblins?\"\n\"That's the interesting part.\"\nDamien grinned. \"Goblins are a monster race descended from fire spirites that degenerated into this current form.\"\n\"The Ogre are the same.\"\n\"In other words, Goblins and Ogres can be considered part of the same race.\"\n\"Oh…\"\nShuna nearly protested that goblins couldn't possibly be distant kin to the Ogre.\nBut this was Lord Damien's judgment, so it had to be correct.\n\"Of course, if it were just goblins, my Leader skill couldn't merge them with the Ogre into one race.\"\n\"But!\"\nDamien continued, \"Hobgoblins are different.\"\nHobgoblins were C-rank, while Ogre were B-rank... just one tier apart.\nIn the original story, Gobwa evolved from a weak goblin to a Goblena (female hobgoblin), then to Ogre, Kijin, and finally Oni.\nThis clearly showed a defined evolution path from goblin to Kijin.\nDamien had consulted Violet, who confirmed this.\n\"As long as all goblins evolve into hobgoblins…\"\n\"I can incorporate them into the Ogres.\" Damien said. \"Then, they'll all become my Familia!\"\nDamien had three Familia slots.\nThe Ogre were his strongest followers at the moment.\nStrengthening their bond with him could only bring benefits.\n\"So, this naming won't just avoid losses... it might even yield a huge profit?\"\nShuna and the other Familiars were Damien's most trusted confidants, incapable of betraying him.\nHowever, secrets like the magicule gains from Leader were kept from others.\nThis wasn't deceit but a ruler's need to maintain an air of mystery.\n\"The Goblins has over 8,000 members. With an average of 300 magicules, evolving them to C-rank hobgoblins would require at least 2,700 magicules each.\"\nShuna noted, \"That's no small number.\"\n8,000 × 2,700 equaled a staggering 21.6 million magicules.\nEven with Violet's 50% discount, that was 10.8 million... a massive expense.\nNo ordinary person could afford that, but Damien had a plan.\nHe could start by naming the Ogres.\n\"If we name the Ogre first, there are about 250 unnamed Ogre left.\"\n250 individuals, averaging 6,000 magicules.\nEvolving them required 4,000 magicules each, totaling 1 million.\nWith the discount, that was just 500,000.\nThat was manageable... Damien could cover it in one go.\nThen, the 270 Ogres with over 10,000 magicules each, as Familia, would provide 30% of their magicules.\nThat amounted to 8.1 million magicules.\nAdding Damien's existing 1.5 million, he'd have 9.6 million.\nWith 9.6 million magicules for naming, doubled to 19.2 million with the discount, he wouldn't need to name all 8,000 goblins at once.\nHe could name 4,000 first, then integrate them into the Familia system as hobgoblins.\n\"Precise magicule expenditure and returns calculated.\"\nViolet's voice echoed in Damien and Shuna's minds. \"Naming the Ogres consumes 500,000 actual magicules and yields 8.1 million.\"\n\"Naming the goblins requires 10.8 million actual magicules and yields 7.2 million.\"\n\"Final calculation: net gain of 4 million magicules!\"\n\"…\"\nA 4 million magicule profit, plus Damien's existing 3 million, brought his total to 7 million.\nNot only did his magicule count not decrease... it more than doubled.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

At this moment, admiration was enough!\n\"Ahem!\"\nDamien hadn't expected a day when he'd want to spend magicules but couldn't exhaust them. \"Anyway, everyone getting stronger is definitely a good thing.\"\n\"Mm-hmm!\"\nShuna nodded eagerly, already envisioning the village's skyrocketing strength.\nOf the 270 Kijin, excluding minors, at least 200 could be deployed as combatants.\nThe Ogre had no concept of weak females.\nThey were all warriors.\nIf not for the reluctance to send children to battle, every single one would fight for Damien.\nThen there were the 8,000 hobgoblins, easily forming a 5,000-strong army.\n5,000 soldiers, 200 elites.\nAdd in paired male and female wolves to create StarDirewolves cavalry.\nWith that, an elite force, cavalry, and regular soldiers formed a nearly 6,000-strong monster army.\n\"Before I knew it, I've amassed enough to form an army.\"\nSoon, the Snow Empress and Shion completed gathering everyone.\nWhen they learned Damien had called them for universal naming, the monsters erupted in deafening cheers and praise.\nNo need for words... Damien was already accustomed to their simple, heartfelt devotion.\n\"Everyone, line up orderly, one at a time, no rushing.\"\nSeated at the head, Damien faced a long queue of monsters eagerly awaiting their names.\nNaming around 8,500 monsters at once was a massive undertaking.\nIt wasn't the magicule consumption that bothered him... Damien was used to that.\nThe real headache was figuring out what names to give them.\n\"Um…\"\nDamien started, \"You, you'll be Cyanwave.\"\n\"For you, a female from the Red Orges, how about Blooddance?\"\nHonestly, Damien hadn't anticipated that the greatest challenge in naming wasn't the magicule cost but the 8,500 names themselves.\nIt was fine at first, but by the end, he'd completely run out of creative ideas.\nWith no other choice, he resorted to Rimuru's approach, throwing out names like \"Gobeast.\" \"Gobwest.\" \"Gobnorth\" To get by.\nFortunately, the monsters didn't mind.\nAny name from Damien was cherished from the heart, never failing his expectations.\n'Honestly, I had no expectations.'\nLuckily, Damien could remember every monster he named.\nThis spared him the embarrassment of forgetting their names in person.\n\"Phew~~\"\nThe naming process lasted nearly an hour.\nExhausted, Damien sprawled on the bed in a starfish pose, longing for a good nap.\n\"So tiring.\"\n\"Who knew naming monsters was such hard work?\"\n\"Violet, don't you have an auto-naming function?\"\nTo Damien's question, Violet replied, \"It's simple to generate names, but naming monsters involves establishing a soul corridor, so shortcuts won't work.\"\nNot only could Violet not assist, but even flipping through a dictionary wouldn't do.\nThe best method was brief thought followed by an instinctive name.\n\"Naming... fated names, huh?\"\nTo Damien, it was just a casual remark.\nBut to the monsters, a name from him was a lifelong treasure.\n\"Fine.\"\nEven so, the thought of potentially naming tens of thousands of Lizardmen or hundreds of thousands of Orcs in the future sent shivers down his spine.\n200,000 names... pure torture!\nHe felt he should get a dictionary early, just in case.\n\"Forget it, future problems are for future me.\"\nDictionaries were useless anyway.\nViolet had made it clear: names had to come from a spur-of-the-moment inspiration to carry the soul corridor.\nNaming while flipping through a dictionary wouldn't work.\n\"No choice but to leave it to future me to stress over.\"\nFor now, after a hard day's work, Damien just wanted to slack off.\nTwo days passed since subduing the goblins and wolves.\nThat noon, while savoring Shuna's latest culinary creation, Damien received a telepathic message from Souei.\n\"Lord Damien.\"\nSouei reported, \"Regarding the Lizardmen's stance.\"\n\"Go ahead.\"\nDamien wiped his mouth with a napkin. \"What did they say?\"\n\"The Lizardmen rejected our alliance proposal.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nDamien wasn't particularly surprised.\nRegarding subduing the monster tribes in the Jura Forest, his plan was to start with cooperation, showing goodwill.\nWhen the Orc Lord's crisis arrived, he'd integrate them.\nOf course, the simplest method was sending a team of A-rank Kijin to the Lizardmen's tribe.\nSubjugation boiled down to martial intimidation and incentives.\n\"What do you think of the Lizardmen, Souei? Can they be recruited?\"\n\"Well…\"\nSouei hesitated. \"The Lizardmen are… peculiar.\"\nDamien sensed Souei's reluctance, wondering if he'd run into trouble.\nWith 7 million magicules, Kijin, hobgoblins, and Star Wolves as three elite forces, Damien lacked neither magicules nor strong followers.\nThe Lizardmen, frankly, were somewhat redundant to him.\nIn fact, he'd rather recruit the Tengu.\nTheir ability to fly made them a natural air force, something he lacked.\nUnfortunately, the Tengu's region was too far from the Kijin village, and Benimaru and Hakurou hadn't yet made contact.\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"It's hard to describe.\"\nSouei sighed. \"If I had to, I'd say the Lizardmen lack awareness of facing stronger beings.\"\nTo Souei, most Lizardmen seemed… not quite right in the head.\nAnd far too fearless.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"I think I get what you mean.\"\nDamien recalled Gabiru from the original story... a rather foolish character.\nNot all Lizardmen were self-important fools like Gabiru; some, like the Lizardman chieftain and the future follower of Souei, Princess Souka, were quite intelligent.\nBut such individuals were the minority.\nThe Lizardmen's general attitude reminded Damien of a certain arrogance from his past life's world, full of self-assuredness.\nOn reflection, it wasn't surprising.\nThe Jura Forest had three dominant races: the Ogres, Orcs, and Lizardmen.\nThe Orcs numbered in the hundreds of thousands but lacked individual strength.\nThe Ogres were strong but too few in number.\nThe Lizardmen, with tens of thousands and individual strength above C-rank... some even reaching C+ or B... saw themselves as the forest's protectors, inherently superior to other races.\n\"Forget it.\"\nDamien decided to ignore the Lizardmen for now. \"Souei, come back.\"\n\"Yes, my lord!\"\nThe Lizardmen had rejected his alliance proposal.\nDamien wasn't petty enough to hold a grudge over it.\nAlliances were their choice to make.\nHe wouldn't force his will on others, demanding they follow his plans or face consequences.\n\"Lord Damien?\"\nShuna noticed Damien set down his utensils, wondering if her cooking wasn't to his taste.\n\"It's fine, it's not about your food, Shuna.\"\nDamien shared Souei's report about the Lizardmen with Shuna, Snow Empress, and the others present.\n\"What ungrateful creatures these Lizardmen are!\"\nShion was the first to speak, indignant. \"Should I go teach them a lesson, Lord Damien?\"\n\"Just a lesson?\"\nThe Ice Empress was far more ruthless. \"If they won't submit, just wipe them out!\"\n\"Uh…\"\nEven Shion was taken aback by her extremism. \"That's a bit much, Ice Empress.\"\n\"Is it?\"\nThe Ice Empress didn't think so.\nIn the world of soul beasts, it was kill or be killed.\nIn the Jura Forest, Damien was undeniably the strongest, and by a wide margin.\nNot declaring war on the Lizardmen and allowing them to live in the forest was already merciful.\nYet they still refused.\nIf it were her, she'd have stormed their tribe and scattered their ashes long ago.\n\"Enough, Ice.\"\nThe Snow Empress intervened. \"This isn't the Far North, and the Lizardmen aren't mindless beasts.\"\n\"They have their own culture and customs, like the Ogres.\"\nThe Snow Empress had studied the Ogres's traditions, centered on a code akin to bushido.\nWithout Damien's great favor and Ogerpon's presence as a superior kin, subduing the Ogre would've been difficult.\nIn the original story, even the Majin Gelmud's attempt to name the Ogre was refused.\nThe Ogre would rather face extinction than compromise their principles.\nThis showed how hard it was to subdue the Jura Forest's monster tribes.\nThe more civilized they were, the harder it was to suppress them with force alone.\nThe Ogres, Lizardmen, Orcs, and Tengu were more human than monster.\nYet, they differed from humans.\nThey were too stubborn.\n\"Sometimes, dignity outweighs life.\"\nShuna noted, \"The wolves submitted because their entire pack was defeated.\"\nThis wasn't to say the wolves lacked integrity or were cowardly.\nRather, as beasts, they didn't prioritize dignity and freedom above all.\nYou wouldn't expect a dog to refuse food offered in disdain, would you?\nThat would be absurd.\nMoreover, as the wolves evolved into beastmen, they shed their beastly instincts, gaining a pack trait: canine loyalty to their master.\n\"Let's leave it at that for now.\"\nDamien said, \"We don't need the Lizardmen's strength anyway.\"\nSubduing nearly 30,000 Lizardmen at once would yield a terrifying amount of magicules.\nEven at a 3% return from naming, that'd be close to 5 million magicules.\nBut for Damien, the difference between 7 million and 12 million magicules wasn't significant.\nNaming them was another matter.\nFor the Ogres, goblins, and wolves, naming was a blessing.\nBut for the Lizardmen?\nBegging to name them would be demeaning.\nDid he look like he had magicules to burn?\n\"Your naming is a transformative opportunity for them.\" Snow Empress said.\n\"It's the Lizardmen who fail to appreciate it.\"\nHer words earned unanimous agreement.\n\"Exactly, it's their loss for not seizing this chance.\" Shuna added.\nShion snorted, \"They're just blind!\"\n\"We'll discuss it when Souei returns.\"\nDamien estimated that with Souei's speed, he'd be back from the Lizardmen's wetlands in a few hours.\nSure enough, Souei soon appeared before him.\nKneeling on one knee, head bowed, he seemed to be apologizing for the Lizardmen issue.\n\"Rise, Souei.\"\nDamien said, \"Good work.\"\n\"It's my honor to serve you, my lord.\"\nSouei's tone was calm, but his words were heartfelt.\nHaving received such favor from Damien, he longed to repay him.\n\"You did well investigating the Orcs.\"\nDamien continued, \"As for the Lizardmen…\"\n\"What exactly happened?\"\n\"Didn't you demonstrate the Kijin's strength to them?\"\n\"I did, but…\"\nRecalling the situation, Souei still found it bizarre. \"They didn't believe it.\"\n\"What?\"\nShion shot up, furious. \"What do you mean, 'didn't believe'?\"\nYou could say they weren't scared... that Shion could understand.\nBut not believing?\nWhat kind of nonsense was that?\n\"Exactly what it sounds like.\"\nAs Souei spoke, he projected the events using shadow magic.\nIn the shadowy images, Souei overwhelmed hundreds of Lizardmen with ease.\nEven their trident-wielding leader was defeated in a single move.\nOf course, Souei hadn't killed them.\nHe'd merely taught the arrogant Lizardmen a lesson.\n\"That's perfect, isn't it?\"\nThe Ice Empress, propping her chin, approved. \"That's exactly what those fools needed.\"\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000

Gabiru!'\n\"Should I go take that guy out?\"\nThe Ice Empress saw it clearly: Gabiru held high esteem among the Lizardmen.\nAs long as he was around, they'd follow his judgment.\nBut Gabiru was clueless, unable to read the situation, and full of himself.\nEven if there were sensible Lizardmen, they likely couldn't override his influence to make the right call.\nIn that case!\nA faint icy blue aura emanated from the Ice Empress. \"If we kill this guy, the Lizardmen will fall in line, right?\"\n\"For once, Ice, you're right.\"\nThe Snow Empress agreed that eliminating this fool named Gabiru was the way to go.\n\"No need.\"\nDamien, however, waved it off nonchalantly, sipping from his teacup.\n\"That guy's already been named.\"\nDamien added, \"Which means Clayman is likely keeping an eye on the Lizardmen.\"\n\"Clayman, one of the Ten Great Demon Lords?\"\nIt was Souei's first time hearing this, his expression tightening as he considered how to gather intel or plan an assassination against a Demon Lord.\n\"Yeah.\"\nDamien nodded. \"The Moderate Harlequin Alliance... those guys are pretty strong.\"\n\"Among us, only me, Violet, Snow Empress, and Ogerpon could take them on.\"\nDamien and Violet were obvious, with Demon Lord Seed-level magicules and a slew of skills.\nEven if they couldn't defeat the Harlequins, they could hold their ground without needing Gate of the Void as a trump card.\nAs for the Snow Empress, her magicules hadn't yet reached 100,000, but that was recent.\nOnce she broke through to Special A-rank, her combat power would soar.\nDamien had confidence she could handle Demon Lord-level opponents.\nOgerpon was different.\nShe was a pure stat monster.\nWith the Star Wolves's addition, her Unique Skill, Growth, gained new fuel.\nThe Ogre's evolution and full attribute refresh gave her another chance to farm experience from them.\nAs a result, Ogerpon's magicules surged, breaking past the Special A-rank bottleneck.\nCombined with abilities inherited from Damien and her own Unique Skills, she could stand toe-to-toe with the Harlequins, even if she couldn't win.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What about me?\"\nThe Ice Empress pouted, dissatisfied. \"Am I not good enough?\"\n\"Ice, you really might not cut it.\"\nDamien didn't sugarcoat it, worried she'd impulsively challenge the Harlequins head-on.\nEvery one of those guys had magicules in the millions.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

they'll trick you.\"\nOgerpon's childlike innocence made her vulnerable to someone as cunning as Yuuki Kagurazaka.\n\"Pone!\"\nFortunately, Ogerpon never caused Damien worry.\nShe was obedient, always taking his warnings to heart.\n\"Of course, if you do run into them, the simplest solution is to contact me.\"\nDamien added, \"I'll decide whether to fight or flee.\"\n\"Tch!\"\nThe Ice Empress bristled at being underestimated.\nBut she didn't dare defy Damien's words.\n\"In fact, I have a plan that will require all of your strength soon.\"\n\"So for now, keep a low profile whenever possible.\"\nDamien referred to his and the Snow Empress's ongoing plan regarding a new otherworld.\nOriginally, their calculations suggested it would take at least half a month to open that gate.\nBut with Violet's emergence, the process had accelerated significantly.\n\"Barring any surprises, it'll be in the next few days.\"\nDamien said, \"Once we confirm the new world's details, I'll take you all with me!\"\n\"A new world?\"\n\"All of us together?\"\n\"Won't transporting so many put too much strain?\"\nShion and Shuna had traveled with Damien to the Douluoverse.\nThe Snow Empress and Ice Empress, as martial souls, had also joined him in the Pokémonverse.\nThus, the women were well aware of the limitations of Damien's world-traveling.\nSometimes it was a headcount limit, sometimes a power cap, or even a need to align with the target world's rules.\n\"What kind is it this time?\"\nThe Ice Empress was eager, craving battle and growth.\nA new world meant new opportunities.\nShe couldn't wait to clash with strong opponents!\n\"None of those.\"\nDamien shook his head. \"This crossing is unlike any before.\"\n\"Violet, explain it to everyone.\"\n\"Yes.\"\nViolet materialized before the group.\nWith a wave of her hand, magicules traced an image in the air.\nIt was a tree.\nNo!\nIt was a cosmos... a vast universe encompassing numerous parallel worlds and timelines!\n\"I've completed partial analysis of that world's laws.\"\n\"These laws are sufficient for us Familiars to enter that world.\"\nViolet's voice rang out. \"However, for safety, we won't enter with our true bodies this time.\"\n\"Not our real bodies?\"\nSouei was the only Familiar who hadn't experienced world-crossing.\nBut as a Familiar, he was entitled to know Damien's secrets.\n\"Yes.\"\nDamien explained, \"This time, we'll descend as projections.\"\n\"This projection mode is somewhat similar to the second type of crossing, like in Konosubaverse.\"\n\"I'm the anchor, and you're linked to me.\"\n\"Ogerpon knows this!\"\nOgerpon raised her hand. \"In the Konosubaverse, if Ogerpon broke the rules, it'd drag Damien down, and we'd both get kicked out.\"\n\"Exactly, that's the second type.\"\n\"Then there's the Douluoverse, where you and Ice were, which is the third type.\"\nIn that mode, everyone Damien brought was independent.\nIf someone broke the rules, only they would be ejected, not affecting others.\nFor third-type crossings, Damien could use his Familiars like disposable bombs.\nFacing tough enemies, he could send out a Familiar to unleash their full power.\nThey'd erupt, defeat the enemy, and get kicked out.\nWhile this meant the Familiar would be sidelined, watching others continue, for someone like Ice, suppressing her power was worse than a single, exhilarating fight.\n\"This descent isn't quite the second or third type.\"\n\"It's somewhere in between.\"\n\"Through this descent, I'll have a projection with a legitimate identity in that world.\"\n\"The projection's power will be limited by that world's rules.\"\nDamien wasn't sure how severe the restrictions would be, but he could guarantee the safety of this descent.\nCompared to safety, a bit of weakening was negligible.\n\"Alright, gather everyone.\"\nDamien instructed the Snow Empress to assemble all combat-ready forces in the village.\n\"5,000 hobgoblins.\"\n\"200 Kijin.\"\n\"400 wolves, forming 200 cavalry!\"\nAt the village square, Damien looked at the dense crowd, grateful for the recent expansion.\nOtherwise, there'd be no space for so many.\n\"Violet, take it from here.\"\n\"Understood.\"\nViolet appeared beside Damien, activating the soul corridor, pulling everyone's souls into it.\nSimultaneously, they gained a second perspective.\nIt was like controlling a game character with a remote... their real body and the character's body.\nEvery monster in the soul corridor received their own game avatar.\n\"My head… it's spinning.\"\n\"Ugh, controlling two bodies at once feels awful.\"\n\"Close your eyes and don't move your body.\"\n\"Oh, oh, that's much better!\"\nIn the unknown space, avatars identical to them were moving animatedly.\nUnlike them, Shuna, Shion, Hoshiga, and the Kijin handled it effortlessly.\nFor those with Thought Acceleration and Parallel Processing, an extra body was no burden.\nEven dozens of avatars wouldn't faze them.\n\"Are these the bodies we'll use to descend into the other world?\"\n\"Correct.\"\nDamien explained, \"Our true bodies won't enter. We'll send remotely controlled puppets.\"\n\"Those without Parallel Processing, prepare to rest.\"\nLike a virtual dive, the hobgoblins and wolves needed to lie down somewhere, focusing all their energy on the other body.\n\"Benimaru, Hakurou, you're not joining this descent.\"\nDamien continued, \"You'll lead the remaining 50 Kijin to protect the village.\"\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Who knew if some powerhouse might emerge and knock him back? And the planet in this world is not just a large rock floating in space, but a Celestial Being.\nTo avoid that, Damien chose to participate in the Holy Grail War to gain benefits from this world.\n\"Voyager... or Traveler.\"\nDamien was fairly satisfied with his class.\nTwo A-ranks, and an EX Noble Phantasm.\nThis was the result of his preparations.\nAs for actual strength…\nCompared to his true body, this Heroic Spirit form was negligible.\n\"The outcome of the Holy Grail War doesn't matter to me.\"\nWhat Damien truly sought was to use his Learner skill to acquire new rules from the Nasuverse.\n\"Gilgamesh's Gate of Babylon.\"\n\"Iskandar's Ionioi Hetairoi.\"\n\"The Noble Phantasms of Heroic Spirits…\"\nThese were what Damien needed most.\nHe'd customized his stats and designed his Noble Phantasm.\nAs for Magic Resistance or other inherent skills, Damien hadn't bothered wasting Violet's computing power on such trivialities.\n\"I need to find a suitable Master first.\"\nGlancing at his mana reserve, Damien felt a slight urgency. \"Otherwise, this body won't last long.\"\nA Heroic Spirit needed a Master. Damien had exploited a loophole in the Nasuverse to descend as a Voyager.\nBut basic rules still applied.\n'Is this the new world?'\n'It feels so strange.'\n'The houses are so tall... what are those shiny lights?'\n'Is this what the human world looks like?'\nHearing his Familiars and Familia's awed exclamations, Damien smiled. \"I'm counting on you all next.\"\n'Ohhh!'\n'Leave it to me!'\nThat voice could only be Shion's.\nWhoosh!\nA night breeze swept through, and the figure on the rooftop vanished into the flickering neon lights.\n'Where are we going?'\nThe Snow Empress noticed Damien heading in a specific direction, clearly with purpose.\n'To find those Heroic Spirits and take them down, obviously!'\n'Ice, the Holy Grail War isn't just about fighting.'\nThe Snow Empress sighed. 'Besides, Damien just said we need a stable mana source.'\n'A Master.'\nShuna added, 'We need a Master, or once Lord Damien's mana runs out, our war is over.'\n'So, where's the Master?'\n'…'\nDamien hadn't shared much about the Nasuverse, as its information was vast and he wasn't fully familiar with it himself.\n\"We're here.\"\nAs the group discussed the sights and speculated about Heroic Spirits' strength, Damien stopped.\nBefore him stood a Taisho-style mansion.\nThis was the Matou residence.\nAnd his chosen Master was none other than Sakura Matou, a key figure in the Fourth Holy Grail War!\nInside the Matou mansion, an elderly man in a kimono, hunched over, led a five- or six-year-old girl down a staircase to the basement.\nThe old man was Zouken Matou, head of one of Fuyuki City's two great magus families.\nThe girl, originally Tohsaka Sakura, had been adopted by the Matou family and renamed Sakura Matou.\nBut…\nAs the staircase grew darker, Sakura felt afraid.\nShe instinctively clutched the old man's sleeve.\nDespite his terrifying appearance, in such a moment, the girl sought comfort by instinct.\n\"Grandfather, I'm cold.\"\n\"The Fourth Holy Grail War is about to begin.\"\nZouken Matou murmured, ignoring Sakura's plea, lost in his own thoughts. \"Every sixty years, this city hosts a secret magical ritual unknown to ordinary people.\"\n\"Seven pairs of Masters and Servants fight to the death, offering the defeated as sacrifices to summon the legendary Holy Grail.\"\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "For the Fourth Holy Grail War, Zouken Matou held little hope.\nThe Matou family, or rather the Zolgen family, had settled in Fuyuki City as outsiders.\nBut magic was deeply tied to the environment, and after centuries of change, the family faced adaptation issues.\nTheir magic circuits began to regress.\nThis was only natural.\nAfter all, who could have foreseen that over hundreds of years, the Holy Grail ritual had never once been truly completed?\nAfter such a long time, the family's magus bloodline was nearing extinction.\nIn the generation following Zouken's son, magic circuits were blocked from birth, preventing them from becoming magus.\nThus, for the Fourth Holy Grail War, the Matou family had no new pawns to field and couldn't participate.\nHowever, unexpectedly, the Tohsaka family... another of the three founding magus families of the ritual... produced promising heirs.\nBoth of Tokiomi Tohsaka's daughters were highly talented magus.\nUnfortunately, the Tohsaka family's magic crest could only be inherited by one.\nTo avoid wasting his daughter's potential, and with the Matou bloodline fading, Tokiomi sent his daughter Sakura to be adopted by Zouken Matou.\nNo, she was now Sakura Matou.\n\"Such fine blood, Sakura.\"\n\"If it's you, winning the Fifth Holy Grail War shouldn't be difficult, right?\"\n\"Isn't that so, Sakura?\"\nThe old man, his appearance twisted and grotesque, paused.\nHe looked down, scrutinizing the little girl beside him, satisfaction glinting in his eyes.\nDue to this world's laws, mystery attracted mystery, and Sakura's exceptional talent meant she could never escape its grasp.\nBut as a young girl, Sakura couldn't comprehend this.\nShe could only follow Zouken fearfully, abandoned by her parents.\n\"Tch tch tch, don't be afraid, Sakura. From today, you're my granddaughter.\"\n\"You'll come to like your new name, Sakura Matou.\"\n\"It sounds much better than Sakura Tohsaka.\"\n\"But first, we need to perform a little ritual.\"\nZouken let out a creepy chuckle, pulling Sakura deeper into the Matou mansion.\nAt his words, Sakura's small frame trembled.\nShe shrank back instinctively, but her timid nature, coupled with overwhelming unease and fear, froze her in place, head bowed.\nBut did Zouken care about Sakura's feelings?\nWith his strong grip, painful enough to make her wince, he forced her to continue.\nIn the end, Sakura completed the journey.\nZouken's rough demeanor only heightened her anxiety.\n\"G-Grandfather, where are we going?\"\n\"We're here, Sakura. No need to fear.\"\nZouken's eerie tone offered no comfort, only intensifying her dread.\nWhen she saw the scene at the bottom of the stairs, her eyes widened, fear spilling over uncontrollably.\nNo explanation was needed... anyone who saw it could guess what was coming.\nThousands of worms.\nAll kinds... twisted, crawling, writhing... formed a pool so repulsive it defied human tolerance.\nDisgusting?\nIt went beyond mere disgust.\nA single glance could drive an ordinary person to madness.\n\"Go on, Sakura. Down you go.\"\nWhat?\nSakura thought she'd misheard.\nThat place, those terrifying worms…\n\"No, no!\"\n\"Waaah~~\"\nUnable to bear her fear, Sakura turned to flee toward the stairs.\nBut Zouken grabbed her hand.\n\"Heh tch tch tch~~\"\nIgnoring her cries, he dragged her toward the worm swarm. \"It'll be over soon. If you have talent, tch tch tch…\"\n\"No!!\"\n\"Mommy~ Daddy~\"\n\"I want to go home, waaah…\"\nAs the worm pit drew closer, the girl, already lonely from abandonment, broke down, sobbing desperately, hoping someone... anyone... would appear.\nHer parents, her sister, anyone!\nPlease, save me!!\nTap!\nTap tap tap!\nSuddenly, the basement's sounds seemed muffled, as if veiled by a hazy curtain.\nThe worms' hissing, the old man's creepy laughter, the girl's cries... all fell silent.\nThe only clear sound was footsteps, growing louder from an unknown source.\n\"Looks like I'm not too late.\"\n\"What a nauseating sight.\"\nAn ethereal voice, as if from the heavens, echoed in the dim, cavernous basement.\n\"Hm?\"\nWisps of cold air drifted through the room. Zouken's pupils narrowed as he looked down, realizing the girl he'd been holding was gone.\n'What's happening?!'\n'Magic?'\nZouken's mind raced as he turned to face a young man standing there.\nBeside him was his newly adopted granddaughter, Sakura Matou.\n'When?'\nSilently, without him noticing, the youth had taken Sakura.\nUnease stirred in Zouken, but he maintained a calm facade.\n\"It's over, Sakura.\"\nA warm hand rested on the girl's head, gently stroking. Damien knelt, wiping the tears from her face.\n\"Waaah~~\"\nSakura didn't know who Damien was, nor did she care.\nAll she knew was that in her moment of despair, this man appeared before her!\n\"There, there.\"\nDamien pulled her into his arms, his gentle expression vanishing as he looked up, replaced by icy resolve. \"Kill him, then destroy this place, Ice.\"\n\"You!\"\nZouken hadn't expected such decisiveness.

Taking Sakura's hand, he vanished from the Matou family's basement.\nIn his place, a beautiful girl, ethereal as a spirit, emerged from the void.\nHer aura, fierce as an ancient beast, enveloped Zouken Matou in an instant.\nNot only his body and magic but even his soul trembled under the overwhelming pressure.\n[Ice Empress]\nType: Anti-Fortress Noble Phantasm\nCombat Strength: A++\n'This thing!!'\nZouken Matou shook, but he wasn't afraid.\nWith his core crest worm intact, losing this body was merely losing a puppet.\nHaving lived for centuries, Zouken's survival skills were maxed out!\n\"Pointless tricks!\"\nThe Ice Empress already knew his thoughts. Expressionless, she raised her hand and clenched it tightly. \"Ice Burst!!\"\n\"It's alright now, Sakura.\"\nDamien set the girl down. Behind him, the Matou mansion had transformed into a crystalline ice palace.\nCrack~~\nThe next moment, a sharp sound rang out as countless fissures appeared in the ice.\nWhoosh~~\nThe Matou mansion began to shatter.\nGlimmering ice shards were swept into the sky by an unseen gust.\n\"So beautiful…\"\nSakura gazed at the breathtaking scene, momentarily forgetting to breathe.\nFrom within the dreamlike sea of ice crystals, a figure approached... the Ice Empress.\n\"It's done. That old worm is gone.\"\nThe Ice Empress had controlled her power precisely, focusing Ice Burst's might to annihilate everything at absolute zero.\nThat included the old worm.\nSoul or crest worm, it didn't matter.\nBefore Damien, a Demon Lord Seed, they were meaningless.\nFrom the start, he had sealed all of Zouken's escape routes, even expending a large portion of his stored mana to summon the Ice Empress as his trump card.\n\"Just to deal with a guy like that, was it really necessary to summon me?\"\nAs a soul beast, the Ice Empress didn't understand human behavior.\nEven seeing Zouken about to push Sakura into the worm pit didn't stir her much.\nUsing a trump card like Ice Burst right away had consumed about a fifth of her mana (100).\nWithout a Master to provide a steady mana supply, this was quite wasteful.\n\"I wanted to calculate how much mana it takes to summon you all.\"\n\"I see.\"\nThe Ice Empress nodded. \"Summoning me cost half your mana. What does that mean?\"\n\"Your power is equivalent to an A+-rank Noble Phantasm's full strike.\"\nDamien explained, \"So, 500 mana is roughly equal to an A++-rank Noble Phantasm's maximum output.\"\nIce Burst wasn't even her strongest move.\nUsing it on Zouken was like swatting a mosquito with a cannon.\nIf she unleashed her full mana, her power could surpass Saber's Excalibur at maximum output.\n\"Don't worry about the mana issue.\"\n\"Besides, that old worm was an unstable factor. Eliminating him early benefits us.\"\nDamien's descent wasn't impulsive; he'd planned for months to maximize gains in this war.\nFinding Sakura to serve as his Master was the first step.\nKilling Zouken was another part of the plan.\n\"Onii-san, thank you for saving Sakura.\"\nSakura clung tightly to Damien's hand, terrified her savior might disappear.\n\"Don't be afraid. I'll take you somewhere safe.\"\nDamien didn't bother with nonsense about sending her home.\nGiven her attitude, whether she'd even want to return to the family that abandoned her was uncertain.\nBeing cast into a pit of horrors by her own parents... any child would feel resentment.\nNever mind claims of magical inheritance.\nPerhaps Tokiomi meant well, but Sakura didn't understand.\nAll she knew was she'd nearly been devoured by those disgusting worms!\n\"Sakura will be good!\"\nSakura was obedient.\nTo her, Damien was a hero descended from the heavens.\nWhatever he asked, she'd do, as long as he didn't abandon her like her parents had.\n\"Poor child.\"\nHearing her thoughts, Damien sighed inwardly.

She opened her eyes, dazed at first, then leapt into his arms like a frightened rabbit.\n\"Don't be afraid, Sakura.\"\nAfter calming her, Damien said, \"Go take a bath and get some rest.\"\n\"Onii-san, where are we?\"\nOnly then did Sakura notice the change in surroundings and the presence of Sakurako and Akahime.\n\"We're at a hotel.\"\nDamien didn't explain further, urging her to bathe and rest.\nAt her most vulnerable, Sakura instinctively obeyed.\nWith Sakurako and Akahime's help, she bathed and changed into pajamas Shuna had bought for her.\nAfter a night's rest, Sakura's spirits improved significantly.\nDamien took the chance to explain his origins and the current situation.\n\"Holy Grail War.\"\n\"Servants and Masters.\"\n\"An early-arriving Voyager.\"\nThe information was beyond Sakura's comprehension.\nBut that was fine.\nShe only needed to understand one thing.\n\"Whatever Damien-nii asks, Sakura will do!\"\nShe agreed without hesitation to Damien becoming her Servant.\nNo, it was perfect!\nServants stayed by their Masters, meaning they'd never part.\nClutching Damien's hand, Sakura felt an overwhelming sense of security.\n\"Girls shouldn't say things like that.\"\nDamien lightly tapped her nose.\nSakura nodded as if acknowledging a mistake, though whether she truly understood was unclear.\n\"Alright, Sakura, I'm starting.\"\nDamien linked his mana to her, establishing a Servant contract per the Nasuverse's rules.\n\"Ah!!\"\nAs the contract formed, Sakura let out a pained cry.\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\"My hand!\"\nSakura looked at her hand. \"It hurts.\"\nOn her delicate hand, a strange red tattoo slowly appeared... the Command Seals, symbolizing her role as a Master.\n\"It's okay.

      "content": "In Damien's original plan, if the Holy Grail War hadn't started early, he would have exploited a loophole in the world's rules to manipulate its timeline, accelerating it to a year later.\nHowever, the war began ahead of schedule, and the Holy Grail swiftly selected its Masters.\nFortunately, Kariya Matou was still chosen as one of the seven Masters.\n\"I've never had such a favorable start.\" Damien thought to himself before asking, \"Are you ready, Violet?\"\n[It can begin.]\nHearing Violet's response, Damien raised his hand, channeling his magical energy through the Command Seals on his hand and connecting to the Holy Grail system enveloping Fuyuki City via its spiritual leyline.\n\"Fill, fill, fill…\"\n\"I declare your body serves under me, my fate is entrusted to your sword; heed the call of the Holy Grail. If you abide by this will and reason, then answer.\"\n\"I am the embodiment of all that is good in the world; I am the conduit for all that is evil.\"\n\"You, clad in the three great words of seven heavens, come forth through the wheel of restraint, Guardian of the Scales!\"\nBoom!\nThe once-dim magic circle erupted in brilliant light under Damien's incantation, its intense magical fluctuations sending waves of air rippling outward.\n\"Not a bad magical reaction.\" The Snow Empress remarked, arms crossed as she stood to the side. \"I wonder what kind of Heroic Spirit Damien will summon.\"\n\"Isn't it that dark one?\" Ogerpon asked curiously, tilting her head. Damien had previously shared details about the seven Heroic Spirits of the Fourth Holy Grail War.\nKariya Matou's summoned Servant was Lancelot, of the Berserker class.\n\"No, it won't be Lancelot.\" The Snow Empress said, shaking her head. \"Our lord didn't use a corresponding Saint Relic, as this allows a stronger connection to the Root, giving Violet a chance to siphon more of its rules.\"\n\"So, it's a random summoning?\" The Ice Empress asked, grasping the idea. Damien was taking a chance, summoning whatever came.\n\"Not entirely random. At least the class is fixed.\" The Snow Empress clarified. \"The other classes are mostly locked, leaving only Caster and Berserker.\"\nThese two classes were up to chance; Damien could summon either one.\n\"It's here!\"\nFinally, Damien sensed a presence emerging from the center of the magic circle.\nA strikingly beautiful girl appeared, with short, pink hair and pale green eyes. She wore a flowing white dress resembling a wedding gown, adorned with metallic accessories at her waist and ears. A golden horn at her forehead faintly glimmered with emerald arcs of electricity as she raised her head.\n\"Frankenstein.\"\nThe moment the girl was summoned, Damien received her complete information.\n[Name: Frankenstein]\n[Class: Berserker]\n[Parameters:\n[Strength C]\n[Endurance B]\n[Agility D]\n[Mana D]\n[Luck B]\n[Noble Phantasm C]\n[Inherent Skills:\n- Galvanism (Rank B): Automatically accumulates magical energy, significantly reducing the Master's burden.\n- Overload (Rank C): At the cost of self-damage, enhances the power of her Noble Phantasm.\n[Noble Phantasms:\n[Bridal Chest]\n[Rank: C]\n[Type: Anti-Unit]\n[Range: 1]\n[Maximum Targets: 1]\n[Blasted Tree]\n[Rank: DB+]\n[Type: Anti-Army]\n[Range: 110]\n[Maximum Targets: 30]\n\"It's Fran.\" Damien mused, surprised to have summoned Frankenstein.\n\"Ah, Ma… Master…\" Fran stammered.\n\"Yes, I'm your Master.\"\nDamien stepped forward, gently brushing Fran's hair without hesitation, showing no fear of her Berserker class or the massive hammer named Bridal Chest.\n\"???\"\nFran had never experienced such a thing.\nShe was a monster created by her father, reviled for her ugliness and abandoned.\nIn her 'life,' no one had ever held expectations for her.\nNo, more accurately, the idea of someone having expectations for her was nothing short of a miracle to Fran.\n\"Pretty average attributes.\" The Ice Empress remarked bluntly, offering no courtesy. \"And that's with the Mad Enhancement boost. Her base stats are probably just on par with a C-rank Heroic Spirit.\"\nIn other words, Damien's summoning had produced a Heroic Spirit only slightly stronger than a lone Shadow Guard.\nWhat kind of terrible luck was this?\n\"Aaah!\"\nHearing the Ice Empress's criticism, Fran raised her hammer in anger, ready to strike.\nBut Damien stopped her with a single hand.\n\"Huh?\"\nFran stared in shock at Damien, who had effortlessly restrained her with one hand, her heart filled with awe.\n\"Don't make trouble, Ice.\" Damien said with a sigh, his tone carrying a hint of reproach.\n\"Got it.\" The Ice Empress replied, chastened.\nHer sharp tongue had been instinctive.\nSince Fran was summoned by Damien, she was a comrade.\nDamien's group had few rules.\nBut one taboo was absolute: betrayal of a comrade.\nThe Ice Empress's disdain for Fran wasn't a big deal, far from a serious offense.\nDamien didn't expect all his subordinates to get along perfectly... that was unrealistic.\nBut in his presence, he would quash such conflicts.\nDifferences breed competition.\nAnd as long as it was healthy competition, Damien wouldn't intervene.\nThere was no need for him to say more.\n\"Ice…\" The Snow Empress's expression was enough to make the Ice Empress lower her head, avoiding her gaze.\nLooking down on a comrade was wrong.\nAt least, that's how it was for them.\nIn truth, they were merely soul beasts from the Douluoverse, having lived for hundreds of thousands of years.\nWithout Damien bringing them out and granting them power, what right did they have to scorn others?\nThis applied not just to the Snow Empress and Ice Empress, but to the Shadow Guards, Goblins, and Star Wolves as well.\nThey were once weak, only rising to their current state through Damien's favor.\nFran might be weaker now.\nBut that was only temporary.\nWho could say that, once Damien brought Fran back to the Cardinal World, she wouldn't receive more blessings and surpass the Ice Empress?\nAt that moment, Damien and the Snow Empress exchanged a glance, sharing a silent understanding.\nDamien's reprimand of the Ice Empress wasn't just for Fran's sake... it was also for Ice's benefit.\nAs the Snow Empress thought, Damien couldn't predict the potential of Fran or future newcomers from other worlds.\nIf the Ice Empress made an enemy of someone weak now, it could lead to trouble later.\nThe Ice Empress was Damien's twin martial soul, closer than a mere vassal... a trusted confidante.\n---\nHi guys, Elenea here! I just want to announce that starting now I'll be trying to focus on my own original fanfic, which I've been thinking about for the past few days (lol I really mulled this over briefly for a few days and decided I'm going to make it a full novel).\nIf you want to read it, feel free to stop by and leave a five-star and that power stone.\n[Worse Than the Devil (DxD)]\nSynopsis:\nDevil.\nAn evil and chaotic creatures born from hell who often blamed by humans for the mistakes they themselves commit.\n\"The devil made me do it.\"\nA phrase always uttered by humans after committing crimes, casting blame and responsibility for their wrongdoings onto the devil.\nBut not all humans are like that, for there is one man who would gleefully commit atrocities that would be condemned by all of human history and accept the blame and responsibility for those wrongs with open arms.\nHis name is Michael, but in stark contrast to the meaning of his name 'Who is like God' he is not a devout man who draws near to God's embrace. Instead… he is the one who sends lost sheep to meet God's embrace much faster.\n---\nDon't forget to stop by, otherwise I'll actually slap you online lol.\nBtw, a quick note before you decide to read, if you have a heart as pure as glass, I suggest you don't read this because it REALLY gets dark to early. The first chapter will give you a little idea of what I might explore later on in this fanservice harem-themed world like DxD.\nAdios!",

      "content": "\"Make friends in humble beginnings, and never underestimate the potential of youth.\"\nDamien's words echoed in the Ice Empress's ears.\nClearly, this was the true lesson Damien wished to impart to her.\n\"I understand.\" The Ice Empress said, her mood lifting considerably.\nRealizing that Damien's defense of Fran was also an expression of his high expectations for her, the Ice Empress's earlier frustration dissipated. She gained a clearer understanding of her role under Damien's command.\n\"Sorry, I shouldn't have said that about you.\" The Ice Empress apologized to Fran, who responded with a few soft \"ahh\" Sounds before turning her attention back to her Master.\n\"So, will Fran become one of Damien's vassals too?\" Ogerpon asked, nibbling her finger and glancing innocently between the Snow Empress, the Ice Empress, and Damien.\nAs a simple Pokémon, she couldn't grasp the complexities of their thoughts.\n\"No.\" Damien replied, checking his status panel with a regretful shake of his head. \"Unfortunately, Heroic Spirit summoning doesn't exploit the loophole of the Unity of All Spirits.\"\n\"Fran is just my Heroic Spirit, not a vassal.\"\nOne of Damien's goals in performing the Heroic Spirit summoning was to test whether it could expand his vassal quota.\nNow, it seemed that plan had failed.\n\"But it's not all bad news.\"\nThrough this summoning, Violet had gathered some critical information.\nOne key point was that Damien could retain the souls of the Heroic Spirits he summoned.\nTake Fran, for example.\nIf Damien chose, he could extract her soul and, in the Cardinal World, craft a new body for her.\nThis way, Damien could effectively \"steal\" Heroic Spirits from this world.\nOnce Fran entered the Cardinal World, Violet could secure her a \"green card.\" granting her the blessings of the World's Voice.\nWith her Heroic Spirit form, substantial magicule, and various skills, Violet estimated that Fran's potential in the Cardinal World would rival that of Shion and Shuna... a seed for high-tier combat strength.\n\"And don't underestimate Fran.\" Damien added. \"Her inherent skill, Galvanism, is exactly the power we need.\"\nDamien's Heroic Spirit form was anchored to Sakura.\nHis existence constantly drained her magical energy.\nDespite Sakura's remarkable aptitude and higher-than-average magical reserves for a magus, a six-year-old girl could not sustain Damien at full power.\nBut now, things were different.\nWith the magical energy provided by Ryudou Temple, Damien could fully unleash his Heroic Spirit template.\nAs for Fran, she was the type who could fight independently once fully \"charged.\" requiring no further effort from Damien.\nHer power source was the ambient magical energy in the air.\nWith Ryudou Temple's leyline, Fran could recharge in the shortest time possible.\nMost importantly, even when Fran's magical energy was full, she could still absorb ambient magic, though she couldn't store it.\n\"Could it be?!\"\nIn that moment, everyone realized Fran's significance to the group.\nName: Frankenstein\nMagical Energy Recovery: 40/hour\n\"A combatant who doesn't need constant support and can boost our magical energy recovery... isn't that a good deal?\" Damien asked.\nTruth be told, compared to the Knight of the Lake, Damien preferred Fran.\nThe Knight of the Lake consumed too much magical energy.\nSupplying him would be less efficient than supporting Shion or Ogerpon, who were no less capable.\nFran, on the other hand, was essentially free labor.\nNot only did she require no upkeep, but she also added 40 points to the magical energy recovery, on top of Sakura's 10 points and the leyline's 100 points.\n\"But 40 points... isn't that a bit much?\" The Snow Empress asked curiously. Despite Fran's modest strength, her ability to draw magical energy from the Greater Grail was four times that of Sakura's, which seemed remarkable.\n\"It's because of this place.\" Damien said, pointing to the ground beneath them. \"Fran's Galvanism absorbs ambient magical energy.\"\n\"And what we're doing now is releasing the magical energy accumulated in Ryudou Temple's leyline over centuries.\"\nThis release required a corresponding magic absorption array.\nHowever, no matter the array, there was always significant waste... around 60 points of magical energy dissipated for every 100 points Damien extracted from the leyline.\n\"Fran can repurpose that wasted energy.\"\nAs a result, Damien's magical energy recovery efficiency had risen from zero to 150 points per hour.\nIn just 100 hours... five days... Damien would be able to fully unleash the power of [The Monster Kingdom of Another World].\nAt that point, no elaborate plans would be necessary.\nHe could simply charge in and dominate the Holy Grail War!\n\"Kirei Kotomine's Heroic Spirit is still the same Assassin.\"\n\"Tokiomi Tohsaka's Goldie remains unchanged as well.\"\nOn the first night of the Holy Grail War, the day after summoning Fran, Damien, stationed at Ryudou Temple, received word that Assassin had infiltrated the Tohsaka residence and was decisively obliterated by Gilgamesh.\nThis scene played out exactly as in the original story, a clear act of Tokiomi Tohsaka and Kirei Kotomine's orchestration.\n\"Aside from the yet-to-be-identified Caster and Lancer, the identities of the other Heroic Spirits have been confirmed.\" Souei reported, kneeling before Damien. The Shadow Guard had gathered intelligence across the city. \"This morning, a white-haired beauty accompanied by a blonde woman dressed as a butler was spotted at Fuyuki City's shopping district.\"\n\"A young man named Waver was also seen with a towering red-haired warrior.\"\n\"Artoria and Iskandar.\"\n\"The King of Knights and the King of Conqueror have arrived.\"\nKnowing these three had successfully joined the Holy Grail War, Damien's lingering concerns vanished. \"Excellent. Our main targets are accounted for. The remaining Caster and Lancer are inconsequential.\"\nDamien's goals were the Gate of Babylon and the Reality Marble.\n\"Hm?\"\nSuddenly, Damien and Souei, seated in the room, sensed an unmistakable wave of battle intent emanating from the void.\n\"This brazen fighting spirit is almost too bold.\" The Ice Empress said, arms crossed as she appeared behind Damien, her expression displeased. \"Shall I go take him out?\"\n\"I agree with Lady Ice Empress.\" Shion chimed in eagerly. \"Let me go... I'll tear that guy to shreds!\"\n\"Don't be so impulsive, you two.\" Damien said, rising slowly. He instructed Shuna to look after Sakura before heading toward the source of the battle intent. \"If I'm not mistaken, this should be the scene of Diarmuid and Saber's first clash.\"\n\"Let's go join the excitement!\"\nMeanwhile, at the container yard by Fuyuki City's river, a warrior wielding dual spears faced off against a knight clad in blue-and-white armor, their figures locked in a fierce exchange of blows.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Bang!\nBoom!\nThe two combatants moved swiftly, their every strike showcasing the pinnacle of swordsmanship and spearmanship.\nDamien's figure appeared atop a vantage point, his gaze sweeping the area, quickly pinpointing everyone present.\nOn the distant bridge stood the Rider Master and Servant, while an Assassin lurked high above, observing the scene. Irisviel watched anxiously from afar, and Kayneth hid somewhere nearby.\nOf course, Damien didn't miss Maiya and Kiritsugu, positioned with sniper rifles, ready to take out a Master at the first opportunity.\n\"How's it looking?\" Damien asked.\n\"In terms of martial skill alone, they've reached the peak of human capability.\" The Snow Empress replied, noticing the figures concealed in the shadows. \"Those rats... should we deal with them?\"\n\"No, tonight we're just here to observe.\"\nDamien let his legs dangle, sitting casually on a container.\nHis targets weren't these two, but the yet-to-engage King of Conqueror and Goldie.\n\"Wait!\"\nSuddenly, Kiritsugu's heart skipped a beat. He shifted his sniper rifle. \"That's…?!\"\n\"A new Master?\"\nThrough the scope, Kiritsugu caught sight of Damien.\n\"What?\"\n\"White hair, heterochromatic eyes, about sixteen or seventeen, dressed in modern casual clothing, and a beauty that seems almost inhuman.\"\nIt wasn't just Kiritsugu. Through Assassin's eyes, Kirei Kotomine also saw Damien and relayed his appearance to Tokiomi Tohsaka.\n\"???\"\nTokiomi was utterly baffled.\nKirei had already described a similar appearance earlier... that of Irisviel.\nTokiomi's judgment was that she was an Einzbern homunculus.\nBut what was Damien's deal?\nA second homunculus?\n\"A Heroic Spirit?\"\n\"Or another Master?\"\nNo further guesses were needed.\nAs if sensing the prying eyes, Damien slowly raised his right hand, revealing the blood-red Command Seals etched on its back.\n\"Command Seals?!\"\n\"A Master!!\"\nThat was everyone's first thought, but they were soon shocked by Damien's audacity.\nAs a Master, he didn't hide but instead exposed himself openly.\nKayneth was concealed in the shadows, Irisviel was a decoy thrown out by Kiritsugu, and Kirei and Tokiomi were observing remotely.\nOnly Damien appeared without reservation in their line of sight.\n\"Is he a fool, or does he have some kind of backing?\"\n\"To so brazenly reveal his position like that.\"\n\"Should we take him out?\"\nMaiya had already aimed at Damien, ready to shoot him in the head. \"At this distance…\"\n\"Yes, at this distance!\"\n\"!!!\"\nSuddenly, Maiya's hand froze mid-motion.\nA gleaming blade hovered at her throat, ready to slit it at any moment.\nWhen?\nA bead of cold sweat slid down Maiya's forehead as she felt the killing intent from behind.\nThe specter of death had never been so clear.\n\"Maiya?!\"\nHaving fought alongside Maiya for years, Kiritsugu immediately sensed the change in her tone.\nSomething had happened to Maiya!\nAnd if she was compromised, so was he.\n\"Shall I kill her, my lord?\"\nA low, weathered voice came through the earpiece, and Kiritsugu realized he, too, had been exposed.\nStep! Step! Step!\n\"Behind me? Since when?!\"\nStartled by the sound of footsteps, Kiritsugu moved to react.\nBut a hand landed on his shoulder faster.\n\"!!\"\nIn that moment, Kiritsugu felt as if an invisible force had pinned him in place.\nA single hand, exerting little effort, held him immobile, unable to rise.\n\"Do you think I should kill her?\" Damien's figure vanished from everyone's sight. He lightly patted Kiritsugu's shoulder. \"Saber's true Master, Kiritsugu Emiya?\"\nAs he spoke, Damien casually sat beside Kiritsugu, continuing to watch the battle below.\nAs for Kiritsugu, completely restrained, he couldn't counterattack, let alone use a Command Seal to recall Saber.\nThis guy!\nHe's definitely not a magus!\nNo magus could wield such methods.\nIt wasn't just Kiritsugu.\nAt that moment, Kirei Kotomine and Tokiomi Tohsaka were also searching for Damien's figure.\n\"Gone?\"\n\"Yes.\" Kirei said. \"Like an illusion. Assassin blinked, and he lost track of him.\"\n\"How is that possible?\"\nIt might be understandable if they lost sight of Damien.\nBut this was Assassin.\nThe Servant most adept at assassination and concealment!\nTo evade his eyes and vanish without a trace... no magus, not even a Heroic Spirit in the Holy Grail War, should be capable of that.\nYet Damien was indeed gone!\n\"An invisibility spell, or an illusion?\"\nThere was another possibility: spatial magecraft.\nBut that was too terrifying to consider.\nIf a magus of that caliber was participating in this Holy Grail War, Tokiomi could imagine the immense pressure it would bring.\n\"Perhaps we've misjudged.\" Tokiomi said, his expression grim. \"That white-haired youth…\"\n\"He's not a Master!\"\nOf the remaining unconfirmed classes, only three were left: Rider, Caster, and Berserker.\nSomeone with such composure couldn't be a Berserker.\n\"Caster?\"\nKiritsugu reached a similar conclusion.\nThe man exhaled deeply, his mind racing as he forced himself to stay calm. \"So, what does the great Caster want with me?\"\n\"Ho?\"\nDamien was mildly surprised that Kiritsugu could still converse calmly. He released his hold on him.\n\"You speak as if we're the ones with intentions.\" Damien said. \"Hiding in the shadows, aiming dangerous weapons for a sneak attack.\"\n\"Pretty underhanded, Mr. Kiritsugu.\"\nDamien calmly outlined their conflict. \"Give me an explanation, or that woman will pay the price for her actions.\"\nThough Maiya hadn't actually fired, aiming a sniper rifle was something Damien could tolerate... but his vassals could not.\nHad Damien not intervened, the Ice Empress would have already unleashed an Ice Burst.\nIf that happened, all eyes would have turned to Damien.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Irisviel? Or perhaps the Einzberns?\nIn an instant, Kiritsugu's mind raced through countless possibilities.\n\"Didn't you call me Caster?\" Damien said. \"As a magus from the Age of Gods, is it so hard to believe I can see through modern magecraft at a glance?\"\nOf course, it was hard to believe!\nKiritsugu hadn't even used the spell.\nTo see through his trump card like that... was this the caliber of a Caster?\nYet, no matter how turbulent Kiritsugu's thoughts were, he was a fish on the chopping block. He had no choice.\n\"Fine, but the essence of this magecraft requires a Magic Crest…\"\nThough Time Alter was the culmination of generations of Emiya family effort, Kiritsugu didn't hold it in high regard.\nAs long as he could achieve his dream of world peace, a mere magecraft was insignificant.\nHowever, this magecraft was no simple feat.\nIts essence was a Reality Marble, a miracle known as a 'Great Magecraft.'\nIt separated the interior of a specific space from the external 'flow of time,' allowing the user to manipulate time at will.\nThis magecraft consumed immense magical energy and required complex preparations and rituals, designed as a technique for performing Great Magecraft.\n\"No need for complications.\" Damien interrupted Kiritsugu's explanation. \"As long as you don't resist, I can analyze a mere magecraft in no time.\"\nHe wasn't worried about revealing his capabilities to Kiritsugu.\nDamien's true trump cards were the Snow Empress, Ogerpon, and the others.\nAs long as these forces remained hidden, no one could counter him.\n\"Alright.\"\nKiritsugu had no choice.\nWith Maiya under Damien's control and himself in his grasp, Kiritsugu had no confidence in escaping a Heroic Spirit like Damien.\nCaster?\nWho is this guy, really?\nFollowing Damien's instructions, Kiritsugu relaxed his body, though his mind continued to race to that white haired gold and silver heterochromatic eyes man.\nHis apperance was so Otherworldy.\nNo matter how much Kiritsugu searched his memory, he couldn't find any Heroic Spirit matching that description.\nWait!\nSuddenly, Kiritsugu realized something.\nIf the Damien beside him was a Heroic Spirit summoned as a Caster, then who was holding Maiya hostage?\nRecalling the deep, weathered voice from the earpiece... distinctly different from Damien's... Kiritsugu wondered, Their Master?\nBut that was too bizarre.\nWhat kind of Master followed a Heroic Spirit's orders to take hostages?\nA complete reversal of roles?!\nEspecially with the Command Seals on Damien's hand... undoubtedly genuine.\nKiritsugu felt his mind going numb: What kind of rule-breaking Heroic Spirit is this?\n[Rule fragment detected. Beginning analysis…]\n[Analysis in progress…]\nThe Learner skill in the Nasuverse wasn't as effective as in the Konosubaverse.\nIn Konosubaverse, Damien could use his appraisal skill to instantly copy an adventurer's class skills.\nHere, replicating another's abilities required not only sufficient analysis time but also the condition that the target either use the skill or be within a certain distance.\nRight now, Kiritsugu was close enough to Damien.\nEven without using the magecraft, Violet could rapidly analyze Time Alter without the Nasuverse's rules detecting it.\n\"Done.\"\nDamien signaled Souei to release Maiya. \"Until the magecraft analysis is complete, let's enjoy this knightly duel.\"\nThough he said this, the situation clearly showed Saber at a disadvantage.\nDiarmuid had unleashed his Noble Phantasms, first using Gáe Dearg to bypass the King's armor, then Gáe Buidhe to sever the tendons in one of her hands with its cursed strike.\n\"Irisviel, use healing on me too!\" Artoria called, seeing Diarmuid's wounds heal rapidly under Kayneth's magical energy.\n\"I did!\" Irisviel replied in a panic. \"I used it… why isn't it…?\"\n\"The healing should have taken effect, Saber. You should be healed by now.\"\nYet Artoria's wrist continued to bleed.\nClearly, this wasn't Irisviel's fault but something Diarmuid had done.\n\"You were clever to see that armor is useless against Gáe Dearg.\" Diarmuid said. \"But abandoning your armor was too hasty. Otherwise, you could have blocked Gáe Buidhe!\"\n\"I see.\" Artoria realized, identifying her opponent. \"The red spear that severs magic, the yellow spear that curses wounds to never heal, and the tear-shaped mole that enchants maidens... the Fianna Knights' greatest warrior, 'Shining Face' Diarmuid.\"\nLikewise, Diarmuid recognized Artoria's identity as the legendary King Arthur through her sword.\n\"Saber's lost.\" a voice said behind Damien. Kiritsugu turned to see a cold, ice-blue maiden.\n\"Hmph!\" The Ice Empress scoffed at Kiritsugu's gaze. \"This guy's an enemy Master, right? Should we take him out?\"\nHer words carried a tangible killing intent that enveloped Kiritsugu.\nTrue to her nature as a 400,000-year-old beast under Damien's command, her first instinct was to kill.\n\"He's already paid the price.\" Damien said.\nAs a man of principle, since Kiritsugu had offered compensation, Damien honored his word and forgave the offense.\n\"But there won't be a next time, Kiritsugu Emiya.\"\nEach word from Damien struck Kiritsugu's heart like a hammer, leaving him drenched in sweat.\nMonster!\nThat was Kiritsugu's first impression of Damien.\nA terrifying, incomprehensible monster!\nAbsolutely…\nI cannot afford to make an enemy of this man!\nThough reason dictated the wisest course, Damien knew well that, as a champion of justice, Kiritsugu would not abandon his resolve to challenge him.\n---\nHi guys, Elenea here!

Zzt!\nA sudden burst of lightning and thunder drew everyone's attention.\nWith a bolt of lightning descending from the sky, Artoria and Diarmuid were forcibly interrupted, their gazes fixed warily on the red-haired giant riding a thunderous ox-drawn chariot.\nHis arrival gave the disadvantaged Artoria a moment to catch her breath.\n\"My name is Iskandar, the King of Conqueror!\" He declared, arms spread wide, announcing his presence to the two Heroic Spirits. \"In this Holy Grail War, I descend as Rider!\"\n\"Another one's shown up.\" The Ice Empress noted, recognizing the burly man as one of the two main targets Damien sought in this Holy Grail War.\n\"Saber's hand is injured; she can't wield her holy sword anymore.\" The Ice Empress observed, having watched Artoria and Diarmuid's duel. She now had a clear grasp of her own strength.\nWithout using special magic, her body... rated A++... surpassed even Diarmuid when he used his Noble Phantasms.\nBut Saber's light cannon? Even if the Ice Empress could withstand it, her magical energy would likely be drained completely.\n\"If we act now, we could take all three of them down.\" She suggested.\n\"Not yet.\" Damien replied, deeming the timing poor. \"There are other Heroic Spirits lurking in the shadows. If Gilgamesh launches a sneak attack while we're engaged, it'll be trouble.\"\n\"Fine.\" The Ice Empress conceded, tempted to ask why he didn't send the Snow Empress to intercept Gilgamesh. But since Damien wasn't ready to end the Holy Grail War tonight, she held her tongue.\nVassals had the right to offer counsel, but the final decision rested with Damien.\n\"???\"\nMeanwhile, Kiritsugu Emiya had been observing the Ice Empress.\nThe girl, radiating terrifying magical energy and an icy aura, didn't seem human at all.\nThe only possibility was that she was a Heroic Spirit.\nBut that was absurd.\nThe one holding Maiya hostage was a Heroic Spirit, and Damien, despite bearing Command Seals, seemed to be one too.\nAnd now, this third one appeared.\nIn just moments, three Heroic Spirits had emerged.\nWhat baffled Kiritsugu even more was that these two clearly deferred to Damien.\nAn alliance?\nNo, no alliance works like this.\nA historical figure flashed through Kiritsugu's mind: A Caster with the ability to summon powerful pseudo-Heroic Spirits…\nNo way.\nKiritsugu was startled by his own theory. If it really is that figure, just how chaotic will this Holy Grail War become?\n\"Hm?\" Damien sensed Kiritsugu's mental storm but ignored it.\nNo matter what Kiritsugu guessed, he'd never imagine that Damien and his group came from another world.\nIt wasn't about plausibility... no one would consider that the Holy Grail War could summon Servants from other worlds.\n\"Though fate pits us against each other for the Holy Grail, I have one question first!\" Iskandar proclaimed. \"Will you join me and yield the Grail to me? If so, I shall treat you as friends, and we'll share the joy of conquering the world together!\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"What kind of joke is this?\"\nUnsurprisingly, Iskandar's bold declaration left everyone speechless.\nThose present, whether Masters or Servants, had their own desires. How could they simply hand over the Grail?\nSubmitting to a fellow Heroic Spirit like Iskandar was an outright challenge to their spiritual dignity.\n\"This guy…\" Kiritsugu muttered. \"The world was nearly conquered by such a fool?\"\n\"Pretty interesting, isn't it?\" Damien said, resting his chin on his hand. \"Honestly, if I could, I'd like to be like him.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I'm not interested in the Grail.\" Damien admitted. \"Rather than the Grail, I'd prefer the loyalty of the summoned Heroic Spirits.\"\nAt that moment, Kayneth finally noticed Waver beside Iskandar.\nRealizing the truth behind his stolen Saint Relic, Kayneth unleashed a barrage of merciless mockery and threats, leaving Waver trembling.\nFortunately, Iskandar, true to his reputation as a great ruler, easily reassured his young Master and countered without hesitation.\n\"Hey, magus!\" Iskandar called out. \"From what you're saying, you intended to replace this boy as my Master, didn't you? That's utterly laughable.\"\n\"A man worthy of being my Master must be a warrior who can ride into battle with me.\" Iskandar declared. \"A coward too spineless to show himself doesn't qualify to be my Master!\"\nWhen it came to mockery, Iskandar was a professional.\nKayneth gritted his teeth, furious at being told he was inferior to Waver.\nKiritsugu remained unfazed.\nAs an assassin, he cared little for reputation.\nStill…\nKiritsugu glanced over and immediately noticed the Ice Empress's darkened expression.\nClearly, such mockery wasn't without effect.\nFor someone as proud as the Ice Empress, being called a rat skulking in the shadows was intolerable.\n\"Fran!\" Damien called, stopping the Ice Empress from acting.\n\"Go make an appearance.\"\n\"Aaah!\"\nWielding her massive thunder hammer, Fran emerged from the void.\nBoom!\nWith a few leaps, she bounded across the containers, crashing onto the battlefield of the three Heroic Spirits like a meteor.\nDamien sent Fran out for no other reason than to introduce his official Berserker to the other Heroic Spirits.\n\"Another one!\"\n\"A new Heroic Spirit?!\"\nWhile Iskandar and the others were surprised by the arrival of another Heroic Spirit, Kiritsugu was genuinely stunned by Damien's tactics.\nThat's the third one!\nFran?\nIs that the Heroic Spirit's True Name?\nKiritsugu couldn't recall any Heroic Spirit named Fran, but his earlier suspicion grew stronger: The legendary King of Magecraft from the Tanakh, said to command seventy-two Demon God Pillars... Solomon!\n\"Hm?\" Damien paused at Kiritsugu's sudden outburst.\n\"Oh, you're talking about my identity?\" He said, neither confirming nor denying it.\nBut come to think of it…\nDamien realized his situation did bear a striking resemblance to King Solomon's legend.\nEspecially the ability to summon seventy-two Demon God Pillars.\nHis [Monster Kingdom of Another World] was indeed quite similar in effect.\nEven the legions controlled by those Demon God Pillars shared some parallels with his Goblin army.\n---\nHi guys, Elenea here!

No one would likely call my bluff.\nGood grief!\nThe real Solomon had somehow become his stand-in.\n\"It seems I guessed right.\" Kiritsugu said, interpreting Damien's silence as confirmation. \"It's hard to imagine... this Holy Grail War with both the King of Conqueror and the King of Magecraft.\"\nAdd in his own Knight King, Arthur, and this war's 'king' quotient was absurdly high.\nZzt! Zzt!\n\"The little girl sparking with electricity.\" Iskandar remarked, rubbing his chin, unable to discern Fran's identity. \"Care to introduce yourself first?\"\n\"Aaah!\"\nFran, not grasping Iskandar's intent, flared with lightning, poised to attack at any moment.\n\"Careful, Irisviel!\" Artoria gripped her holy sword, shielding Irisviel behind her.\nDiarmuid's expression grew serious, ready to fight.\n\"Hey, hey, hold on!\" Iskandar protested. \"Such a hot-tempered girl... can't you let me finish?\"\nHis words had no effect, but Damien's command calmed Fran instantly.\nAs the arcs of electricity faded, Fran planted Bridal Chest beside her, awaiting Iskandar's next words.\n\"I thought you were one of those non-communicative types.\" Iskandar said, keenly sensing Fran's nature. If he wasn't mistaken, she was likely this Holy Grail War's Berserker.\n\"Rider?\" Artoria asked. \"What exactly are you after? What's your goal?\"\n\"My goal?\"\nIskandar didn't answer directly. Instead, he tilted his head back and shouted.\n\"Hey! There are others out there, right?!\"\n\"You lot hiding in the shadows, spying on us!\"\nHis voice deepened. \"Surely, Saber and Lancer's clear clash of blades has drawn more than just me and this little girl.\"\n\"Come now! Heroic Spirits summoned by the Holy Grail, if you don't want to be scorned as cowards by me, Iskandar, the King of Conqueror, show yourselves!\"\nHeroic Spirits were renowned heroes of history, each with their own pride and legendary deeds.\nUnsurprisingly, Iskandar's provocation was something few could stomach, except perhaps an Assassin.\n\"This is…\" Tokiomi Tohsaka, watching from the shadows, felt a headache coming on. \"Trouble.\"\nAmong the summoned Heroic Spirits, none would be more provoked by Iskandar's taunt than Gilgamesh.\n\"The Nasuverse lamppost king lives up to his name.\" Damien remarked, watching as Gilgamesh appeared atop a lamppost, unleashing a torrent of insults, branding everyone as worthless mongrels.\nWithout Lancelot present, Gilgamesh's Noble Phantasms were aimed at Iskandar, who had dared to offend him.\nBut then...\n\"Aaah!\"\nWhether it was a natural clash between Berserker and Gilgamesh, Fran glared at him, her body wreathed in lightning, ready to pounce.\n\"Hm?\" Damien was surprised but quickly understood.\nIn a way, the term 'mongrel' wasn't just a trigger for Mordred... it struck a nerve with Fran too.\n\"Who permitted you to gaze upon me, mongrel?\" Gilgamesh snapped, turning two Noble Phantasms toward Fran.\nBoom!\nBoom!\nTwo golden beams of light shot toward Fran on the ground.\nShe swung her massive hammer, deflecting the faster Durandal with force.\nBut the overwhelming strength from the holy sword slowed her attempt to block the second spear by a fraction.\nFran's strength, among this war's Heroic Spirits, was only slightly above Hundred-Face Hassan.\nAgainst the overpowered Gilgamesh, victory was unlikely... surviving for long was the real question.\nStill, Damien had never intended for Fran to play a major role in this Holy Grail War.\nShe had already provided valuable experience in Heroic Spirit summoning and a magical energy recovery buff.\n\"Leave it to you.\" Damien said calmly, unconcerned for Fran's safety, and called out, \"Shion!\"\n\"At your command!\"\nWithout needing further instruction, a graceful, tall figure crossed space, positioning herself between Fran and the incoming Noble Phantasm spear.\nBoom!\nA slender, pale hand reached out, seizing the spear's tip in front of the disbelieving eyes of the Heroic Spirits, halting it with sheer force.\nBuzz! Buzz!\nThe Noble Phantasm spear trembled in Shion's grip, emitting a low hum.\nIt struggled to break free.\nBut her hand, as if forged from steel, held firm, unscathed by the legendary weapon.\n\"Not a bad weapon, but…\" Shion raised her head, her sharp eyes locking onto Gilgamesh atop the lamppost. With a sudden exertion...\nCrack! Snap! Bang!\n\"How is this possible?!\"\nAll eyes were fixed on the Noble Phantasm spear in Shion's hand, their faces filled with disbelief.\nThe once-gleaming golden spear was now riddled with cracks, shattered by Shion's brute strength.\n\"That spear!\"\n\"No doubt, it's a Noble Phantasm!\"\nAnd not just any... at least B-rank or higher!\nYet Shion had crushed it with her bare hands.\n\"Keep going, Shion.\" Damien's voice rang in her ear. \"I need that golden shiny guy to keep using his Gate of Babylon.\"\nGetting close to Gilgamesh was no easy task.\nSo, the plan was to force him to fight, to keep unleashing his arsenal of Noble Phantasms.\nAnd in the process…\n[Noble Phantasm identified: Gate of Babylon]\n[Analysis initiated]\n[Analysis in progress…]\nFor Violet, there was no need to analyze abilities one at a time.\nThe more a target used their power in Damien's presence, the more flaws Violet could detect, hastening the analysis of its essence.\n\"To dare touch my treasures with those filthy hands.\" Gilgamesh seethed. His anger at Shion's contact with his treasures surpassed his shock at the spear's destruction.\n\"Do you desire death so badly, mongrel?!\"\nHis handsome face froze with icy killing intent, devoid of expression.\nThe space around Gilgamesh warped like a mirage, and a divine radiance burst forth.\nA new array of Noble Phantasms unfurled like a saint's halo around the golden Heroic Spirit... sixteen in total.\nNot just swords and spears, but axes, hammers, and lances.\nSome were strange weapons of unknown purpose or origin.\nEach gleamed like a mirror, imbued with potent magical energy.\nEvery one was a true Noble Phantasm, without exception.\n---\nHi guys, Elenea here!

Let's head back.\"\n\"Oh, right.\"\nDamien stood, patting Kiritsugu's shoulder. \"Thanks for your gift. See you next time, Kiritsugu Emiya.\"\nThe Ice Empress followed Damien's lead.\nBefore leaving, she shot Kiritsugu a chilling glance.\nHer icy stare was like a blade, ready to pierce his heart at any moment.\nDamien wasn't surprised by her reaction.\nKiritsugu Emiya was a dangerous man.\nEven the Ice Empress, a soul beast, instinctively sensed something off about him, urging her to eliminate him.\nBeastly intuition?\nKiritsugu recognized this, his heart growing heavier. It's like facing an ancient predator…\nFortunately, the one commanding these 'Demon God Pillars' was King Solomon.\nAnd he was someone Kiritsugu could still communicate with.\nPhew…\nRealizing Damien had truly left and that he'd survived, Kiritsugu let out a relieved breath.\n\"Maiya!\"\nHis taut nerves relaxed, and he immediately contacted her.\n\"I'm fine. He's gone.\" Maiya replied.\n\"Is that so?\" Kiritsugu said. \"It seems he doesn't consider us a threat.\"\nDespite the slight, Kiritsugu felt no resentment... only gratitude.\nAs expected of the legendary King of Magecraft.\nSuch magnanimity was admirable.\nHe was also thankful for his and Maiya's insignificance.\n\"So, who is that Heroic Spirit…?\"\n\"If I'm not mistaken, he's likely the king who commanded the seventy-two Demon God Pillars.\"\n\"!!!\"\nAt the mention of the seventy-two Demon God Pillars, anyone versed in occult knowledge would know his story.\n\"King Solomon?\" Maiya asked.\nPrompted by Kiritsugu, she recalled the recent events.\nThe girl with the strange giant hammer, the tall purple-haired woman with a horn, the silent shadow assassin who nearly slit her throat.\nAnd not long ago, the incident that reduced the Matou residence to icy shards.\nIf Damien was behind that, it made sense.\n\"With so many powers, if they stem from Solomon's Demon God Pillars, it's not surprising.\" Maiya said, fully endorsing Kiritsugu's theory. Only that identity explained why Damien was surrounded by so many powerful entities.\n\"Those aren't Heroic Spirits but something like magical beasts or familiars... Demon God Pillars.\" Kiritsugu reasoned.\nRestricted by the Holy Grail War, they couldn't fully unleash their power, appearing in humanoid forms instead.\nKiritsugu's speculation convinced not only himself but Maiya as well.\nIt was hard to argue otherwise.\nThe pressure from the Ice Empress's parting glance was overwhelming.\nKiritsugu was certain she wasn't any historical Heroic Spirit.\nShe lacked any human traits.\nHer judgment was purely that of an ancient predator hunting prey.\nNo other reason.\nA dangerous entity had to be devoured.\nThat was all!\n\"Time to go.\" Shion said, approaching Fran and vanishing with her in a shimmer of golden particles.\n\"Hm.\"\nFran felt a twinge of regret.\nShe'd wanted to fight Gilgamesh too.\nBut she knew her limits and was no match for him.\n\"Ah, aaah~~\"\n\"No need to thank me.\" Shion said, understanding Fran's cries and smiling. \"We're comrades, so of course we help each other!\"\n\"Hm.\"\nFran followed Shion obediently.\nThe girl's heroic rescue under the Noble Phantasm barrage had captivated her.\nA new Master and the first comrade she'd ever met.\n\"Com…rade… Fran… likes…\"\n\"Oho!\" Shion laughed, slinging an arm around Fran's shoulders as they walked. \"You're talking now? Haha, that's great!\"\nWith that, the two women's figures dissolved into golden particles, fading into the distance.\nTheir departure didn't ease the tension among the remaining Heroic Spirits.\nOn the contrary, their curiosity about the duo's origins and identities intensified.\nFirst, they were undeniably Heroic Spirits.\nThe others, as Heroic Spirits themselves, couldn't mistake that.\nSo, the question was: if the less rational Fran was the Berserker, what was Shion?\nCaster?\nBased on the Heroic Spirits present... Saber (Artoria), Rider (Iskandar), Archer (Gilgamesh), Lancer (Diarmuid), Berserker (Fran), and the earlier Assassin... the only remaining class was Caster.\nBut a Caster this combat-proficient?\nWith the terrifying defense and melee prowess Shion displayed against Gilgamesh, even the strongest class, Saber, wouldn't dare claim victory over her.\n\"Strength, Endurance, Agility... all above A-rank.\"\n\"That can't be a Caster's stats.\"\nHad they been deceived?\nWas Fran not the Berserker, and Shion was?\n\"Kid, did you pick up on anything?\" Iskandar asked, turning to Waver for clues.\n\"The first one, the girl with the giant hammer, is definitely Berserker.\" Waver said of Fran. \"But the other one, I could only see her stats, not her class.\"\nMasters could glimpse basic information about Heroic Spirits through specific magecraft.\nTrue Names, Noble Phantasms, and abilities, however, remained hidden.\n\"What do you mean?\" Iskandar asked, puzzled. \"You can see her stats but not her class?\"\n\"Uh…\"\nAs a half-baked magus, Waver could only relay what he saw.\n\"!!!\"\nOther Heroic Spirits might not grasp the significance of Waver's report, but Iskandar was different.\nIs it an ability like mine?\nIn an instant, he considered a possibility: A subordinate Servant with stats but no class, yet able to rival other Heroic Spirits.\nWasn't that exactly like the soldiers in his Ionian Hetairoi?\nThe only difference was that Shion was stronger.\n---\nHi guys, Elenea here!

      "content": "Time passed quickly, and the third day of the Holy Grail War arrived.\nOn the first night, Artoria's clash with Diarmuid drew the attention of all Heroic Spirits except Caster. Due to Damien's intervention, Ryūnosuke was whisked away by Souei's Shadow Guard the moment he summoned his servant, rendering the original plot irrelevant.\nFrom the second night, the Heroic Spirits began their own maneuvers.\nThe fiercest conflict was between Kayneth and Kiritsugu, their enmity like fire and water, with Saber and Lancer clashing multiple times.\nPerhaps because Saber's disadvantage was too great, Kiritsugu had no choice but to return her scabbard, Avalon.\n\"Saber, restored by some means, successfully repelled Lancer.\"\n\"Kayneth was struck by an Origin Bullet, sustaining severe injuries.\"\nThough he survived, the Origin Bullet's destruction of his Magic Circuits left Kayneth paralyzed.\n\"That dual-wielding spearman is utterly incompetent.\" The Ice Empress remarked. \"He got so caught up fighting Saber that he forgot to protect his Master.\"\n\"And worse, he charmed his lord's fiancée.\"\nKayneth was arguably the most pitiful Master in this Holy Grail War.\nCrippled and betrayed by his fiancée, swayed by his Servant.\nThough Diarmuid had no such intentions, his curse inevitably attracted married women.\nOne could only say Kayneth was reckless, summoning Diarmuid without fear of betrayal.\n\"Anything else?\" Damien asked, seated in the main hall of Ryudou Temple, listening to Souei's report. \"No other Heroic Spirits detected our movements?\"\n\"The Rider team is investigating us.\"\n\"Oh?\" Damien was surprised. For Souei to say this meant Waver and Iskandar had picked up some clues.\nIskandar's brash nature didn't suggest such subtlety.\n\"So, it's Waver?\" Damien mused.\nWaver's talent was undeniable.\nThrough some method, he'd noticed the simultaneous presence of multiple Heroic Spirits.\nNot just Damien's Shadow Guard, but also Assassin, who should have been eliminated.\n\"My apologies, my lord.\" Souei said, bowing. \"I should have been more cautious.\"\n\"No matter.\" Damien replied, shaking his head. \"Finding Ryudou Temple was only a matter of time.\"\nOver three days, Damien had amassed considerable magical energy.\n24 hours x 3 days x 150 units... at least 10,800 magical energy.\nAfter summoning the Snow Empress, Ogerpon, the Ice Empress, Shion, Shuna, and Souei, Damien had successfully summoned all his Kijin.\nBy tonight, even Hoshiga and the Eighteen Wolf Guards would manifest in this world.\nAs for the remaining wolves and goblins, their inclusion was merely for participation, not to influence the war's outcome.\n\"Keep waiting.\" Damien instructed. \"As long as no one attacks us directly, we don't need to get involved in their fights.\"\nDamien remained composed, showing no intent to reveal his strength.\nThat day, he took Shuna and the others to explore Fuyuki City, exuding no trace of wartime tension.\nAs for exposure?\nWith the Shadow Guard monitoring everything, there was no need to worry.\nThat night, Souei brought new intelligence.\n\"Tokiomi Tohsaka is dead?\"\nYes, the notorious Tokiomi, the source of so much trouble, had died prematurely that evening.\n\"So soon?\" Damien was genuinely surprised.\nIf he recalled correctly, Kirei Kotomine's betrayal of Tokiomi should have happened after Assassin's exit.\n\"How did he die?\"\n\"Backstabbed by his disciple, Kirei Kotomine.\"\n\"Same old story.\" Damien thought. \"Did Gilgamesh grow so fed up with Tokiomi that he acted early?\"\nKirei's premature move meant he now controlled both Assassin and Gilgamesh.\n\"Can he sustain two Heroic Spirits?\" The Snow Empress asked, frowning. \"Or does he plan to abandon Assassin?\"\n\"No need for that.\" Damien replied. \"Gilgamesh has Independent Action. Unless he's fighting, he consumes minimal magical energy.\"\n\"Tokiomi was Sakura's father, wasn't he?\" Ogerpon, listening to the conversation, pointed out. \"Should we tell her?\"\n\"…\"\nThe hall fell silent.\n\"Shuna, bring Sakura here.\" Damien said.\n\"Lord Damien?\"\n\"It's fine. I trust Sakura.\"\nDamien had no intention of hiding this from her.\nFor others, he might craft a white lie.\nBut not for Sakura.\nShe wasn't as fragile as she seemed.\nSurviving the Crest Worms' corruption into adulthood, her resilience was unquestionable.\n\"Damien-nii?\"\nSoon, Sakura appeared, running to Damien and throwing herself into his arms in front of everyone.\n\"Sakura.\"\nDamien gently stroked her hair, hesitating briefly before breaking the tragic news.\n\"My father…\"\nHearing of Tokiomi's death, Sakura couldn't process it at first.\n\"How could this happen?\"\nHer voice trembled, unable to believe that her stern, imposing father was gone.\nThough she harbored resentment for the father who gave her away, this Sakura wasn't the one consumed by the Crest Worms.\nShe still held affection for the Tohsaka family.\n\"What about my sister and mother? Are they okay?!\"\nAfter shock and grief came worry for Rin and Aoi.\nSakura had learned much about the Holy Grail War's dangers from Damien and Shuna.\nHer father chose to participate, so he had to accept the risk of death.\nSakura hated her father's killer but wouldn't unreasonably demand Damien avenge him.\nShe never forgot who saved her from her torment.\n\"Don't worry, Sakura. They'll be fine.\" Damien reassured her, promising that her mother and sister would be safe from the war's harm.\n\"I trust you, Damien-nii.\" Sakura said, tears still on her cheeks.\nDamien continued, \"As for Kirei Kotomine, who killed your father, I'll ensure he exits this Holy Grail War.\"\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Unbeknownst to them, they'd reached the temple's gate.\nCreak…\nBefore they could knock, the gate swung open.\n\"Eek!\" Waver yelped, darting behind Iskandar, trembling.\n\"Hm, new faces.\"\nA burly middle-aged man with beastly ears appeared before Iskandar... Hoshiga, the Star Wolves leader.\nIskandar studied him with interest, assessing his strength.\n\"By my lord's command, I've been awaiting you, King of Conqueror.\"\nHoshiga stepped aside, inviting Iskandar into Ryudou Temple.\n\"Hahaha!\" Iskandar laughed. \"He foresaw my arrival?\"\n\"Well then, I'll make myself at home!\"\nWith a hearty laugh, Iskandar crossed the threshold, his boldness befitting Alexander the Great.\n\"Come on, kid!\" He slapped Waver's back, striding forward while observing the surroundings.\nBeastmen?\nHoshiga's appearance sparked many thoughts in Iskandar.\nThe seventy-two demon god pillars indeed included such forms, lending credence to Waver's theory.\nStill, Iskandar wouldn't jump to conclusions before meeting the man himself.\nSoon, under Hoshiga's guidance, they entered the temple's main hall.\nThere, Iskandar and Waver finally met the enigmatic Caster... the one they believed to be the King of Magecraft.\nThe Berserker from that night!\nAnd the woman who fought the golden guy!\nFran and Shion, standing by Damien's side, immediately drew their attention.\nFortunately, they'd anticipated this.\nBeyond surprise, they had no other reactions.\nHowever…\nWaver cautiously scanned the hall, noting the men and women dressed as warriors lining both sides.\nJudging by their auras, every one was a Servant akin to Shion!\n\"First meeting, King of Conqueror Iskandar.\"\nSeated at the head, Damien raised a hand, gesturing for Iskandar to sit.\n\"Ho! Thanks!\"\nIskandar plopped down unceremoniously, and Waver, flustered, hurriedly sat beside his Servant.\nOnly then did they have a moment to study Damien closely.\nDamien's appearance differed greatly from his pre-reincarnation self.\nHe had no interest in reverting.\nHaving started anew, he wasn't fixated on the past.\n\"Please, enjoy.\"\nShuna, accompanied by several shrine maidens, served tea and pastries before returning to Damien's side.\n\"Every one of them is like an elf from fantasy.\"\nFrom the moment they entered, every Servant-like figure they saw, male or female, was impossibly beautiful.\nIt was as if they'd stepped out of a fairy tale, almost too fantastical.\n\"No need to be so tense.\" Damien said, conveying his thoughts to Iskandar. \"Attacking guests upon entry?

See you tonight, Damien!\"\nDuring their talk, Damien had shared his name.\nAs Iskandar said, he didn't care about Damien's true identity.\nHere, in this Holy Grail War, Damien was a king worthy of sharing drinks and clashing with.\nHistorical kings belonged to the world.\nOnly those raising glasses together were worthy opponents!\n\"Just let him leave like that?\"\nFor once, it wasn't the Ice Empress speaking.\nSince Damien's last lesson, she'd matured considerably.\n\"It's basic guest etiquette.\" Damien said, glancing at the waiting Star Wolves leaders. \"He and I will clash eventually, but not now.\"\nIn their conversation, Damien had already issued a war invitation to Iskandar.\nAnd he had accepted.\nNo schemes, just an open clash of forces.\n\"We obey your will.\"\n\"We'll deliver victory in this duel of kings!\"\nOver thirty kilometers west of Fuyuki City's downtown, a national highway cut through a mountainous region far from human habitation.\nAlong this road lay a lush, verdant forest, untouched by the encroaching tide of urban development.\nThis area was shrouded in mystery.\nAt first glance, it seemed like public land, but it was privately owned by a foreign corporation whose existence was uncertain.\nDigging into the land's details yielded only odd urban legends.\nRumors spoke of a 'Dream Castle' deep within the forest.\nChildren exploring for fun or lost hikers would find a magnificent stone castle emerging from the fog.\nThe castle was said to be an eerie mansion.\nThough it appeared abandoned, it was pristine, spotless, unlike any uninhabited place.\nNo one took the rumors seriously, save for third-rate magazines filling summer occult specials.\nOnly a select few magi knew the castle's true existence.\nIt was a mystical fortress that welcomed its master every sixty years, serving as a wartime stronghold.\nProtected by illusions and bounded fields, it was nearly impossible for outsiders to find, except in rare circumstances.\nThose who knew its true nature called the forest Einzbern Forest.\nJust a day ago, a magical conflict had erupted here.\nKayneth had stormed the Einzbern residence, clashing with Kiritsugu, only to fall to the Origin Bullet.\nA day later, many of the castle's facilities remained unrepaired.\nUnder the silent night, the scars of battle were still jarring.\nIrisviel sighed, trying to ignore the devastation as she walked through the crumbling, near-ruined corridor.\n\"Kiritsugu…\"\nAs she worried for her husband's future, a deafening roar shattered the night's silence.\n\"Ah!\"\nThe strain on Irisviel's Magic Circuits nearly made her collapse.\nThe roar came from nearby thunder.\nThe magical feedback accompanying it signaled that the forest's bounded field had been breached.\nNot just breached... the bounded field's very structure had been obliterated.\n\"They're breaking through head-on?\" Irisviel felt stifled.

Stay close to me.\"\nIrisviel nodded, following Saber as she moved to confront the intruder.\nShe knew the safest place on the battlefield was by Artoria's side.\n\"That thunder and unrestrained force... it's likely the King of Conqueror.\" Artoria said.\nThey hurried through the dilapidated castle, reaching a balcony overlooking the grand hall, waiting for the intruder's arrival.\n\"I think so too.\" Irisviel agreed, recalling the power of the Noble Phantasm Gordius Wheel from the warehouse district two nights ago.\nThe thunder-wreathed divine bull chariot.\nIf such an anti-army Noble Phantasm was fully unleashed, it wouldn't be surprising for it to uproot the forest's magical array.\n\"Hey, King of Knights!\" A voice boomed. \"I came all this way for you... come out already!\"\nAs expected, the bold voice echoing through the hall was Iskandar, the King of Conqueror.\nArtoria, mid-stride, transformed her suit into silver-white armor, ready for battle.\n\"Yo, Saber.\" Iskandar greeted. \"Heard you built a castle, so I came to check it out.\"\n\"Tch, tch, tch.\" He clicked his tongue, rubbing his chin. \"Kinda disappointing. This place feels a bit… rundown.\"\n\"Still!\" He added. \"A castle's a castle.\"\n\"You don't mind if I borrow it for a banquet, do you?\"\nIskandar's shameless words left both women struggling to keep their composure.\n\"Rider, you…\" Artoria caught the meaning behind his words.\nHe wasn't here to pick a fight.\n\"You caused all this commotion just to say that?\" She snapped, glaring at him. \"And stop claiming other people's things!\"\n\"Now, now.\" Iskandar said, scratching the back of his head with a toothy grin. \"Since I helped clear some trees from your gate, how about lending me the place?\"\n\"Doesn't it feel like the view's much better without those trees in the yard?\"\nYou... !\nIf Artoria weren't so principled and Irisviel weren't a refined lady, they might have cursed him outright for his brazen self-praise.\n\"What do you want?!\" Artoria demanded. \"Give me a good reason, or my sword won't show mercy!\"\n\"Idiot, idiot, idiot!\" Waver poked his head out from behind Iskandar. \"I told you to ask first!\"\n\"Haha, no time for that!\" Iskandar ignored Waver, hoisting a wine barrel. \"Relax, relax, I'm not here to fight.\"\n\"Then what?\"\n\"Can't you tell?\" Iskandar patted the barrel, grinning. \"This is tonight's wine!\"\n\"Come on, don't just stand there... lead the way. Don't you have a garden suitable for a banquet?\"\n\"This dusty old castle is unbearable.\"\nEach of Iskandar's words stabbed at Irisviel's heart.\nEven her gentle temperament flared with the urge to take him down with her.\nThis guy was too much!\n\"Is this a trap?\"\n\"He doesn't seem like the type to use petty tricks.\"\n\"Is he really just here to drink?\"\nOn the way to the courtyard, Irisviel whispered to Artoria.\nThinking back, Iskandar had publicly declared he wouldn't fight Saber until her duel with Lancer was settled.\nIf that was a vow made on his honor as a Heroic Spirit, a surprise attack tonight made no sense.\n\"Could he be trying to win your favor for a sneak attack?\" Irisviel wondered.\n\"No, Irisviel, you don't understand.\" Artoria said, having seen through Iskandar's intent.\nShe lowered her battle stance, but her expression grew more serious.\n\"This is a challenge issued by a king.\"\n\"I am a king, and so is he.\"\nArtoria continued, \"If he knows our identities and still wants to drink with me, this is a 'battle' without weapons.\"\n\"Haha!\" Iskandar laughed, seeing Saber catch on. \"Exactly!\"\n\"If you don't want to cross blades, then raise glasses, King of Knights!\"\n\"Tonight, I'll test your kingly mettle. Are you ready?\"\n\"Interesting. I accept.\" Artoria said resolutely, her face radiating the same valor as on the battlefield.\n\"This…\"\nIrisviel realized this wasn't a jest but the start of a true contest.\nThe chosen venue was the castle's central garden courtyard.\nUntouched by the previous night's battle, it was a decent spot to host guests without embarrassment.\n\"Shall we begin?\" Artoria asked, sitting cross-legged opposite Iskandar in the garden's center.\n\"Wait, one more guest hasn't arrived.\"\n\"Another guest?\"\n\"This Holy Grail War has more than just you and me as kings.\" Iskandar said.\n\"Could it be?!\"\nThe word 'king' instantly brought a name to Artoria's mind, \"Solomon…\"\nShe immediately thought of Damien, whom Kiritsugu had mentioned.\nOf course, she deliberately ignored a certain arrogant lamppost king.\nThat guy was far too haughty.\nArtoria had no interest in inviting him to her home.\n\"I hope I'm not late.\"\nAs Artoria reeled, Damien's figure appeared in the courtyard, unnoticed until now.\n\"Our first meeting, huh, Ahoge King?\"\nDamien took a seat facing east, closely studying Artoria's heroic demeanor.\nUpon his arrival, Irisviel and Artoria's gazes locked onto him, as if trying to see through him.\nThis is the legendary King Solomon?\nEven Irisviel, a homunculus, had to admit Damien's appearance was striking.\nHe seemed less human and more like a god walking among mortals.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

That huge barrel of fine wine probably cost a fortune.\nHe doubted Waver was the type to use magecraft for ill-gotten gains.\n\"Though it's shaped oddly, this is a traditional drinking vessel of this land.\" Iskandar said proudly, holding up a bamboo ladle.\n\"That's not a decanter; it's just a tea utensil.\" Damien corrected, familiar with its use in Japanese tea ceremonies.\n\"Is that so?\" Iskandar shrugged. \"Eh, doesn't matter. It works fine.\"\nHe scooped a ladle of wine, ready to down it.\n\"Use this.\" Damien said, handing out cups.\n\"Ho, thanks!\"\nIskandar accepted without fuss, filling a cup and draining it in one go.\n\"The legend says the Holy Grail will be granted to the worthy.\" He said solemnly, opening the discussion.\nThough rare for him to speak so seriously, it felt oddly fitting.\n\"This contest in Fuyuki is the ritual to determine the worthy.\"\n\"But choosing a candidate doesn't always require bloodshed.\"\n\"If Heroic Spirits can accept each other's 'mettle,' the answer will emerge naturally.\"\nArtoria took a cup from Damien and scooped wine from the barrel.\nDespite her petite frame raising doubts about her drinking ability, she matched Iskandar's boldness, downing it with equal gusto.\nIskandar grinned, pleased.\nBoth turned to Damien, awaiting his response.\n\"You're all drinking; if I don't, won't I look out of place?\"\nDamien had little interest in wine, but with the mood set, he joined them, downing a cup.\n\"So, you want to compare 'mettle' with us, Rider?\" Artoria asked, keeping her eyes on Damien.\nIf Iskandar was a forthright overlord, Damien was like an elegant, enigmatic saint-king.\nHis every move lacked Gilgamesh's arrogance, exuding a refreshing ease that showcased a king's magnanimity and openness.\n\"Exactly. As self-proclaimed kings, we must discuss mettle.\" Iskandar said, his gaze shifting between Damien and Artoria. \"This isn't a Holy Grail War but a Holy Grail Q&A.\"\n\"King of Knights, King of Conqueror, and… King of Magecraft.

Shion, Souei, Hoshiga, and the Ice Empress... they could deliver a lethal blow before he could react.\n\"Stand down.\" Damien commanded.\nHe hadn't forgotten Gilgamesh's insolence.\nBut responding to verbal jabs with blades would be petty.\n\"Ignorance is fearless.\" Damien said. \"I forgive your offense this time.\"\n\"But…\" His gaze turned icy. \"There won't be a next time, Gilgamesh.\"\n\"Gilgamesh?\"\n\"He said Gilgamesh?\"\n\"The ancient king of Babylon?\"\n\"No wonder!\"\n\"No wonder he has so many Noble Phantasms!\"\nDamien's revelation of Gilgamesh's identity caused his brows to twitch, while the onlookers, including Artoria and Iskandar, felt their hearts race.\n\"Hmph.\"\nGilgamesh crossed his arms, refraining from further taunts.\nDamien's strength had exceeded his expectations.\nMoreover, if Damien truly was Solomon, Gilgamesh couldn't easily mock him.\nNot because of Damien's power or the threat of Shion and the others.\nBut because the man before him had achieved the feat of dominating gods and daemons!\nWhat did Gilgamesh despise most?\nUndoubtedly, those lofty, self-righteous gods who toyed with mortals.\nCompared to himself, a mere pawn, this man could bend demon god pillars to his will.\nThat alone, king or not, earned Gilgamesh's respect.\nDivinity…\nWhen Shion, the Ice Empress, and the others appeared, Gilgamesh had sensed it.\nEach of them carried divinity.\nThis meant they were, if not gods, at least demigods, angels, or divine beasts.\n\"Alright, alright, the banquet's just started. No need to make it so tense!\" Iskandar laughed, easing the strained atmosphere.\nWaver and Irisviel, previously paralyzed by the killing intent, exhaled in relief.\nStill, they worried Gilgamesh might refuse to join.\nArtoria was ready to shield Irisviel if Gilgamesh lashed out.\nYet, events unfolded unexpectedly.\nGilgamesh took the ladle without hesitation, sniffed the wine, and ignored the cup Iskandar offered.\nThe scene reminded Irisviel of Artoria's earlier words, calling this banquet a 'challenge.'\nThe most ancient king, facing fellow kings, had no choice but to accept Iskandar's test of heroic mettle.\n\"This is low-grade swill.\" Gilgamesh sneered, scorning the wine. \"You think this can measure a hero's worth?\"\n\"Is that so?\" Iskandar countered. \"Among the wines from the local market, this is top-tier.\"\n\"You think that because you don't know true wine, lowly mongrel.\"\n\"If you say so, you must have something better.\" Damien challenged. \"Don't show it, and I'll assume you're bluffing.\"\n\"Hmph!\"\nGilgamesh disliked Damien's tone but, unusually, held back his venom.\nAs he'd reasoned, a man who commanded gods and daemons stood on his level.\nHum…\nThe space beside Gilgamesh twisted and swirled.\nWaver and Irisviel, recognizing the prelude to his Noble Phantasm barrage, felt a chill and prepared to flee.\nBut what emerged wasn't a weapon... it was a set of ornate, gem-encrusted wine vessels.\n\"Watch and learn.\" Gilgamesh declared. \"This is a king's vintage!\"\nFrom a heavy golden flask poured a clear, colorless liquid. Four golden goblets were tossed to Iskandar, who filled them and passed them to Damien and Artoria.\nDamien glanced at his ordinary cup but didn't refuse.\nWhy reject something superior?\n\"Wow, this is amazing!\" Iskandar exclaimed, eyes wide after a sip.\nDamien didn't hesitate either, curious about the wine Gilgamesh offered in the Fourth War.\n\"Hm?\"\nThe moment it touched his throat, a wave of euphoria struck him.\n\"Delicious.\"\nDamien wasn't fond of wine.\nBut this flavor was unlike anything he'd imagined... a supreme taste.\nBold yet refreshing, rich yet exhilarating.\nThe intense sensory pleasure overwhelmed his sense of smell, even dulling his sight and touch.\n\"Absolutely incredible!\" Iskandar roared. \"This wine couldn't be man-made... is it from the Age of Gods?\"\nGilgamesh smirked, pleased by the praise.\n\"Of course.\"\n\"Be it wine or swords, my treasury holds only the finest treasures.\"\n\"That alone determines a king's worth, doesn't it?\"\nAt some point, he'd sat cross-legged at the head, gently swirling his goblet.\n\"Is that so?\" Damien said, savoring the wine with a teasing tone. \"Then tell me, which falls first: a land rich with fields and grain but lacking an army to protect it, or a neighboring nation with a vast military?\"\n\"You…\" Gilgamesh's eye twitched.\nHe understood Damien's implication.\nGilgamesh had presented his wine, proving his kingly worth through wealth.\nBut Damien's retort was clear.\nWealth without the might to defend it made a king a lamb awaiting slaughter, ripe for plunder by the strong.\nIn such times, even the weak would take a bite, devouring it piece by piece.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

      "content": "\"If you desire this king's treasures, be prepared to be blasted to pieces!\"\n\"Blasted? You mean those exploding treasures of yours?\"\n\"You fellow...\"\nDamien coveted Gilgamesh's Noble Phantasms greatly, but he didn't need to resort to theft. With his analysis complete, he could acquire anything.\n\"Alright, alright, let's calm down for now.\"\nIskandar smiled wryly as he prevented Gilgamesh from retorting further.\n\"Archer, your finest wine is indeed suitable to be held in the most precious goblet. But unfortunately, the Holy Grail is not a goblet.\"\n\"This is a Holy Grail Q&A to test who is most qualified to obtain the Holy Grail. First, let's hear what great wish you have placed upon the Holy Grail; otherwise, we can't proceed.\"\n\"So, the most ancient King of Heroes, Gilgamesh.\"\n\"Why do you want to obtain the Holy Grail?\"\nHeroic Spirits are not supposed to have desires, but since they have been summoned, they must have a pursuit for the Holy Grail.\n\"Stop giving orders, mongrel.\"\n\"Moreover, the premise of 'fighting for the Holy Grail' is already against reason. To tell the truth, it originally belongs to me. Tracing back to the origin, there is nothing in the world that does not come from my treasury. Although a long time has passed, and some things may have been lost, those treasures still belong to me.\"\nThis answer made everyone curious. Even Artoria began to ask if the Holy Grail truly has the power to grant wishes.\n\"Do not judge by the standards of mongrels.\"\n\"The total number of treasures this king possesses has long exceeded what this king knows, but as long as an item is a 'treasure,' it is certain that it belongs to this king's property.\"\n\"Is that so?\"\nIskandar understood, \"A treasury that symbolizes the prototype of all treasures, that is the true nature of your Noble Phantasm. Truly worthy of the legendary King of Heroes. Taking back what originally belongs to you, this reason is perfectly legitimate.\"\nDamien didn't target Gilgamesh anymore, and his response somewhat surprised Gilgamesh.\n\"Since that's the case, you don't really need to take it too seriously, right?\"\n\"It's just a cup; for you, it shouldn't be a big deal, right?\"\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\"This king has no reason to bestow treasures upon mongrels like you.\"\n\"Eh~~\"\n\"Is the legendary King of Heroes such a miser?\"\n\"Stupid, those who should receive this king's grace are only this king's subjects and people.\"\n\"So, Rider, if you submit to this king, I can reward you with one or two cups anytime.\"\nObviously, that was impossible.\nGilgamesh's reason was simple: what is mine is mine, and if I don't give it to you, you can't take it!\nHe didn't care about the outcome of the Holy Grail War or the Grail itself. What angered Gilgamesh was that someone dared to challenge his authority and the laws he had set.\n\"In that case, next, we can only meet with swords.\"\nIn tonight's King's Q&A, Iskandar has received his answer from \"My way is to seize what I want by force, because I am Iskandar, the King of Conqueror.\"\n\"Then there's nothing more to say. You break the law, and this king will punish you. There's no room for argument.\"\nThe two could not reconcile because true kings always adhere to their own principles.\nBut that didn't mean Gilgamesh disliked Iskandar. On the contrary, they felt each other's reasons and spirit as kings.\nAt least in their identity as kings, there was no distinction of superiority or inferiority.\nIn the following Q&A, Iskandar also stated his reason for wanting the Holy Grail.\nHe wanted to obtain a physical body and then start anew to continue his journey of world conquest.\n\"Truly someone who sticks to his beliefs to the end, King of Conqueror.\"\nDamien quite liked people like Iskandar, who always stayed true to their hearts, whether in life or death.\n\"Ah.\"\nGilgamesh rarely agreed with Damien's comment, \"A boring life always needs one or two spices. I await your challenge, King of Conqueror!\"\n\"What a joke!!\"\nArtoria had been frowning, silently watching the three gradually build a relationship that was unclear whether it was hostile or friendly.\nFrom the beginning until now, the girl couldn't find any opportunity to join the discussion.\nBecause she believed that the opinions expressed by these two Heroic Spirits were far from her ideals as the King of Knights and had nothing to do with her.\n\"It's completely selfish!\"\n\"That's not the right path for a king to follow.\"\nArtoria's words finally broke the isolation.\n\"Oh?\"\nIskandar asked, \"Then, let us hear your esteemed opinion, King of Knights.\"\nWhat happened next was already known to Damien.\nArtoria expressed her lofty ideal that she had been pursuing, like a vow, \"My wish is to save my homeland!

What's so funny about my mourning that?\"\n\"No.\"\nListening to Artoria's words, Damien shook his head. \"Your thinking is somewhat presumptuous.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"Saber...\"\nDamien did not mock Artoria's ideals as Gilgamesh had.\nOn the contrary, Damien inwardly hoped that a leader would be a wise and virtuous ruler.\nBut such a thing was destined to be impossible.\n\"I want to ask you a question.\"\n\"You want to use the Holy Grail to save your nation. Then what?\"\n\"What?\"\nArtoria was stunned, not quite understanding what he meant.\n\"Is it hard to understand?\"\n\"I want to know, assuming you actually obtain the Holy Grail and have the chance to fulfill your wish, what exactly would you do?\"\n\"Would you simply say to the Holy Grail, 'Please save my nation'?\"\n\"I...\"\nArtoria was stumped by Damien's question. She hadn't truly considered how to use the wish to achieve the miracle of salvation.\nThis showed that the title of \"King of Knights\" for Artoria was indeed fitting.\nThe girl was not just a little naive.\nDespite being so fixated on the Holy Grail War, she hadn't even thought through her wish.\nGilgamesh had no wish.\nHe participated in the war because every Heroic Spirit vying for the Holy Grail was a challenger coveting his treasures.\nKilling and punishing them all was, to Gilgamesh, only natural.\nIskandar wanted to continue conquering battlefields, needing a physical body to live freely in a new world and era.\nArtoria had a wish, but did she really know how to use the Holy Grail to achieve her goal?\n\"You can think about this question slowly.\"\n\"Now, let's assume your wish comes true, and your nation is saved.\"\n\"Then what?\"\nOnce again, \"then what.\" And once again, Artoria looked utterly bewildered.\nWhat then?\nThen what?\n\"I mean, if the nation is back on track, what about you?\"\n\"I...\"\nGoodness, Damien's question caught Artoria completely off guard.\nTo be honest, Artoria had never thought that far.\nAnd according to Damien, if the nation was saved, what use would she, as a king, have?\n\"If the nation no longer needs me, where should I go?\"\nThat was the question.\nWhen Artoria was alive, to become the King of Knights that everyone admired, she lived like a saint, selfless and diligent.\nSo, Artoria had never considered what she would do if she were no longer a king.\nTo be honest, having lived her entire life for others, did she even have a dream of her own?\n\"If the Holy Grail saves your nation, what about you?\"\n\"Would you continue being the King of Knights of Great Britain, waiting for the nation to fall again under your rule?\"\n\"What?! You...\"\nArtoria was startled.\nAt the same time, she realized something.\nThe Holy Grail saving her nation didn't mean everything was over.\nHistory had already proven that she was not suited to be the King of Knights... at least, Artoria herself believed so.\nBritain fell under her rule.\nEven if the Holy Grail saved it once, what about the next time?\n\"When the nation falls again, will you seek the Holy Grail once more, repeating the cycle?\"\n\"What difference is there between such a nation and a puppet of the Holy Grail?\"\nDamien pointed at Iskandar. \"You mocked Iskandar for pursuing the Holy Grail out of personal desire.\"\n\"But at least he knows that conquest brought by a mere cup is meaningless!\"\n\"The same applies to your nation.\"\n\"If the nation's survival depends not on the collective efforts of its people but on wishing upon a cup, what meaning does it have?\"\n\"...\"\nDamien's words were calm, but Artoria felt a chill in her heart.\nIndeed, a salvation brought by wishing upon the Holy Grail... wasn't it the same as Iskandar's wish for \"world conquest\"?\n\"If that's the case!\"\nArtoria steadied herself and retorted, \"Then choose a different king!\"\nBeing a king meant nothing to Artoria.\nAs long as she could save her people and her nation, what did it matter if she wasn't king, or if she never drew the Sword in the Stone?\n\"Choose a different king, huh...\"\n\"That's a possible method.\"\n\"But...\"\n\"Saber, don't you think your wish is a bit too cruel?\"\n\"What?\"\nArtoria didn't understand what Damien meant.\nWhy call her cruel?\n\"Isn't it cruel?\"\n\"You made a wish for Great Britain to select a king greater than you.\"\n\"Here's the question: why would you impose something even you couldn't achieve on someone else?\"\n\"By your logic, a king should be noble, just, kind, tolerant, and benevolent, like a perfect saint.\"\nDamien looked at Gilgamesh and Iskandar, both shaking their heads, and said gravely, \"If such a person truly exists, fine.\"\n\"But if this is imposed on someone because of your wish...\"\n\"Isn't that cruel?\"\n\"You, Artoria Pendragon, for your own selfish desire, would turn another person into a soulless husk called a 'holy king'!\"\n\"They could have enjoyed fine wine and food, had a fulfilling family life.\"\n\"But because of your wish, you'd strip them of their happiness and life!\"\n\"I... I didn't mean that!\"\nArtoria was shaken by Damien's words. She understood the principle of not imposing on others what she wouldn't want for herself.\nAnd given her character, she could never do such a thing.\nShe only thought she wasn't a qualified king and wanted someone better to take her place.\n\"But what if the new king is like the King of Heroes or the King of Conqueror?\"\n\"What if the new king, whom you despise and cannot understand, is the one who can save Great Britain?

King...\"\nDamien's identity and origins were beyond anyone's imagination.\nThough the summoning of Hero heroic Spirits by the Holy Grail was already miraculous enough.\nEven Irisviel and Waver had heard that the Holy Grail could summon Heroic Spirits from the future.\nBut another world?\nThat was just too bizarre, wasn't it?\n\"A king from another world?\"\nIskandar rubbed his chin. \"No matter what, as long as you're a king, that's fine by me.\"\n\"Another world, how interesting!\"\nGilgamesh, too, acknowledged Damien's identity as a king.\n\"I don't need your acknowledgment.\"\n\"Unlike you, with your one or two treasuries or ruling over a mere region...\"\n\"What I possess is a gift box called a 'world'!\"\nDamien's words stunned the group, even Gilgamesh and Iskandar, who he had mocked, showed expressions of disbelief.\n\"This world!\"\n\"The very planet you stand on, the entire space-time and universe it resides in!\"\n\"To me, they are all treasure chests waiting to be opened.\"\n\"Traveling through countless worlds, conquering, plundering, dominating, ruling!\"\nDamien clenched his fist tightly, revealing his ambitions and desires to everyone. \"An unyielding Creator?

Apart from that Saber girl, you two are undoubtedly kings with sufficient caliber.\"\n\"Hey! Rider!\"\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"\nArtoria, repeatedly belittled, was itching to draw her sword and cut down the three infuriating figures before her.\n\"Calm down, Saber.\"\n\"If, after hearing what I say next, you still want to fight us, I don't mind kicking you out of the game first.\"\n\"You...\"\nIgnoring Artoria's darkened expression, Damien continued, \"Here and now, King of Conqueror, in the name of the Demon King, I formally declare war on you!\"\n\"Declare war?!\"\nWaver's heart nearly skipped a beat at Damien's words.\n\"This is a clash between kings.\"\n\"Gilgamesh, Artoria.\"\n\"I also invite you to witness my duel with the King of Conqueror!\"\nYes, Damien's primary target was Iskandar.\nNoble Phantasms were, at best, a means to grant Damien greater power.\nBut powerful methods? Damien had no shortage of those.\nWhat he truly needed was a way to bypass the familiar contract and bring people back to his Cardinal World!\nThrough his recent research on Time Alter, Violet had given him good news.\nA Reality Marble did indeed have the potential to transport others.\n\"And the prerequisite for all this is awakening my own Reality Marble!\"\nDamien was highly confident in awakening his own Reality Marble.\n\"You're planning to go that far?\"\nIskandar's expression grew serious. Truthfully, he had no reason to refuse.\nIn fact, Iskandar was thrilled, so thrilled he wanted to laugh.\n\"A war between kings... it's been a while.\"\nAnd if Iskandar's guess was correct, Damien likely possessed abilities similar to his own.\nHis Ionioi Hetairoi and Damien's army of Majins.\n\"Hahaha!\"\nIskandar let out a hearty laugh. \"Fine! I accept your challenge!\"\nAs his words fell, Iskandar shot a glance at Gilgamesh, his look practically saying, \"See that, Goldie? He chose to challenge me first, not you!\"\n\"Tch!\"\nGilgamesh glared at Damien, irritated. This damned guy dared to humiliate him to this extent!\n\"I'm starting to really want to crush you...\"\n\"And your answer, Gilgamesh?\"\nDamien's invitation was, in a sense, a call for the two to take a stance.\nWould they refrain from interfering in this war and stand by as spectators, waiting for one side to fall?\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

I'm worried about you, you jerk!!\"\nThe atmosphere gradually fell silent again.\nIskandar didn't immediately explain.\nThe red-haired giant drove the thunderous chariot through the deserted night.\n\"That guy is strong, completely different from any opponent I've faced before.\"\nIskandar was quiet for a moment before smiling. \"It's great to be part of the Holy Grail War.\"\n\"What?\"\nWaver was utterly confused by Iskandar's sudden shift. \"What are you even talking about?\"\nIn life, Iskandar led his army from Macedon, conquering every nation in his path without lingering over the territories.\nHe pressed eastward, driven by the desire to reach the \"end of the world\" And see the legendary \"Ocean at the World's End.\"\nSadly, Iskandar never fulfilled that dream.\nHe collapsed from exhaustion before reaching it.\nNot long after, the historical King of Conqueror, Alexander the Great, passed away.\n\"I never saw the Ocean at the World's End, nor reached the world's boundary.\"\nIskandar shed his usual carefree demeanor, now resembling a true king.\nDamien's image appeared in his mind.\nSailing across endless seas, landing on islands called worlds, witnessing, conquering, leading, and then moving forward without attachment until the true end.\n\"...\"\n\"If you can obtain the Holy Grail, you can surely fulfill your wish.\"\nWaver had no wishes of his own, so he could let Iskandar use the wish to gain a physical body. \"You said it, right?

      "content": "\"You, kid...\"\nIskandar shook his head, knowing Waver hadn't grasped his true intentions.\nHe wasn't lamenting.\nA true king never regrets.\nOr rather, if he had reached the world's end before his death, Iskandar would have been left with endless regret.\nBecause that would mean his journey had reached its end.\nNot because he didn't want to go forward, but because he couldn't.\nFor a conqueror, an explorer, a life without further adventure is dull.\nReaching the world's end, returning home, and watching himself grow old... such an ending was the sorrow Iskandar could not accept.\nA great man should die on the battlefield, not in a bed!\nThe moment Damien declared war on him, Iskandar knew he had met a kindred spirit.\nOne conqueror had encountered another.\nRegardless of victory or defeat, their adventure would reach a fulfilling conclusion.\nThe loser would become a trophy of the victor.\nAnd the victor would carry the loser's ambitions, witnessing broader horizons.\n\"Rider?\"\n\"Hm?\"\n\"Will you win?\"\nWaver vaguely understood Iskandar, grasping the true desire behind his summoning as a Heroic Spirit.\n\"Nah.\"\nIskandar flicked the reins, charging forward with thundering might. \"I'd win!\"\nLeaving the confident Iskandar aside, Damien had returned to Ryudou Temple.\nHe first checked on Sakura's condition and, learning from Shuna that the girl was recovering well, felt reassured.\n\"Lord Damien.\"\nIn the Cardinal World, within the village, Damien withdrew his consciousness from the Heroic Spirit.\nHe gathered the participating goblins, wolves, and kijin, selecting the pre-positioned team leaders to discuss tomorrow's war.\n\"This war will be led by Violet as the overall commander.\"\n\"Snow Empress, Ogerpon.\"\nDamien instructed, \"You two may participate, but don't display excessive strength.\"\n\"Bo-ne!\"\n\"I know my limits.\"\nThe two women were Damien's strongest trump cards, too valuable to use against Iskandar.\nIn terms of combat power, Snow Empress alone could, like Gilgamesh in the anime, shatter Iskandar's Reality Marble with a single world-breaking Noble Phantasm.\nBut such an act would be meaningless to Damien.\nHe sought not just victory but to analyze Iskandar's Ionioi Hetairoi as thoroughly as possible.\nThat was why he had assembled a massive army of Majins.\nThis battle was critical.\n\"This battle is of utmost importance.\"\nDamien said, \"I expect you to deliver a performance that truly shines.\"\nHis words ignited a surge of passion among the Majins.\nThey weren't here to make up numbers.\nThey were vital forces!\n\"We will do our utmost to create analysis opportunities for Lady Violet!\"\nSeeing their determined expressions, Damien was satisfied. \"Then it's up to you. Let the Heroic Spirits of this world feel the power of our Majins.\"\nTime passed quickly, from sunrise to sunset, and soon it was the next night.\nThe crimson steel bridge spanned the riverbanks.\nUnder the lights, Artoria, who arrived early, and Irisviel, disguised as her Master, watched Damien, who was meditating with closed eyes, with tension.\n\"Lancer!\"\n\"Please don't worry, Master.\"\nThe battle was known not only to Saber and Gilgamesh but also to Lancer.\n\"You came too, Lancer.\"\n\"Ah, I hope my uninvited presence isn't rude.\"\n\"But such a grand event... I couldn't resist coming to witness it myself.\"\n\"May I have the honor of observing?\"\n\"You may.\"\nDamien opened his eyes, casually granting Diarmuid's request.\n\"Thank you.\"\nDiarmuid nodded slightly, then stood beside Artoria.\nThis scene made Sola-Ui, Diarmuid's new Master and Kayneth's fiancée, feel a pang of jealousy.\nEnchanted by Diarmuid's charm curse, she felt a sense of crisis toward any woman near her Servant.\nThe reason Sola-Ui wasn't left at the hotel was simple.\nNo place was safer than by Diarmuid's side.\nRather than hiding her somewhere, it was better to keep her close.\nHaving made one mistake before, Diarmuid wouldn't make it again!\n\"Lancer...\"\n\"Sorry.\"\nDiarmuid was helpless; this was the curse that plagued him.\nHe truly had no intention of pursuing his lord's woman.\nTap! Tap! Tap!\nSuddenly, approaching footsteps interrupted their conversation.\nThey turned to see Gilgamesh, clad in golden armor, striding slowly toward them.\n\"What?\"\n\"He hasn't shown up yet?\"\n\"Tch!\"\nGilgamesh grumbled, \"Making this king wait... such a crime deserves death!\"\n\"He's here.\"\nSoon, Iskandar descended from the sky on his Gordius Wheel, like a bolt of lightning crashing onto the bridge.\n\"You're already here?\"\n\"I was delayed slightly by some matters.\"\n\"No matter.\"\nDamien looked up, meeting the eyes of Iskandar and a noticeably changed Waver.\nClearly, they had undergone some personal journey of their own.\n\"So, have you said all your last words?\"\n\"If not, I don't mind giving you more time to settle your affairs.\"\n\"Pretty sharp, aren't you?\"\n\"You're actually upset, aren't you?\"\n\"Come on, don't be so petty. Even kings have their inconvenient moments.\"\nIskandar's goofy demeanor was, in truth, a tactic to provoke Damien's emotions.\nUnfortunately, he miscalculated.\nNot to mention Damien had Violet's support.\nEven on his own, he wouldn't lose his temper over something so trivial, unlike Gilgamesh.\n\"Enough, King of Conqueror.\"\nDamien said calmly, \"Let's begin our war.\"\n\"...\"\nSeeing his little trick noticed, Iskandar dropped the act.\n\"Phew~~~\"\nSuddenly, those standing on the bridge felt a whirlwind rushing toward them.\nIt was a scorching, dry gust of heat.\nGradually, whether it was an illusion or not, they seemed to hear the roaring wind sweeping through a blazing desert.\n\"Hm?\"\nWaver felt gritty sand on his tongue and spat a few times.\n\"Sand?\"\n\"Why?\"\nDiarmuid, puzzled, instinctively shielded his Master, as did Artoria.\nThe strange wind carried hot sand that shouldn't exist here.\nAll eyes turned to Iskandar.\nThe mana emanating from him was surging.\nClearly, this phenomenon was his doing.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Artoria, Gilgamesh, and the others... were isolated on a towering sand dune outside the battlefield.\nThe vantage point was perfect, offering a clear view of the entire battlefield.\nHeroic Spirits with keen eyesight could see the upcoming battle in vivid detail.\n\"Hey, hey, hey.\"\nDiarmuid's eyes widened in disbelief. \"Are you kidding me?\"\n\"This kind of thing...\"\nArtoria stared intently at the mirage-like shadows appearing around Iskandar.\nThere wasn't just one shadow... two, four...\nThe hazy figures of mounted warriors multiplied, forming ranks.\nThe shadows gradually took on color and depth.\n\"This world, this landscape, can take form because it comes from the collective mental image of us all.\"\nUnder the astonished gazes of the onlookers, the cavalry materialized one by one beside Iskandar.\nThough their races and equipment varied, their physiques were robust, their gleaming armor adorned with heroic splendor, each vying to outshine the others in magnificence and strength.\nWithout exception, every one of them was a Servant!\n\"All of them?!\"\nDiarmuid looked at Sola-Ui, incredulous at her observation.\nHe considered himself formidable, a legendary hero.\nBut...\nThe number of Servants before him was beyond counting.\nNo matter how skilled Diarmuid was, how many could he face?\nA few dozen?\nA hundred?\nAgainst such an army, the only outcome for Diarmuid would be utter annihilation!\n\"Behold, this is my unparalleled army!\"\nIskandar raised his arms, his voice brimming with pride as he boasted of the assembled cavalry.\n\"These are heroes whose bodies have perished, whose souls were summoned by the world as Heroic Spirits, yet still pledge their loyalty to me.\"\n\"They answer my call across time and space, my eternal comrades.\"\n\"The bond with them is my greatest treasure!

so, Ranga remained the foremost of the Eighteen Wolf Guards, with the highest potential in the clan.\n\"Koriga!\"\n\"I'm here to aid you!!\"\nA pair of sky-blue wings sprouted from Ranga's back, carrying it and its flight-aligned kin soaring into the heavens.\n\"You're not the only one who can fly, Ranga!\"\nFollowing Ranga were the wolves led by Dragonfang.\nWhether beast-eared girls or werewolves, their bodies were covered in glistening dragon scales.\nMoreover, they inherited dragon power from Damien, able to summon dragon wings and claws in battle, granting them formidable aerial combat abilities.\n\"Moo~~\"\n\"Woo~~\"\nAlongside the bulls' roars, Ranga's howl resounded.\nIn that moment, gales and thunder clashed, turning the sky within the Reality Marble into an apocalyptic thunderstorm.\n\"Gulp!\"\nWaver, standing with Iskandar, swallowed hard.\nEven from this distance, he could feel the stray winds and lightning, a testament to the intensity of the clash.\nBang!\nBut

terrifying mana shockwave through the air, producing a piercing sonic boom.\nThe immense strength from Honooga's massive size was not something a mere human could withstand.\nEven a warrior like Hephaestion, facing such an onslaught, was pushed back, sliding across the desert-magma ground, carving two deep trenches.\n\"Ah!!!\"\nThe blond warrior roared, veins bulging on his arms, forcibly halting his retreat against Honooga's claw.\n\"Impressive, Heroic Spirit from another world!\"\nHonooga praised the man who, like an ant shaking a tree, managed to block its strike.\n\"How about this?\"\nMassive fireballs coalesced in the air behind Honooga, crashing forward like meteors.\n\"Still not enough!\"\nHephaestion leaped, his spear dancing, shattering the boulders laced with lava and flames.\nBoom~~\nAs the two fought, dozens of fire wolves and werewolves charged into Hephaestion's formation.\nIn an instant, the formation melted like butter under a hot knife, penetrated deeply.\nBut that was as far as they got.\nHundreds, thousands of C-rank Heroic Spirits against dozens of B+ rank fighters might falter initially.\nBut the wolves' mana was limited, and they would eventually be worn down by the relentless Heroic Spirit legion.\n\"Hold fast!\"\n\"Do not fear!\"\n\"Our king is watching us!!\"\nThe commanding voice came from a man with long black hair, dressed in a black court robe, exuding the stern authority of a judge.\nEumenes, the royal secretary.\nAfter Alexander's death, he rose quickly in the Diadochi conflicts, defending the Argead dynasty's legitimacy.\nThough a scholar, his intellect and command rivaled any, ultimately becoming the appointed commander of Asia Minor.\n\"Ha!!\"\nShields stacked before the soldiers, forming a flawless phalanx that linked mana into an invisible bounded field, blocking the falling fire rain and flames.\nWhat followed were hundreds, thousands of spears.\n\"Annoying!\"\nFire-aligned wolves leaped, crashing onto the bounded field, leaving only cracks, unable to advance further.\n\"Such a tough formation.\"\nFacing the wolves' breakthrough, Iskandar's side responded immediately.\nThey shielded their main forces within, while the outer layer consisted of shield-and-spear formations.\nWith mana flowing through, their durability far exceeded the wolves' expectations.\nUnlike in the original story against Assassin, this was a clash of armies, and the Heroic Spirit legion displayed the discipline they had in life.\nDifferent units coordinated, countering various environments and enemies.\nDamien's side was no less formidable.\nThe Majins didn't understand formation tactics.\nWhat they had was sheer power, charging with overwhelming force.\nTowering werewolves were the first to engage, their massive bodies easily breaking gaps in the opposing shield formations with a single charge.\nPfft, pfft, pfft!\nYet Iskandar's army, heedless of casualties, charged relentlessly at the fearsome beasts.\nTheir spears struck... some shattered by wolf claws, others unable to pierce their defenses.\nBut!\nA portion, after depleting the wolves' mana shields, tore through flesh, piercing their bodies.\n\"Roar~~~\"\nThe intense pain brought not retreat or panic but fury and even more savage slaughter.\nBoom!!\nA fire-wreathed werewolf's heart was pierced.\nYet in the next moment, dazzling flames erupted from its body, instantly engulfing enemies within a hundred-meter radius in a blazing inferno.\nThis wasn't an isolated case but a common sight across the battlefield.\nBe it werewolves or giant wolves, they fought like monsters oblivious to death.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power

It's Lady Snow Empress!\"\n\"What did you say, Lady Snow Empress?\"\n\"Don't disturb him... he's still fighting the enemy.\"\nSnow Empress ordered the crowd to disperse, then looked at the small figure still seated.\nAs the village's overseer of Majins, Snow Empress had shifted from her icy demeanor in the far north, now focusing on unlocking their potential and talents.\nThis battle was meant to temper the Majins.\nIn such training, some were bound to stand out.\n\"Let's see which goblins can hold their ground against the Heroic Spirits' onslaught.\"\nAs the crowd parted, Snow Empress scanned them, spotting several she had already considered promising.\nShe didn't underestimate the goblins.\nThe Cardinal World's magical beings had an evolution mechanism.\nEven the weakest goblin, with enough potential, could grow to the level of a Demon Lord Seed.\nSnow Empress had few hobbies.\nOne was helping Damien unearth talent.\nIt was like sculpting ice, revealing dazzling brilliance through careful crafting.\nThis was a rare pastime Snow Empress had found to pass the time.\n\"Uh...\"\nBut when she saw Gobta, even the usually composed Snow Empress faltered.\n\"This one...\"\nSnow Empress scrutinized Gobta. \"Are you sure he's a Hobgoblin?\"\nHobgoblins and regular goblins were vastly different.\nThe latter were deformed little monsters.\nHobgoblins, however, were barely distinguishable from humans.\nThe females, aside from slightly green skin, were nearly identical to humans.\nBut this one...\nHow to put it?\nSnow Empress could only say he had the classic goblin look, with a foolish expression.\n\"This...\"\nSnow Empress decided her standards for nurturing talent might need to be raised.\nShe didn't want one of her \"works\" To be such an outlier in the future.\n\"No wonder you were skeptical.\"\nSnow Empress nodded inwardly, understanding. \"Alright, don't disturb the meditating goblins. Let them keep fighting.\"\n\"Yes!\"\n\"Understood, Lady Snow Empress.\"\nFollowing her orders, the goblins instinctively shielded their still-fighting kin.\nMeanwhile, those who had left the battlefield looked up.\nThey watched the projection, where the battle had reached its final stage.\nThe shattered earth, deserts crystallized by heat, and countless elite Heroic Spirits bound by spatial threads.\nThe 20,000-strong army had crushed the 5,000 goblins.\nWithout a moment to mourn the goblins' deaths, nearly a hundred kijin elites rushed to the battlefield.\nInitially, Iskandar thought the kijin were merely B+ rank Servants like the wolves.\nOnly a few, like Shion, reached or surpassed A-rank.\nBut reality was far crueler than he imagined.\nEach of the hundred kijin was equivalent to an A-rank Heroic Spirit.\nAmong them were powerhouses rivaling Shion and Souei.\nTake Hakurou, for instance... his strength was on par with Souei's.\nOnly due to Damien's appointment did he act discreetly as part of the Shadow Squad.\nIf singled out, at least fifty top-tier warriors could be found among the two hundred kijin.\nAnd so...\nWithout suspense, the 20,000 Heroic Spirit legion was slaughtered by a mere hundred.\n\"Monsters...\"\nIskandar and Waver were unharmed.\nDue to Damien's orders, the kijin deliberately spared them, allowing their passage.\nWaver stared blankly at the kijin.\nIn that moment, their displayed power shattered his understanding of Heroic Spirits.\nToo strong... unimaginably so.\nIt was hard to fathom that there were a hundred such terrifying beings.\nAnd Damien, commanding such a force, seemed like an insurmountable chasm between the Masters and the Holy Grail.\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

Are you hurt?\"\n\"Don't worry, Sakura.\"\n\"I'm fine. Iskandar was no match for me.\"\nDamien had left twenty kijin at Ryudou Temple. With Gilgamesh and the other Heroic Spirits present, he wasn't worried about Assassin's sneak attacks.\nHassan of the Hundred Faces lacked the ability to breach the kijin's defenses and harm Sakura.\n\"You saw it, didn't you?\"\nDamien's battle with Iskandar had been projected to Sakura and the kijin here.\n\"Mm!\"\nSakura said, \"Onii-san is amazing, and everyone else is super, super amazing!\"\nAt five or six years old, the little girl didn't know fancy compliments.\n\"Amazing\" and \"super amazing\" were her highest praise.\n\"Of course, I'm the one who's going to dominate the Holy Grail War.\"\nDamien scooped Sakura up and headed to his room.\nHe didn't set her down, letting her play in his arms while he focused inward, sensing the new power gained from Iskandar.\nReality Marble.\nDamien was filled with anticipation. \"Let's see how much of a surprise you can bring me.\"\n\"Violet!\"\n[Here.]\n\"The essence of the Reality Marble... have you analyzed it?\"\n[Fully analyzed.]\nViolet reported her findings to Damien. \"I've integrated this power into your Spirit Space, linking it with the Gate of the Void.\"\n\"And the result?\"\n\"I've successfully bypassed the rule barriers between the Cardinal World and other worlds.\"\nViolet's news resolved one of Damien's biggest headaches.\nPreviously, he couldn't bring beings from other worlds to the Cardinal World, except through familiar contracts.\nLikewise, non-familiar beings from the Cardinal World couldn't enter other worlds.\nBut now, things were different.\nThe Reality Marble, analyzed from Iskandar, became a privileged channel bypassing these restrictions.\nIf different worlds were islands, Damien's Reality Marble was a stealth ship that could deceive any world's defenses.\nTake Sakura, for example.\nIf Damien placed her in his Reality Marble before crossing, he could bring her to the Cardinal World.\n\"Can I take Sakura out?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Theoretically, the Cardinal World's purity is so high that Sakura's physical condition would be crushed by its gravity alone.\"\n\"Theoretically?\"\n\"Indeed.\"\nViolet's voice carried a hint of pride. \"There's a lot of room to maneuver here.\"\nViolet wasn't the Cardinal World's sole will.\nBut just as she'd bent the rules for Damien's naming, she could issue an \"identity pass\" for outsiders like Sakura.\n\"What kind of pass?\"\n\"A reincarnator!\"\n\"Hoho!\"\nDamien teased, \"Nice one, Violet, playing it like that?\"\nBeing recognized as a reincarnator by the Cardinal World meant a lot, no explanation needed.\nThe Voice of the World would grant Sakura Magicule based on her soul's quality.\nWith some luck, she might even gain a unique skill.\n\"In that case, couldn't I bring a whole group back and get a ton of unique skills?\"\n\"Not that simple.\"\nViolet doused his enthusiasm. \"Not everyone can withstand Magicule transformation.\"\n\"If their soul quality is lacking, forget unique skills... they might not even survive.\"\nThus, if Damien wanted to bring others back, he'd need to choose those with sufficient qualifications.\nHere, qualifications didn't mean talent or strength but their \"weight\" in their own world.\n\"Weight?\"\n\"Think of it as a character's importance.\"\n\"Like protagonists, supporting characters, villains, sidekicks, or extras?\"\nDamien felt this resembled the concept of \"children of destiny\" in some novels.\n\"Exactly.\"\nViolet said, \"The Cardinal World will grant Sakura gifts from the Nasuverse based on her weight.\"\nIn other words, it was like diplomatic relations between nations.\nThe Nasuverse sent Sakura as a guest to the Cardinal World, which would offer hospitality matching her status.\nThis was the benchmark for how much those Damien smuggled could gain in the Cardinal World.\nThe more important the character, the more favor they'd receive from the Voice of the World.\nIn a way, acquiring talent was a form of rule-plundering for the Cardinal World.\nViolet had used this logic to convince the Cardinal World.\nAfter all, who'd refuse free benefits?\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",

World peace?\nTo Artoria, Kiritsugu was just a scumbag lost in his own delusions.\n\"I'm going to bring Irisviel back!\"\nArtoria prepared to head to Ryudou Temple to formally request Damien return Irisviel.\nDamien was powerful.\nBut he was also a king with his own sense of honor.\nIf possible, Artoria hoped Damien could find a way to prevent Irisviel's death.\nFor that, she was willing to pay a price.\n\"By the power of the Command Spell, Saber... \"\nSwish!\nBefore Kiritsugu could continue, Artoria's blade was at his throat.\n\"Don't stop me, Kiritsugu.\"\nArtoria saw through him. \"Or when your Command Spells run out, I'll kill you!\"\nWhat Holy Grail War?\nWhat Master and Servant?\nIf she couldn't protect someone dear to her, what was the point of her wish to save her people?\nShe would bring Irisviel back.\nEven if it meant risking death.\n\"...\"\nWatching Saber leave, Kiritsugu's face darkened.\nHe deeply regretted summoning Saber.\nAny Heroic Spirit with better compatibility would have spared him this trouble.\nPer Kiritsugu's plan, with the situation as it was, they should stay on the sidelines, waiting for Damien and Gilgamesh to settle their duel.\nHeroic Spirits' mana and Noble Phantasms were finite.\nNo matter who won, the survivor would be greatly weakened.\nThen, Saber could strike, giving him a chance at the Holy Grail.\nUnfortunately, Saber despised such schemes.\nMeanwhile, at Ryudou Temple, Damien looked at the white-haired woman Snow Empress brought back, surprised.\n\"What's this?\"\nDamien asked, \"What happened?\"\n\"My trophy.\"\nSnow Empress recounted the events exactly as they unfolded.\n\"So, you were upset about Saber's sudden retreat.\"\n\"And kept Irisviel as retaliation?\"\nDamien scratched his head awkwardly. \"I'm not blaming you, but what do we do with her?\"\nKilling her was out of the question.\nLocking her up?\nDamien wasn't so crude as to treat a woman that way.\n\"Forget it.\"\n\"Find a room, assign two kijin, and take good care of her.\"\n***\nBonus Chapter:\n100 Power Stones = 1 BC\n300 Power Stones = 2 BC\n500 Power Stones = 3 BC\n700 Power Stones = 4 BC\n1000 Power Stones = 5 BC\n***\nIf you want to read up to 50 chapters ahead, don't hesitate to visit our patron: pat reon . com / XElenea (remove space)",
