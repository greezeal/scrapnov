      "content": "\"Fang Yuan, quietly hand over the Spring Autumn Cicada and I'll give you a quick death!\"\n\"Old bastard Fang, stop attempting to resist anymore, today all of the major factions of justice have combined together just to destroy your devil lair. This place is already covered in inescapable nets, this time you will definitely be decapitated!\"\n\"Fang Yuan you damn demon, just because you wanted to cultivate the Spring Autumn Cicada, you've gone and killed thousands of people. You've committed too many unforgivable, heinous sins!\"\n\"Demon, 300 years ago you insulted me, took away my body's purity, killed my entire family and executed my nine generations. From that moment onwards, I hated you with a burning passion! Today, I want you to die!\"\n...\nFang Yuan was in deep green robes that had been torn to shreds. His hair was disheveled and his entire body was covered in blood. He looked around.\nThe bloody robes waved lightly in the mountain breeze like a war flag.\nFresh blood flowed from the numerous wounds on the body. Just by standing there for a short while, Fang Yuan had already accumulated a large pool of blood beneath his feet.\nEnemies surrounded him all around; there was already no way out.\nIt was a foregone conclusion that he would die here.\nFang Yuan understood his situation clearly, but even in the face of death his expression did not change, it was calm.\nHis gaze was limpid, his eyes like deep pools of water in a well, so deep that there seemed to be no end.\nThe major factions of justice that had surrounded him were not just the experienced elders, but also young and talented heroes. Around the heavily surrounded Fang Yuan, some were roaring, some were sneering; there were eyes that were gleaming with light, some holding onto their wounds while looking on fearfully.\nThey did not move; everyone was wary of Fang Yuan's final attack.\nFor six hours, this tense moment went on until the evening came, the sun casting its rays upon the side of the mountain. In that moment, it was as if the place was on fire.\nFang Yuan, who had been silent as a sculpture the entire time, slowly turned his body.\nThe group of warriors was suddenly alerted and they all took a big step backwards.\nBy now the gray mountain rock beneath Fang Yuan's feet had long been stained a deep red. Due to the massive loss of blood, his face had become deathly pale; in the afterglow of the sunset, it suddenly had a brilliant luster upon it.\nLooking at the setting sun, Fang Yuan lightly laughed. \"The sun sets above the blue mountain, the autumn moon with the wind of spring. The morning is fine like hair and night is like snow, whether you succeed or fail when you look back there's nothing left.\"\nAs he said this, memories of his previous life on Earth emerged before his eyes.\nHe was originally a Chinese scholar on Earth who chanced upon this world. He endured a hard life for 300 years and went through another 200 years; over 500 years of his life flew by in the blink of an eye.\nSo many memories that were buried deep inside the heart begun to relive themselves, sprouting into life before his eyes.\n\"I failed in the end.\" Fang Yuan sighed in his heart emotionally, yet there were no regrets.\nThis end result was something he had foreseen. When he made his decision in the beginning, he had prepared himself for this.\nTo be a demon is to be merciless and cruel, a murderer and destroyer. There is no place in heaven or earth for such a thing—turning into an enemy to the world, still having to face the consequences.\n\"If the Spring Autumn Cicada that I have just cultivated is effective, I shall still be a demon in my next life!\" With this thought, Fang Yuan couldn't help but let out a laugh.\n\"Wicked demon, what are you laughing about?\"\n\"Be careful everyone, the demon is going to attack before his final moments!\"\n\"Hurry up and surrender the Spring Autumn Cicada!!\"\nThe group of warlords surged forward; at this moment, with a loud bang, Fang Yuan was engulfed in a blinding surge of energy.\n...\nThe spring rain quietly rained down on Qing Mao Mountain.\nIt was already late in the night, a slight breeze blowing with the light rain.\nYet Qing Mao Mountain was not covered in darkness; from the side down to the foot of the mountain, dozens of tiny lights shone like a bright band.\nThese lights shone from tall buildings, even though it could not be said to match up to ten thousand lights, yet it was still a few thousand in number.\nSituated on the mountain was Gu Yue1 Village, giving the vast lonely mountain a rich touch of human civilization.\nIn the middle of the Gu Yue Village was a magnificent pavilion. A grand ceremony was being held at this moment, and the lights were even brighter than ever, radiating with glory.\n\"Ancestors, please bless us! We pray that this ceremony will bring many young men of outstanding talent and intelligence, bringing their families new blood and hopes!\" The head of the Gu Yue clan had a middle-aged appearance, his sideburns were graying and he was clothed in ceremonial white robes, kneeling on the brownish yellow floor.\nHis body was straight with his hands held together, eyes tightly shut as he prayed sincerely.\nHe was facing a tall black case; there were three layers on the case, all housing memorial tablets of ancestors. On both sides of the tablets was copper incense, the smoke rising.\nBehind him were over 10 people kneeling in a similar fashion as him. They wore loose white ceremonial garments, and were all the clan's elders, important members, and those who had much authority.\nAfter the prayers, the Gu Yue clan head bent his waist with his two hands pressing against the floor and kowtowed. As his forehead struck the brownish yellow floor, light thuds could be heard.\nBehind him, the elders and important clan members solemnly and quietly followed suit.\nWith this, the hall was filled with light thuds as the heads knocked against the floor.\nWhen the ceremony was over, the crowd of people slowly got up from the ground and silently walked out of the sacred temple.\nIn the hallway, sighs of relief were heard from the crowd of elders and the atmosphere loosened up. The noise of discussion slowly rose.\n\"Time flies too quickly, in the blink of an eye, a year has gone by.\"\n\"The previous ceremony feels like it just happened yesterday, I can still recall it vividly.\"\n\"Tomorrow is the beginning of the annual grand ceremony, I wonder what new blood will show up this year for the clan?\"\n\"Ah, I hope that some highly talented youths will appear. The Gu Yue clan hasn't seen a genius emerge for three years now.\"\n\"Agreed. The Bai Village, Xiong Village these few years all had some talented geniuses appear. Especially that Bai Ning Bing from the Bai clan, his natural talent is quite terrifying.\"\nIt was unclear who had brought up the name Bai Ning Bing, but the faces of the elders started to show worry.\nThe boy's qualifications were splendid; in just a short period of two years worth of training, he had already reached the level of a level three Gu Master.\nAmong the younger generation, he could be said to be the most outstanding one. It was to the point that even the older generation could feel pressured from the promising youth.\nIn time, he would inevitably become the pillar of the Bai clan. At the very least he would also be an independently strong warrior. No one ever doubted this fact.\n\"But for this year's youths that will be participating in the ceremony, not all hope is lost.\"\n\"You're right, Fang Zhi's side has appeared a young genius. Able to start talking after three months, able to walk after four. At five years of age he was able to recite poetry, seems exceptionally intelligent, especially talented. What a pity that his parents died early, now he is being raised by his uncle and aunt.\"\n\"Yes, this one has wisdom at a young age, also harboring big ambitions. In recent years I have heard his creations 'Jiang Jing Jiu', 'Yong Mei' and 'Jiang Cheng Zi', what a genius!\"\nThe Gu Yue clan head was the last to walk out of the ancestral temple. After slowly closing the door, he heard the discussions that were going on in the corridor among the clan elders.\nHe knew at once that the elders were discussing about the youth known as Gu Yue Fang Yuan at that moment.\nAs the head of the clan, it is natural to pay attention to the outstanding and prominent young ones. And it so happens that Gu Yue Fang Yuan was the most eye-catching one amongst the juniors.\nExperience has shown that those who have photographic memory at a young age, or those who possess strength that could rival an adult, or had other great inborn talents, all had outstanding cultivation qualifications.\nIf this child shows A grade potential, with great care he could even compete against Bai Ning Bing. Even if it is B grade, in future he could also become a banner of the Gu Yue Clan. But with this sort of early intelligence, the chances of B grade isn't that high, and it's highly possible to be an A grade. With this thought, the Gu Yue clan head curled his lips slowly into a smile.\nAt once, with a cough he faced the clan elders and said, \"Everyone, it's late. All of you should rest well tonight for tomorrow's opening ceremony so as to ensure sufficient energy levels.\"\nAt his words, the elders looked startled. They looked at each other with a hint of caution in their eyes.\nThe clan head's words meant well, but everyone knew what he was aiming to convey.\nEvery year to compete for these young geniuses, the elders would fight among themselves to the point of reddened ears and bleeding heads.\nThey needed to stay well rested and replenish themselves until tomorrow comes where the competition begins.\nEspecially with that Gu Yue Fang Yuan, whose A grade potential was extremely huge. Not counting the fact that both his parents were deceased, and also that he was one of the two only descendants of Fang Zhi's bloodline left. If one was able to get their hands on and bring him into their own family line, with great care and training, one could secure himself a hundred years of prosperity!\n\"However, I'm going to go ahead and say what needs to be said first. When you compete, do it fair and square; no tricks and conspiracies are allowed, or damage to the clan's unity. Please keep this in mind, all of you!\" the clan head strictly instructed.\n\"We wouldn't dare, we wouldn't dare.\"\n\"We'll keep it in mind.\"\n\"Then I shall bid you goodnight, please take care.\"\nThe clan elders slowly dispersed with deep thoughts.\nNot long after that, the long corridor became quiet. The wind from the spring rain breezed through the window, and the clan head lightly walked towards the window.\nImmediately, he breathed in the fresh moist air of the mountain, how refreshing it felt.\nThis was the third floor of the garret; the clan head looked out of the window. He could see half of the entire Gu Yue Village.\nEven if it was late in the night, most of the homes in the village still had lights on, which was unusual.\nTomorrow was the opening ceremony, and it affected everyone's best interests. A kind of excited yet tense atmosphere had enveloped the hearts of the people of the clan, and thus naturally many people couldn't sleep well.\n\"This is the hopes for the clan's future.\" With the many lights dancing in his eyes, the clan head sighed.\nAt the very same moment, a pair of clear eyes quietly looked at the same lights sparkling in the night, full of complex feelings inside.\n\"Gu Yue Village, this is 500 years ago?! Looks like the Spring Autumn Cicada really worked…\" Fang Yuan quietly gazed, standing by the window, letting the rain from the wind hit his body.\nThe use of the Spring Autumn Cicada was to reverse time. In the Ten Big Mystical Gu rankings, the Spring Autumn Cicada managed to be ranked seven; naturally it was no mere creature.\nIn short, it was the ability to be reborn.\n\"With the use of the Spring Autumn Cicada I have been reborn, going back to the time of 500 years ago!\" Fang Yuan stretched out his hand, his sight fixated on his own young and soft, pale palms, then slowly clenched them, embracing the truth of this reality with all his might.\nThe sound of the drizzling rain hitting softly against the window sill filling his ears, he slowly closed his eyes, opening them after a long while. He said with a sigh, \"500 years of experience, it really feels like a dream.\"\nBut he knew it clearly: This was definitely not a dream.",

      "content": "It was said in legend that a river of time existed in this world. It supported the world's time flow and circulation. And by using the Spring Autumn Cicada's power, one could travel back upstream and return to the past.\nThere had been much conflicting opinion on this mythical tale. Many did not believe in it, and some were skeptical to the truth.\nFew people actually dared to believe it.\nBecause every time one used the Spring Autumn Cicada, one had to pay with their life, letting their entire body and cultivation be the driving force to use its very power.\nSuch a price was just too great, and the thing that people just couldn't accept was the fact that after paying with one's life, one didn't even know what the outcome would be.\nSo even if someone had the Spring Autumn Cicada, they wouldn't dare use it so indiscriminately. What if the rumors were fake, and if it was just a scam?\nIf Fang Yuan were not cornered into such a state, he wouldn't have used it so hurriedly either. But now, Fang Yuan was thoroughly convinced—the reality of the truth had been laid before his eyes and there was no denying it. He had really been reborn!\nIt's just a pity… From the start I had wasted an absurd amount of effort, killing hundreds of thousands of people, making even the heavens furious and attracting the vengeance of people. I went through suffering and multiple hardships to finally attain and refine this good Gu… Fang Yuan thought with a sigh. Even though he had been reborn, the Spring Autumn Cicada didn't come with him.\nHumans were the greatest among thousands of creatures; but Gu were the essence of heaven and earth.\nGu came in thousands of shapes and sizes of strange and mysterious variety—there were too many to count. Some Gu after being used once, twice or even thrice would completely dissipate. And some Gu could be reused again and again as long as it wasn't used over its limits.\nThat said, it was probable that the Spring Autumn Cicada was one of those types that could only be used once before disappearing for good.\n\"But even if its gone, I can still refine another. I have done it in my previous life, why can't I do it in this life?\" After the thoughts of pity were put aside, Fang Yuan's heart burst forth ambitious and determined feelings.\nTo be able to be reborn made the loss of the Spring Autumn Cicada entirely acceptable.\nNot to mention he had something precious with him, so it's not like he had lost everything.\nThis precious treasure was his 500 years worth of memories and experience.\nIn his memories were a multitude of all kinds of treasures and precious items that no one had opened yet in this time. He could easily grasp all the big events and incidents by the veins of history. There were a countless number of figures: some predecessors of hidden levels; some geniuses, and some were not even born yet.\nAlso in those 500 years were memories of painstaking cultivation and rich combat experience.\nWith all these memories and experiences, he had undeniably grasped the overall situation and upcoming opportunities. With good planning and execution, he could empower the situation with great fierceness and elegance. It was not a problem now that he could take a step ahead of others, breaking the higher boundaries!\n\"So how do I go about this hmmm…\" Fang Yuan was incredibly sensible. He collected himself together and faced the night rain outside the window, pondering. With this thought, things started to feel complicated. After thinking for a moment, his brows wrinkled deeper.\n500 years of time was a rather long period. Ignoring those long muddled memories that couldn't be recalled, even remembering the hidden locations of treasures or special encounters of people was demanding, but the main issue was that the locations were separated among a long distance and had to be accessed or visited at certain periods of time.\n\"The most important thing is cultivation. The present me has not even opened my Primeval Sea, hasn't stepped on the path to be a Gu Master. I'm just a mortal! I have to hurry and cultivate, catching up to history and seize the opportunities with the best advantage.\"\nNot to forget, many of these hidden locations of treasures were useless without proper foundation. Instead it would just be walking into a wolf's den, looking for death.\nThe problem in front of Fang Yuan right now was cultivation.\nHe had to increase the level of his foundation as fast as possible. If he were slow like his previous life, he would just be too late.\n\"To cultivate as fast as possible, I would have to borrow the resources from the clan. With the state I am right now, I have no power or ability to travel back and forth across the dangerous mountains. Even an ordinary mountain boar can take my life. If I can reach the cultivation of a Third level Gu Master, I'd have the means to protect myself and leave the mountain.\"\nThrough the eyes of a 500-year-old person who had cultivated in the demonic path, Qing Mao Mountain was just way too small, Gu Yue Village even felt like a cage.\nBut while the cage restricted freedom, the sturdy bars of the cage also brought about a certain kind of safety.\n\"Hmm, in this short period of time, I'll just stay in this cage. As long as I can reach Third level Gu Master, I can leave this poor mountain. Luckily tomorrow is the Awakening Ceremony, I'll be able to start training as a Gu Master soon after.\"\nWhen he thought about the Awakening Ceremony, old memories that had long been buried away in his heart resurfaced themselves.\n\"Talent huh…\" He sneered, his gaze focused out the window.\nAt this moment, the door to his room was lightly pushed open and a young teenager walked in.\n\"Brother, why are you standing in the rain by the window side ?\"\nThe youth was thin, slightly shorter than Fang Yuan. His face resembled Fang Yuan's features greatly. As Fang Yuan turned his head to look at this young man, a complicated look flickered across his face.\n\"It's you huh, my twin little brother.\" He raised his eyebrows, his expression returning to that of cold indifference. Fang Zheng lowered his head and looked at his own toes; this is his signature stance.\n\"Brother, I saw that your window wasn't shut, so I thought I'd come in here and close it. Tomorrow is the Awakening Ceremony, it's so late and you haven't gone to bed yet. If Uncle and Aunty knew, they would probably be worried.\"\nFang Zheng was not surprised at Fang Yuan's coldness. Ever since he was a little child, his older brother had always been like that. Sometimes he would wonder, perhaps a genius was just like that, being rather different from ordinary people. Even though he had the same looks as his older brother, he felt that he was ordinary akin to an ant.\nThey were born from the same womb at the same time, and yet why were the heavens so unfair? His older brother had been endowed with gleaming talent, while he himself was as ordinary as a stone.\nEveryone around him would say, \"This is Fang Yuan's younger brother—\" when they mentioned him. His aunt and uncle would constantly tell him to learn from his older brother. Even when he looked into the mirror sometimes, he would feel disgusted as he saw his own face!\nThese thoughts had been ongoing for many years, accumulating day and night deeply into his heart. Like a giant stone pressing against his heart, Fang Zheng's head lowered more and more over the years, and he also grew quieter.\n\"Worried…\" At the thought of his aunt and uncle, Fang Yuan laughed silently. He could still remember clearly how his parents of this world had both lost their lives in one of the clan missions. When he was only three years old, he and his little brother had become orphans.\nIn the name of upbringing, his aunt and uncle grabbed hold of the inheritance left behind by his parents while inflicting harsh treatment against his younger brother and himself.\nHe originally planned on simply being a normal person, even planning to conceal his abilities and bide his time. However his life was difficult, making Fang Yuan have no choice but to choose to expose some of his talents.\nThe so-called talent was merely but a mature and intellect soul that carried a few of Earth's popular ancient poems.\nWith this he managed to startle people and capture attention. Because of pressure from the outside world, the young Fang Yuan made a decision to keep a cold indifferent expression to protect himself, reducing the possibility of revealing any secrets. Over time the coldness became a habit that he was accustomed to expressing.\nThus, his aunt and uncle were no longer harsh on him and his younger brother. As the years passed and they got older, the future became more optimistic and he received better treatment. This was not love, but a type of investment.\nIt's hilarious how his little brother never saw the truth; not only was he deceived by their aunt and uncle, but he also started burying his resentments inside. Although he looked like a good-natured and honest boy now, in Fang Yuan's memories when his brother was found out to be an A grade talent, the clan spent much effort in raising him with all they had.\nAfter that, all the buried resentment and jealous and hate inside was released, and many a time Fang Zheng would target, suppress, and make life difficult for his own older brother.\nAs for his own grade, it was only C grade talent.\nFate loved to play a joke.\nA pair of twins—the older one only had C grade talent, but had been known as a genius for a dozen years. The younger one who was always overlooked was the one with A grade talent instead.\nThe results of the Awakening Ceremony had left the clan shocked. The treatment of the two brothers suddenly reversed after that.\nThe younger brother was like a dragon that rose up to the heavens; the older brother was like a phoenix that fell down to the earth.\nAfter that came the many hardships and troubles from his own younger brother, the cold eyes of his aunt and uncle, and the contempt of the clan.\nDid he hate it?\nFang Yuan hated it in his previous life. He hated his own lack of talent, he hated how heartless the clan was, hated how fate was so unfair. But now, with his 500 years of life experiences, using this to retrospect, his heart was actually calm without a shred of hatred.\nWhat was there to be gained from resentment?\nThinking about if from another point of view, he could understand his younger brother, aunt and uncle, even those enemies from 500 years later who attacked him.\nThe strong ate the weak—survival of the fittest; these had always been the rules of this world. Everyone had their ambitions, always struggling to grasp the opportunities presented before them. Among all the war and killing, what was there not to be understood?\n500 years of life experience had long allowed him to understand all of this, with a heart that wanted to gain immortality.\nIf someone tried to prevent this pursuit of his—no matter who it was—he would kill and live through it. The aspirations in his heart were too big. Taking this path ensured he made the world his enemy, and he was destined to be alone, and destined to kill.\nThis was the conclusion from having lived 500 years.\n\"Revenge is not my intention, the demonic path does not compromise.\" With that he couldn't help but laugh and gave his younger brother a faint glance. \"You may leave.\"\nFang Zheng's heart shook as he felt that his brother's eyes were incisive like an ice blade, seemingly penetrating the deepest parts of his heart.\nUnder such a gaze, he felt like he was naked in the snow, unable to hold any secrets.\n\"Then I'll see you tomorrow.\" Not daring to say anymore, Fang Zheng slowly closed the door and left.",

      "content": "Chapter 3: Please go aside and scram\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nBang, Bang, Bang.\nThe patrolling night watchman banged his wooden clappers in a rhythm.\nThe sounds spread into the high pillar houses; Fang Yuan opened his dry eyelids while his heart silently thought, “Its already the hour before dawn.”\nHe had been lying in bed thinking for a long time last night. He thought up a lot of plans. He probably only slept for a little over two hours. This body has not started cultivating, his energy is not so vigorous and thus his body and mind were still shrouded in exhaustion.\nHowever with 500 years of experience Fang Yuan had long build up deep steel-like determination. This sort of sleep-deprived exhaustion is nothing to him.\nImmediately he shoved away the thin silk blanket and got up neatly. He opened the window and found that the spring rain had stopped.\nThe mix of fragrance of the earth, trees and wild flowers greeted him. Fang Yuan felt his head clear, the sleepiness washing away cleanly. Right now the sun had yet risen, the sky still a deep dark blue, not dark yet not bright.\nLooking around, the tall houses made of green bamboo and wood contrasting with the mountain, was a sea of pale green colour.\nThe tall houses had at least two floors; it was the mountain folk’s unique structure of a house. Due to the mountain’s uneven terrain, the first floor is massive wooden stakes; the second floor is where the people reside. Fang Yuan and his brother Fang Zhen stayed at the second floor.\n“Young master Fang Yuan, you’re awake. I will go upstairs and wait for you to wash up.” At this moment, a maiden’s voice floated up from downstairs.\nLooking down, Fang Yuan saw his own personal servant – Shen Cui.\nHer looks were only slightly above average, but she dressed up well. Shen Cui wore a green robe with long sleeves and trousers, had embroidered shoes on her feet and her black hair had a pearl hairpin. Her body from head to toe radiated youthful vitality.\nShe looked happily at Fang Yuan while carrying a basin of water, and walked upstairs. The water was at the right warm temperature and was used to wash the face. After rinsing his mouth, he used a willow twig with snow salt to clean his teeth.\nShen Cui waited gently, her face wearing a smile and her eyes lively as spring. After he was done she helped Fang Yuan dress, her plump breasts rubbing against his elbow or his back a few times during the process.\nFang Yuan’s face showed no expression; his heart was calm as water.\nThis servant girl was nothing but his aunt and uncle’s watcheye and was a vain heartless girl. In his previous life she enraptured him, but after the Awakening Ceremony when his status plummeted she quickly turned away her head and gave him countless disdainful looks.\nWhen Fang Zheng came over he was in time to see Shen Cui smoothing the creases on the clothing of Fang Yuan’s chest. His eyes had a flicker of jealousy.\nThese years living together with his older brother, under the care of Fang Yuan he also had a servant waiting on him. However his servant was not a youthful girl like Shen Cui but a fat and wide old woman.\n“I wonder which day can Shen Cui wait on me like this, wonder what it feels like?” Fang Zheng thought inside his heart, yet he did not dare to.\nHis aunt and uncle’s biased love to Fang Yuan was no secret to everyone. Originally he did not even have a servant to wait on him. It was Fang Yuan who decided to take the initiative and ask for one for Fang Zheng.\nAlthough there was the status difference of master and servant, but usually Fang Zheng did not dare underestimate Shen Cui. That was because her mother was the Mother Shen(1) who stood beside his aunt and uncle. Mother Shen was the caretaker of the entire household – having full trust of his aunt and uncle, her authority was not small.\n“Alright, no need to tidy up.” Fang Yuan impatiently brushed away Shen Cui’s soft small hands. His clothing had long been tidy; she was just trying to seduce him.\nTo Shen Cui and the brightness of her future, Fang Yuan’s possibility of having an A grade talent was huge. If she could be his concubine she would be able to elevate from servant status into master – it was quite a big step.\nIn his previous life Fang Yuan was deceived by her and had feelings for Shen Cui. After his rebirth he was clear as a blazing fire, his heart as cold as ice.\n“You can leave.” Fang Yuan did not even look at Shen Cui as he tidied up his own sleeve cuffs. Shen Cui pouted slightly, feeling that today Fang Yuan’s puzzling behavior was rather odd and upsetting. She wanted to reply in a spoiled way but being scared by his cold and confusing nature, her mouth opened and closed a few times before she ended up saying ‘yes’ and retreating obediently.\n“Are you ready?” Fang Yuan asked Fang Zheng.\nHis younger brother stood at the doorway, his head bowed down to look at his toes. He muttered a light ‘yes’. Fang Zheng had actually been awake since the fourth watch, too nervous to fall back asleep. He quietly got out of bed and got ready a long time ago, his eyes having black circles.\nFang Yuan nodded. In his previous life he was not clear about his younger brother’s thoughts, but in this life how could he not understand? But right now it was meaningless to him, and he lightly said, “Then let’s go.”\nSo the two brothers left the house. On the way they bumped into many youths of similar age, all in groups of twos and threes, quite clearly heading to the same destination.\n“Look guys, those are the Fang brothers.” Their ears could pick up the small cautious talk. “The one walking in front is Fang Yuan, he’s the Fang Yuan who created the poems,” some of them emphasized.\n“So that’s him. His face is expressionless as if he had no regard for others, just like the rumors say.” Someone said in a sour tone filled with jealousy and envy.\n“Hmph, if you were like him then you can also act like that!” Someone coldly replied against the person, hiding a sort of dissatisfaction.\nFang Zheng listened expressionlessly. He had long been accustomed to this kind of discussion. His head low, he followed quietly behind his older brother.\nBy now the light of dawn had peeked over the horizon, casting Fang Yuan’s shadow over his face. The sun rose gradually, but Fang Yuan suddenly felt like he was walking into darkness.\nThis darkness was coming from his older brother. Maybe in this life, he would never be able to escape from the imprisoning huge shadow of his brother.\nHe felt a burst of pressure on his chest making his breathing difficult. This damned feeling was even making him think of the word ‘suffocate’!\n“Hmph, this talk is a good example of the saying: ‘those who of outstanding talent easily bring about jealous from others’,” Fang Yuan thought with a sneer as he listened to the gossip around.\nNo wonder when it was announced that he had C grade talent, he would be surrounded by enemies and suffer harsh, disdainful coldness for a long time.\nBehind him, Fang Zheng’s breathing got dreary and tried to stop listening.\nWhat Fang Yuan did not manage to realize in his previous life, he could perceive with the finest detail in this life. This was the ability of keen insight that he had gained from 500 years worth of life experiences.\nHe suddenly thought of his aunt and uncle and how scheming they were. Giving him Shen Cui to monitor him and passing his younger brother an old wet nurse, not including other things in life that were different among them. All these actions had intentions – They wanted to cause unhappiness in his younger brother’s heart and instigate a rift among the brothers.\nPeople are not worried about whether they receive less; people worry about whether whatever they received is undistributed well.\nIn his previous life his experiences were too little, while his younger brother was too foolish and too naïve, thus his aunt and uncle successfully instigated a riff among them.\nAfter being reborn with the Awakening Ceremony before him, it seemed like the situation was difficult to change. But with Fang Yuan’s evil way of means and wisdom, it’s not like the situation cannot be changed.\nHis younger brother can be suppressed entirely, that young Shen Cui he could turn into a concubine early on. Not forgetting his aunt and uncle and the clan elders – he had at least several hundred ways of beating them.\n“But, I don’t feel like doing that...” Fang Yuan sighed carefreely.\nSo what if it was his own younger brother? Without the blood relation his younger brother was just an outsider, he could easily give him up anytime.\nSo what if Shen Cui grew any prettier? Without love and loyalty she was just a heap of flesh of a body. Keep her as a concubine? She’s not worthy.\nSo what if it was his aunt and uncle, or the clan elders? They’re just passers-by in life, why waste effort and energy to beat these people?\nHehe.\nAs long as you don’t get in my way, then you can go aside and scram, I don’t need to care about you.\n(1) Mother Shen is like a title or way to call a woman of her position.",

      "content": "Chapter 4: Gu Yue Fang Yuan\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe sun rises in the sky, the sun ray brilliant. The mountain fog is not very thick; the sharp rays easily pass through.\nOver a hundred 15 year-old youths gathered in front of the clan pavilion. The clan pavilion was in the middle of the village, reaching 5 storeys and having sharp tilted roofs; it was heavily guarded. Before the pavilion was the square, and in the pavilion was the shrine of the Gu Yue ancestor memorial tablets. Every generation of clan head had lived in the pavilion. With every major ceremony or big incident, the clan elders would gather and discuss meetings here as well. This was the entire village’s authority central.\n“Good, all of you are punctual. Today is the Awakening Ceremony; it is your life’s great turning point. I won’t say much, just come with me.” The one responsible at the moment was the elder of the academy. His beard and hair were white and he was in high spirits as he led the young teenagers into the pavilion. However they did not go up, but were led downstairs after going through the entrance of a great hall. Following down a constructed stone ladder, they went into an underground cave.\nThe group of youths made surprised and amazed noises. The underground cave was beautiful, stalactites sparkling with the colors of the rainbow. This light shone on the youth’s faces, the neon hues gorgeous.\nFang Yuan was mixed into the crowd, quietly observing everything that was happening. In his heart, he thought: Hundreds of years ago, the Gu Yue clan came to Qing Mao Mountain and settled down after migrating from the central lands to the South Border. It was when they found a spirit spring in this underground cave. This spirit spring produces a large number of primeval stones – It could be said that this was the foundation of the Gu Yue village.\nThey walked several hundred steps. It got darker and the sounds of water were faintly heard. After turning around a corner, a 3 zhang – wide(1) underground river greeted them. By now the colorful lights of the stalactites had disappeared completely, yet in the darkness the river emitted faint blue light. It was like a star river of the night sky.\nThe river flowed from the dark depths of the cave. Inside the crystal clear waters, one could see fish, aquatic plants and even the sand beneath the river. Opposite the river was a sea of flowers.\nThis was the Gu Yue Clan’s closely cultivated moon orchids. The beautiful blue and pink colored petals were like shaped like a crescent moon; the flower stems were like jade, the center of the flower shining like the sort of warm brilliance that radiates from pearls under the light. At first glance, in the dark background the flower sea looks like a huge piece of land covered in bluish green carpet dotted with countless pearls.\nThe moon orchid is food for a lot of Gu. This flower sea could be said as the clan’s biggest cultivation medium, Fang Yuan thought knowingly to himself.\n“Wow, so pretty!”\n“It really is beautiful!”\nThe new sight opened the young teenagers’ eyes. Each one of them had a light radiating from their gaze with excited and anxious feelings.\n“Alright, listen as I call your names. Those who are called must walk through this river to the opposite bank. Walk as far as you can, of course the further you go the better it is. Are you all clear?” The elder said.\n“All clear,” the youths replied. Actually before they came here, they had all heard their family members or seniors talk about it. It is known that the further you can walk, the better your talent is. Your future will also become brighter.\n“Gu Yue Chen Bo.” The elder held the name list and called out the first person.\nThe river was wide but not deep – it covered up to a youth’s kneecaps. Chen Bo’s face was full of seriousness as he stepped into the flower sea ashore. As he did so, he could feel an invisible pressure as if there was a wall in front of him that he could not see, blocking him from walking forward. During this moment, the flowers at his feet suddenly gave off a weak white light. The light gathered around Chen Bo and entered his body. For a moment Chen Bo felt the pressure drop; the invisible wall blocking him suddenly felt softer. With this, Chen Bo gritted his teeth and mustered his strength, walking forward. He tried to force his way in stiffly, yet after three steps the wall in front of him hardened again back to the state before. Thus he could not walk any further.\nAs he watched this the elder sighed. While recording what happened, he said, “Gu Yue Chen Bo, 3 steps, no talent to become a Gu Master. Next, Gu Yue Zao Xie!”\nChen Bo was deathly pale as he walked pass the river back to the youths, clenching his teeth. Without the endowed talent he could live as a normal human, holding the lowest position in the clan.\nHis stature was shaky; it was a huge blow to him, as if reality had killed all his hopes. Many people threw him pitiful gazes, while even more had fixated stares at the second person crossing the river.\nIt was a pity that this youth could only walk four steps forward – he did not have talent either.\nNot everyone has the natural talent to be a Gu Master. Generally speaking, it is not bad if five out of ten people have talent. In the Gu Clan, this ratio is higher, reaching six people. This is because the Gu Yue clan’s ancestor – The first generation clan leader was a famous, legendary and powerful man. Due to cultivation reasons his bloodline carried powerful genes, thus the average quality of talent in the Gu Yue clan was generally higher as they carried his blood in their veins.\nWith two consecutive failures, the other elders observing the scene in the dark started making ugly expressions. Even the clan head was frowning slightly. The next moment, the academy elder called out the third name: Gu Yue Mo Bei.\n“Here!” A horse-faced youth dressed in linen robes lightly called as he came forth. He was tall in build, looking much sturdier than his peers. There was a brave aura about him. He crossed the river in a few steps and reached the opposite bank. 10 steps, 20 steps, 30 steps; one after another small lights entered his body. He walked until he reached 36 steps before he could finally go no further.\nThe youths at the riverbank watched with wide opened eyes, shocked. The academy elder happily exclaimed, “Good, Gu Yue Mo Bei, B grade talent! Come here, let me see your Primeval sea.”\nGu Yue Mo Bei walked back to the academy elder’s side. The latter stretched out his hand and put it on the juvenile’s shoulder, closing his eyes as he checked with focus. Then he retracted his hand and nodded, recording down on the paper: Gu Yue Mo Bei, primeval sea measuring six by six, can be vigorously trained.\nThis special talent can be measured by four grades – A grade to D grade. A D grade talent youth who is raised for 3 years would be able to become a rank one senior Gu Master, become the foundation of the family. A C grade talent youth after two years of cultivation will usually be able to become a rank two senior Gu Master, becoming the clan’s backbone. A B grade talent must be cared for. Often becoming a future clan elder, with 6-7 years of training they will become rank three Gu Masters.\nAnd when it comes to A grade, even if it was just one, would bring great luck to the entire clan. Great care must be given; with this talent in about 10 years they can become a rank four Gu Master. At that moment they would be able to compete for the position of the head of the clan!\nIn other words, as long as this Gu Yue Mo Bei grows up, eventually he will become one of the elders of the Gu Yue clan. That is why the academy elder laughed happily; the elders watching in the darkness also sighed in relief, then they all turned to look at one of the elders amongst them with jealousy.\nThis elder was also horse-faced, known as Gu Yue Mo Bei’s grandfather, Gu Yue Mo Chen. His face was already smiling. He provokingly looked at his old nemesis and said, “What do you think? My grandson isn’t bad huh, Gu Yue Chi Lian.”\nGu Yue Chi Lian had a head full of red hair. He made an annoyed ‘hmph’, not replying to other. It was apparent that his face expression was really dark.\nOne hour later, half of the youths had already walked through the flower sea. There were quite a number of C and D grade talents among them, while half of those youths had no talent at all.\n“Sigh, the bloodline is getting thinner. These few years the clan hasn’t had any rank four masters to strengthen the bloodline. The fourth generation clan head was the only rank five master, but in the end he perished together with the Flower Wine monk and did not leave behind any descendants. The Gu Yue clan’s later generation talents are getting weaker and weaker,” the clan head said with a deep sigh.\nAt this moment, the academy elder shouted, “Gu Yue Chi Chen!”\nOn hearing this name all the elders looked at Gu Yue Chi Lian; this was Gu Yue Chi Lian’s grandson.\nGu Yue Chi Lian had a small and short build with a face full of pockmarks. He was clenching his fist, his entire face sweating. It was evident that he was incredibly nervous.\nAs he walked onto the opposite bank, the little lights entered his body; after walking straight for 36 steps he stopped.\n“Another B grade!” The academy elder yelled.\nThe youths started a commotion, sending Gu Yue Chi Chen envious stares.\n“Hahaha, 36 steps, 36 steps!” Gu Yue Chi Lian shouted, proudly staring at Gu Yue Mo Bei. This time it was Gu Yue Mo Chen’s turn to have a sour face.\n“Gu Yue Chi Chen, huh...” In the midst of the crowd, Fang Yuan stroked his chin thoughtfully. In his memories, the clan heavily punished Gu Yue Chi Chen because he cheated during the Awakening Ceremony. In reality Chi Chen only had a C grade talent, but because his grandfather Gu Yue Chi Lian helped him fake the results, that’s why he appeared to have B grade talent.\nTo be honest if he wanted to cheat, Fang Yuan had a countless number of ways to do so, some ways even more perfect than Gu Yue Chi Chen’s method. If a B grade or A grade talent appeared, they would receive the clan’s huge care.\nBut firstly, Fang Yuan had only just been reborn. It was hard to prepare the cheating method by this condition. Secondly, even if he managed to cheat, he would not be able to fake his cultivation speed. He would be exposed by then. However Gu Yue Chi Chen was different; his grandfather was Gu Yue Chi Lian – One of the two elders with the most authority within the clan. With this Chi Lian would be able to cover up for his grandson.\n“Gu Yue Chi Lian was always hostile towards Gu Yue Mo Chen, these two elders are the clan’s two biggest influential authorities. To suppress his opponent he would need his own grandson to have an outstanding talent. It is also because he was helping from behind, Gu Yue Chi Chen was able to conceal the truth for a time. In my memories, if it were not for that incident, the truth would never have been exposed.”\nFang Yuan’s eyes shone with light, his mind thinking up ways to use this knowledge to his advantage.\nIf he exposed the matter on the spot, he would receive a bit of reward from the clan, but then he would offend the highly powerful Gu Yue Chi Lian. This was not advisable.\nWithin such a short time he also could not blackmail them. Due to having low status, it would just backfire on him.\nAs he pondered, he suddenly heard the academy elder call out his own name: “Gu Yue Fang Yuan!”\n(1) 3 Zhang(丈) – This is an old measurement unit in ancient China. 1 Zhang is 3.3 meters.",

      "content": "Chapter 5: The First Human and 3 Gu, Hopes Awakening\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nIn that moment his surroundings went quiet. Countless numbers of eyes were on him.\nIt’s getting more and more exciting, Fang Yuan thought to himself with a laugh. Under the gazes of the masses, he walked across the river and reached the opposite bank.\nHe could feel a layer of pressure on him. This pressure came from the spirit spring deep in the flower sea. The spirit spring produced primeval qi – because the qi was too rich in here, it caused the pressure.\nBut very quickly from the flowers below Fang Yuan’s feet, little lights made their way up. These dots of light enveloped his entire body before finally entering him.\nThese are the Hope Gu, mused Fang Yuan. The person in charge did not tell them, but he knew it very clearly. Every spot of light is a Gu, known as the Hope Gu.\nOne of the oldest legends talk about the Hope Gu. In the legend, when the world was just formed it was a land of savage wilderness. Among the wild beasts that walked the earth, the first man appeared. He was known as Ren Zu (1), eating raw meat and drinking blood, living a difficult life.\nIn particular was a group of wild beasts called Predicament. These wild beasts loved the taste of Ren Zu and longed to eat him.\nRen Zu did not have a body as strong as mountain rock, nor did he have the sharp teeth and claws of a wild beast. How could he fight with the Predicaments? His source of food was unstable and he had to hide all day. He was at the bottom of nature’s food chain, and could barely survive.\nAt this moment, there were 3 Gu that came up to him and said, “As long as you use your life to provide us, we will help you through this difficulty.” Ren Zu had nowhere to go, so he could only agree to these 3 Gu.\nHe first gave his youth away to the biggest Gu among the three. That Gu then granted him strength.\nWith strength, Ren Zu’s life began to change. He started to have a stable source of food and was able to protect himself. He fought bravely and ruthlessly, defeating many Predicaments. But soon he suffered and finally realized that strength was not everything. It needed to heal and be cultivated, not spent freely at his will. Not to mention when facing the entire group of Predicaments, his strength alone was too small.\nRen Zu reflected over this lesson bitterly and decided to give his prime middle years to the most beautiful Guamong the three. And thus, the second Gu gave him wisdom.\nWith wisdom, Ren Zu was able to learn how to think and reflect. He began to accumulate experience and found out that many times when he used wisdom, it was more effective than using strength. By relying on wisdom and strength was he able to conquer all the goals that he formerly could not, and killed many Predicaments. He ate the meat of Predicaments and drank the blood of Predicaments, surviving with tenacity.\nBut good things do not last and Ren Zu was old, and would only grow older and older. This is because he gave away his youth and middle years to keep the strength and wisdom Gu. When a man is old, his muscles deteriorate and his brain slows down.\n“Human, what else can you give us? You don’t have anything else left to provide to us,” the strength and wisdom Gu said as they realized this. They left him.\nWithout wisdom and strength, Ren Zu was once surrounded by Predicaments. He was old and could not run, his teeth had fallen out and could not even chew wild fruits and plants.\nAs he fell weakly onto the ground surrounded by Predicaments, his heart was filled with desperation. It was at this time the third Gu said to him, “Human, take me up. I will help you escape Predicament.”\nRen Zu tearfully replied, “Gu, I don’t have anything else left. See, the strength and wisdom Gu have abandoned me. I only have my old age left! While it is not as worth my youth and middle age, but if I give you my old age, my life would immediately end. Even though I am surrounded by Predicaments right now, but I will not die immediately. I wish to live a little longer, even if just a second more. So you should leave, I have nothing else to provide to you.”\nBut the Gu said, “Among the three I have the smallest needs. Human, if you just give me your heart, it will be enough.”\n“Then I will give you my heart,” Ren Zu said. “But Gu, what can you give me in return? In this situation, even if the strength and wisdom Gu returned to my side, it would change nothing.”\nWhen compared to the strength Gu, this Gu looked frail and was just a tiny ball of light. When compared to the wisdom Gu, this one was only able to give out a dim white light, not beautiful in any way.\nBut when Ren Zu gave it his heart, this Gu suddenly gave out endless light. In this light, the Predicaments screamed in horror: “This is the Hope Gu, withdraw! We Predicaments are most afraid of hope!”\nThe Predicaments retreated suddenly. Ren Zu was speechless, and from that day onwards whenever he faced predicament, he would give his heart to hope.\nAt this moment, the Hope Gu converged into a stream of light and had already entered Fang Yuan’s body. Due to the outside pressure they quickly gathered into his abdomen and collected into a group spontaneously, 3 inches under his navel.\nFang Yuan suddenly felt the pressure lessen. He began to walk forward. With every step he took, one after another the Hope Gu would fly out from the sea of flowers and enter his body, joining the ball of light. The ball of light grew brighter and brighter, but the person in charge opposite the riverbank frowned.\n“This number of Hope Gu is lesser than expected.” Many elders watching Fang Yuan in the dark thought this as they saw the sight. The clan head frowned as well. This was definitely not the sign of an A grade talent!\nFang Yuan withstood the pressure, continuing to walk forward. “Below 10 steps it means that there is no cultivation talent. 10-20 steps means D grade talent. 20-30 steps would be C grade talent, 30-40 steps is a B grade talent. And 40-50 steps would mean A grade talent. Up till now, I have walked 23 steps.”\n24, 25, 26... 27.\nFang Yuan counted in his heart; when he walked the 27th step he could hear a bang and in between his two kidneys the ball of light reached its limit and suddenly exploded.\nThis burst of energy only happened inside his body; outsiders cannot see it. Only Fang Yuan alone could feel at that moment, an earthshaking reaction. Instantly the fine hairs on his body stood up, his pores shut tight, his mind stretched to a tense limit.\nSoon after, his mind went blank, his entire body becoming soft as if he fell into some clouds. His heart relaxed, his fine hairs flattening and his pores re-opened again.\nIn a short while his entire body was perspiring.\nThis entire process felt long, but it actually happened in a short time. The feeling went away as fast as it came.\nFang Yuan was blanked out for a short moment before he returned to his senses. He secretly focused his attention into his body and found that below his navel and in between his two kidneys, an aperture had formed out of thin air.\nThe Awakening Ceremony was a success!\nThis was the hope to immortality!\n(1) Ren Zu (人祖) – Ren is human, Zu is ancestor. He is the first human, like the Adam from Adam & Eve.",

      "content": "Chapter 6: The road to the future will be interesting\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe aperture was mysterious and unusual. Although it was located inside Fang Yuan’s body, it was at the same time, not sharing the same space with his internal organs. You could say that it was endlessly huge, yet at the same time infinitely small.\nSome call it the Purple Prefecture; some call it the Chinese Pool. However many know it as the Primeval Sea Aperture. The entire body is spherical and the surface of it is covered in flowing white light, like a thin layer of light coating. It was the layer of light from the Hope Gu that previously exploded.\nThis thin membrane of light supported the aperture so it would not collapse, and inside the aperture was naturally, the Primeval Sea. The seawaters were smooth like a mirror, showing a greenish blue color, yet the water was dense and brought about a copper luster. Only Rank one Gu Masters can form this green coppery primeval essence, known as the green copper sea.\nThe height of the sea surface was not up to half of the aperture – it was only up to 44%. This was also the limitation of a C grade talent. Every drop of seawater was pure primeval essence, representing the condensation of Fang Yuan’s essence, vitality and soul. It was also the accumulation of his life potential over the past 15 years.\nThis primeval essence is used by Gu Masters to raise Gu. This also means that from now onwards, Fang Yuan has formally entered the route of a Rank one Gu Master. Since the aperture had opened, no more Hope Gu entered Fang Yuan’s body.\nFang Yuan gathered himself and felt that the pressure before him was as thick as a wall; he could no longer walk another step forward. “Just like my previous life,” he smiled indifferently at this result.\n“You can’t go any further?” The academy elder shouted across the river, holding onto a small thread of hope. Fang Yuan turned around and walked back, answering with his actions.\nAt this moment even the young teenagers started reacting. The crowd suddenly buzzed with chatter.\n“What? Fang Yuan walked 27 steps?”\n“So he was just a C grade talent?!”\n“Unbelievable, only a C grade for such a genius like him?”\nA great disturbance erupted from the crowd.\n“Big brother...” Among them, Gu Yue Fang Zheng looked up, watching with shock as Fang Yuan returned across the river. He could not dare to believe it, his own brother was only a C grade?\nHe had always thought that his older brother would be an A grade talent. No, not just him, even his aunt and uncle and so many people among the clan thought the same too.\nBut now, the result was unexpectedly the opposite!\n“Damn, he was only a C grade!” The Gu Yue clan head clenched both his fists, drawing a deep breath, disappointment in his voice.\nThe elders watching from the darkness had mixed reactions. Some were frowning, some lowering their head in discussion, some looking up with a sigh.\n“Could the results be wrong?”\n“How can that be? This method is accurate beyond reasoning, not to add that we were watching the entire time, even cheating is hard.”\n“But all his actions and intelligence previously, how do you explain those?”\n“Youths with higher quality of primeval sea would indeed display characteristics that surpass the ordinary man. Such as intelligence, perception, memory, strength, agility and so on. On the other hand, these characteristics do not mean that the primeval talent is definitely high. Everything will still be determined by the results.”\n“Sigh, the bigger your hopes the bigger the disappointment. The Gu Yue clan’s generation now is no longer like the first generation.”\n—\nHis socks were soaked with the icy cold waters from the river, the coldness piercing into his bones.\nFang Yuan walked with the same emotionless face, his distance getting closer and closer towards the crowd. He could clearly see the academy elder’s heavy expression, and was aware of the stares thrown at him from over a hundred youths.\nThese glares were mixed with amazement, shock, sneering, and some taking pleasure at this unfortunate event, some indifferent.\nIt was the same situation, making Fang Yuan unwillingly remember his previous life.\nDuring that time he felt as if the sky had fallen. When he crossed the cold river he lost his footing and fell, soaking his entire body in the water, feeling so lost. No one came forward to help him up.\nThose disappointed, cold expressions and gazes were like sharp knives, piercing into his very own heart. His mind was in chaos, his chest searing with pain. It was as if he had fallen from the clouds, down to the ground. The higher you stand, the harder you fall.\nBut in this life, as the same scene replayed itself, Fang Yuan’s heart was calm. He thought of the legend: When Predicaments come, give your heart to Hope.\nAnd today that hope is inside of him. Even though it was not big, but it was better than those people who had totally no primeval talent.\nIf others feel disappointed, then let them be disappointed. What else can they do?\nWhat does other people’s disappointments have to do with me? The most important thing is to carry hope inside my heart!\n500 years of living had led him to understand that the interesting things that happen in a person’s life, happens during the process when one chases after his own dreams. There is no need to ask others around you to not be disappointed or make them like it.\nWalk on your own path, let others be disappointed and unhappy however they please!\n“Sigh...” The academy elder let out a deep breath and shouted, “Next, Gu Yue Fang Zheng!”\nBut no answer came.\n“Gu Yue Fang Zheng!” The elder yelled again, the sound of his voice reverberating inside the cave.\n“Ah? I’m here, I’m here!” Fang Zheng snapped out of his shock and ran out hurriedly. Unfortunately he tripped over his own foot and fell, hitting his head with a groan and tumbled into the river.\nInstantly the entire cave was filled with huge laughter.\n“The Fang brothers, nothing special.” The Gu Yue clan head scoffed, feeling a sort of annoyed boredom towards Fang Zheng.\n“This is such a huge embarrassment!” Fang Zheng struggled and splashed in the water. The bottom of the river was just too slippery; he couldn’t get up properly. Trying his best only made him look more stupid and clumsy. His heart increasingly flustered as the sounds of laughter filled his ears.\nBut right at this moment, he suddenly felt a strong pull lifting him up. His head finally left the water surface and his body found balance again.\nHe wiped his face in a panic and focused his sight. It was actually his older brother Fang Yuan who had grasped his collar and pulled him up.\n“Big brother...” He opened his mouth to say. But instead he started choking on water, ending up triggering a violent cough.\n“Haha, the difficult older and younger brother of the Fang family!” Someone laughed at the riverbank. The laugher grew louder, yet the academy elder did not come out and stop it. He was deeply frowning, disappointment filling his heart.\nFang Zheng was completely at a loss on what to do, and then he heard his brother say to him, “Go on. The road to the future will be interesting.”\nFang Zheng could not help but open his mouth in surprise. Fang Yuan’s back was facing the crowd so they could not see properly, but Fang Zheng could clearly feel the calmness radiating from Fang Yuan. As his older brother spoke the corners of his mouth were slightly raised, revealing a deep and thoughtful smile.\nIt was obviously only a C grade talent, yet how can big brother be so calm? Fang Zhen could not help but wonder, his heart full of doubt. Yet Fang Yuan did not say any more. He patted Fang Zheng on the back, and turned and walked away.\nFang Zheng wore a stupefied expression as he walked towards the flower sea. “I never thought big brother would actually be so calm. If it was me, I’d...”\nHe lowered his head, walking forward absent-mindedly. Yet he did not know that he was playing out a miraculous scene. When he finally snapped out of his reverie, he was already deep in the sea of flowers, standing in a distance that no one else had reached before him.\n43 steps!\n“Oh my god, A grade talent!” The academy elder screamed, seeming to have lost his mind.\n“A grade, really an A grade!?”\n“It’s been 3 years, an A grade talented genius has finally appeared in the Gu Yue clan!”\nThe clan elders that were watching in the darkness were also screaming out at the same time, losing their composures.\n“Well, the Fang bloodline originated from us Chi bloodline. So we Chi family will adopt in this Gue Yue Fang Zheng,” Gue Yue Chi Lian immediately announced.\n“How is that possible? You old bag Chi Lian, your morals and abilities are out of order, but you’re definitely good at misleading young boys. It’s better to pass this kid to I, Gu Yue Mo Chen to raise!” Gu Yue Mo Chen roared back instantly.\n“Stop arguing. No one is more qualified to raise this child than the current clan leader. Whoever has any objections is to go against me, Gu Yue Bo!” The Gu Yue clan head had gone crazy and swept his fiery red gaze over the disappointed and discouraged looks.",

In this world there are thousands of species, countless number of Gu. They live everywhere around us – In the soil, in the bushes, even on the bodies of wild beasts.”\n“As humans continue to propagate and grow, the scholars of the past gradually uncovered the mysteries of the Gu.

With the coagulation of the primeval sea, right now you are all Rank one Gu Masters.”\nIn the village academy, the academy elder talked with confidence and composure. In front of him were 57 students, seated and listening attentively.\nThe mystery and strength of a Gu Master had been deeply rooted in the hearts of the youths a long time ago. Thus everything that the elder taught and said, the students were very interested in.\nAt this moment a young teen raised his hand. With the elder’s permission he stood up and asked, “Elder sir, I’ve known this since I was small. There are Rank one Gu Masters, Rank two and so on, can you explain in more detail to us?”\nThe Gu Yue teacher nodded and waved his hand to ask the young man to sit down. “Gu Masters have 9 ranks, from bottom to the top – Rank one, Rank two, Rank three all the way up to Rank nine. Every rank is considered a big realm, and it is divided into 4 small realms – initial stage, middle stage, upper stage and peak stage. You have all just become Gu Masters, so all of you are Rank one initial stage.”\n“If you all work hard in your cultivation, your cultivation base will naturally advance to rank two, even rank three. Of course, the higher your talent the bigger your chance of promoting.”\n“For D grade talent, the primeval sea takes up about 2-3 layers of the aperture, the highest promotion reachable is Rank one to Rank two. For C grade talent, the primeval sea is 4-5 layers of the aperture. Usually the progress stops at Rank two, but with luck a small percentage of people can advance to Rank 3 initial stage. B grade talents have a primeval sea that takes up 6-7 layers of the aperture, they are able to cultivate to Rank 3, even as far as Rank 4. As for A grade talent, the primeval sea is plenty; it takes up 8-9 layers of the aperture. This kind of talent in a person is naturally the most gifted and the most suitable for a Gu Master’s cultivation, being able to reach Rank 5.”\n“As for Gu Masters who are Rank 6 and above, they are all legends. I am not clear about the specifics either. In the Gu Yue clan, there has never been the appearance of a Rank 6 Gu Master, but Rank 4 and Rank 5 Gu Masters we have had before.”\nThe teenagers’ ears all pricked up, their eyes shining brightly as they listened.\nMany of them couldn’t help but look at Gu Yue Fang Zheng who was sitting rigidly at the first row. He was an A grade talent after all. Their eyes were filled with feelings of envy and jealousy. At the same time there were some who stared at the corner at the last row of the classroom.\nLeaning against the window at the corner was Gu Yue Fang Yuan, who was bent over the desk sleeping soundly.\n“Look, he’s still sleeping,” someone whispered.\n“He’s been sleeping continuously for a week, yet he’s still not awake?” Someone cut in.\n“There’s more. I heard that he was up all night, wandering about at the edge of the village.”\n“There’s been people who’ve seen it more than once, apparently he holds a wine-jar at night, dead drunk outside. Luckily these few years the village surroundings have been cleared clean, so it’s safer.” The fellow schoolmates whisper here and there, letting all kinds of small gossip spreading around quickly.\n“Ah well, the blow was just too big. Someone hailed as a genius for so many years unexpectedly ending up to be a C-grade talent in the end, hehe.”\n“If only it was just the case. Of all the people his own little brother was pronounced an A grade, right now being the center of attention, enjoying the best treatment. The younger brother soars up to the sky, while the older brother falls to the ground, tut tut...”\nAs the discussion amongst the students got louder and louder, the academy elder’s brow deepened into a frown. In the whole classroom all the teenagers were sitting respectfully, showing liveliness. This made Fang Yuan who was sleeping on his table stand out so much that it hurt the eyes.\n“It’s already been a week, yet he’s still so dispirited. Hmph, initially I must have been mistaken by him, how could someone like this be a genius!” The elder thought disgruntledly. He had spoken many times to Fang Yuan regarding this matter, but to no effect – Fang Yuan still did whatever he liked. He would sleep through every class, making the elder in charge of teaching have a very frustrated headache.\n“Forget it, he’s just a C grade. If he can’t even withstand this sort of blow, fostering him with that kind of temperament will just end up wasting the clan’s resources, nothing good will come out of it.” The elder’s heart was filled with disappointment towards Fang Yuan.\nFang Yuan was just a C grade, compared to his younger brother Fang Zheng who was an A grade talent, now this was someone worth the clan spending an amount of effort on raising!\nWhile the academy elder thought about all this, he was also replying to the latest question. “In the clan history, there has been many strong masters. For Rank five masters there were two. One of them is the first generation clan head, our ancestor. He was the one who established Gu Yue Village. Another one was the fourth clan head. He had remarkable talent, and managed to cultivate all the way to the realm of a Rank five Gu Master. If it wasn’t for that despicable shameless demon Flower Wine Monk’s sneak attack, he might have been able to achieve Rank six, but who knows...”\nAs he said this he heaved a deep sigh. Below the platform, the youths starting shouting in a rage.\n“It’s all because of that Flower Wine Monk, he was too sinister and cunning!”\n“What a pity that our fourth clan leader was softhearted and benevolent, and died at a young age.”\n“If only I was born a few hundred years earlier! If I saw that demon I would have torn off his ugly face.”\nThe fourth clan head and the Flower Wine Monk’s story is something that the entire Gu Yue clan knows.\nThe Flower Wine Monk was also a Rank five Gu Master, famous among the Demon faction in his time for his many years as a big flower thief. A few hundred years ago he travelled to Qing Mao Mountain. He attempted to commit crimes in Gu Yue Village, but was found out by the fourth generation clan leader in the end. After a earthshakingly huge battle, the Flower Wine monk was beaten to the point he had to beg for mercy on his knees. The fourth clan head was merciful and kind, intending to spare his life. Yet the Flower Wink Monk suddenly launched a sneak attack, successfully inflicting heavy wounds on the fourth clan head. The clan head flew into a rage, killing the Flower Wine Monk on the spot. However his heavy injuries were not curable and thus, he died.\nTherefore in the hearts of the Gu Yue clansmen, the fourth generation clan head was a great hero who sacrificed his life for the village.\n“Flower Wine Monk huh...” Awoken by the classroom’s noisy chatter, Fang Yuan opened his sleepy eyes.\nHe stretched his body and thought with resentment in his heart, this Flower Wine Monk, where did he die? Why is it that I still can’t find his legacy after searching around the entire village?\nIn his memories, there was a Gu Master from the clan who was brokenhearted and started drinking a lot. About two months later from now, the man was heavily drunk as he lay down outside the village. His heavy wine aroma unknowingly attracted a Liquor worm.\nThe Gu Master was ecstatic, fully intent on catching it. The Liquor worm hurriedly fled, and as the Gu Master was in hot pursuit after it, he followed the Liquor worm’s trail and discovered an underground hole entrance and went in.\nThe Liquor worm was a very precious and expensive type of Gu. The half drunk Gu Master decided to risk it and enter the hole, finding himself in a secret underground cave. After that he discovered the bones of the Flower Wine Monk and the inheritance he left behind.\nWhen the Gu Master returned to the village, he reported his discoveries and immediately caused a big stir among the entire clan. Later on that Gu Master benefitted much from it, his cultivation base suddenly becoming outstanding. His lover who had once abandoned him before was attracted to him again, and he became the talk of the clan for a while.\n“Sadly I only heard bits and pieces about this piece of news, so I don’t know where the accurate location is. It wasn’t like I knew I would be reborn again to this day. Flower Wine Monk, where in the world did you die off to?”\nThese few days he had been buying a lot of wine, wandering around the village as soon as night arrived. He wanted to use the aroma of liquor to attract the Liquor worm. Unfortunately he never saw the Liquor worm appear, making him feel very disappointed.\n“If I could find that Liquor worm and refine it into my vital Gu, that would be so much better than the clan’s Moonlight Gu. In the blink of an eye its already April, there’s not much time left.” Fang Yuan heaved a sigh and gazed out of the window.\nUnder the blue sky and white clouds, verdant mountains stretched into the distance. In the vicinity was a bamboo grove. This was Qing Mao Mountain’s unique spear bamboo, each bamboo stick as straight as a line, the ends of the bamboo exceptionally sharp like the tip of a spear.\nNot too far away, the woods were already turning green. The tender shoots sprouted in a sea of yellow green color. Every now and then, beautiful and colorful sparrows would perch on the branches. The wind of spring blew, wrapping up the freshness of the mountains and rivers, and dispersing it into the world.\nWithout knowing it, the class was almost over. The academy elder finally informed, “This week I have taught you all how to contemplate and check your own aperture’s primeval sea, and how to meditate and shift around the primeval essence inside your body. Now is the time for you all to refine your vital Gu. After this class ends, you will all go to the academy’s Gu room and pick a Guworm. After choosing your Gu, please go home and focus on refining it. When you have finally refined your Gu, then you can come back to the academy and continue attending class. At the same time, this is your first assessment. Whoever can finish this assessment first will be rewarded a generous sum of 20 primeval stones.”",

      "content": "Chapter 8: Things will always be things, but humans will change\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nBeside the academy was a Gu room. The Gu room was not big; it was only 60 meters² in size.\nIn a Gu Master’s road to cultivation, a Gu is the key to strength.\nAt the end of class, the excited teenagers rushed towards the Gu room.\n“Form a line, enter one by one,” some voices suddenly yelled; it was natural that there were guards outside the Gu room. The youths went in one at a time and came out. Finally it was Fang Yuan’s turn to enter the Gu room.\nThis room was a mysterious room. The four walls all had holes; in each one of these embedded square holes were another square hole. Each of the holes differed in size, some big and some small. The bigger ones were no bigger than a an earthenware cooking pot, the smaller holes no smaller than a fist.\nIn the many square holes were all kinds of containers – there were grey stone basins, verdant jade dishes, exquisite grass cages, earthen stoves etc. These containers kept in all kinds of variety of Gu.\nSome Gu were silent, while some Gu made a lot of noises, creating chirping, clucking, rustling sounds and so on. All these noises combined together to create a sort of life symphony.\n“Gu are also divided into 9 big levels, following the same concept of the 9 rank realms of Gu Masters. All the Guin this room are Rank one Gu.” Fang Yuan glanced around, immediately aware of this.\nGenerally speaking, Rank one Gu Masters can only use Rank one Gu. If they used higher level Gu, these masters would need to pay an extremely heavy price. In addition, Gu need to be fed. The high cost of feeding higher level Gu was often not something lower ranked Gu Masters could afford. Thus to Gu Masters who were newcomers, they would always pick a Rank one Gu worm as their first refined Gu unless under a special situation.\nThere is great significance to the first Gu that a Gu Master refines – It will become their vital Gu, interconnecting their lives together. If it dies, the Gu master will suffer a huge blow.\n“Alas, my original wish was to get my hands on the Flower Wine Monk’s Liquor worm and refine it as my vital Gu. But right now there are still no leads on my search for the Flower Wine Monk’s skeleton. I don’t even know when will I be able to find it, or when someone else does. Just to be safe I’ll pick a Moonlight Gu first.” Fang Yuan sighed inwardly as he walked straight along the wall on his left.\nOne of the top layers of the holes in this wall had a row of silver plates. In every plate was a Gu.\nThese Gu were crystalline and shaped like a crescent; it was like a piece of blue quartz. Against the backdrop of the silver dish, the Gu gave off a quiet and beautiful feeling.\nKnown as the Moonlight Gu, this variety of Gu was the local Gu of the Gu Yue clan and many of the clansmen would choose the Moonlight Gu as their vital Gu. The Moonlight Gu was not a Gu of nature; it was a breed that was cultivated with a secret method by the Gu Yue clan. The Moonlight Gu could not be found anywhere else; it could be said that this Gu was a symbol of the Gu Yue clan.\nSince it was all Rank one Moonlight Gu, there was very little difference among one another. Fang Yuan casually chose one and took it. The Moonlight Gu was very light, comparable to the weight of a piece of paper. The insect occupied a small area of his palm; it was roughly the size of a common jade pendant. As Fang Yuan put it on his hand, he could see through it and gaze at the lines on his palm.\nWith one last look and finding nothing wrong with it, Fang Yuan put the Moonlight Gu into his pocket and walked out of the Gu room. Outside the Gu room, the queue was still quite long. As soon as the next person in line saw Fang Yuan leave, he went into the room hurriedly with excitement.\nIf it were others, when they got their Gu the first thing they would do, would be to take it home and quickly refine it. But Fang Yuan was not in a hurry to do so, for his mind was still thinking about the Liquor worm.\nThe Liquor Worm was more precious compared to the Moonlight Gu, although the Moonlight Gu was a specialty of the Gu Yue village, it did not help a Gu Master as much as a Liquor Worm.\nAfter he left the Gu room, Fang Yuan headed straight for the tavern.\n“Shopkeeper, two jars of aged wine!” Fang Yuan fished around his pockets and drew out the remaining primeval stone pieces, putting them onto the counter.\nThese few days he would come here and buy wine, then go around the village border and scout, intending to attract the Liquor worm so it would appear. The shopkeeper was a short and fat middle-aged man, his face oily. After these few days he had already remembered Fang Yuan.\n“Sir, you’ve come.” While he greeted Fang Yuan, he stretched out a thick and short chubby hand and skillfully swiped away the primeval stone pieces. As he put them onto his palm he shifted his hand up and down and felt that the weight was correct. With this the shopkeeper’s smile deepened.\nPrimeval stones were the currency used in this world, used to measure the value of all commodities. At the same time it was also a condensed matter of the world’s essence, usable on oneself, and is important in helping a GuMaster in his cultivation.\nAs it has monetary attributes as well as usable properties, it was similar to the gold on Earth. Earth has a gold currency standard system, and in this world it was replaced with primeval stones. Compared to gold, the purchasing power of primeval stones is even more astonishing. However with Fang Yuan’s continued spending like this, no matter how many primeval stones he had it would not be enough.\n“Two jars of wine everyday, and it has been 7 full days already. The initial savings I had are already almost all spent,” Fang Yuan frowned slightly as he walked out of the tavern with two jars of wine.\nOnce someone becomes a Gu Master, he would be able to extract primeval essence straight from a primeval stone to replenish the primeval sea in his aperture. Thus to Gu Masters, primeval stones were not just a form of currency, but also a supplement in their cultivation. With sufficient primeval stones, the rate of cultivation will increase greatly; this can make up for the disadvantages of those with lower talent grade.\n“I won’t have primeval stones to buy wine anymore tomorrow, yet the Liquor worm just doesn’t want to appear. Do I really have to take the Moonlight Gu and refine it as my vital Gu?” Fang Yuan felt rather unsatisfied.\nAs he walked with the two jars of wine in his hand, he started to wonder. “Academy elder said, the first person who manages to refine his vital Gu will get a reward of 20 primeval stones. Right now I guess a lot of them are at home trying their best to refine their Gu and compete for the first position. A pity, refining the vital Gu is more of a test of one’s talent. Those with better primeval talent will have better advantage. With my C grade talent, without any special means I have totally no chance of winning.”\nIt was at this moment, the voice of Gu Yue Fang Zheng called out to him from behind. “Big brother, you really did go to the tavern and buy alcohol! Follow me, aunt and uncle want to see you.”\nFang Yuan stopped in his tracks and turned around. He found his younger brother was no longer like before, always lowering his head as he spoke. Right now the two brothers gazed at each other face to face.\nA gust of wind blew, lifting up the older brother’s messy short hair, the lower hem of the younger brother’s robes swishing around.\nJust a short period of one month has gone by, yet humans change.\nA week after the Awakening Ceremony, a huge change came upon the older brother and the younger brother. The older brother Fang Yuan fell from the clouds, the title of genius mercilessly destroyed. And the younger brother began to bloom with radiance, slowly rising up like a new star.\nTo the younger brother Fang Zheng, this sort of change was earthshaking to his world. He finally tasted the feelings that his older brother used to have – the feelings of people pinning their hopes on him, the feelings when people use envious and jealous looks to gaze at him. He felt like he was suddenly dragged out from a dark corner and placed into a heaven filled with light. Everyday when he woke up, he felt like he was having a very sweet dream. The difference of how he was being treated from before and now was like day and night, making him somewhat unable to believe his reality even until now, but at the same time also strongly unaccustomed to it.\nIt was hard to adapt.\nIn a short while from being unknown to someone who was closely watched, people pointing at him all the time. Sometimes when Fang Zheng walked on the road, he would hear people around him talking about himself, voices praising him. His face would heat up and he would feel completely at a loss of what to do, his eyes trying to avoid gazes, he even almost forgot how to walk properly!\nThe first ten days or so, Gu Yue Fang Zheng became thinner yet his energy became more vigorous. From the inner depths of his heart, something called ‘self-confidence’ began to manifest.\n“This is what big brother had always been feeling before, how beautiful and painful at the same time!”\nHe could not stop thinking about his older brother Gu Yue Fang Yuan; facing such attention and discussion, how did his older brother deal with it?\nHe subconsciously started to imitate Fang Yuan, pretending to look expressionless all the time, but quickly found that he was not fit for this kind of style. Sometimes during class, a girl’s shout could easily send him red-faced. On the roads, all the flirting from older women even caused him to flee in a hurry many times.\nHe was like a toddler learning how to walk, stumbling and falling as he tried to get used to his new life. During this entire process, he was unable to avoid hearing about his older brother – falling into depression, becoming a drunkard, not going home at night, sleeping soundly in class.\nHe felt very shocked at this. His own older brother, once a strong entity and hailed as a being of great genius, suddenly becoming like this?!\nBut slowly he started to sort of understand. His big brother was also a normal man after all. Encountering this kind of setback and huge blow would send anyone into depression. Along with this understanding, Fang Zheng secretly felt an indescribable happiness inside. This feeling was something he was terribly unwilling to admit, but yet it definitely existed.\nHis older brother who was hailed as a genius and always covering him in shadow, acting so depressed and dispirited right now. From a reverse angle, it was a testimony to his own growth, wasn’t it?\nHe was the outstanding one, this was the real truth!\nHence when he saw Fang Yuan holding the wine jars, his hair messy and clothes untidy, Gu Yue Fang Zheng felt relieved, his breathing also becoming a lot easier. But yet he said, “Big brother, you have to stop drinking, you cannot go on like this! You have no idea how worried the people who care about you are, you need to wake up!”\nFang Yuan was emotionless; he did not say anything. The two brothers gazed at each other.\nYounger brother Gu Yue Fang Zheng’s eyes were shining, giving off a sharp and keen feel. And the older brother Gu Yue Fang Yuan’s two orbs were a deep black, faintly resembling a deep ancient pool. These eyes could not help but make Fang Zheng feel a strange oppression. Not long after he subconsciously turned away his gaze and looked somewhere else.\nBut when he realized it, he felt a sudden rise of anger. It was an anger that was directed at himself.\nWhat’s wrong with you? Can’t even muster the courage to look directly at your big brother?\nI’ve changed, I’ve completely changed!\nWith these thoughts his eyes shifted back their sharpness and he shot his gaze at his brother again. But Fang Yuan was already not looking at him. Holding a jar of wine in each hand, he walked past Fang Zheng and said in a dull voice, “What else are you gawking at? Let’s go.”\nFang Zheng’s breathing became disoriented, the strength that had accumulated inside his heart no longer able to be released. This made him experience a depression that was hard to describe.\nSeeing that his older brother had walked far ahead, he could only quicken his pace to catch up. But this time his head was no longer lowered, but rose to meet the sun. His gaze was fixed on his own feet that was stepping on his older brother Fang Yuan’s shadow.",

      "content": "Chapter 9: Two people who start on the same road, gradually becoming distant\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe sunset was a red hue setting over the east.\nThe sky was still bright, but everything seemed to be covered by a shade of gray. Overlooking the window, the mountains in the distance were gradually drawing towards a heavy black color.\nThe light in the living room was dim. Aunt and Uncle sat high in their chairs, their faces enveloped in shadow, their expressions hard to discern.\nAs he saw Fang Yuan carrying the two jars of wine, his Uncle Gu Yue Dong Tu’s eyebrows twisted into a knot. He opened his mouth and spoke, “In the blink of an eye, you are both 15 years old now. Since you both have the talents of a Gu Master, especially Fang Zheng, your aunt and I are proud of the both of you. I will give you both 6 pieces of primeval stones, take it. Refining your Gu consumes a lot of primeval essence, so you’ll need these primeval stones.”\nAs he said this, some servants came over and passed Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng each a small bag.\nFang Yuan took his bag silently.\nFang Zheng immediately opened his bag and looked inside to see 6 pieces of oval shaped, greyish white primeval stones. His face lit up with gratitude at once and he stood up from his seat, facing his aunt and uncle. “Thank you Aunt and Uncle, your nephew does need primeval stones to replenish my primeval essence! You have both raised me until today, this gratitude is engraved into my heart, I shall not forget it forever!”\nUncle smiled and nodded. Aunt hurriedly waved her hands and said warmly, “Sit down, sit down! Although you both are not our children directly, we have always raised you as our own. You both are able to gain a future, and we are proud of that. Alas we do not have children of our own, and sometimes we thought that if you both could really become our children it would be the best.”\nHer words brought deep meaning. Fang Zheng did not understand it, but Fang Yuan frowned a little.\nUncle cut in and said, “I have discussed this with your aunt. We thought of adopting you both and become a genuine, real family. Fang Zheng, I wonder if you are willing?”\nFang Zheng was stunned for a second, but the look on his face quickly emerged a joyful smile and he said, “To be honest, every since both my parents died I have longed very much for a family of my own. To be able to become a family with Aunt and Uncle, this is too good to be true!”\nAunt’s expression loosened and she laughed, “Then you are our good son, shouldn’t you stop calling us Aunt and Uncle?”\n“Father, mother.” Fang Zheng in a state of realization changed his statement.\nAunt and Uncle laughed heartily. “What a good son, not a waste of us husband and wife to raise you since you were five years old. And we have raised you for ten whole years,” Aunt wiped her tears.\nUncle looked at the silent Fang Yuan and said gently, “Fang Yuan, how about you?”\nFang Yuan shook his head without saying a word.\n“Big brother.” Gu Yue Fang Zheng was about to advise him, but Uncle, whose tone was unchanged, stopped him. “If that’s the case, Fang Yuan my nephew, we won’t force you. Since you are already 15 years old, you need to start being independent, this way you will also easily carry on your Fang bloodline. Uncle here has prepared 200 primeval stones for you as financial support.”\n“200 primeval stones!” Fang Zheng’s eyes opened wide; he had never seen so many primeval stones in his life. He couldn’t help but reveal a jealous expression.\nBut Fang Yuan still shook his head.\nFang Zheng was puzzled, while Uncle’s expression changed slightly. Aunt’s face had also turned cloudy.\n“Aunt and Uncle. If there is nothing else, then your nephew will take his leave,” Fang Yuan did not give them any chance to speak again. After he finished his sentence he took his wine jars and left the hall immediately.\nFang Zheng rose from his seat and said, “Father, Mother. Big brother is not thinking straight, how about you let me advise him?”\nUncle waved his hand and deliberately sighed, “Alas this matter cannot be forced. Since you have the heart, as your father I am already very content. Servants, take care of young master Fang Zheng treat him well. “\n“Then your son will take his leave,” Fang Zheng retreated, and the living room fell into silence.\nThe sun set below the mountain, and the living room became darker. In a while from the darkness Uncle’s cold voice emerged. “Looks like this brat Fang Yuan has seen through our plot.”\nAmong the regulations of the Gu Yue clan it was clearly stipulated that the eldest son at 16 years of age would have the qualifications to inherit the family property. Fang Yuan’s parents had passed away, leaving behind a fortune. It was being ‘taken care’ of by Aunt and Uncle. This inheritance was not something a measly sum of 200 essence stones could compare to. If Fang Yuan had also agreed to be adopted by Aunt and Uncle, then he would lose the right to inherit this fortune. If Fang Yuan at this year’s age of 15 decided to be independent, he would also not conform to the clan’s regulations.\n“Luckily we managed to win over Fang Zheng, and Fang Yuan only has C grade talent,” Uncle heaved a sigh, feeling joyful.\n“Then husband, if Fang Yuan decides to go independent at 16 years of age, what do we do?” Aunt’s tone was hysterical as she thought about the inheritance.\n“Hmph, since he is acting undisciplined, then he can’t blame us. As long as we catch him committing a huge mistake before he leaves us and expel him from our family, it will be counted as snatching away his right to inherit the legacy,” Uncle explained coldly.\n“But the brat is very clever, how would he make a mistake?” Aunt asked, puzzled.\nUncle rolled his eyes immediately and whispered angrily, “You are really stupid! If he won’t make a mistake, can’t we frame him instead? Just let Shen Cui seduce Fang Yuan and scream assault, we catch him on the spot, fabricate a story about him acting wild while he was drunk. Surely we can expel Fang Yuan?”\n“Husband you really have a way, what an ingenious plan!” Aunt was overjoyed at that moment.\nThe thick colors of the night covered the sky, and the stars that blanketed the sky were mostly covered away by floating dark clouds. Each of the households in the village gradually lit up with lights.\nGu Yue Fang Zheng was ushered into a room.\n“Young master Fang Zheng, the old master personally had me tidy up this room specially for you,” Mother Shen said with a hospitable tone. She bowed her waist, her face having a flattering smile.\nFang Zheng looked around with a glance, his eyes shining. This room was at least bigger by two times compared to his previous room. The middle of the room was a spacious bed; beside the window was a rosewood desk with a delicate set of ink and paper. The walls were decorated with exquisite ornaments, and beneath his feet was not an ordinary floor, but covered in a layer of soft handmade carpet.\nFrom his childhood until now, Fang Zheng had never stayed in such a room. He immediately nodded his head continuously and said, “This is very good, it really isn’t bad, thank you Mother Shen.”\nMother Shen was Aunt and Uncle’s most highly valued person; she was in charge of all the slaves in the house and was a housekeeper who lived up to her reputation. The girl Shen Cui who served Fang Yuan was her daughter.\nMother Shen laughed, “I am not deserving of young master’s gratitude, it is my duty, my duty! Young master, do not hesitate to eat well and sleep well. Whatever you want, just shake the bell beside your bed, somebody will attend to you immediately. Old master has already instructed us, so in these few days please do put all your attention on cultivating, young master. Just leave all the other chores to us.”\nFang Zheng felt a gush of gratitude in his heart. He did not say anything, but deep down inside he decided, this time I must get number one and not let Aunt and Uncle down!\nThe dark clouds in the sky were getting heavier, and the night was getting darker. In the night sky most of the stars were covered away by the clouds, leaving a few shining with faint light, blinking away in the sky.\n“Aunt and Uncle must be plotting on how to expel me from the house right now. In my previous life they secretly instigated the servants to provoke me, and then framed me. Then they expelled me from the family; I wonder if there will be any changes in this life.” Fang Yuan sneered in his heart as he walked along the streets.\nHe had long seen clearly the true colors of his Aunt and Uncle. But he could also understand it.\nMen would throw away their lives in pursuit for wealth. No matter whether on Earth or in this world, there would always be many people who would be willing to trample over kinship, friendly and love for their own self-interests and benefits.\nIn fact kinship did not exist. In the beginning when Aunt and Uncle took in Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng, their only purpose was to seek the heritage. It was just so that the two brothers were repeatedly unexpected.\n“All things are difficult before they are easy. To me this is more so of the case. Firstly I do not have outstanding talent; secondly I do not have the care of a teacher. It is equivalent to raising a family from nothing, but with my parent’s legacy it can be said to be a huge advantage for me. In my previous life Aunt and Uncle stole away the heritage, and because of that I had to waste two full years to be able to cultivate to Rank One peak stage. In this life I cannot afford to make the same mistake.”\nFang Yuan pondered in his mind as he walked.\nInstead of staying home, he held the two jars of wine and walked towards the outskirts of the village.\nThe night deepened and the dark clouds obscured the star light, the mountain breeze blew, growing stronger gradually.\nThe mountain rain was coming. But he still had to search; to get ahold of his parent’s inheritance, he would need to wait until he was sixteen. And the Flower Wine Monk’s treasure was the only thing that he could get his hands on in the short run.\nThere were not many people on the streets. The houses along the road showed a dim light. Some small rubbish and leaves were blown away by the wind, drifting about.\nFang Yuan’s thin clothing could not stop the mountain wind, and he could not help but feel a cold chill. He simply opened the wine jar, drinking a small mouthful of wine. Although it was turbid wine, but after swallowing it he felt a warm feeling rising up.\nThis was the first time that he actually drank wine in these few days.\nThe further he walked out of the village, the lesser the houses beside the road, and the dimmer the lights became. In front of him it was even darker. The wind blew heavily against the mountain forest, the branches swaying in the night, making a whistling noise that sounded like a herd of beasts roaring.\nFang Yuan’s pace did not slow down. He walked out of the huge entrance of the village and out into the darkness, going further as he walked. And behind him were the bright and brilliant lights of tens of thousands of houses. In these lights there was a warm corner.\nThe younger brother Fang Zheng was seated at his desk, reviewing the notes that he had taken down during class. The lights in the house were shining brightly, the and solid wall blocked away the cold winds. Beside his hand was a cup of warm ginseng tea, the steam rising up from the cup.\n“Young master Fang Zheng, the hot bathing water has been prepared for you.”\nOutside the door, Shen Cui’s voice softly floated through.\nFang Zheng’s heart jolted. “Then bring it in please.”\nShen Cui walked into the room with her waist bowed, her expression pleased.\n“Your servant greets young master.” Her eyes sent amorous glances at Fang Zheng. Fang Yuan was only a C grade talent, but Fang Zheng was an A grade talent! To be able to get ahold of him, is truly the biggest fortune!",

      "content": "Chapter 10: A storm may arise from a clear sky, refining Gu is full of hardships\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nPitter patter...\nBig, heavy raindrops fell to the earth, battering the roof of the verdant bamboo house, making brittle sounds.\nThe surface of the pond in front of the building was full of ripples as the rain fell, the fish in the water swimming lively around, the aquatic plants swaying about at the bottom of the pond. The sky was overcast; a thick rain curtain obscured the field of vision as far as the eye could see.\nIn the somewhat dim room the window was open, and Fang Yuan quietly watched the heavy rainfall, sighing.\n“It has already been 3 days and 3 nights.”\nOn the night 3 days ago he had walked out of the village with two jars of wine, searching around the surroundings. But when it was late into the night it started pouring rain. Put aside him being drenched to the bones, the main point was that in the situation he could not go about searching anymore.\nThe rainwater would quickly wash away the wine fragrance. At the same time if he forced himself to search under such conditions, it might arouse suspicions. Although previously he pretended to become a depressed drunken person to cover up his real motives, but he knew never to underestimate the intelligence of others around him. Only a fool would think others were stupid.\nThus under this helplessness, Fang Yuan could only stop his search.\nNot too mention that the moment it started raining, the rain had went on continuously. Sometimes it became heavier and sometimes lighter, but it never stopped.\n“I guess in this way, I won’t be able to find the Liquor worm for a short period of time. To be safe I can only choose to start refining the Moonlight Gu. While I refine it, if I can find the Liquor worm during the process it would be the best, but if I can’t then this would have to do. But this matter is very common; a storm may arise from a clear sky, something unexpected may happen anytime. In this world who can do everything without obstacles in his way, having a perfect journey?”\nFang Yuan’s thoughts were very calm; his 500 years of experience had long washed away the impulsiveness that he rarely had in the first place.\nHe closed the door and window and sat cross-legged on his bed. He closed his eyes slowly and after breathing a few times, he calmed his state of mind.\nIn the next moment the vision of his primeval aperture appeared in his mind. The aperture may be positioned inside his body but it was mysteriously unusual, limitlessly big and yet infinitely small. The outer layer of the aperture was a layer of light. The white light gave a thin impression, but it still supported the aperture well.\nIn the aperture was a sea of primeval essence. The seawater was a green copper color, the surface of the sea clear and calm as a mirror. The water level was about half the height of the aperture. The entire volume of the sea occupied 44% of the aperture.\nThis was the green copper primeval sea of a Rank one Gu Master, and every drop of seawater was primeval essence. It was Fang Yuan’s life elementary force and the condensation of his essence, vitality and soul.\nEvery drop of primeval essence was precious, because it was the root of a Gu Master, and was the source of power. Gu Masters need to rely on primeval essence to refine and use Gu.\nAs he retreated his mind from the primeval sea, Fang Yuan opened his eyes retrieved the Moonlight Gu. The Moonlight Gu quietly sat in the middle of his palm, resembling a curved blue moon, small and crystalline.\nWith a simple thought, the primeval sea in his aperture tumbled and a jet of primeval essence broke from the sea surface and transferred out of the body, finally rushing into the Moonlight Gu. The Moonlight Gu suddenly radiated fiercely in blue light, slightly trembling in Fang Yuan’s palm, resisting the influx of primeval essence.\nGu are the essence of heaven and earth, carrying the secrets of the world, the bearers of the law of nature. They are living creatures that live freely under the sky, each born with a will of its own. Right now with Fang Yuan trying to refine it, it would mean wiping out its will. Feeling the danger looming, the Moonlight Gu naturally resisted.\nThe process of refining is a very difficult one.\nThe Moonlight Gu was like a curved crescent moon. As the green copper primeval essence poured into the crescent, the two pointed ends of the crescent turned green. Slowly this green copper essence began to spread to the middle of the crescent moon.\nIn less than three minutes, Fang Yuan’s face had become pale. A huge volume of primeval essence continuously poured into the Moonlight Gu, making him feel a weakness that rapidly attacked his heart.\n1%, 2%, 3%... 8%, 9%, 10%.\nTen minutes later, Fang Yuan’s primeval sea had used away 10% of primeval essence. Yet on the blue crystalline Moonlight Gu’s surface, the points of green copper essence on the two tips of the crescent only expanded a tiny little area towards the center.\nThe resistance of the Moonlight Gu was immensely strong. Fortunately Fang Yuan had anticipated this earlier and did not feel surprised. He persisted and poured in more essence into the Moonlight Gu.\n1%, 2%, 3%...\nAfter another twenty minutes, the primeval sea in Fang Yuan’s body was only left with 14%. The green copper essence on the Moonlight Gu had expanded slightly, the two tips of green essence adding up together covering the surface of the Moonlight Gu by about 1/12. The rest of the Moonlight Gu’s surface was still the original color of light blue.\n“Refining a Gu is so hard,” Fang Yuan sighed as he looked at it. He broke the influx of primeval essence, stopping the refining process.\nUp until now, he had been refining for half an hour, the primeval sea in his aperture consumed over more than half, with only 14% of primeval essence left. And the Moonlight Gu was only refined by 1/12 of it.\nTo make matters worse the Moonlight Gu was still emitting its faint blue halo. Even though Fang Yuan had stopped refining, the Moonlight Gu did not stop resisting; it was still driving out Fang Yuan’s green coppery primeval essence.\nFang Yuan could clearly feel that the primeval essence that he poured into the Moonlight Gu was being pushed out, bit by bit by the Moonlight Gu out of its body. On its surface, the green copper essence at the two tips of the moon crescent was slowly shrinking.\nBased on this speed of reduction, in about six hours later the Moonlight Gu would be able to completely expel all of Fang Yuan’s primeval essence. At that time when he needed to refine this Gu it would make no difference from starting over again.\n“Every time when refining Gu, it is just like a fight between two armies, a battle of positional warfare, or war of attrition. Even though I refined 1/12 of the Gu, I wasted three quarters of my primeval essence. When refining Gu, a Gu Master has to replenish his primeval sea while continuously engaging the refinement process, consolidating his victory. The refinement of a Guis a test of one’s skill in shifting his primeval essence and the patience of an enduring battle.”\nFang Yuan took out a piece of primeval stone from his moneybag as he pondered.\nA Gu Master had two ways to replenish the consumed primeval essence. The first way was natural recovery. After a period of time the primeval sea would naturally replenish the primeval essence. In the case of a C grade talent like Fang Yuan, it would take about one hour to replenish 4% of primeval essence. In six hours it could recover 24% points of the total quantity primeval essence.\nThe second way was to absorb the natural essence directly from a primeval stone.\nThe primeval stone is a treasure from nature itself. As condensed natural primeval essence, while absorbing it the water level of the primeval sea was rising with a continuous speed that could be seen with the naked eye.\nAfter about half an hour the primeval sea had been replenished back to its original volume of 44%. At this level the rising water level of the sea stopped abruptly. Even though there was still space inside the aperture, Fang Yuan could not store any more primeval essence. This was the limit of his C grade talent.\nThus from here one can see the significance of the grade of one’s cultivation talent. The higher the talent, the more primeval essence the aperture can hold, and the faster the natural recovery of the primeval essence will be.\nIn Fang Yuan’s case to refine a Gu and solidify his results, he would have to absorb primeval stones because his primeval essence natural recovery rate cannot defeat the rate of the Moonlight Gu expelling it out.\nHowever in the case of the A grade talent Fang Zheng, he could replenish 8% of primeval essence every hour. In six hours he would recover 48% of primeval essence, and in the same time frame the Moonlight Gu could only expel away 3% points of primeval essence. Fang Zheng did not require the external help of a primeval stone. He could go on refining with a few rests in the process and successfully refine the Moonlight Gu in a few days.\nThat was why Fang Yuan knew from the beginning that in this test, to refine the Moonlight Gu he never had the chance to obtain the first position. It had nothing to do with a person’s actual strength, as the first factor was the grade of talent.\nThe second factor would be primeval stones. If there was an abundance of primeval stones, without hesitation to consume, a B grade talent could also surpass an A grade talent and obtain the first position.\n“In my hands are six pieces of primeval stones. I cannot compare to Gu Yue Mo Bei or Gu Yue Chi Chen, these kinds of people who have their elder family members supporting them from behind. My talent is on C grade, and cannot be compared to Fang Zheng who has an A grade talent. I never had a chance of winning in this test. Why not divert my energy and go look for the Liquor worm? If I can make the Liquor Worm into my vital Gu it would be so much better than the Moonlight Gu. Hmm? The sound of rain outside the window has gotten lighter, there seems to be a sign of ceasing. The rain has been ongoing for three days and three nights, it should be time it stopped.”\nFang Yuan kept the Moonlight Gu and got down from his bed. As he was about to open the window, there was a knock on the door.\nOutside the door came his servant Shen Cui’s voice, “Young master Fang Yuan, its me. It has been raining straight for three days, so I brought you some food and wine. Young master can eat and drink and ease some depressed feelings.”",

      "content": "Chapter 11: It’s just power play\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nFang Yuan frowned slightly. Based on intuition and 500 years’ worth of life experience, he could smell a conspiracy.\nHis eyes flashed and he relaxed his brows. “I’m a little hungry right now, you came at the right time. Come in,” He said.\nOutside the door, while carrying the food box Shen Cui smiled coldly as she heard his reply. But when she pushed open the door, her face was left with a gentle and meek expression.\n“Young master Fang Yuan, the food and wine smells really good. I can smell it as I hold the box.” Her voice was sweet and had a hint of longing and flattery. She put the food box on a small table and took out the dishes, arranging them nicely. The food was indeed very fragrant and tasty. After that she took out two wine cups and poured the wine.\n“Come, young master. Sit down. Your servant mustered her courage today and wants to accompany young master for a drink.” She smiled like a flower, walking to Fang Yuan’s side. Boldly she took him by the hand and pulled him over to sit at the chair by the table.\nThen she sat on his thigh and leaned her gentle body against Fang Yuan’s chest, acting like a timid and lovable woman, whispering in his ear. “Young master Fang Yuan, your servant has always liked you. It doesn’t matter what grade you are, I will always wish to be beside you, rely on you, and comfort you. Tonight your servant would like to give her body to you.”\nShe really dressed up today.\nShe put on blusher, her lips like cherry powder. When she whispered in his ear, a delicate and youthful breath teased at Fang Yuan’s earlobe. Because she was sitting on his lap, Fang Yuan could feel her well-shaped figure easily. Her elastic thighs, her slender little waist and her soft chest.\n“Young master, let me feed you wine myself.” Shen Cui picked up the wine cup, raising her head and taking a sip. Then her eyes fixated on Fang Yuan, her small cherry lips a little opened, slowly leaning over to his mouth.\nFang Yuan’s expression was indifferent, as if what was on his lap was not a young maiden, but a block of sculpture.\nWhen she saw Fang Yuan’s expression, Shen Cui felt a little uneasy at first. But when her lips were just an inch away from his, she was assured, sneering in her heart. You’re still pretending, she mused.\nJust at this moment Fang Yuan scoffed, his tone disdainful. “So it’s just a power play (1).”\nShen Cui’s face became stiff and she swallowed the wine in her mouth, trying to pull false flattery. “Young master Fang Yuan, what are you saying...”\nFang Yuan’s eyes were emitting cold light. He stared into Shen Cui’s eyes, placing his right hand on her snowy white neck at the same time, slowly pressing it with force. Shen Cui’s pupils shrank and her voice was full of panic. “Young master, you’re hurting me.”\nFang Yuan did not answer, but his hold on her neck grew stronger.\n“Young master Fang Yuan, your servant is a little scared!” Shen Cui already had difficulty breathing; she was looking flustered. A soft pair of hands subconsciously grasped at Fang Yuan’s hand, trying to pry his hand away. But Fang Yuan’s hand was strong like iron, unable to be pulled away.\n“Looks like Uncle and Aunt let you come over to seduce me and frame me? This must mean that there are already people arranged downstairs, huh.” Fang Yuan laughed coldly, adding, “But who do you think you are, coming to use tactics on me, with the two piles of garbage of rotten flesh on your chest?”\nAs he said this, his left hand climbed up her chest and ruthlessly grabbed her soft breasts, making it incredibly deformed all of a sudden.\nIntense pain flared from her chest; Shen Cui’s eyes were round and wide-opened.\nThe pain was so great that her eyes were full of tears. She wanted to scream, but Fang Yuan gripped her throat so strongly that in the end she could only sob for a few times. Then she started resisting strongly, for she really was going to suffocate!\nBut at this moment, Fang Yuan slowly relaxed his grip.\nShen Cui immediately opened her mouth and gulped in air greedily. Her breathing was too eager – resulting in a series of violent coughs. Fang Yuan laughed lightly, stretching out his palm. He gently stroked her cheek, his tone carefree as he spoke, “Shen Cui, do you think I can kill you, or not?”\nIf Fang Yuan roared at her with an evil and loud voice, Shen Cui might actually fiercely retaliate. But when Fang Yuan smiled and spoke in a shallow manner, his soft voice asking if he could kill her or not, Shen Cui felt a deep fear from the bottom of her heart.\nShe was scared!\nShe looked at Fang Yuan with terror on her face, seeing this young man smiling all over his face as he gazed at her.\nAt this instance, Shen Cui vowed to herself that she would never forget his eyes for the rest of her life. This pair of eyes were not mixed with the slightest emotion, dark and profound, resembling a deep ancient pool that was hiding a horrifying beast.\nUnder the gaze of these eyes, Shen Cui felt like she was naked in the midst of ice and snow!\nThe person before me, definitely dares to kill me, is able to kill me...\nOh heavens! Why did I come and provoke this kind of devil?!\nShen Cui’s heart was full of remorse. At this moment she longed to turn and flee. But right now she was still on his lap; she did not dare to run away, not even able to pluck the courage to do any action.\nThe muscles on her entire body were tense, her gentle stature trembling. Her face was as pale as white paper and she could not utter a single word.\n“Since you as a personal servant girl, have been serving me for so many years, I won’t kill you this time. Since you want to escape from slavery, go and find my little brother, he’s stupid and naïve.” Fang Yuan retracted his smile and patted her cheek, his tone plain like water.\nWith a sigh, he finally said —-\n“You can leave.”\nShen Cui was as dumb as a piece of wood as she walked out obediently. She was afraid out of her wits, and did not know how she managed to leave the side of the devil called Fang Yuan.\nThe men hidden in the shadows looked confused when they saw Shen Cui come out looking so shaken.\n“They actually arranged such a beautiful trap, its even more innovative than my previous life. Hehe, Aunt and Uncle, this kindness of yours I will remember deeply!”\nNot long after Shen Cui left, Fang Yuan stood up and left as well. No matter what, he could not stay at this residence anymore. A wise man sees and mitigates foreseen risks, what more to say for a devil? When there is insufficient strength, only a fool would put himself in danger.\n“Innkeeper, do you have any rooms available?” Fang Yuan came to the only inn in the village and asked for the price.\n“Yes, yes. There is room on the second floor and third floor. Not only is it cheap, the rooms are also tidy and clean. The first floor is the cafeteria; guests of the inn can come here and eat. There is also service for asking the inn workers to bring up food to your room.” The innkeeper was full of hospitality as he entertained Fang Yuan.\nThis inn was the only one in the village, but the business was not very good. In fact it was somewhat deserted. Only when the annual merchant caravan came by to trade on Qing Mao Mountain, the inn would be full of people.\nFang Yuan was a little hungry, so he passed 2 full round pieces of primeval stones to the innkeeper. “Give me a good room for me to stay in, and prepare 2 jars of wine, 3-4 different dishes, return me any excess balance.”\n“Done.” The innkeeper took the 2 pieces of primeval stone and asked, “Would you like to eat in your room, or dine in the hall?”\nFang Yuan looked at the sky. The rain had stopped and it was nearing evening. He could simply eat in the lobby and set out straight for the outskirts of the village when he was done, continuing his search for the treasure of the Flower Wine Monk. Thus he replied, “I’ll eat in the hall.”\nThe inn had a dining hall; there were a dozen square tables, four long benches surrounded each table. In between the tables were huge and thick pillars that were supporting the inn. The floor was covered with big tiles of marble, but it was wet; it was hard to conceal the moisture of the mountain.\nThere were 3 tables seated with people. Seated by the window, an old man was drinking wine, gazing outside at the sunset, being all alone. In the middle of the cafeteria was a table seated with 5-6 hunters. They were discussing about their hunting experiences in loud voices, and at their feet were a pile of different kinds of mountain prey, like pheasants and hares.\nIn another corner was a table with 2 young people, seemingly discussing in secret. Their figures were hidden in the darkness, it was hard to see them, and harder to know their gender.\nFang Yuan decided to sit by the table nearest to the door. Soon after, the dishes were served on the table.\n“With my C grade talent, to refine the Moonlight Gu I would need to borrow primeval stones. If my luck is good and this Moonlight Gu does not have a strong will, I would only need 5 pieces. But if it is stubborn that I’d be in trouble, probably need around at least 8 pieces.”\nGu are living creatures, so it is natural for them to have the will to survive.\nSome have a strong will and would always resist the refinement process; some Gu have weak will, all throughout refining they helplessly surrender; once there was no resisting, the refining process would become relaxing.\n“Right now I only have 6 primeval stones on me, but I gave 2 to the innkeeper so I’m left with 4 pieces. There’s not enough.”\nIn this world primeval stones are the local currency, and the buying power is very strong. A normal family of three would spend at most 1 piece of essence stone in a month. But when it came to a Gu Master, the consumption of primeval stones was greater. Take Fang Yuan for example; just by refining Gu alone he would need an average of 7 primeval stones or so. And this is just on a Moonlight Gu, if he really did find the Liquor worm, just to refine it with Fang Yuan’s grade talent, he would need at least a dozen more!\n“In other words, right now my situation is – Even if I find the Liquor worm, I don’t necessarily have the primeval stones to refine it. However I still need to search around, because there is a huge possibility that the Flower Wine Monk’s treasure has a huge abundance of primeval stones.”\nThis was not a difficult deduction. The Flower Wine Monk was a Rank five Gu Master after all. For such a famous strong warrior of the Demonic Faction, how could he not have primeval stones, which are the must-have item in a Gu Master’s cultivation?\n(1) Power play – tactics exhibiting or intended to increase a person’s power or influence.",

      "content": "Chapter 12: Green Bamboo Wine is fragrant, Gu Master flaunts power\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\n“Right now everything comes down to the Flower Wine Monk’s treasure. If I can find it, all my problems will be solved. If I don’t find it, all these issues will greatly slow down my speed of cultivation. If that happens I’ll lose out to people at my age in cultivating. I don’t understand! I’ve spent more than a week trying to attract the Liquor worm to appear, why do I still not see it?”\nFang Yuan frowned and racked his brains. It was like putting food into his mouth, but still not knowing how it tasted (1).\nSuddenly there was a loud noise, interrupting his thoughts. Fang Yuan looked at the direction of the sound, realizing that the 6 hunters seated around the table at the middle of the hall were heavily drunk. The atmosphere around them was fiery and their faces were all red.\n“Brother Zhang, come, drink another cup!”\n“Old brother Feng, we brothers admire your abilities! You took down a black skinned wild boar alone, what a man! This cup of wine you must drink, or else you’ll be disrespecting us!”\n“Thank you brothers for your sincerity, but I really can’t drink anymore.”\n“Brother Feng can’t drink anymore, perhaps you dislike this wine because it’s not good enough? Waiter, come over! Give me some good wine!”\nThe noise was becoming louder; it was obvious that the group had drunk a lot. The waiter hurriedly went over and said, “Well good sirs, we do have good wine, but it is quite expensive.”\n“What, you’re afraid we won’t pay up?!” When the hunters heard the waiter, quite a few of them stood up and stared at the waiter. They were either big and tall or thick and burly in stature, capable and vigorous in a threatening manner, each having the courage that mountain men possessed.\nThe waiter quickly said, “I would not dare to look down on you brave men, it’s just that these wine is really expensive, one jar costs 2 pieces of primeval stones!”\nThe hunters were stunned. 2 primeval stones was definitely not cheap – It was the sum of 2 months of the normal average household monthly expenses. Even though hunters earn more from hunting when compared to ordinary mortals, like how some times a black skinned wild pig could be worth half a primeval stone. However hunting was risky and a mistake could turn the hunter into prey.\nTo the hunters, using 2 primeval stones just to drink a jar of wine was just not worth it.\n“Is there really such an expensive wine?”\n“Boy, you aren’t trying to lie to us right?”\nThe hunters were shouting about, but their voices felt a little timid, unable to back out of the situation with grace. The waiter kept telling them he wouldn’t dare.\nThe hunter called brother Feng saw that the scene was not right, and he hurriedly said, “My brothers, let’s not spend anymore. I can’t drink anymore, let us drink this wine another day.”\n“What, you can’t say that brother!”\n“This is...”\nThe rest of the hunters were still shouting, but their voices started to fade away. One by one they sat back in their seats. The waiter was also a shrewd person. When he saw this, he knew that he was not able to sell the wine any more. However this situation hardly surprised him. As he was about to retreat, a young man’s voice came from the table at the dark corner. “Hehe, hilarious. Each one of them blindly shouting for nothing. If you can’t afford to buy wine, you should just obediently keep your mouths shut and go to the side!”\nWhen the hunters heard this, one of them immediately retorted in anger, “Who said we can’t afford it? Waiter, bring over that jar of wine, I’ll give you the stones, two pieces of it!”\n“Oh, give me a moment sir, I’ll get it!” The waiter did not expect such a turn of events. He hurriedly replied and turned to grab a wine jar and brought it over. This wine jar was as big as the common jar of wine, but the moment it was uncorked, in that very instant a refreshing and mellow fragrance filled the entire cafeteria. Even the old man sitting alone at the window could not help but turn his head over when he smelled the wine aroma, and he gazed at the jar of wine.\nIt was definitely good wine.\n“Dear guests, its not bragging. This is the green bamboo wine; the entire village only has one inn, which is us. Smell the fragrance!” The waiter inhaled deeply as he said this, his facial expression full of satisfaction and enjoyment.\nFang Yuan was moved. This inn waiter was really not boasting.\nIn the Gu Yue Village there were 3 taverns. The wine sold there were the common rice wine, muddy wine and other similar common wine. In order for Fang Yuan to attract the Liquor worm, he continuously bought wine for 7 days; it was naturally that he was aware of the prices.\nSeveral of the hunters looked at the wine jar before them. They were consumed by alcohol addiction. Each of them twitched their noses and swallowed. As for the hunter who bought the wine in a moment of anger, his expression was even more interesting; a layer of remorse and anger appeared on his face.\nAfter all this jar of wine was the value of two primeval stones!\n“I was too rash and bought the wine by impulse. This waiter is not too typical. He immediately brought the wine, now the cork is unsealed. Even if I want to return the goods it is too late.”\nThe more the hunter pondered, the more distressed he felt. He wanted to return it back, yet he was unable to do so in fear of being humiliated. At last he could only bang on the table and said with a strong smile, “Damn, this wine is good! Brothers please, drink all you want. Today this wine is on me!”\nAt this moment the young man at the table in the corner hissed, “How is this small jar of wine enough for six? If you have the guts then go buy a few more jars.”\nThe hunter was furious when he heard this and stood up in a rage, his eyes fixed on the young man who spoke. “Brat, you sure have a lot of words. Come, stand up and fight me!”\n“Oh? Then I will stand up.” The young man got up from his seat as he heard the hunter’s remark, grinning as he walked out from the shadows. His body figure was tall and thin, his skin pale. He was dressed in navy battle robes, and looked clean and neat. His head wore a blue headband; his upper body had a jacket that showed his thin and weak shoulders. The lower body had long pants, the feet were covered in bamboo sandals and the calves were tied.\nThe most important thing about him was the green belt on his waist. The middle of the belt was a shiny piece of copper; on the copper plate was a black “One” word.\n“It’s a Rank One Gu Master?!” The hunter clearly understood what this manner of clothing represented. He drew in a deep breath, the anger on his face dissipating, replaced by alarm.\nHe had never imagined that he actually provoked a Gu Master!\n“Didn’t you want to fight me? Come on then, hit me.” The young Gu Master walked slowly towards the man, a playful smile on his face. But the hunter who had challenged him earlier had become frozen like a sculpture, unable to move from his spot.\n“Maybe you guys can all come at me together, that works too.” The young Gu Master slowly walked to the hunter’s table, casually speaking.\nThe expressions on their faces had changed. Some of the hunters who had drunken red faces had gone pale suddenly. Each of their foreheads was drenched in cold sweat, and they felt restless, too afraid to even breathe heavily.\nThe young Gu Master stretched out a hand, picking up the green bamboo wine jar. He put it under his nose and sniffed, smiling. He said, “It sure smells good...”\n“If my lord likes it, then please feel free to take and drink it. It is an apology from me for offending my lord,” the hunter who provoked him earlier hurriedly replied and cupped his hands together before his chest, pushing a smile to his face.\nUnexpectedly the young man’s facial expression changed fiercely; with a loud crack the jar fell into pieces on the ground. The Gu Master looked cold as ice, his gaze sharp like a sword. He hissed angrily, “You think you have the right to apologize to me? You bunch of hunters must be really rich, even richer than me, since you guys spent 2 primeval stones to drink wine?! Do you have any idea, how upset I am over primeval stones right now! You actually dare to show off your wealth in front of me at this time! You mortals can even compare to me?!”\n“We wouldn’t dare, we wouldn’t dare!”\n“To offend my lord, it is a heinous crime!”\n“We mortals did not mean to offend you, these are our primeval stones, please accept lord Gu Master.”\nThe hunters quickly got on their feet and took out the primeval stones they had. But how could these mortals have money, all they pulled out was just bits and fragments of primeval stones, the biggest fragment piece was no bigger than a quarter of a primeval stone.\nThe Gu Master did not accept these primeval stones, but he did not stop sneering. He used his hawk-like gaze and swept past the entire cafeteria. The hunters that he scanned over lowered their heads. The old man who sat at the window watching the scene also quickly turned his head to avoid the Gu Master’s gaze.\nOnly Fang Yuan watched quietly, void of hesitation.\nThe clothing that this young Gu Master was wearing was the uniform that only formal Gu Masters could wear, so Fang Yuan was not qualified to wear it. Fang Yuan would only receive it from the clan after he graduated from the academy.\nThe word ‘One’ on the copper piece on the belt of the young Gu Master was to indicate his position as a Rank one Gu Master. However he was already around 20 years or so, and the aura of primeval essence that his body emitted seemed to indicate that he was Rank one upper stage.\nStarting cultivation at 15 years of age and only reaching Rank one upper stage at around 20 years of age, this showed that the young Gu Master was only of D grade talent, which was a grade worse than Fang Yuan. There was a high possibility that this man was only a logistics Gu Master, not even counted as a battle Gu Master.\nHowever even if that was the case, when facing these six brawny hunters it was more than sufficient.\nThis was the gap of power between a Gu Master and a mortal human.\n“With power, one can be at the top. This is the nature of this world. No, actually any world is also the same, the big fish eats the small fish and the small fish eats the shrimp. It’s just that this world shows it even more openly,” Fang Yuan mused secretly.\n“Alright Jiang Ya, you already taught them a lesson. Let’s not further embarrass these mortals. If it gets out, even if you are not embarrassed, I would be,” the other young person sitting in the corner voiced out.\nWhen everyone heard the voice speak, they realized that this young person was a woman.\nThe young Gu Master called Jiang Ya stopped sneering as his female companion chided him. He did not even bother looking at the fragments of primeval stones that the hunters had taken out; these stones were not even the sum of two primeval stones, he was definitely not interested in it.\nHe flicked his sleeve and walked back to his original table. As he strode back he said maliciously, “If you think you have the guts to continue drinking, then go and drink green bamboo wine. I want to see, who still dares to drink this wine?”\nThe hunters all lowered their heads, acting like six obedient sons after being scolded.\nThe strong aroma of wine filled the entire cafeteria. The hunter who bought the wine felt his heart aching as he smelled the fragrance. After all he had spent 2 primeval stones on this wine, yet he never got to drink even one mouthful!\nFang Yuan put down his chopsticks; he had eaten enough. As he sniffed in the wine aroma his eyes flashed for a moment, then he took out 2 primeval stones and put them on the table. “Waiter, give me a jar of green bamboo wine,” he said indifferently.\nThe whole scene froze.\nThe young Gu Master called Jiang Ya instantly stopped in his footsteps. The corners of his mouth twitched and he exhaled. He had just finished his warning, yet right after he was done Fang Yuan wanted the wine. This was like specially stepping over him and slapping him in the face.\nHe turned around and narrowed his eyes, shooting a cold glare at Fang Yuan.\nFang Yuan calmly stared back, his face indifferent and void of fear.\nJiang Ya’s eyes flashed and the coldness in his gaze slowly disappeared; he felt the aura of primeval essence on Fang Yuan’s body. After realizing Fang Yuan’s identity, he lit up with a smile and said warmly, “Ah, it’s a junior brother.”\nEveryone else came to the realization and the looks they shot at Fang Yuan changed.\nNo wonder this young teenager was not one bit afraid of a Gu Master, it was because he was also one. Even though he was still attending the academy, his position was already different.\n“Lord Gu Master, your wine!” The waiter scurried over, smiling all over his face. Fang Yuan nodded at the young Gu Master and took and jar of wine and walked out of the inn.\n(1) It means that he is putting in effort, yet he cannot see the results.",

      "content": "Chapter 13: The bamboo forest under the moon, a bead of snow\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nAround 300 years ago, an incredible genius appeared in the Gu Yue Clan. He was very talented and had already cultivated to the point of a Rank five Gu Master at a young age, and even had the possibility of going further. He was famous throughout Qing Mao Mountain, had a bright future and was the pinnacle of hope and responsibility in the clan’s eyes.\nIn the history of the Gu Yue clan, everyone spoke of him the most – the fourth clan head.\nUnfortunately he sacrificed himself to protect his people and fought the equally powerful Rank five Gu Master, the demonic Flower Wine Monk. Even though he defeated the Flower Wine Monk after a fierce battle, he let the devil get on his knees and beg for mercy.\nIn the end he was careless and got caught by the Flower Wine Monk’s sneak attack. The fourth head angrily executed the Flower Wine Monk, but due to his own heavy injuries he died an untimely death.\nThis tragic incident had long since circulated until today, becoming a popular story among the Gu Yue clan. However Fang Yuan knew that this story was not to be believed, because it had a very large loophole.\nIn his previous life, a month later from now, a drunken Gu Master who had been rejected by his lover lay down outside the village, so drunk he was like a fish. In the end because of the overflowing smell of wine, it ended up attracting a Liquor worm.\nThe Gu Master chased after the Liquor worm and found the remains of the Flower Wine Monk in a secret underground cave, also finding the Flower Wine Monk’s inheritance. This Gu Master quickly hurried back to the clan and told them of the matter, causing a huge stir.\nAs the storm gradually subsided he also gained benefit from it – He obtained the Liquor worm, his cultivation increased, the girl friend who once abandoned him went back to his side and he became the talk of the village for a while.\nWhen stories are passed down generation by generation, it is normal to change along the way. But in Fang Yuan’s memories, the story of the Gu Master discovering the treasure seemed quite authentic, yet he had a feeling that the story was hiding other truths.\n“I was not aware of it at first, but in these few days while I searched and analyzed on the side, I feel that something feels out of place.” The night grew dark, and as Fang Yuan walked in the bamboo forest that grew around the village, he reviewed through the clues he had so far in his head.\n“If I put myself in his shoes and think about it, when I discover the Flower Wine Monk’s treasure why would I not take it all for myself, but go and notify the clan instead? Don’t even mention sense of clan honor, everyone has greed in their hearts. What is it that would make that Gu Master betray the greediness in his heart, even going as far as to be willing to abandon all interest and profit, and report this finding to the clan’s top brass?”\nThe truth is always hidden inside the fog of history. Fang Yuan racked his brains but he could not get the result. After all the clues he had were too few. The only two clues he had could easily be true or false, so it could not be fully relied upon.\nFang Yuan could not help but think of himself. “No matter what, after buying this jar of green bamboo wine I only have 2 primeval stones left on me. If I can’t find the treasure then I’ll be in grave trouble. Today shall be considered the final gamble, it’s all or nothing!”\nHowever he didn’t have enough primeval stones to refine a Gu worm in the first place. So why not invest it in this wine and increase the chances of success?\nIf it were in the case of other people, most of them would probably play it safe and save up the primeval stones. But in the case of Fang Yuan, the efficiency of doing so was too low. He would rather take the risk and gamble.\nYou see, the people of the Demonic Faction love to take risks.\nRight now, the night grew thicker, the spring moon shaped like a bow. Clouds obscured the moonlight, as if coating the crescent moon with a thin sheet of gossamer.\nBecause it just finished raining continuously for three days and three nights, the turbid energy between the mountains had been washed away clean, leaving behind the purest of freshness. This fresh air was pure like a piece of white paper, and was more effective in spreading the wine aroma around. That was the first reason why Fang Yuan was full of confidence tonight.\nThe previous seven days of searching was not without gain. At least it proved that the Flower Wine Monk did not die in those places. This was the second reason for Fang Yuan’s confidence.\nIn the bamboo forest the grass was luxuriant, the white flowers endless and the green spear bamboo straight like a pencil, the forest resembling a clump of jade rods.\nFang Yuan opened the jar seal, releasing a thick wine aroma instantly. Green bamboo wine could be said as the Gu Yue Village’s number one wine. This was the third reason for Fang Yuan’s confidence tonight.\n“With these three big reasons gathering together, if I want to succeed it has to be tonight!” Fang Yuan cheered in his heart as he slowly tilted the wine jar, pouring a small stream of wine, dripping it onto a stone. If those bunch of hunters saw this sight, they would have probably become insanely distressed. This wine is worth 2 whole primeval stones after all...\nBut Fang Yuan was indifferent.\nThe fragrant aroma quickly spread out into the night. The breeze was gentle, the faint aroma floating about and contaminating the bamboo forest. Fang Yuan stood at his spot, smelling the aroma. He waited for a while, yet he did not see any movement.\nAll he heard was a nightingale crying in the near distance, its sound like a string of bells. His gaze was silent. He did not feel surprised, and he moved away, walking to a spot a few hundred meters away.\nIn this place he did the same, pouring out a few drips of wine and waiting at the spot.\nHe did the same thing over and over again, moving away to a few other different locations, dripping wine a few times. After all that the green bamboo wine in the jar was only left with a bit.\n“This is the last time,” Fang Yuan sighed. He tipped the wine jar over, the bottom facing the sky. All the remaining wine left in the jar flowed out. The wine sprinkled over the grass, letting the green grass sway about. The wild flowers were stained with wine, slightly lowering their heads.\nFang Yuan stood with the last shred of hope in his bosom, and gazed around.\nRight now the night was already very deep. A thick cloud had obscured the moonlight. The dark shadows were like a curtain, covering the bamboo grove. It was deadly silent all around, each strand of green spear bamboo standing alone, leaving a trail of lines that were straight up and down in Fang Yuan’s pupils.\nHe quietly stood at the spot, listening to his own clear breathing. Then he felt the small hope that he carried in his chest, slowly dissipating away, becoming nothing.\n“It failed after all.” His heart muttered, “Today I had three great advantages gathered together, yet I still failed, not even seeing the shadow of the Liquor worm. This means that in future the rate of success will be lower. Right now I only have two primeval stones left, and I still need to refine the Moonlight Gu. I can’t risk it anymore.”\nThe end result of taking a risk was often unsatisfactory. But when the result was ideal, the profit would be impressive. Fang Yuan liked taking risks, but he was not a gambling addict, and he was not someone who was bent on gambling back what he lost. He had his own limit, he was clear about his own capabilities.\nRight now, the five hundred years of life experience was telling him, it was time to stop.\nSometimes life was like this. Often it was that there was that one goal that seemed so perfect, filled with temptation. It seemed so near yet with so many twists and turns, the goal was constantly unfulfilled. It made people restless, thinking about it night and day.\n“This is the helplessness of life, but it’s also the charm of living,” Fang Yuan laughed bitterly, turning to walk away.\nIt was at this moment.\nA gust of wind blew, like a gentle arm, lightly brushing away the clouds in the night sky. The clouds floated away to reveal the hidden moon. The crescent shaped moon hanging in the sky was like a white jade lamp, pouring moonlight that was clear as water down onto the earth. The moonlight spilled over the bamboo forest, spilled onto the mountain rock, bathing onto the rivers and streams in the mountain, shedding onto Fang Yuan’s body.\nFang Yuan was dressed in plain clothing; under the gentle touch of the moonlight, his young face became fairer. The darkness seemed to fade away in a flash, and taking its place was a field of snowy frost flowers. As if it was infected by the moonlight, the nightingale began to sing once more, but this time it was not just one, but many. Scattered among the bamboo grove, they all tweeted in response.\nAt the same time, a type of insect that inhabited huge mountains, the Dragonpill crickets that were active under moonlight started singing a rustling song of life. They were critters that only came out in the night. Their bodies emitted faint red light; at this moment they jumped out in droves, each of their bodies flashing with the brilliance of a red agate.\nAt first glance, Fang Yuan thought that these Dragonpill crickets were like jets of crimson water bouncing about, landing on the green grass and wild flowers, prancing under the moonlight in the bamboo grove.\nThe bamboo forest was like a conscious pond, under the moonlight the green jade colors of the spear bamboo flashed in the brilliance of light and smooth jade. The enchanting sight of the dense trees and bright flowers in spring, Mother Nature was showing Fang Yuan her immense beauty at this moment.\nFang Yuan unconsciously stopped in his footsteps, feeling as if he was in a heavenly land. He was already about to depart, but at this moment he subconsciously looked around.\nThe clump of wild flowers and grass that he had poured the last dredges of wine over trembled gently in the wind, remaining empty. Fang Yuan laughed at himself and took back his line of sight.\nHowever.\nUnexpectedly in the process of turning away, he saw a dot of white snow.\nThis bead of snow was glued to a spear bamboo pole not far away. Under the moonlight it was like a suspended round pearl.\nFang Yuan’s two pupils expanded fiercely, his body trembling slightly. His heart dropped and started pumping faster each second.\nIt was the Liquor worm!",

      "content": "Chapter 14: In the mountain crevice hides a profound theory\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe Liquor worm was shaped like a silkworm, its entire body giving out pearl white light. It was a little chubby and had a cute appearance.\nThe Liquor worm fed on wine and could fly. When it flew around, it would curl up into a ball, and its speed was very fast. Even though it was only a Rank one Gu, but it was worth even more than a few Rank two Gu.\nTo make it into one’s vital Gu was way more beneficial than the Moonlight Gu.\nRight now the Liquor worm was glued to a bamboo pole merely 50-60 steps away from Fang Yuan. He held his breath, not closing in rashly, but slowly walking backwards.\nHe knew his distance was very near, but to really catch a Liquor worm directly it was an incredibly difficult task for a Gu Master who just opened the primeval aperture like him. You could say, there was totally no hope of success.\nFang Yuan’s was unable to see the Liquor worm clearly, but in the darkness he could feel the Liquor worm directing its vigilance at him. He slowly backed away gently, trying his best not to disturb the Liquor worm.\nHe knew that if the Liquor worm was to fly away, he could never catch up with his own speed. He needed to wait until the Liquor worm drank until it was drunk, and then with its flying speed slowed down he would have a chance to catch it.\nSeeing Fang Yuan retreated further away, the Liquor worm crawling on the bamboo pole stirred. The strong aroma of wine before it was so tempting, so attracting, making the worm lost in a reverie. If it had saliva, it would have long been drooling a pool of saliva around it.\nBut the Liquor worm was incredibly wary and vigilant. Only after Fang Yuan retreated 200 steps back did it shrink a little and bounced into the air. When it fluttered high in the air, its body curled up into a ball, looking like a small and white rice dumpling. The little dumpling swept across the air in a round arc, floating down onto the grass that was sprinkled with green bamboo wine earlier.\nWith delicious food right before its eyes, the Liquor worm dropped its guard. It impatiently climbed onto a flower bud filled with some wine and popped its little head in, only leaving a chubby tail on the outside.\nThe Liquor worm was ravenous, and the green bamboo wine was so delicious. It opened its mouth wide and inhaled, very quickly lost in the deliciousness of its food, totally forgetting about Fang Yuan.\nAt this moment, Fang Yuan started to approach cautiously. He could see the tail of the Liquor worm outside the flower bud. This tail was just like a silkworm’s tail, chubby and rounded. The light it emitted made people think of a pearl.\nAt first the Liquor worm’s tail was hanging outside, unmoving. Then after a while this tail started to curl upwards, showing that it was drinking really happily. At the end when Fang Yuan was only ten steps away, its tail started wagging and swinging with a cheerful rhythm.\nIt was totally drunk!\nSeeing this made Fang Yuan nearly laugh out. He did not continue walking forward, but patiently waited. If he rushed over right now he would definitely have a huge chance on catching the Liquor worm, but Fang Yuan’s intention was to have this Liquor worm guide him to the Flower Wine Monk’s remains.\nIn a moment the Liquor worm withdrew from the flower bud. Its body was fatter and its head swayed about, resembling a drunken man. Unexpectedly it did not realize Fang Yuan’s presence. It climbed up onto another bright yellow flower and perched on the stamen, feeding heartily on the wine droplets there.\nThis time after it had finished drinking, it finally felt full. Its body slowly shrank into a round ball and slowly flew up. When it was 1.5 meters above the ground, it leisurely flew in the direction of the deeper part of the bamboo forest.\nFang Yuan quickly followed after its trail.\nThe Liquor worm was already heavily drunk, making it fly slower by half of its usual speed. Even though this was the case, Fang Yuan still had to run with all his might to follow after its shadow.\nThe night was washing past his vision as the young teenager ran in the bamboo forest, chasing after a small bead of snow not far ahead.\nThe moonlight was gentle, the breeze slow and steady. In the bamboo forest that was like a clear pond, the stalks of green spear bamboo flashed past before his eyes, quickly falling behind him. The ground was a green carpet of grass, riddled with blossoming wild flowers. There were small stones with moss growing, and the yellow shoots of bamboo.\nFang Yuan’s faint shadow was also speeding ahead on the ground, passing through the shadows that each stalk of bamboo cast on the earth like a black line. He tightly kept his sight on the bead of snow, gulping in huge amounts of fresh mountain air, ordering his legs to catch up in the midst of faint wine aroma in the air.\nBecause of his speed, the moonlight looked like water to his eyes. Light and shadow moved frequently, like he was galloping in water filled with seaweed.\nThe Liquor worm flew out of the bamboo forest, and so did Fang Yuan. A sea of white flowers with a yellow spot in the middle borrowed the wind from his feet, scattering their petals. A group of Dragonpill crickets resembling a flowing poem just so happened to move to the front; as Fang Yuan dashed through there was a swoosh and a red cloud bloomed before him, dispersing about a sea of red star fireflies that emerged from the cloud.\nA quiet mountain stream paved with pebbles, the gurgling water surface reflecting the spring moon in the night sky; with a few splashes Fang Yuan waded across, creating thousands of silver coloured ripples.\nIt was a pity that this stream, after so many ages, had its beautiful and precious stones trampled upon and broken.\nFang Yuan was in hot pursuit, firmly following behind the Liquor worm. Going upward the mountain stream, he could already hear the sound of a waterfall. After he turned around a sparse forest, he saw the Liquor worm fly into a crevice in the middle of a boulder.\nFang Yuan’s eyes lit up and he stopped in his tracks.\n“So it’s here.” He panted heavily, his heart beating against his chest like mad. With this one stop he could feel his entire body covered in sweat, hot air surging throughout his body accompanying his accelerating blood flow.\nLooking around, he found that this place was a shallow benchland (1).\nPebbles of various sizes covered the ground, the river surface barely covering over the small stones. There were also blocks of gray boulders scattered freely in the area.\nBehind Qing Mao Mountain was a huge waterfall. The flow of the waterfall varied with the weather; it plummeted down to the earth, pounding out a deep pool. Beside the deep pool was the Bai Clan Village, a clan with powerful influence that was comparable to the Gu Yue village.\nThe waterfall branched out to many smaller branches, and it was apparent that Fang Yuan was facing one of the many branches of a branch. On normal occasions this benchland was dry, but due to the recent heavy rainfall that went on for three days and three nights, a shallow stream formed here.\nThe source of the flowing stream was from the huge boulder that the Liquor worm had entered into earlier.\nThe boulder leaned against a vertical mountain wall. Small waterfalls that branched away from the main waterfall were like silver pythons that flowed down the mountain wall, hitting onto the boulder. After a considerably long time the middle of this huge boulder had eroded away and formed a crevice.\nAt this time as the waterfall washed down, the water current gently roared. It was like a white curtain, completely obstructing the gap in the boulder.\nAfter observing his surroundings, Fang Yuan’s breathing was no longer anxious. His eyes flashed with a hint of resolve; he walked to the boulder and took in a deep breath, and then he rushed in headfirst.\nThe boulder gap was rather large, and two adult humans could walk side by side in it with no problems. What more to say with Fang Yuan, who was merely a 15-year-old teenage boy?\nOnce he rushed in, the rapid currents pressured down on Fang Yuan’s body. At the same time the cold water quickly drenched him from head to toe. Fang Yuan battled against the water pressure, moving in quick steps forward. As he walked a few dozen steps, the water pressure started to lessen.\nBut the space in the fissure also began to shrink, and Fang Yuan could only walk sideways. His ears were filled with the roaring of the water, the top of his head was a sheet of white, and deeper into the boulder was a black darkness.\nWhat was hiding in the darkness?\nIt could be a poisonous serpent, but it could also be a poisonous gecko. Perhaps it was a trap set by the Flower Wine Monk, or perhaps it was empty.\nFang Yuan could only continue forward by walking sideways, slowly edging into the darkness. The water no longer washed over his head; the stone walls were covered in moss, grazing against his skin, feeling slippery. Soon he was swallowed by the darkness, and the stone crevice became narrower, squeezing around him. Gradually even his skull could not rotate freely. Still Fang Yuan gritted his teeth and continued forward.\nAfter walking another twenty more steps, he realized that there was a red shade of light in the darkness. At first, he thought it was an illusion. But when he blinked and focused, he began to confirm that this was indeed light!\nThis realization made him renew his spirit.\nHe continued walking for another fifty to sixty steps, the red light growing brighter. In his eyes the light slowly expanded into a long, vertical and fine seam.\nHe stretched out his left arm, suddenly feeling that the wall in front had bent away. Instantly he rejoiced, knowing that there was an enclosed space inside the huge boulder. With another few steps he finally rushed into this light seam.\nHis eyes were greeted with the sight of an approximately 80meters² wide enclosure.\n“I have been walking for so long. With this distance I’d have long passed the boulder, so I should be in the heart of the mountain cliff right now.” As he sized up this hidden space, he moved his hands and legs about, stretching his limbs.\nThe entire room was filled with dim red light, but he could not tell where the light was coming from. The stone walls were damp and covered in moss, but the air here was very dry. On the walls there was also a few withering vines. The vines intertwined with each other, weaving across half of the wall surface. There were even a few withering flowers growing on the vines.\nFang Yuan looked at the remnants of these flowers and leaves, feeling somewhat familiar.\n“These are Wine Sack Flower Gu, and Rice Pouch Grass Gu.” Suddenly a thought had crossed his mind and he was able to recognize these withering stems and vines.\nGu came in many shapes and forms. Some were like mineral rocks such as the blue crystal form of the Moonlight Gu. Some came in the forms of worms, such as the silkworm-like Liquor worm. There were also flowery grassy types, just like the Wine Sack Flower Gu and the Rice Pouch Grass Gu before Fang Yuan.\nThese two types of Gu were Rank one natural Gu. Just with pouring in primeval essence would they be able to grow. After growing up the middle of the flower would secrete flower nectar wine, and the grass pouch would grow out fragrant rice.\nFang Yuan moved his line of sight along the vines, and sure enough he discovered a heap of withered roots gathered into a ball-shaped clump at a corner. The Liquor worm was resting on the clump of dead roots, sleeping soundly. It was already within easy reach.\nFang Yuan walked over and took the Liquor worm into his arms. Then he got onto his knees and pulled the dead vines apart, discovering a pile of skeleton bones bundled inside.\n“I’ve finally found you, Flower Wine Monk.” There was a smile on his lips as he saw this.\nJust as he was about to reach his hand out and strip away the remaining vines, suddenly-\n“Try touching it?” A voice full of murderous intent suddenly sounded behind Fang Yuan.\n(1) Benchland : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bench_(geology)",

      "content": "Chapter 15: History is written by the victorious\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nIn this secret cave, someone’s voice loomed behind all of a sudden.\nEven when it came to Fang Yuan he could feel the hairs on the back of his neck standing, his scalp numb.\nHe had been followed!\nCould it be that him repeatedly going out these few days had aroused the suspicion and attention of people?\nOr was it someone sent by his uncle?\nIn his mind he even thought of the Rank one Gu Master that he encountered in the inn, the young man called Jiang Ya.\nIn that short moment his mind flashed countless ideas and guesses, in addition to thinking of a solution.\nFang Yuan could feel that in the short sentence, it was full of deep murderous intent. This made him secretly groan – He was only a Rank one initial stage right now, and he did not even have a vital Gu. To a Gu Master this was the equivalent of having zero fighting ability, how was he supposed to fight?\n“Too weak, too weak!” He roared in his head.\n“You have already been poisoned by my Single Gate Poison Gu. Without my other Gu that acts as the counterpart to it, after seven days you will turn into pus and blood and die,” the voice said behind him.\nFang Yuan gritted his teeth, his expression cold. He said in a low tone, “You want the Liquor worm? I can give it to you.”\nHe slowly stood up, his actions careful. But at this moment, another voice appeared. This voice was full of fear, and said in a tremble, “ I’ll give it, I can give you anything, please just spare my life, O Flower Wine Monk!”\n“Wait a minute, this is...” Fang Yuan frowned and suddenly turned around in realization. He was met with the sight of light and shadow changing and fluctuating on the wall in front of him, a picture emerging.\nA lean and threatening Gu Master was standing at the top of a mountain; there was another Gu Master prostrating before him. Around the two Gu Masters was a collapsed pit, fragments and chunks of stone littering the area, showing the obvious scene of a fierce battle that just ended.\nNot far away from them was a group of old onlookers, their faces filled with anger and fear.\nIn the middle of the scene, the victorious Gu Master lifted his head upwards and laughed loudly. “Ha ha ha, Gu Yue’s hero, cultivating to Rank five at such a young age. I thought you were quite something at first, but I didn’t expect you to be so unbearable. Hmph!”\nThe laughing Gu Master had long and thin eyes. He was dressed in long pink robes, his huge and wide sleeves swaying with the wind. The area where his robes intersected around his neck was loose and wide open, revealing his strong and pale chest muscles. The most eye-catching part of him was his bald head, shining without a single strand of hair.\n“The Flower Wine Monk!” Fang Yuan immediately recognized the identity of this Gu Master.\n“To compare myself to Sir Flower Wine, I’m just a fart! I must have been unwell in the head, to actually not recognize such a great person and offended Sir Flower Wine. Sir Flower Wine, please remember my clan’s generous hospitality earlier and spare my life!” The Gu Master prostrating on the ground was shaking, cold sweat all over, tears and mucus mixing as he begged for mercy.\nFang Yuan narrowed his eyes and carefully distinguished the two, realizing that the other Gu Master was wearing the Gu Yue clan head uniform. Looking at the appearance, it was clear that this person was the fourth generation clan leader!\nAs for those aged onlookers, they were probably the clan elders of that generation.\n“Hehe, generous hospitality? You sure have the guts to say it! I was actually sincere in coming to trade with you, using primeval stones to buy your clan’s moon orchids with a fair price. It was you who was harboring evil intentions, pretending to greet and take me in, telling me to take a seat at your banquet, intending to lace my liquor with a poisonous Gu. You all have been looking down on me way too much, I have made a living under the sky with the name of Flower Wine, how could I possibly be poisoned this way?”\nThe Flower Wine Monk pointed at the kneeling fourth generation clan leader, sneering, “If you cooperated fairly none of this would have happened. In the end you just wanted to use my head to raise your reputation and fame, you only have yourself to blame for dying!”\n“Sir, please spare my worthless life!” The fourth generation clan head shouted in dismay, his knees scraping against the ground, he quickly crawled over to the Flower Wine Monk’s feet and hugged against his thigh.\n“Sir, my clan has a spirit spring which produces primeval stones, we also planted huge numbers of moon orchids in an underground cave. I am willing to take in your Enslavement Gu and become your servant, my life and death are at a whim, I am willing to devote a lifelong servitude to you sir!”\nFang Yuan watched speechlessly, while the few elders in the picture looked even more uncertain.\nThe Flower Wine Monk narrowed his eyes, his anger had already calmed down. His eyes flashed and he said, “Hmph, the Enslavement Gu is precious beyond reasoning, it is a Rank five Gu, do you really think I would have one? However you have been infected by my Single Gate Poison Gu, only I can cure the poison so I’m not afraid of you disobeying. Since that is the case, your clan has to give me 3,000 stalks of moon orchids every week, also 3,000 primeval stones. I will come around every now and then to pick up the goods and temporarily cure your poison, sparing your useless life.”\n“Thank you so much for your mercy, sir! Thank you so much for your mercy, sir!” The fourth generation clan head cried repeatedly, kowtowing non-stop. His head bled continuously as it bumped against the mountain rock.\n“Hmph, stop kowtowing, I despise groveling people like you the most! What so called Gu Yue genius, strong Rank five fighter, how unworthy of your name. You better serve me properly. This is also regarding your life... Urgh!” The Flower Wine Monk suddenly cried out, his face making a horrified expression.\nHe kicked away the fourth generation clan head with his leg, his body swaying. He frantically backtracked a few big steps, yelling at the fourth generation clan head, “How do you still have Gu?”\nThe fourth generation clan head was kicked at the pit of his stomach and he spat out a mouthful of blood. He got up with a painstaking effort, his face revealing a scheming smile. “Heh heh heh, anybody has the right to punish people of the Demonic Faction! This Gu is called Moonshadow, it is the best at hiding. Even though it is only Rank four, but it has the ability to restrict the usage of the primeval sea and primeval essence. Demon, you and I have been fighting fiercely, you don’t have many Gu on you anymore, how could you possibly restrain the Moonshadow Gu? Just obediently surrender and become my servant, as long as you serve me until I am happy, you will still have a chance to live!”\nThe Flower Wine Monk flew into a rage and roared, “To hell with you!!”\nHis voice had barely faltered away when his body surged forward like a bolt of electricity, a punch landing onto the fourth generation clan head’s heart.\nThe fourth generation clan leader did not expect the Flower Wine Monk to be so radical; even if his primeval sea was threatened, the Flower Wine Monk was unwilling to compromise. A huge force came and he flew into the air, his body falling onto the ground like a broken sack.\nThump.\nHe spouted out a huge mouthful of fresh blood, the red liquid mingled with countless bits of internal organs.\n“Have you gone mad, we could have totally settled this over a discussion...” He stared daggers at the Flower Wine Monk, his lips moving with great effort. His sentence went unfinished, for his legs gave way and his head crooked to the side. He died.\n“Clan head!”\n“Men of the Demonic path are all insane.”\n“Kill him, kill this demon. Avenge the clan leader!”\n“He has been inflicted by the Moonshadow Gu, he can’t just simply use his primeval essence anymore, over a time even his primeval essence will be threatened.”\nThe elders who were watching at the sidelines all roared in fury and swarmed the area.\n“Ha ha ha, all those who are looking for death, come!” The Flower Wine Monk cried into the air. Facing the elders charging at him, he rushed at them headfirst.\nA fierce battle ensued and the Flower Wine Monk quickly had the upper hand. Very soon all the elders had collapsed onto the ground, some of them injured and the rest dead. Just as the Flower Wine Monk was about to finish off the surviving elders, his facial expression suddenly changed and he covered a hand over his abdomen. “Damn!”\n“I’ll come back in future to deal with you lot,” said the Flower Wine Monk. He stared daggers at a few of the elders and his body moved like electricity as he fled into the mountain woods, disappearing without a trace in the blink of an eye.",

Without my other Gu that acts as the counterpart to it, after seven days you will turn into pus and blood and die.”\n“To compare myself to Sir Flower Wine, I’m just a fart! I must have been unwell in the head, to actually not recognize such a great person and offended Sir Flower Wine. Sir Flower Wine, please remember my clan’s generous hospitality earlier and spare my life!”\nThe scene replayed itself over for the second time on the wall. Fang Yuan remained silent; when the motion picture started to repeat itself for the third time he finally sighed faintly and said, “I see.”\nThis method of leaving a moving picture with sound on the wall was probably the Flower Wine Monk’s doing with the help of a Photo-audio Gu. This Gu was able to record down imagery and project it out later.\nThe Photo-audio Gu fed on light and sound to survive. For some unknown reason this secret cave emitted red light, while at the same time the stone crevice was connected to the outside world, so it would not completely isolate the sounds outside. Right now Fang Yuan could still hear the roaring of the smaller waterfalls. Thus the Photo-audio Gu was able to live on in this secret cave.\nA moment ago when Fang Yuan ripped away the withered vines, he had probably alarmed the Photo-audio Guhiding in the stone wall. As long as one is not stupid, with mere guesswork one could tell that this moving image was authentic.\nBack then, the fourth generation clan head tried to plot against the Flower Wine Monk but he failed. After he lost in the battle he tried a sneak attack; even though it repelled away the latter, he eventually died because of it. This part of history was considered disgraceful, and the remaining surviving clan elders decided to tamper with the truth.\nThey reversed the roles of the fourth generation clan head and the Flower Wine Monk.\nThe Flower Wine Monk became the one who was defeated in battle and tried a sneak attack, and later died on the spot. On the other hand, the fourth generation leader was turned into the justified and perfect hero.\nBut this story itself had a big loophole – The Flower Wine Monk had clearly died on the spot, so his corpse should be in the hands of the Gu Yue clan, but why was another pile of remains found?\nIn his previous life, the Gu Master who found it had probably been terrified after seeing the moving image. Those surviving elders had long been dead, but to prevent the truth of the Flower Wine Monk from returning, this truth was probably kept secret by the top brass of the clan.\nThat Gu Master realized that if he single handedly took the treasure it would be a huge risk. If people investigated and found that he was involved with the Flower Wine Monk in future, the top brass would naturally execute him. Thus after making his choice, he did not dare to hide away this treasure, but instead make a decision to notify the top brass.\nBy doing so it would prove his loyalty to the clan. His subsequent circumstances would also show that he made a wise choice.\nHowever even if he did that, it didn’t mean that Fang Yuan would do the same.\n“I went through a pretty rough time searching for this treasure, so I should take everything for myself. Why should I share it with others? So what if I’ve been found out? Without braving the risks, where would you get profit? That Gu master is really cowardly,” Fang Yuan smiled coldly, no longer caring about the moving image that kept repeating on the stone wall. He turned around and stretched his hand, using his strength to pull apart the dead vines and roots.\nThe Flower Wine Monk’s remains were also affected. It was originally intact, but right now it was being broken into several pieces. Fang Yuan could hardly care; he kicked away a piece of leg bone that was in the way and squatted again, searching through the remains.\nFirstly he found a bag of primeval stones. When he opened them he only found fifteen pieces.\n“Old miser,” Fang Yuan spat. The Flower Wine Monk’s outer appearance looked flashy, but unexpectedly he only had so little money put aside.\nHowever he quickly thought of the reason – The Flower Wine Monk went through a fierce battle, add on to the fact that he got tainted by the Moonshadow Gu, so he would definitely have used primeval stones to heal his injuries. To be able to leave behind fifteen pieces was actually not bad already.\nAfter that he found a few dead Gu remains. Most of them were flower and grass variety, and had all completely withered away. Gu are also living creatures, so they also need food to survive, and most of them are picky. Though the grass Gu and flower Gu need less food, but in this secret cave there was not even a single ray of sunshine.\nAnd after that...\nAfter that, there was nothing.\nThe Flower Wine Monk was on the same level as the fourth generation clan leader. After fighting a fierce battle, he fought with around ten elders right after. His own Gu were mostly consumed, and up to this stage as he wanted to heal his injuries, he grew the Wine Sack Flower Gu and the Rice Pouch Grass Gu here. Yet in the end because of the Moonshadow Gu he was dragged to death.\nAfter three hundred year, the Gu in his possession also died away. The only ones left were the Photo-audio Guon the wall and the Liquor worm.\nThis Liquor worm was probably reliant on the Wine Sack Flower Gu and barely lived through until today. But as the Wine Sack Flower Gu withered away one by one, it also lost its food supply.\nThis prompted the Liquor worm to go outside and look for wild Wine Sack Flowers. Then in this night, it was attracted by the aroma of the green bamboo wine and came before Fang Yuan.\n“The Photo-audio Gu can only record once, since it’s a one-time use Gu. Looks like the Liquor worm is my greatest gain here, no wonder that Gu Master decided to report to the clan. Looks like it was because the profit was too small, and not worth such a huge risk.” A sort of understanding rose into Fang Yuan’s heart.\nIn his memories, that Gu Master was already Rank three, while the Liquor worm was just a Rank one Gu. To Fang Yuan it was more precious, but to that Gu Master it was pretty much nothing.\nHowever it was clear that due to his report, the clan gave him a big reward.\n“Should I also tell the clan?” Fang Yuan thought for a moment, then he pushed away this idea.\nThe Flower Wine Monk’s treasure seemed to be just the Liquor worm and the primeval stones, but that was not the case. The most valuable thing was actually the wall that hid the Photo-audio Gu. In other words, it was the moving image that did not stop repeating on the wall.\nThis image could entirely be sold to other villages. Trust in the fact that the top brass of the two other villages on Qing Mao Mountain must be very interested in this sort of evidence that could strike hard onto the conviction of a clan.\nWhat?\nYou said something about a sense of loyalty and honour to the clan?\nI’m so sorry, Fang Yuan does not have one bit of that.\nMoreover this moving image isn’t even some kind of strong force that can destroy the entire clan; it won’t do much substantial damage. The indifferent nature of the clan will also not look at Fang Yuan with importance. He needed to rely on his own hard work and find cultivation resources, in the early stage of cultivation he needed to borrow the powers around him more.\n“Count on the clan? Heh heh.” Fang Yuan sneered in his heart, “How can I be so naïve like my past life.”\nDo not depend on anyone; you must rely on yourself on everything in this world.\nAfter making sure that he had ransacked every corner of the cave, Fang Yuan began his way back following the original road home.\nHolding against the water pressure and squeezing past the boulder, he returned outside the mountain. Looking back at this huge boulder, Fang Yuan suddenly thought of his past life. It was said that the remains were found in an underground secret cave. But how was this place underground? It was clearly in the inside of the mountain wall.\nNo wonder he couldn’t find it for seven days straight even though he wasted so much effort. Looks like in his past life after the clan found out about this place, the first thing they did was to destroy the wall with the image, and then go about spreading a truth riddled with lies to mislead the clanspeople.\nTo be able to find this place tonight was partly due to luck, partly due to hard work, and the biggest reason would be the green bamboo wine.\nThis green bamboo wine was really rich, it could be said to be the best in Qing Mao Mountain. Perhaps in his past life, after that Gu Master lost his lover, the wine that he had been drinking was this wine.\nBut all of this was no longer important. The Flower Wine Monk’s treasure had been unearthed and ransacked by Fang Yuan; although in the end it was rather disappointing, it was also reasonable. The most important was that Fang Yuan’s original goal (Liquor worm) was in his hands, and the item he needed the most (primeval stones) was also gotten.\n“Next up, I will need to set my heart on holing myself in the inn refining this Gu. As long as I have a vital Gu I can return to the academy and be qualified to stay in the academy dormitories. I’ll also be able to borrow the clan resources to cultivate. I can only stay in this inn for one or two times; if I stay too long the cost is too much.” Fang Yuan pondered, his footsteps never ceasing as he hurried back to the village.\nHe was originally left with two primeval stones, but now he gained fifteen pieces, so the total is seventeen pieces. But to a Gu Master, this small amount of primeval stones mean nothing.",

      "content": "Chapter 17: Starting to refine the Liquor worm\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\n“With my C grade talent, the amount of my primeval sea in the aperture is only 44%. The speed of Gu using up primeval essence is way faster than my own recovery rate. If I want to refine a Gu I would need to borrow external help, which means I need to waste primeval stones.”\n“The weaker the Gu’s will, the smaller the resistance, the easier it becomes for me to refine it. However any living creature will always have the will to live. To refine the Moonlight Gu I would at least require five primeval stones, at the most I’d need eight pieces.”\n“Right now to refine the Liquor worm, I would need at least eleven pieces, at the most I would need sixteen pieces.” Although the Liquor worm was also a Rank one Gu like the Moonlight Gu, but it was definitely rarer. Thus the difficulty of the refinement process also increased.\nIn other words, even though right now Fang Yuan had seventeen primeval stones, but just to refine the Liquor worm he would at most be left with six pieces, or at least one primeval stone.\nIn the night, the bright crescent gave off clear and pure moonlight. The moonlight was like the lady saint’s gentle hand, lightly stroking over the Gu Yue Village. Along the way the bamboo houses were like jade, standing in great numbers. The night breeze blew slowly.\nUnder this moonlight, Fang Yuan found his way back to the inn. The inn door had already closed. Fang Yuan banged on the door.\n“I hear you! I hear you! Who is it, knocking on the door at this late time...” The inn worker grumbled as he opened the door, his eyes puffy from sleep.\nBut when he saw Fang Yuan standing at the door, all the displeasure and sleepiness from his expression changed, and he bent his waist and said with a flattering smile,” “Ah, it’s his young lordship. This little one is very lucky to be able to open the door for his lordship.”\nFang Yuan nodded his head, his expression cold with indifference, and walked into the inn.\nHis expression made the worker laugh in a more humble manner, and he took the initiative to ask, “My lord, are you hungry? Would you like me to notify the kitchens and make some small dishes for you as supper?”\n“No need,” Fang Yuan shook his head and only ordered, “ Go and prepare some hot water for me, I would like to wash myself.”\n“Yes!” The worker immediately nodded, “My lord, go on to your room first. I guarantee you, the hot water will be sent over immediately.”\nFang Yuan let out a noise of approval and went up the stairs, heading towards the second floor. The worker watched Fang Yuan’s back, his two eyes glittering in the light, revealing an expression of jealousy.\n“This is a Gu Master, oh if only I had the talent to cultivate, how good that would be!” He shook his fists, sighing deeply. These words floated into Fang Yuan’s ears and he smiled bitterly in his heart.\nA Gu Master had the power to transcend mortals, becoming a man above men, but in this process the price that was to be paid was also very high.\nThe first difficult problem was financial resources. A Gu Master needed primeval stones to cultivate, battles also required primeval stones, refining Gu also needed primeval stones, trading was also not an exception.\nWithout primeval stones, how could cultivation be possible?\nThis point was a difficult position that, being an ordinary mortal who watched from the sidelines, the inn worker would not understand.\nJust like earlier in the evening, the young Gu Master Jiang Ya vented his anger and displeasure on the hunters when he dropped their wine jars. His meaning was – He himself could not bear to spend primeval stones to drink this green bamboo wine, yet these hunters who were just ordinary men actually had such money to spare!\nTo take a glimpse at the whole picture, just that meaning alone could tell a lot about the cultivation situation of a Gu Master. The strength of a Gu Master was great, they achieved more than a common mortal, but the price was also great. Many a time using every single piece of primeval stone needed great consideration, especially when it came to lower ranked Gu Masters. Do not be fooled by the glorious surface; in reality the life of a Gu Master is constantly strained by money.\n“Not to mention, as the realm of a Gu Master increases, the resources they require also increase. Without proper backing it is very difficult for a Gu Master’s road to cultivation.” Fang Yuan thought of his previous life and had deep understanding of this reality.\nHe returned to his room. Just after he lit the lamp, the inn worker came up with a basin of hot water. Of course, there were cloth towels and other toiletries.\nFang Yuan let the worker leave and closed the room door. He put down the door latch, washed himself and got up to his bed.\nAlthough his body was feeling a little tired, his heart still flared with a surge of excitement. “I finally got my hands on the Liquor worm. The Liquor worm is rarer than the Moonlight Gu, because in a sense it is a Gu that increase a Gu Master’s latent talent!”\nFang Yuan sat cross-legged on the bed and took out the Liquor worm. The Liquor worm was still sleeping soundly. Its body size was slightly bigger than the Moonlight Gu, soft and white like a silkworm.\nUnder the light its body was shrouded in a layer of faint wavering light, just like a pearl’s mellow luster. Two little eyes resembling two black sesame seeds were mounted on its chubby white head, making it appear charmingly naïve.\nPlaced in his hand, it was not heavy. Its weight was about half a chicken egg. When smelling it carefully, its body exuded a whiff of wine aroma. This fragrance was not the aroma of green bamboo wine but the Liquor worm’s own fragrance. The smell was faint and misty, as if it was not there. Fang Yuan’s nose twitched as he inhaled the fragrance of the Liquor worm.\nThe wine fragrance moved straight downwards into the aperture, entering into the green copper primeval sea. The primeval sea surged and rippled for a moment, quickly absorbing in the wine. A gleam of pure and refined primeval essence was produced.\nThe other primeval essence had an emerald green color, shining with a metallic copper luster. However this primeval essence was a pale green, and it was more condensed than the original primeval essence. This was the primeval essence that a Rank one middle stage Gu Master could produce.\nAware of this gleam of pale green primeval essence in his green copper sea, Fang Yuan revealed a satisfied smile. “Right now my cultivation base is just that of a Rank one initial stage. But with the Liquor worm’s condensing, after the primeval essence is refined I will be able to have Rank one middle realm primeval essence. The beauty of this benefit is something that cannot be said in one or two sentences.”\nBut very soon, he took back his smile. “However right now I have yet to fully master the Liquor worm. It is only when I refine the Liquor worm and turn it into my vital Gu, then I will be able to freely use it and later on with maximum efficiency, refine my primeval essence.”\nThinking up to this point, he no longer hesitated and began to draw out a jet of green copper primeval essence from his primeval sea. The primeval essence tightly wrapped around the Liquor worm, bringing it into the air before Fang Yuan, and started to invade its body.\nThe Liquor worm felt its life at danger and woke up immediately. It began to struggle violently, using its own power to drive out Fang Yuan’s primeval essence.\n“This Liquor worm has a really strong resistance.” Fang Yuan’s complexion turned grave as he felt the consumption rate of his primeval essence go beyond more than double of what the Moonlight Gu had consumed.\n“No matter what, I have to refine the Liquor worm.” His two eyes flashed with a firm light as he continued pouring primeval essence into the Liquor worm.\nIn the room, the candles on the table quietly burned, shining a bright light in the middle of the room while the far corners of the walls were dark. The candlelight radiated on Fang Yuan’s face but he had already closed his eyes, gathering all his focus onto the Liquor worm.\nA continuous jet of green-copper coloured primeval essence that resembled a jet of mist emitted out from Fang Yuan’s whole body, then it gathered together and firmly wrapped around the Liquor worm. The Liquor worm hovered in the air, its distance less than a feet away from Fang Yuan’s face. It struggled with all its might in the midst of the green copper primeval essence.\nTime slipped away quietly.\nAs the candles burned they became smaller and the light grew dimmer. The crescent outside the window had slowly gone down, and then a new day arrived.\nThe morning light squeezed through the narrow crack in the window and shone into the room. It was like the window had a light edge.\nFang Yuan opened his eyes and looked at the Liquor worm in front of him. The Liquor worm’s white body had a shade of green colour. This was the result of Fang Yuan’s effort after half a night. However it was clear that this volume of green colour was not even 1% of the Liquor worm’s body.\nFang Yuan’s face looked grave. This Liquor worm’s will was way too tenacious and its resistance was incredibly strong; simply put this was beyond a Rank one Gu’s boundary.\n“This Gu was most probably the Flower Wine Monk’s vital Gu. The Flower Wine Monk was a Rank five master, so this Liquor worm was originally Rank five, but because it went through all those years without enough food, pretty much full in one moment and starving in the next, so its grade also fell. Right now it is left at the level of Rank one, yet its will is still as tough as a rock!”\nFang Yuan had guessed the truth.\nThis Liquor worm was originally the Flower Wine Monk’s vital Gu. Its original will had been wiped clean and refined to the end; it had accompanied the Flower Wine Monk throughout all his battles, passing through the underground world.\nAfter the Flower Wine Monk died, his strong will continued existing in the Liquor worm. Right now with Fang Yuan trying to refine the Liquor worm, it actually meant fighting against the Flower Wine Monk’s will.\nThis was way more difficult than trying to refine a natural Gu.\nA human’s will is generally stronger than a natural Gu. When facing death humans were able to produce strength that even they themselves could not imagine. Not to mention that the Flower Wine Monk was a master of the Demonic faction. He came and went by himself, going up and down the underground world. His will was more tenacious than the masters of his level from the Righteous faction.\n“To refine this Liquor worm in a month is impossible, unless there is a strong master who can use a Rank two or Rank three Gu’s breath to pressure this Liquor worm and suppress the will inside the worm’s body to the lowest limit. Under this kind of help then will I be able to do twice as much with half the effort.” As he pondered, Fang Yuan could not help but sigh.\nHis parents had died while his aunt and uncle were plotting against him. He himself did not have any backing, so where could he possibly find external aid?\nIf he had A grade talent there might still be a chance, but he was only a C grade talent. Everyone in the clan were not optimistic about him, so who would be willing to expend such energy to come and help him?\nMore crucially, he could not expose the existence of the Liquor worm.\nThere was no Liquor worm in the Gu Yue Village, and Fang Yuan was not able to explain about the origins of this Liquor worm. If it was exposed, there was a huge possibility that the top brass would find out and link it to the case of the Flower Wine Monk. It was too easy to think of a relationship between the two.\n“Based on this fact, seventeen primeval stones will not be enough. I’d need at least thirty primeval stones! How troublesome, but no matter how hard it is I will still want to refine this Liquor worm.” Fang Yuan’s own will was like metal, and he was already determined to refine the Liquor worm.\nThe importance of the vital Gu was huge. It would greatly influence the future of a Gu Master’s cultivation direction. Although the Liquor worm was not the world’s best choice for a vital Gu, it was still much better than the Moonlight Gu. It was also the best option in Fang Yuan’s present situation.\nGrowl...\nAt this moment Fang Yuan’s stomach came up with a cry of protest.\nAfter a whole night without sleep and putting full effort into refining the Liquor worm, Fang Yuan was naturally hungry.\n“I guess I’ll go and fill my stomach first and think of a way to accumulate primeval stones.” Fang Yuan rubbed his belly and went downstairs. He went to the cafeteria and picked a seat at the corner, ordering a few kinds of breakfast dishes.\nJust as he was beginning to eat, his younger brother Gu Yue Fang Zheng appeared.\n“Big brother, why are you staying at the inn, why didn’t you go back home and sleep last night?” His brother was very straightforward, his tone carrying the implication that it was demanding for an explanation.",

      "content": "Chapter 18: Let the past disperse away like smoke\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nFaced with his brother’s question, Fang Yuan did not speak; he continued eating his breakfast. He knew his younger brother’s character – Fang Zheng was not someone who could keep in his composure.\nSure enough Fang Zheng saw that his older brother did not even bat an eye at him, as if Fang Yuan pretended he was air. In the next moment he called out in a tone full of unhappiness, “Big brother, what did you do to Shen Cui? Ever since she came out from your room yesterday, she cried all over the place. When I comforted her, she cried even more.”\nFang Yuan looked up at his younger brother, his face expressionless. Fang Zheng frowned, staring firmly at his older brother, waiting for his reply.\nThe atmosphere was growing tense.\nBut Fang Yuan just looked at him for a second before he lowered his head and continued eating.\nThe younger brother Fang Zheng was immediately flustered. Fang Yuan’s attitude was clearly an undisguised contempt towards him. Under shame and frustration he banged his hand on the table, roaring loudly, “Gu Yue Fang Yuan, how can you act like this! Shen Cui as a servant girl has served you for so many years; I have seen her gentleness and care towards you. Yes, I know you feel lost, and I can understand your dejected feelings. Yeah you’re just a C grade talent, but it doesn’t mean you can vent your anger on others just because of your own misfortune. This isn’t fair to her!”\nHe had barely finished when Fang Yuan stood up, raising his hand in a flash.\nSlap!\nWith a loud snap he gave Fang Zheng a solid smack.\nFang Zheng covered his right cheek, stumbling two steps backwards, his face full of shock.\n“Useless bastard, what kind of tone are you using to talk to your own older brother?! That Shen Cui is just a servant girl! Just because of a lowly girl like her you would forget that I am your older brother?” Fang Yuan reprimanded in a low voice.\nFang Zheng finally reacted, his stinging pain on his face surging through his nervous system in waves. He stared wide-eyed, his breathing rough as he said in disbelief, “Big brother, you hit me? From the time I was still young until I grew up, you have never hit me before! Yes, I was found out to be an A grade talent, you were just C grade. But you also cannot blame me for it, this is all the arrangement of heaven...”\nSlap!\nFang Zheng had not finished speaking, yet Fang Yuan used the back of his hand and smacked him again.\nFang Zheng covered both his cheeks with his two hands. He was stunned.\n“Naïve fool, do you still remember! From young till now, how did I take care of you? When our parents died, our life was hard. During New Year, aunt and uncle only gave us both one new robe, did I wear it? Who did I give it to wear? When you were small you loved to eat sweet porridge, I would tell the kitchens to make another bowl for you everyday. When you were bullied by others, who brought you back? Not to mention a ton of other things, I don’t feel like it is worth talking about. Well, right now because of a maid, you would talk to me like this, coming to question me?”\nFang Zheng’s face was red. His lips trembled, ashamed and annoyed, as well as surprised and angry. Yet he was unable to say a single word of rebuttal.\nBecause everything Fang Yuan said was the truth!\n“Whatever.” Fang Yuan sneered, “Since you even gave up your own biological parents and admitted someone else, what am I worth to you, as merely your big brother?”\n“Big brother, how can you say that. You also know that I have always longed for the warmth of a family since I was young, I...” Fang Zheng immediately explained.\nFang Yuan waved his hand, stopping his brother from continuing. “From today onwards, you are not my little brother, and I am no longer your older brother.”\n“Big brother!” Fang Zheng was surprised, opening his mouth to say more.\nAt this moment Fang Yuan spoke, “Don’t you like Shen Cui? Don’t worry; I didn’t do anything to her. She’s still a virgin, untouched and pure. Pass me six primeval stones and I’ll pass her to you, from today onwards she can be your personal maid.”\n“Big brother, why are you...” To have his inner thoughts revealed out loud so suddenly, Fang Zheng felt a surge of panic, feeling rather unprepared.\nBut at the same time his heart was assured. The one thing he was worried about the most did not come true.\nNot long ago in the night, Shen Cui personally served and washed him.\nEven though nothing important happened, Fang Zheng could not ever forget the gentleness of that night. Every time when he thought of Shen Cui, he would remember her skillful hands and her soft red lips, and his heart would throb.\nThe sincere feelings of youthfulness had long planted itself in the young man’s chest, starting to grow.\nThus when he learned about Shen Cui’s unusual state last evening, a bout of anger immediately burst from his heart. He instantly gave up refining his Moonlight Gu and turned the village inside out trying to find Fang Yuan, wanting to make a statement.\nSeeing Fang Zheng not replying, Fang Yuan frowned and said, “Love is very normal, be more honest. There’s no use hiding away. Of course, if you don’t want to exchange, then that’s fine.”\nFang Zheng was anxious on the spot. “I’ll exchange! Why would I not exchange. But the primeval stones on me are not enough for six anymore.”\nAs he said this, he took out his money pouch, his face red all over.\nFang Yuan took the pouch and found six pieces in it, but one of the stones among them was smaller than a normal primeval stone by half size. He immediately knew that Fang Zheng had absorbed the primeval essence from this stone to speed up the process of refining his Moonlight Gu. After all the more natural essence gets absorbed from the primeval stone, the smaller the stone becomes, and its weight will also become lighter.\nEven though it was just five pieces and a half, Fang Yuan knew: These were all the primeval stones that Fang Zheng had in his possession right now. Fang Zheng had no savings on his own, and these six primeval stones were what Aunt and Uncle had given to him not long ago.\n“I’ll keep these, you can go now.” Fang Yuan’s expression was cold as he tucked the bag away.\n“Big brother...” Fang Zheng wanted to say more.\nFang Yuan raised his eyebrows slightly, speaking in a slow and leisure manner, “Before I change my mind, you better disappear from my eyes.”\nFang Zheng felt his heart tighten. He gritted his teeth, and finally turned and left. When he stepped through the doorway of the inn, he subconsciously covered his chest with his hand, feeling a wave of uneasiness. There was a feeling that was telling him that he had just lost something very important.\nBut very quickly he felt hot as he thought of Shen Cui, and that dreamy night. “I can finally have you rightfully as mine, Cui Cui (1).” He did not look back, and walked out of Fang Yuan’s sight.\nFang Yuan stood expressionless; he stood for a long time, then he finally slowly sat down.\nThe bright sunlight passed through the window, shining onto his indifferent face, making those who saw this feel somewhat cold inside. The business in the cafeteria was rather poor, and the streets grew busier with people. The noise and excitement from the bustling crowd travelled over, making the place feel quieter. The dishes grew cold. A worker came up attentively, asking if Fang Yuan would like to reheat his breakfast.\nFang Yuan did not hear it. His gaze kept shifting like a cloud, as if he was reminiscing some old memories. The worker waited for a while. But as he saw Fang Yuan in a trance, never saying a single word, he could only rub his nose and walk away bitterly.\nAfter a long time, Fang Yuan’s eyes became focused again. The past memories in his heart were like smoke; they had already dispersed away.\nHe returned to reality once more. The sunlight that flowed in shone over half the table. The hot air that wafted out of the dishes had already disappeared, and the bustling noise of the crowd on the streets travelled into his ears.\nHe reached into his robes and patted the five-and-a-half primeval stones at his bosom, his mouth curling into a bitter and mocking smile. But the smile was quickly cast away.\n“Waiter, go and reheat these dishes for me.” Fang Yuan took a look at his dishes and faintly opened his mouth, shouting away. At this moment his eyes looked so chilly.\n“What! Your older brother really said that?” In the hall, Uncle frowned, his voice cold. Aunt sat aside, looking speechlessly at the fresh red handprint on Fang Zheng’s cheeks.\n“Yes, when I met big brother, he was at the inn eating breakfast. The entire thing went like this,” Fang Zheng replied politely.\nUncle’s frown deepened, all condensed into 3 black lines(2).\nAfter a few breaths he sighed and said in a solemn tone, “Fang Zheng my child, you must remember this. The maidservant Shen Cui is not Fang Yuan’s personal property; we assigned her to him. How can he use her as a trading item? If you wished for it, you should have told us earlier on. We would just assign her to you.”\n“Ah?” Fang Zheng was stunned as he listened to this.\nUncle waved his hand. “You can take your leave. You gave all your primeval stones to Fang Yuan, so I’ll just give you another six. Remember, use them properly on refining your Gu and seize number one. We will be very proud of you when you do.”\n“Father, your child is ashamed...” Fang Zheng was suddenly moved to tears. Uncle sighed and replied, “Just go, hurry back to your room and refine your Gu. You don’t have much time left.”\nWhen Fang Zheng took his leave, Uncle’s face revealed a ferocious and angry expression.\nBang!\nHe hit the table with his palm using great force, hissing, “Hmph, this damn bastard. He actually took our workers to do an exchange, he’s really cunning!”\nAunt advised, “Husband, calm your anger. It’s just six primeval stones.”\n“What do you understand, woman! This Fang Yuan is only a C grade talent, if he wants to refine the MoonlightGu he would need primeval stones. With his weak experience of a first timer, six primeval stones won’t be enough to refine it. But now that he has twelve pieces, it will be more than sufficient.” Uncle was so furious he gritted his teeth.\nHe added, “A Gu Master’s cultivation will very swift as long as there are enough resources and no obstacles. In two or three years, the clan will be able to produce a Rank two Gu Master. The lower Fang Yuan’s cultivation rank, the smaller his hopes of trying to seize the family inheritance one year later. Right now he is still young, just starting to cultivate. We shall hinder him and let his starting process fall behind those at his age. The academy resources are always awarded to excellent students. With his latent talent, once he falls back he won’t be able to get any resources. Without the help of resources his cultivation will fall even further. With this vicious cycle, I would like to see if he has the ability to inherit the family inheritance a year later!”\nAunt did not understand. “Even if we do not stop him, he would at most be at Rank one Middle stage a year later. Husband, your cultivation is at Rank two, why are you still afraid of him?”\nUncle was so angry he stomped and said, “Woman, you really are a case of ‘long hair but short insight’! With just my identity as the senior, should I really beat down the younger generation? If he wants to get back the inheritance, it is reasonable and cannot be stopped directly; I can only fight back using the clan rules. It is stated in the clan rules: To be head of the house at sixteen years old, the person must have at least Rank one middle stage cultivation. Otherwise it means that Fang Yuan will have no right to waste the clan resources. After I have said this, do you understand now?”\nAunt was enlightened.\nUncle narrowed his eyes, a glint in his gaze. He shook his head a little, sighing as he said, “Fang Yuan is just too smart, too cunning. He could even see through a power play. What kind of intellect is this? Scheming and calculating at such a young age, how terrorizing! Initially I was going to continue plotting against him, yet he moved out straight away. I wanted to further rely on Shen Cui to monitor and trouble him, but in the end he went away and even earned six primeval stones.”\n“Alas, if he could be as stupid as Fang Zheng, that would’ve been great. Oh right, from today onwards you must treat Fang Zheng better. He is an A grade talent after all. Not to mention I can see that he has feelings of dissatisfaction and unhappiness towards Fang Yuan. These emotions are a good thing; they must be guided properly. I have a sort of feeling that he will become the best tool to deal with Fang Yuan in future!”\nIn the blink of an eye, two days had passed.\nIn the room at the inn, there were no lights. The moonlight poured in, casting a color of frost. On the bed Fang Yuan sat cross-legged, his eyes closed. He moved his green copper primeval essence, concentrating his mind on refining the Liquor worm. On its body, a small cut had already been dyed the green color of green copper, but the Liquor worm’s will was still as tenacious as ever. It constantly struggled in the midst of the ethereal primeval essence.\nFang Yuan’s refining process was not going smoothly. It was very difficult.\n“I spent two days and two nights, only resting two hours each day, and I spent twelve pieces of primeval stone but only managed to refine around 1/15 of progress. Calculating according to the time, I guess someone will succeed in refining their Gu in these few days.”\nFang Yuan could see the situation clearly. However his talent was a poor grade anyway, add on the Liquor worm that he was trying to refine having an incredibly tenacious will to live; it was even stronger than a normal Moonlight Gu. The resulting situation of falling behind was normal.\n“A moment of falling behind is nothing, as long as I have the Liquor worm...” Fang Yuan’s heart was clear like a mirror, not a single trace of anxiety and discouragement in him. Suddenly, the Liquor worm curled up into a ball.\n“Oh no, the Liquor worm is counterattacking!” Fang Yuan instantly opened his eyes, a hint of astonishment in his gaze. Before him, the Liquor worm had curled into a round little dumpling, fiercely giving out a blinding white light.\nIt was risking everything in this one last stand!\nAt once Fang Yuan felt a strong will coming out from the Liquor worm’s body, flowing directly through the primeval essence and descending into the primeval sea in his aperture.\nThe situation where a Gu counterattacked was incredibly rare. Only Gu with extremely strong will would give their all, it was either success or death. In the face of such a scenario, the usual teenager would be panicking right now.\nThough he was surprised, Fang Yuan did not panic; in fact he was somewhat delighted. “Staking everything in one last attempt, this is also a good thing. As long as I can handle this counterattack, the Liquor worm’s will shall greatly weaken. However I need to put full focus into fighting back against this will, I cannot receive even the slightest outside interference. Or else that would be bad, sigh... But I hope no one will come and disturb me during this period.”\nHis thoughts finalized, he was ready to gather the primeval essence in his aperture, ready to accept the Liquor worm’s will. He would be entangled with it and fight it 300 rounds.\nBut at this moment, a miraculous event happened!\nIn the middle of his aperture, just above the sea high in the air, a Gu appeared.\nBoom!\nA mighty strong breath erupted from this Gu.\nThis breath was like the Milky Way pouring out, and floodwater rushing down from the mountains. Yet, it was also like a dreadful beast whose dignity was offended that opened its scarlet red eyes and looked around to see who would dare to violate its territory!\n“This is the Spring Autumn Cicada?!” Seeing this Gu, Fang Yuan was completely shocked!!\n(1) Cui Cui is just an affectionate way to call Shen Cui.\n(2) The novel says [都凝成了一个川字], which means condensed into a 川 word (Chinese words are used to describe things sometimes)\nAuthor’s Note: (He thanks a bunch of people)\nI will keep on going forward, 3 years, 6 years, 9 years... in this period of time, some of you may leave temporarily and some will always stay. In the busy process of human life, we constantly mark our constant existence, and we all prove to each other that we have lived before.\nI had imagined this sort of scenario: When we are old, you all will look at ‘Gu Zhen Ren’ this ID, and will laugh in your hearts: “Oh, its him, when I was young I have read his book before. I even gave him a recommendation vote.” Maybe I will open my previous layout and see all these familiar IDs, those that have rewarded, voted and commented before. I will reminisce the times when I was writing alone, these names were the company of my long and difficult journey, giving me warm little lights.\nRight here in the book is a small little twist. Fang Yuan will begin to truly show his unique style. Those who were able to read up till here are predestined. I guarantee you right here, this book will become more and more exciting.",

      "content": "Chapter 19: Rank six vital Gu, The Spring Autumn Cicada!\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nDuring the process of refining, the Gu counterattacked!\nAt this time, the Liquor worm that had inherited the Flower Wine Monk’s extremely strong will invaded his aperture, brazenly counterattacking at Fang Yuan.\nThis strong willpower descended from above, surging down towards the bottom of the aperture where the green copper primeval sea was. The waves in the sea tumbled, setting off bursts of high tide. Under Fang Yuan’s will, large amounts of primeval essence rose upwards to the sky and gathered together, forming a towering monster wave, brazenly accepting the incoming Liquor worm’s will.\nJust as both sides were about to collide viciously in the middle of the aperture, a faint image of a Gu worm emerged in a blank area between the two energies.\nThis was a cicada. The cicada’s body was not large; if the Moonlight Gu was described as a blue crystal shaped like a curved moon, then this cicada would be a delicate craftwork that was made from palm wood and tree leaves by a master craftsman.\nThe Gu sported a brownish yellow head and abdomen. Its surface had the texture of a tree’s growth rings, as if it had witnessed countless years. On its back were two very wide and translucent wings, like two tree leaves overlapping. The wings had similar structure; this structure was like a typical net-vein leaf. The center had a coarse stem, and from this stem sprouted out a network vein of leaf lines on both sides.\nThe Spring Autumn Cicada!\nIt had been startled. It was just like a giant beast, usually hiding in its cave in a deep sleep. But suddenly it was awakened, furthermore learning that its territory had been violated.\nWho dares to come into my turf and act wildly!\nAs if its dignity was offended, the Spring Autumn Cicada was angry and let out a whiff of aura; the aura was weak yet powerful. It was like the surging Milky Way, rolling forth with vast and mighty waves; it would sweep across mountains for ten thousands of miles, or submerge a broad desert!\nTo be compared to this aura, the Liquor worm’s will was like the case of an ant meeting an elephant!\nThe aura swept around and expanded, just like a raised invisible tsunami. The invading will of the Liquor worm did not even have the ability to withstand it; it was immediately swallowed whole by this aura.\nFang Yuan felt depressed. The green copper primeval essence that he had thrust forward with his might collided with this aura like it was a wave crashing onto a great mountain. In a moment the condensed primeval essence disintegrated and dispersed into rain, scattering down to the primeval sea.\nThe waves on the primeval sea rose one after another; it was like a rainstorm had just swept across, increasing its turbulence.\nBut after a few seconds, the Spring Autumn Cicada’s aura spread down, pressing onto the primeval sea.\nBoom!\nFang Yuan felt like he heard a buzz. In an instant, the rolling waves on the sea calmed down. The Spring Autumn Cicada’s aura firmly repressed the entire primeval sea, just like an invisible mountain pressing down. The surface of the sea was calm like a mirror, not a single wave rolling about. It was like an originally crumpled piece of paper; a boundless giant hand covering over it suddenly, flattening it.\nThis was easily an incomparable power!\nFang Yuan felt a pressure weighing like an enormous invisible mountain pressing down on his heart. He compared it to Sun Wukong being pressed down by the Five Elements Mountain; Fang Yuan could not even mobilize a single pint of primeval essence.\nHowever although he was shocked, he was not afraid. In fact his heart felt great joy.\n“I didn’t think the Spring Autumn Cicada would actually follow me and be reborn together! So it’s actually not a one-time use Gu worm, but one that can be used again repeatedly.”\nThe Spring Autumn Cicada was a Rank six grade, and it was the first Rank six Gu in Fang Yuan’s previous life, as well as his last. Just to make it, Fang Yuan had used all means and resources, wasting an incredible amount of strength, using thirty years of fermenting to finally succeed.\nBut not long after he succeeded, when the Spring Autumn Cicada was still fresh from the oven, warriors of the Righteous faction felt Fang Yuan’s threat and gathered together to attack and kill him.\nAfter being reborn, Fang Yuan did not find the Spring Autumn Cicada, so he thought it had died. But in reality it had fallen into a deep sleep, resting inside Fang Yuan’s body.\nTo travel back five hundred years in an instant was a huge blow to its vitality. It was too weak, so weak that even Fang Yuan as its master could not feel it. Right now even though the Spring Autumn Cicada had appeared, its situation was still bad.\nAfter being reborn it had always been resting in a deep sleep. To appear right now was because it had felt the danger that the aperture was facing; it could be said that the Liquor worm’s will had awakened it.\nIt was weak, very weak, extremely weak.\nIn Fang Yuan’s memories, the original Spring Autumn Cicada was full of vitality. Its body was like a precious floorboard, giving out a warm and glossy varnish. Its two wings were verdant green, like two soft tree leaves that had just freshly sprouted.\nBut right now, there was a strong and deathly chill emanating from the body of the cicada. There was no shine or gloss from its body, making it feel rough and dim like dead wood. Its wings were not the colour of soft and green leaves; they were fully yellow, just like the withering leaves of autumn. The tips of its wings were slightly rolled up, a little incomplete, just like the corner of fallen leaves.\nSeeing this, Fang Yuan felt both distressed and lucky. He was distressed because the Spring Autumn Cicada suffered such a heavy blow; it was barely a step away from death, just a foot away from the edge of a cliff.\nThe fortunate thing was, thank heavens the Spring Autumn Cicada was weak to this point, or else he would be in great trouble!\nOne must know, between a Gu Master and a Gu, both must complement each other, the best would be both having the same rank.\nA Rank one Gu Master should use a Rank one Gu – this was the most appropriate. If the Gu’s grade was lower than the Gu Master, when the Gu Master uses it, it would be the equivalent of a strong man carrying a small stick, the strength output would be small. If the Gu’s grade was higher than the Gu Master, when the Gu Master uses it, it would be the example of a small child carrying a heavy axe, unable to wield it properly.\nThe Spring Autumn Cicada was a Rank six Gu, and Fang Yuan was just a Rank one initial stage Gu Master. To use an image as example, the Spring Autumn Cicada would be a mountain, and Fang Yuan would be a squirrel. If the squirrel wanted to use the mountain to beat its enemy, the squirrel would just be squashed flat by the mountain at the first second.\nIf the Spring Autumn Cicada was at its peak state, Fang Yuan’s weak Rank one aperture could not even tolerate it; the majestic aura of the cicada would just make the aperture burst to death.\nFortunately it was at its weakest state, so Fang Yuan’s aperture could accommodate it right now.\n“I gave up the Moonlight Gu, going through all the lengths to find the Liquor worm just to refine it into my vitalGu. But in reality I already had a vital Gu from the start, the Spring Autumn Cicada is my vital Gu!” Fang Yuan’s heart was filled with emotion as he felt the close connection between him and the Spring Autumn Cicada.\nThe vital Gu is the first Gu that a Gu Master refines. It is terribly important, and would affect the future development of a Gu Master by a large extent.\nIf a vital Gu is well picked, the Gu Master’s development will become smoother. When the vital Gu is of a poor grade, to a Gu Master it would just drag down his cultivation and let peers surpass him. The more important thing is that it would affect the matter of life and death in a battle.\nFang Yuan was clear on this point, so he was not satisfied after choosing the Gu Yue village’s signature Moonlight Gu. He just had to go all the way to find the Liquor worm.\nIn his memory to a Rank one Gu Master, the Liquor worm was already considered a high quality pick. The Moonlight Gu was just a choice that was slightly above average.\nBut life is fascinating, because no one will ever know what is waiting for him or her at the next moment.\nFang Yuan had refined the Spring Autumn Cicada in his previous life. After his rebirth the Spring Autumn Cicada fell into a deep sleep, but the connection between them still existed. In fact Fang Yuan found that, as if going through the refinement of the River of Time, his connection with the Spring Autumn Cicada had grown even closer and mysterious than his previous life. It was just because the Spring Autumn Cicada was too weak, so Fang Yuan was not aware of it.\nTherefore in the real sense, the Spring Autumn Cicada is the first Gu that he had refined. The only thing was that the Spring Autumn Cicada was not refined in his current life, but the result of hard work in his previous life of 500 years.\nThe Spring Autumn Cicada was Fang Yuan’s vital Gu.\nA Rank one Gu Master, having a Rank six vital Gu!\nIf this sort of thing was said out loud, it is expected that no one would believe such a thing! This has already broken the limits of human cognition!\nBut yet, that is exactly what happened. The truth is beyond doubt.\n“The Liquor worm as a vital Gu is already one of the best choices, but when you compare it to the Spring Autumn Cicada, it is just like scum on the ground! My vital Gu in this life is actually the Spring Autumn Cicada, ha ha ha....”",

      "content": "Chapter 20: The academy elder is speechless\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe immense joy he felt did not overcome his mind; he quickly calmed down and started to consider the consequences that the Spring Autumn Cicada would bring to him:\n“The Spring Autumn Cicada’s ability is rebirth. But right now it is at its weakest state, at the instant I use it, it’ll die. However it is still a Rank six Gu, so I can totally use its aura. This won’t do any damage to its body.”\n“Hee hee hee.” After he finished pondering, he closed his thoughts and opened his eyes. The Liquor worm was hovering before him, shivering in the midst of the smoke-like green copper primeval essence that had surrounded it.\nEarlier because it wanted a chance to survive, desperation drove the Liquor worm risk everything on a single throw. Yet in the end its will was easily defeated by the Spring Autumn Cicada’s aura. Due to this it suffered a heavy blow, its current strength not even 1% of the original will it had.\n“Spring Autumn Cicada.” With a simple thought, Fang Yuan released a small trace of the Spring Autumn Cicada’s aura. This aura pressured onto the Liquor worm’s body; the Liquor worm immediately stood still, motionless like a dead creature. Its scattered will felt the Spring Autumn Cicada’s aura; like a mouse that had run into a cat, it was frightened. It shrank into a ball and was too afraid to move even a slight bit.\nFang Yuan laughed and took the opportunity to mobilize his primeval essence. In the beginning when he tried using his green copper primeval essence to refine it, the Liquor worm’s will resisted fiercely, so it could only expand arduously bit by bit. But right now Fang Yuan’s green copper primeval essence drove straight in, flowing vigorously without resistance. There was no obstruction at all.\nThe green copper colour on the surface of the Liquor worm rapidly expanded. In a few winks, the once pearl-white Liquor worm was fully dyed green.\nThe general situation had passed; the last remains of the Liquor worm’s will was finally washed away easily by Fang Yuan’s will, dissolving into nothingness.\nWith that, the Liquor worm was fully refined!\nCompared to the beginning where Fang Yuan had to endure hardship akin to trampling mountains and crossing ravines, the refining process right now was as easy as swallowing saliva.\nA kind of mysterious and cordial feeling connected the Liquor worm and Fang Yuan together. The refined Liquor worm was like a part of Fang Yuan – If Fang Yuan told it to huddle up, it would curl; if he told it to curl into a ball it would curl into a round little dumpling. The feeling was like moving his own finger.\nFang Yuan took back his primeval essence, and the Liquor worm returned to its fat and white state. Then with a leap, it went through thin air and plunged into the middle of Fang Yuan’s aperture. When it was inside, the Liquor worm flew a distance away around the hovering Spring Autumn Cicada and entered the green copper primeval sea. On the sea surface the Liquor worm stretched its body arbitrarily; occasionally it would twist around its chubby waist, appearing comfortable as if it were bathing in a hot shower.\n“With the Spring Autumn Cicada, my plans will have to change.” Fang Yuan gathered his mind away from the aperture and took out the Moonlight Gu. He repeated what he did earlier: Letting out a hint of the Spring Autumn Cicada’s aura, pressing it down on the Moonlight Gu.\nAs it felt the Spring Autumn Cicada’s aura, the Moonlight Gu’s will immediately surrendered, its fear so great its will could only turtle up in the furthest corner of its own body.\nFang Yuan’s primeval essence poured in. In the blink of an eye, the Moonlight Gu was dyed a jade green colour. Finally with just a simple thought, the Moonlight Gu’s will was easily strangled.\nAfter he was done he took back his primeval essence and the Moonlight Gu returned to its original, semi-transparent, blue crystal form. He put away the Moonlight Gu; it did not enter his aperture, but instead directly dropped onto his forehead, forming a pale blue crescent mark in the middle of his brow.\nThe entire refining process of the Moonlight Gu from beginning to end did not take more than five minutes. Comparing the start of his difficult refining process to the situation right now, the speed was rapid and created a sharp contrast.\nNot only was it very fast, the consumption of primeval essence was also very little.\nFor the past few days, Fang Yuan had consumed six pieces of primeval stones just to refine the Liquor worm. But tonight, while Fang Yuan could see the bottom of the primeval sea in his aperture, he did not use a single stone.\n“Ha ha, with the Spring Autumn Cicada at hand, it is as easy as having a god’s help! After today all I just need to do is use its aura to pressure down, any Rank one Gu will be easily refined. Even though I only have C grade talent, I don’t need to borrow the help of primeval stones. The difference of before and now is like heaven and earth.”\nFang Yuan’s mood was joyous. Right now his situation was like pushing away the mist and cloud to see the blue skies.\nAlthough the Spring Autumn Cicada was at its weakest point, it was still a Rank six Gu. A fallen tiger still leaves behind threat; a festered ship still has three pounds of nails (1). Just relying on its aura, Fang Yuan’s cultivation from today onwards would receive a huge driving force.\nAt this moment, the moon outside the window was bright and the stars were few. The moonlight flowed through the window, shining on Fang Yuan’s face.\n“Initially I thought I wouldn’t be able to get number one, but the road twisted and turned unexpectedly. Time waits for no one! I must go to the academy now and receive the top prize!” Fang Yuan’s eyes glistened.\nWith a thought the Spring Autumn Cicada faded away from view and disappeared once more, returning to its deep slumber. Then he called out the Liquor worm and hid it away at a corner of his bed. This was to prevent the academy’s unnecessary examination.\nFifteen minutes later, in the clan academy.\nThe academy elder had long gone to bed, but in his dreams he could vaguely hear the sound of somebody knocking on the door. He was awoken by the noise and he opened his eyes, rather displeased. “Who is it outside there in the middle of the night?”\nInstantly a voice replied in a respectful tone, “Reporting to sir elder! It is a student from this year’s batch; he has already finished refining the Moonlight Gu. You have instructed your subordinates earlier to report to you the very instant the first name appears, no matter what time it is.”\n“Well... Its true that happened.” The academy elder frowned, and then he got off his bed. As he put on his robes he asked, “Which student is it that got number one this year? Is it Gu Yue Fang Zheng?”\nThe subordinate outside the door replied, “It seems so. The moment I heard the news I hurried over here to tell you about it, sir. It seems to be someone from the Fang family branch.”\n“Hehe, counting the time, it is probably him.” The academy elder laughed lightly, confidently saying, “Who else could it be besides the A grade talent genius? All those B grade talent students would still be worse even with the help of primeval stones. Or else why would the grade of cultivation talent be so important?”\nAs he said this he pushed the door open and came out. Outside the door, his subordinate respectfully bowed, moving two steps backwards. “Sir is right,” he echoed.\nIn the hall, ten candles or so burned together, brightening up the hall. The man who had received Fang Yuan had already cleared up all doubts by now. Under the bright light of the candle fire, his face showed a stunned expression. “Wait, what did you just say? You are called Gu Yue Fang Yuan, not Gu Yue Fang Zheng?”\nFang Yuan nodded. At this moment the elder walked in from the entrance. Fang Yuan and the man stood up and turned around to greet.\nWhen the academy elder saw Fang Yuan, his face was full of smiles. He strode over and stood in front of Fang Yuan, patting his shoulder in a friendly manner. “You did well, Gu Yue Fang Zheng, you did not disappoint me. You are indeed an A grade talent – genius! All those B grade, C grade peers of yours will never compare to you no matter how hard they try. Ha ha ha.”\nFang Yuan and Fang Zheng were twin brothers; their outer appearance was similar to a fault. Even the academy elder was mistaken.\nFang Yuan was neither haughty nor humble. He took a little step back, letting his shoulder free from the academy elder’s hand. He stared at the academy elder, his hands folded behind his back. Then he said with a faint smile, “Sir elder, you have been mistaken. I am Gu Yue Fang Yuan, Gu Yue Fang Zheng is my younger brother.”\n“Huh?” The academy elder opened his mouth slightly, his expression startled. He glared at Fang Yuan doubtfully, his brow turning into a frown. After a few breaths, he finally spoke. “You are Gu Yue Fang Yuan?”\n“Correct sir,” Fang Yuan replied.\n“You have refined the Moonlight Gu?” The academy elder was extremely surprised. His two eyes glared firmly at Fang Yuan’s crescent mark on his forehead. His eyes were shining; he was asking the obvious.\n“Indeed, that is the case,” Fang Yuan said.\n“Then, you are first of your batch?” The academy elder was asking stupid questions, but he was not entirely at fault. After all, this situation was entirely out of everyone’s expectations.\nOne must know that he had been in charge of the academy for decades and is extremely experienced. He had seen C grade talent students contending for number one before this, but it was never this early. Not to mention that in this batch there were peers with A and B grade talent.\n“If there is no one earlier than me...” Fang Yuan pretended to be in deep thought, then he rubbed his nose and continued, “Then it seems like it.”\nThe academy elder: “........”\n(1) It means that while spoiled/damaged, it can still be put to use.",

      "content": "Chapter 21: How can it be that big brother got number one?\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe sky was not yet bright, and the sun had yet to rise. The east sky just began to turn bright, the dark colours in the sky slowly fading away, the smell of the night still remaining in the air.\nThe streets were empty, then came the sounds of quick footsteps. The early dawn mountain air was moist, yet Gu Yue Fang Zheng did not feel the slightest cold rush; his heart was full of surging enthusiasm. His face blushed red, and now he was walking swiftly toward the academy.\n“I have been cultivating hard these few days, spending two primeval stones. I did not sleep at all last night, and I’ve finally successfully refined the Moonlight Gu. I am an A grade talent and I was so hardworking. No one can be faster than me, no one! Father and mother, I told you I won’t let you feel disappointed.”\nWhen he thought of the moment where he told his aunt and uncle about the good news earlier, they expressed happiness and relief, making Fang Zheng feel a surge of joy and pride.\n“Just wait, all you clanspeople who looked down on me, and big brother. From today onwards, I shall make you all look up to me, Gu Yue Fang Zheng!”\nThe more he thought the more Fang Zheng felt excited. He could not help but clench his fists, and his pace quickened a little more.\nHe came to the academy entrance.\nThe academy’s two guards looked at him strangely. They asked him, “Umm, Gu Yue Fang Yuan, why are you back?”\n“What, big brother was here just now?” When Fang Zheng heard them, his face showed a hint of surprise and puzzlement.\n“Ah, whatever!” He would never have guessed that Fang Yuan would snatch away number one. He shook his head and cupped his hands together, his tone carrying a trace of arrogance, “Two elder brothers, I am not Gu Yue Fang Yuan, but I’m Gu Yue Fang Zheng. I have already successfully refined my vital Gu, and I am here to come and take the top prize.”\n“You are Gu Yue Fang Zheng? You brothers are just too alike, no wonder the academy elder was mistaken,” the guard on the left side shouted, his eyes widening. The guard on the right shook his head and said, “You came one step too late. Just last night in the late hour, your older brother Gu Yue Fang Yuan came and met with sir elder and took the top prize.”\n“My older brother!” Fang Zheng suddenly opened his eyes wide, crying out, “Wait, you said he’d gotten number one?”\nHow can this be! Isn’t his big brother a C grade talent?\nGetting number one, this has to be a joke right?!\n“It’s true. How could we possibly joke around with this matter?” Seeing Fang Zheng in disbelief, the guard seemed somewhat unhappy.\n“This matter has been confirmed by the academy elder. In due course the name list will be released and announced. What’s wrong, your older brother did not tell you about it?” The other guard added.\nFang Zheng just stood silly at the door.\nThe truth was so much different from his imagination; right now he just could not understand what had just happened. In Fang Zheng’s heart, there were several illusions of his adversaries. Among them, the ones that brought the most threat were two – Gue Yue Mo Bei, and Gu Yue Chi Lian.\nThese two were of B rank talent. Behind them were the clan’s two largest family branches, and each of them had a grandfather that carried huge authority as elders, as well as sufficient financial power.\nIf any of these two people won first place over him, Fang Zheng’s heart and mind was still prepared. Even though he would feel a sense of loss, it was still acceptable.\nBut right now, the one who took away number one was not Gu Yue Mo Bei or Gu Yue Chi Lian; it was not even any of the opponents in his heart.\nBut it was Gu Yue Fang Yuan, his older brother!\nThat person with a C grade talent!\nThat person who fell downhill and turned dejected after the Awakening Ceremony!\nThat person who slept soundly in class all day!\nThat person who was always heavily drunk and never turned home at night!\nThat person who bullied Shen Cui, slapped him twice, and took all his primeval stones away!\nThat person who always held him down, just like a shadow entrenched in his heart!\n“How can it be like this? It can’t be possible!” In a short while, Fang Zheng roared in his heart, “I was so hardworking, but he just drank everyday until he became drunk, and yet in the end he was the one who got number one, is this even fair? Why? Why?!”\nThe sun rose from the east, the birds chirped around, and the overflowing air of spring took over Qing Mao Mountain.\nGu Yue Fang Zheng bathed in the warm sunlight. He slowly lowered his head, gritting his teeth, looking at his own lonely shadow. The excitement in his heart had turned into a balloon that leaked air, long dissipating. Instead what took its place was the emotions of confusion, resentment, unwillingness, puzzlement, fear and other complicated feelings.\nAs time went by, the sun climbed higher.\nThe academy bulletin wall had posted a new name list, and on the list were just two names – firstly Fang Yuan, and then Fang Zheng. Following the appearance of this list, the news gradually spread out.\nAfter hearing the news, all those young students who had been bent on refining their Gu at home after receiving one were in an uproar.\n“How can it be like this!”\n“If it was Fang Zheng who got number one I would still have believed it, but it’s Fang Yuan, isn’t he a C grade talent?”\n“Could there have been a mistake, the A grade talent Fang Zheng actually lost to the C grade talent Fang Yuan, is this Tales from the Thousand and One Nights(1)?”\nThe Mo branch family home.\nThe greenery in the courtyard was overflowing, the fragrance of tea dancing about.\nOne of the clan elders of the Gu Yue clan, Gu Yue Mo Bei was sitting in front of his desk, looking at the spring scenery outside his window. He leisurely drank his tea and said, “Mo Bei hasn’t continued refining his Gu?”\nThe housekeeper standing at a side hurriedly replied, “After he heard about news concerning Fang Yuan in the afternoon, young master Mo Bei seemed to be deeply affected and has no mood to continue refining the Moonlight Gu. It is a pity, young master Mo Bei was just so close to succeeding. Actually, if Fang Zheng got number one it could still be ignored, but it just has to be that C grade talent Fang Yuan. So young master Mo Bei lost his interest, it can’t be helped.”\n“Hmph! Do not excuse him.” Gu Yue Mo Chen snorted coldly, his face stern and his tone hard, “A Gu Master’s cultivation process is full of hardship each step, what is a small setback like this? That Fang Yuan is just a C grade, so to be able to get number one it is presumably because of luck. The Moonlight Gu that he chose must have had a weak will, so that is how he could snatch the top. If Mo Bei can’t see through this and let such a small setback get to him, then how is he supposed to be in charge of our Mo family branch in future, how can he compete with the Chi family branch? No one is allowed to advise him, let him think about it by himself!”\n“Yes, master.” The housekeeper did not dare refute.\nAlmost at the same time, in the home of the Chi family branch.\n“Sigh, Gu Yue Fang Yuan...” The clan elder Gu Yue Chi Lian gave a long sigh, his brows held down in a frown as he thought, waving his hand around. “Someone, call young master Chi Chen over please.”\nIn a moment, Gu Yue Chi Chen walked into the room with a lost expression, kneeling down with respect, “Your grandson greets his grandpa.”\n“Seems like you already know about the news,” Gu Yue Chi Lian stared at his only direct grandson, his tone gentle. He slowly said, “I called you over to prevent you from getting influenced by this matter. You see, when refining the vital Gu, firstly one looks at the talent, secondly at the Gu worm.”\n“Fang Yuan’s talent is just C grade, yet he was able to gain number one this time. This means that the Gu he chose -compared to all the Moonlight Gu your peers have – has a will that is much weaker. This is entirely due to luck. So my grandson, do not be discouraged, this is nothing really. He is just a C grade talent, though he is the same as you, but his supply of resources is not as well as yours. His road to advancement will also be harder than yours, believe your grandpa, you will soon surpass him.”\n“Hence you should put away this trivial matter. Fang Yuan will not be your opponent, and is not worthy to be your adversary. Your real enemies are the A grade talent Fang Zheng and the Mo family’s Mo Bei. Do you understand?”\n“Yes, thank you for your advice, grandpa. I understand. I will go now and continue refining my Gu!” Gu Yue Chi Chen had lost the sad expression on his face, replacing it with a high-spirited will to fight.\n“Mmm.” Elder Gu Yue Chi Lian nodded his head, satisfied. A kindly smile emerged from his face and he said, “Good grandson. While your talent is only C grade, but you can be rest assured that grandpa will fully support you. Later on, I will come out and use the aura of a Rank three Gu worm to suppress your Moonlight Gu’s will and help you refine this Gu!”\n(1)天方夜谭 – It speaks of Tales from the Thousand and One Nights here.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights",

      "content": "Chapter 22: Dancing Moonblade\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe sky was blue and clear, looking pure as if it had been washed clean. The sun was shining golden.\nPuffs of white clouds floated away, and a group of colourful peacock parrots chirped as they flew beneath the blue sky, forming an arrow formation under the clouds as they soared.\nThis variant of colourful parrots would only appear in large groups during springtime. Their bodies were littered with feathers the colour of the rainbow, their bodies the size of an eagle. The birds had parrot beaks, while their tails were that of a peacock’s flowing long tail.\nIt had been ten days since the day Fang Yuan managed to acquire number one in the test to refine the vital Gu. The spring breeze blew over the whole mountain’s green grass, while the wild flowers bloomed eagerly, and the bees and butterflies danced around together. Life was surging all around; it was the wonderful beauty of spring.\nThe breath of spring was so strong that the tall bamboo walls surrounding the training grounds could not hold it back.\nThis training field occupied 3 Mu(1). The ground was flat, paved with a layer of thick and wide grey graphite. Its four sides were planted with green spear bamboo; these green poles were placed closely together side by side, straight and tall, forming a circle of green high walls.\nWhile below the wall corners were stone as well, clumps of green grass emerged from many areas. In between the bamboo were also some wild roses, poking in from the outside, a few even climbing the wall.\nFifty-seven young teens at the age of fifteen were standing in the midst of the training field right now, formed in a semi-circle around the academy elder who was in the center, putting their focus on him.\nThis was a lesson to teach the students on how to use the Moonlight Gu.\n“The Moonlight Gu is our Gu Yue clan’s symbolic Gu, just like the Xiong(2) House’s Bear Strength Gu, and the Bai(3) House’s Stream Gu. The majority of you on the field have chosen the Moonlight Gu as your vital Gu, so you must all watch properly. Soon I will demonstrate personally how to use the Moonlight Gu to attack. Students whose vital Gu is not the Moonlight Gu must also concentrate on me, as this classical long-distance attacking method can also be used on other Gu; the spectrum of methods one can use is very wide.”\nAs he spoke, the academy elder stretched out his right hand, his five fingers opening wide. He lowered his palm so that the young teens could see the center of it.\n“Firstly, you use your mind to mobilize the Moonlight Gu, moving it to the center of your palm.” Following his voice, the crescent mark that represented the Moonlight Gu moved down the elder’s arm and into his palm.\n“Then, you mobilize the primeval essence in your aperture, pouring it into the Moonlight Gu.” A thread of white silver coloured primeval essence gushed out from the elder’s body, so fine it was almost impossible to see. It entered the Moonlight Gu in his palm.\nThe academy elder was of a Rank three realm, and only Rank three Gu Masters could produce white silver coloured primeval essence. Rank one Gu Master’s primeval essence was commonly known as green copper primeval essence, while Rank two Gu Masters had theirs called red iron primeval essence. When they reached Rank three, it becomes white silver primeval essence.\nOnce it absorbed the thread of white silver primeval essence, the crescent-shaped mark in the elder’s hand instantly glowed brighter and brighter. Although it was daytime, it still issued a brilliant pale-blue light.\n“That’s awesome!”\n“How beautiful.” The youngsters could not help but let out praises of surprise and amazement when they saw it.\nThe pale blue light was clear like water. It flickered faintly in the elder’s palm. At first glance it would seem as if the academy elder’s hand was scooping a handful of moonlight. The academy elder smiled a little. “Now watch carefully, the last step is just like how I will do it, launching it out.”\nAs he said this, his widely opened five fingers slowly closed together, then he lifted his arm up and slowly moved it forward, his arm straight. Finally he waved his palm lightly in a cutting motion.\nThe entire movement was steady and powerful.\nSwoosh.\nThe young students could hear a light brushing sound beside their ear.\nFollowing the academy elder’s movement, the condensed water-like pale blue light in his palm was thrown out like that.\nThe light transformed into a small moonblade in the air, the faint blue moonblade only the size of a wide-open hand, the shape just like the crescent moon in the night sky. It drew a straight line in the air before it hit a grass puppet ten meters away.\nA tearing sound was heard, and the grass puppet’s neck that was about thirty centimeters thick was cut clean by the moonblade. The puppet’s body swayed about, the huge head suddenly falling onto the floor.\nAfter cutting the grass puppet into half, the moonblade immediately appeared dimmer. However it continued flying about another six meters in the air before the crescent began to gradually fade away, finally dissipating in the air.\nLooking at the grass puppet’s neck again, one could see that the cut area was extremely flat, as if it was cut away by the sharpest sickle.\nThe youngsters were all shocked as they saw this, their eyes wide-open. A few of them even touched their own necks involuntarily, astonished by the attacking power of the moonblade.\nAfter a short silence, the sounds of exclamation began. The teenagers had shining eyes as they stared at the grass puppet, some of them staring at the elder’s palm. A few of them were looking at their peers, talking and whispering excitedly.\nOnly Fang Yuan stood hidden in the crowd with a cold expression, his stature calm.\nIn his previous life, Fang Yuan had cultivated to Rank six, and he had created the Blood Wing Demon Sect in the Middle Kingdom. He taught tens of thousands of people, and was reputed as a giant figurehead of the Demonic faction, his fame illustrious.\nThe academy elder was just a Rank three Gu Master. This small trick was just child’s play to him; it would not cause any ripple of emotion in Fang Yuan’s heart.\n“All those of you who have refined the Moonlight Gu, step out. Each one of you shall take a grass puppet and follow the way I just did it, throwing out the moonblade, practice attacking.”\nOnce the academy elder was finished, around thirty students stepped out.\nIn this batch the entire clan had a hundred young teens joining the Awakening Ceremony. Those who had cultivating talent were around fifty-seven. Among these students, those who had chosen the Moonlight Gunumbered around thirty-five. After going through these few days of hard work, they had all refined the Moonlight Gu. Those that were left were all D grade talents. It was not because they did not desire to refine the Moonlight Gu, but it was due to the inability of their talent, so they could only withdraw after learning of the difficulty.\nTo the youngsters of the Gu Yue clan, the Moonlight Gu was not a simple Gu worm, but the symbol of the clan’s glory.\nVery quickly thirty-five of them stood in a row. Each of them faced forward, standing ten meters away from a grass puppet on the opposite.\nFang Yuan stood in the middle of the row, but he did not garner any attention. The practice began.\nThe students all stretched out their right hands, letting the Moonlight Gu move to the heart of their palm. One by one the blue crescent mark started to give out water blue light as green copper primeval essence was poured in.\nBut when they drew a vertical cut with their palm, only seven or eight crescents flew out. Among these crescents, some of them only appeared for a short moment before dissipating away. Some flew out for two to three meters before disintegrating into blue light with a bang. Some flew further, but the direction was severely off-course, flying straight up to the sky.\nThe young teens all frowned. When they saw the elder’s demonstration earlier it seemed quite easy. But when they started practicing themselves, they realised the skill required in this action. To throw out a moonblade and to have it hit on the grass puppet, it really was not that simple.\nThe elder had a faint smile as he watched. He saw this scene every year, and was not surprised. The remaining twenty-two students could only stand outside the field, watching jealously.\nAfter practicing for five minutes, the youngsters were gradually able to produce moonblades. For a time in the training ground, pale-blue coloured moonblades flew about everywhere.\nA few moonblades would fade halfway, a few unluckily crashing into another. Some flew out of the training field, twisting around. Those that were able to hit on the grass puppets were just a small few. Of course these were all due to sheer luck.\nThe academy elder started to tutor and guide each one personally.\nHe focused greatly on Fang Zheng, Mo Bei and Chi Cheng and those others with good latent talent. He patiently corrected their postures, teaching them his experience. Towards those C grade talent students like Fang Yuan, he only mentioned two sentences.\nFang Yuan kept condensing the blue light in his hand. He waved his palm a few times cutting the air, but he did not release the light, pretending and acting. With the field a mess at the moment and no one focusing on himself, he moved his thoughts and released his hold on the Moonlight Gu, his palm tilting a little, making a cutting action.\nIn order not to raise attention, he did not focus on his own grass puppet opposite him, but aimed at the one on his left.\nWith a whoosh, a moonblade flew out quickly, passing through the center of chaos, drawing a straight line in the air and cutting accurately into the neck area of a grass puppet.\nThe grass puppet wavered for a moment, the neck area cut deeply by the moonblade. But very quickly, the green grassy area that was cut began to regrow, tangling together and healing away the wound.\nOf course, this grass puppet was not a normal scarecrow. It was a Rank one Scarecrow Gu, having the nature-type ability of self-recovery.\nUnless the puppet was cut into half at once, it would just recover back to normal in a short while.\n“Wow, look at that crescent!”\n“How cool, who threw it?”\nMoonblades that were able to hit grass puppets right now were rare. Fang Yuan just casually hit one, yet it caused the most significant result so far. Thus in an instant the students outside the field gave out cries of surprise. Even the academy elder’s attention was caught, and he asked, “That moonblade just now was not bad. Was it yours?”\nHe looked at a C grade talent student with an enquiring eye, since that grass puppet was just opposite him.\nThis male student blinked his eyes, feeling somewhat bewildered as he faced everyone’s sudden gazes at him. To be honest the field was just in a chaos earlier with moonblades flying about, so even he did not know if it was he himself who threw it.\nHowever looking at it, it probably is me? Thought the young boy. Then he nodded his head subconsciously.\nThe youngsters around him immediately looked at him with admiration.\n“Who is he, what is his name?” Some of the girl students asked around.\n“Even he can throw out a moonblade, I must not lose!” Gu Yue Mo Bei’s eyes flashed with a hint of determination.\n“So it’s not big brother who threw it,” Gu Yue Fang Zheng inexplicably sighed with relief. After Uncle and Aunt consoled him, he was able to recover from the previous blow.\n“Big brother, you won first place last time because your luck was good, picking a weak-willed Moonlight Gu. A GuMaster’s cultivation cannot always rely on luck, I will win you.” Fang Zheng was cheering for himself in his heart.\n“You did well. Continue trying hard, seize the feeling you had earlier.” The academy elder patted the student’s shoulder, smiling as he encouraged him.\nThe young boy quickly showed excitement and he nodded continuously, his eyes appearing with a different luster.\nThe elder took the opportunity and announced, “Listen up everyone, this will be your homework. Practice well after class, in three days I will check the results. Whoever performs the best will receive ten pieces of primeval stones as the prize. Understand?”\n“Yes!” The young students all shouted loudly. They could not help but be more excited when they heard about the primeval stone reward.\nHowever only three minutes later, the moonblades that flew about in the air started to thin gradually.\n“Damn, every single moonblade takes up 10% of primeval essence.”\n“The consumption of the moonblade is just too much, I am just a C grade talent, my aperture can only hold 38% of green copper primeval essence. I can only throw out three moonblades.”\nThose that stopped all sighed.\nThe academy elder was calm as he witnessed everything, but his heart sighed, “This is the benefit of those with high cultivating talent. To use the moonblade, it is simply just three words – Practice makes perfect. Those with higher grade talent are able to hold more primeval essence in their apertures, and the rate of recovery is faster, so they have more chances to practice. Those with poorer talent can also use primeval stones to make up for it, strengthening the number of practices. But those with low grade talent and have no primeval stones, though they have the mind to practice they will still be powerless. Sigh, the Gu Master’s cultivation process is just so cruel. I had just better take care of those high grade talent students.”\n(1) 亩 – Mu, an ancient Chinese measurement. 1 Mu is 666 ⅔ meters²\n(2) 熊家 – Xiong House, Xiong is the word for Bear\n(3) 白家 – Bai House, Bai is the word for ‘white’ as in white colour",

      "content": "Chapter 23: Raising a Gu is like raising a mistress\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe sun had already set.\nThe sunset glow was still burning in the sky. The mountains far away in the distance were covered in a thick layer of grey ash, gradually turning to black.\nIn the academy, a day’s class was over. The students walked out from the academy in groups of twos and threes.\n“I’m really happy today, I learnt quite a few things. Especially how I got to learn how to use the Moonlight Gu.”\n“The way the moonblade flies in the air looks so cool. It’s too bad that my talent isn’t enough, so in the future I can only be a logistics Gu Master, I won’t be able to go onto the battlefield.” The young teenagers happily chatted away.\nA few of them called their friends over.\n“Let’s go and eat, we can drink some rice wine while we’re at it, what do you think?”\n“Sure, that’s not a bad suggestion.”\n“You guys go on first, I need to go to the store beside the academy’s Gu room and buy a grass puppet. It will be easy to practice at home with it.”\nFang Yuan went to the Gu room alone.\nThe academy’s Gu room kept quite a few Rank one Gu worms. There were many types and variations, and Fang Yuan’s Moonlight Gu was taken freely from inside.\nOnce in a while the students would have a free chance to pick a Gu worm. If one wanted to get extra Gu, they would need to pay up.\nIn this short time Fang Yuan had no wish to refine any other Gu. He walked to the building beside the Gu room – it was a small store.\nIn the store there were seven students, each of them negotiating over the counter with the store owner for buying grass puppets.\n“It’s you, junior.” The Rank one Gu Master responsible for the store was in his twenties. When he saw Fang Yuan, he automatically greeted him while bargaining with his customers.\nFang Yuan was taken by surprise, finding out that this Gu Master was Jiang Ya. It was the young Gu Master that had taught the hunters a lesson in the inn.\n“Ah, it’s you senior.” Fang Yuan nodded his head, his face expressionless.\nJiang Ya took out a grass puppet from the counter behind him, passing it to the student who purchased it. At the same time he threw Fang Yuan a friendly smile and asked, “Did junior brother come here to buy a grass puppet as well? If you want me to leave one for you, you just need three pieces of primeval stones. These things sell like hotcakes, right now there’s only seven left, if you wait any longer there won’t be any stock left.”\nJiang Ya’s attitude towards mortals was arrogant, but towards people like Fang Yuan, he was very kind and sincere.\nFang Yuan shook his head, laughing secretly as he thought, this Jiang Ya really did know how to do business. The grass puppets were made with the Scarecrow Gu. Even after including the primeval essence that was put in, the final cost should not be more than one and a half primeval stones.\n“Senior, this isn’t fair. It should be first come first serve, why leave any for him?”\n“Yeah, we all came early. If you want to do business you should know the rules.”\n“Three pieces will be three pieces, here’s the primeval stones, give me a grass puppet.”\nThe youngsters in the store were all worried when they heard that the store only had seven puppets left. They stopped trying to negotiate, and took out their stones to buy it.\nVery quickly, seven satisfied teenagers walked out.\n“Does my junior want to buy a grass puppet?” Jiang Ya laughed as he asked, “It seems like they were sold out, but actually there’s still the eighth puppet stowed away below the chest. If junior doesn’t buy it now, you will miss the opportunity.”\nFang Yuan had no interest towards the grass puppet. He shook his head and pulled out a piece of primeval stone, putting it on the counter. “I want to buy ten moon orchid petals.”\nJiang Ya was stunned. He looked Fang Yuan deep in the eye, taking away the primeval stone and pulling open the counter drawer. Then he took out a paper bag, saying, “Ten pieces of moon orchid flower petals, not one less. Please make sure.”\nFang Yuan checked the goods on the spot and found no mistake with it. Finally he left the small shop.\nGu have to be fed.\nA Gu Master refines Gu, uses Gu, and at the same time needs to raise Gu.\nRefining a Gu is difficult; there is the risk of counterattack. Using a Gu is not easy; one needs a lot of practice. The knowledge of raising a Gu is even more extensive and profound, because there are all kinds of Gu worms and their food are exceedingly strange. Some need to swallow soil, some need starlight, some require tears and some feed on the clouds and air from the nine skies.\nJust by taking Fang Yuan’s current three Gu for example, the Moonlight Gu requires moon orchid petals, two meals a day. In the morning and night one meal, every meal two pieces of flower petals. Meanwhile for the Liquor worm, it needs to drink wine. A jar of green bamboo wine could support it for four days. As for the Spring Autumn Cicada, it is even more peculiar as it drinks straight from the River of Time, maintaining its vitality.\nThe River of Time supports the flow of this world. It is not far away in the sky but very near at hand, flowing by every person’s side. Every move made by every living creature requires the push of time.\nTime is like flowing water, hurriedly gliding forward. The River of Time is invisible and colourless, while in reality all living creatures are actually surviving and living in the waters of the River of Time.\nAfter buying the bag of moon orchid petals, Fang Yuan went to the inn to buy green bamboo wine. The Liquor worm could also drink some turbid wine or rice wine to live. However with this kind of second-rate wine the amount it needed to drink would increase, and it would need many jars everyday. After calculating, Fang Yuan decided it would be better to buy green bamboo wine straight away. Not only would it be more worth than buying second-grade wine, it would also not arouse suspicion.\n“Young sir, you’ve come.” The workers in the inn had already known Fang Yuan. Fang Yuan passed him three pieces of primeval stones directly, saying with a familiar ease, “Give me a jar of green bamboo wine and make me a few good dishes. You don’t need to give me the change, just put it here first. At the end of the month when it amounts up to one stone, you can subtract from my bill with it.”\nEven though Fang Yuan no longer stayed at the inn right now ever since he moved to the academy dormitories, he would always have a meal here when he bought wine.\n“Alright. Young sir please take a seat, the dishes will be sent over immediately.” The worker echoed, leading Fang Yuan to his seat. He took the cloth on top of his shoulder and gently wiped the table before leaving. Indeed as the worker said, the dishes were very quickly served.\nFang Yuan ate and calculated at the same time in his mind, “A piece of primeval stone can buy me ten pieces of flower petals. The Moonlight Gu consumed four pieces everyday. A jar of green bamboo wine costs two pieces of stones, and it can support the Liquor worm for four days. In other words just to raise and feed the two of these Gu, I would need to spend nearly one stone everyday.”\nIt does not seem like much, but in reality this was very costly. The monthly living expenses for a mortal family of three only used up one piece of primeval stone. From the starting of refining the Gu until today, sixteen days had already passed. Just to raise the Gu alone Fang Yuan had already spent fourteen and a half primeval stones.\n“I have acquired the Flower Wine treasure, taken away Fang Zheng’s bag of primeval stones and also got the first place reward. My primeval stone assets once reached up to forty-four pieces and a half. However in the early days of refining the Gu I wasted six pieces and a half, then I used fourteen pieces and a half on feeding these Gu. My living expenses cost half a piece, and today I am probably left with twenty pieces.”\nFang Yuan took out his money pouch. He opened it and looked inside. The bag contained pieces of primeval stones inside. Each of these stones were greyish white in colour, their shapes ellipsoid and the volumes equal, the size similar to a duck egg.\nAfter counting he found that he really only had twenty pieces left. In other words if this continued on then Fang Yuan would only be able to go on for half a month with the remaining stones he had left. He was not like his peers – they had relatives and friends to help them out, especially with the case of students like Gu Yue Mo Bei and Gu Yue Chi Cheng who were loaded with primeval stones.\nFang Yuan could only think of a way himself.\n“Uncle and Aunt have already cut off my living expenses, but every weekend the clan academy would give out three pieces of primeval stones as subsidy to every student. Looks like I would need to show off in the moonblade assessment in three days and take that ten primeval stone prize.” Fang Yuan chewed the food in his mouth while he pondered.\nHis current age was just at the age where the body was growing. Without realizing it all the rice and dishes had entered his stomach.\nTaking up the sealed green bamboo wine jar, Fang Yuan lifted his feet and started walking, leaving the inn.\n“Young sir, young sir.” The inn worker chased after him from behind and said, “Just to tell young sir something, but in less than a month the trading company will arrive to the village. By convention they would always buy the green bamboo wine in our shop. Young sir loves our green bamboo wine and always buys a few jars every week, so the innkeeper ordered me to tell young sir about this matter. The green bamboo wine in our store has limited supply, so after we sell it to the trading company I’m afraid we would be left with very little.”\n“Is that the case?” When Fang Yuan heard the news, he frowned slightly. To know someone and tell apart the conversation, Fang Yuan had five hundred years of experience. The shop worker and the young Gu Master Jiang Ya spoke with similar meaning, however Fang Yuan could naturally tell the difference with Jiang Ya’s tricky words and the shop worker’s truthful words.\nThis matter was a little troublesome. Fang Yuan needed to feed the Liquor worm and he needed a huge amount of green bamboo wine in the long run. If this inn ran out of stock then he would have to use huge amounts of second-rate wine to feed the Liquor worm.\nIt was not possible for him to drink several jars a day. After a while people would be suspicious. After thinking about it, Fang Yuan took out ten pieces of primeval stones and said, “Then I’ll buy another five jars. I will need you to carry them for me and follow me to put them in the academy dormitory.”\n“Alright, young sir.” The worker immediately accepted the primeval stones.\nThe moon orchid flower petals could only last for five days without any special storage means, so Fang Yuan would only buy a bag every time. However the green bamboo wine could be kept for a very long time, thus there was no problem with this.\nA few workers followed Fang Yuan into the academy dorms and placed the wine jars under his bed, and then they bid their leave. As he saw the money pouch that had suddenly flattened down in his hands, Fang Yuan heaved a sigh.\nRefining a Gu is hard, but raising a Gu is also not easy.\nThis is also considering the fact that he had his five hundred years of previous life experience, so he did not need to practice using his Gu, meaning that the consumption rate of primeval essence would be lessened and thus saving him a huge sum of expenses.\nFor those at his age around him, they would need to practice using the Moonlight Gu and would need to waste primeval essence. To increase proficiency, one would need to practice many times. When too much primeval essence is consumed, primeval stones would have to be used as a supplement since the recovery rate is too slow. To buy a grass puppet it costs three primeval stones as well. All this is money.\n“Fortunately my Spring Autumn Cicada feeds on time and not anything else. Otherwise I would have long gone bankrupt, I would never be able to support it.” Fang Yuan suddenly felt very lucky.\nThe more high-end the Gu is, the greater the food consumption needed or the more precious and rare the food required would be, thus the more difficult it would be to keep. A normal level Rank two Gu worm would cost up to around one to two pieces of primeval stones a day.\nIt is good enough if the food is purchasable. There were some Gu that required food that was relatively difficult to find, some of it did not even circulate in the market.\nJust like the Spring Autumn Cicada’s food being time itself, this was actually more precious. After all there was a saying, an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time.\nNo matter how much money you have, can you buy time?\nYou can’t!\nIn theory a Gu Master can refine an unlimited amount of Gu. As long as you can refine it, whether ten, a hundred or a thousand worms is possible. You can refine as many Gu as you wish to.\nBut in reality a Gu Master normally only had 4-5 Gu.\nWhy?\nThe biggest reason is because it is hard to afford.\nThe higher the grade of the worm, the more expensive it would cost to feed and raise. It often gave a Gu Master too many difficulties to cope with, making them have unceasing headaches over it.\nAnother reason was – unable to use.\nTo use the Moonlight Gu to throw out a single moonblade attack, one would need to use up 10% of primeval essence. A C grade talent Gu Master could run out of primeval essence in their apertures after launching three to four attacks.\nTo raise so many Gu, wouldn’t it be a waste if one couldn’t use them anyway?\nThus in the Gu Master’s cultivation there was a saying going around: Raising a Gu is like raising a mistress.\nTo keep a mistress you would need to buy food, clothes, a house etc. It is very expensive and the more you have the more costly it is; a normal man cannot afford it.\nEven if you keep so many, a man’s energy is limited; he cannot use them all. Would you raise them just to look at them?\nWhen the rank of the Gu Master increases, so does the food standard of the Gu worm. Thus please refrain from seeing how a Gu Master has no limit to the number of refining Gu; in general a Gu Master only keeps around 4-5 Gu of his level.\nIf the number of Gu was raised higher, the Gu Master would go bankrupt!",

      "content": "Chapter 24: Close Combat Gu Master\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThree days later.\n“Lowering your body to dodge, that is the usual technique of restraining against a flying fist. When your enemy comes and attacks you, quickly squat down and at the same time do a counterattack, striking his crotch and abdomen. Do not be afraid of a swinging fist. Usually those who come up and start swinging their fists at the first moment are people who have no brains and are impulsive and rash.”\nOn the martial arts field, the academy’s martial arts(1) instructor spoke while he performed actions to demonstrate. A wooden puppet’s right first swept over, and the martial arts instructor quickly squatted down, dodging the incoming attack. Then he threw a punch at the puppet’s abdomen, knocking it down with a few punches.\nThe students were looking at the demonstration in a circle, but most of them were lacking in spirit, showing very little interest.\nThe academy taught a variety of courses and this lesson was the one that taught foundation of martial arts. Using fists and legs to exert oneself was too inferior to the handsome and cool attack style of the moonblade, making almost all the students absent-minded.\n“The next class will be the Moonlight Gu’s usage assessment. How have you been practicing so far lately?”\n“I’m still doing good. I can do three moonblades, but only a few of them actually hit. Usually I get two blades on the grass puppet.”\n“Mmm, that’s the same like me. I specially bought a grass puppet just to practice for this in these few days.”\n.....\nThe young teens whispered to one another, their minds long gone from the lesson. They were all worried about the assessment in the next class. Just for this assessment, they had practiced hard for a long time after class, and now they were flexing their hands and feet, looking forward to the assessment.\nThe sounds of the students’ discussion had reached the instructor’s ear, and the martial arts coach jerked his gaze back at them, shouting, “No talking allowed in class, all of you keep your mouths shut and watch closely!”\nHe was a Rank two Gu master, his body rather muscular. His upper body was naked and robust, the bronzed skin littered with countless scars on it. With a loud shout he showed a threatening manner, pressing down on all the students in the field.\nSilence fell in the martial arts field.\n“The foundation of martial arts is the most important among important things. Especially in the early stages of a Gu Master’s cultivation, it is more important than anything else. All of you better focus your attention on me!”\nAfter he finished scolding, the martial arts instructor called out another wooden puppet. This light yellow wooden puppet was two meters tall, its huge wooden feet making sharp sounds as it stepped on the bluestone floor tiles. The wooden puppet stretched open its arms and rushed clumsily towards the coach.\nThe instructor dodge its attack, then fiercely hugged its waist and used his strength to push it forward down, causing the huge and tall wooden puppet to fall to the ground. Then the instructor rode on the puppet’s waist and swung his fist quickly at the puppet’s head.\nThe wooden puppet resisted for a moment, then its head was smashed broken by the instructor’s raining blows. It was paralyzed on the ground, lying motionless.\nThe martial arts instructor stood up, his breathing calm and long as always. He explained to the students, “When facing a huge and tall enemy in close combat, do not be afraid. Ruining the opponent’s center of gravity is a type of sensible tactic to pin down your enemy. Just like how I did it earlier, you must hug the opponent’s waist, control his hips and then push forward with your strength. After that you take the opportunity and get on his body and fiercely punch at your enemy. Those with no defensive capabilities will instantly collapse.”\nThe students nodded repeatedly, but most of their eyes showed disapproval. The coach saw all of this and laughed bitterly in his heart.\nEvery batch was like this. The attitudes of these youngsters were naturally easily attracted by gorgeous things. Without personal understanding and experience, it was hard for them to understand the importance of having a martial arts foundation. In truth especially for a Gu Master in his early stage, while the basic martial arts did not look promising, it was actually more important than the blade attack.\n“....Remember, in close combat, your sight must not always stare at the enemy’s eye. It should focus on the enemy’s shoulder. No matter punching or kicking, the enemy’s shoulder will always move first....”\n“...In close combat your speed is very important, the speed I am talking about in this context is not the speed of your fists, but the speed of the movement of your legs....”\n“....Distance is the best defense...”\n“...Keep your legs elastic, then you will be able to easily burst out your strength...”\n“When striking with your fists, maintain a triangle support. Otherwise you will lose your footing. The enemy has not fallen, yet instead you fell first...”\nThe instructor patiently explained while he demonstrated. These were all his valuable experiences that he got from sacrificing blood and tears, experience accumulated from long battles.\nUnfortunately the students were unaware of this. They gradually started to whisper again, the focus of the discussion still on the next lesson’s moonblade assessment.\n“This martial arts instructor is very pragmatic, but his teaching style is wrong.” Fang Yuan watched quietly among the crowd, nodding and shaking his head at times. The instructor had no discipline in his teaching; he taught completely by interest, and just taught whatever he thought of. Therefore the things he taught came out in a mess and there was a lot of complicated info. In the beginning many students listened seriously, but gradually they lost interest and diverted their attention to other aspects.\nOnly Fang Yuan listened meticulously all the way; while others were learning, he was revising. His combat experience was richer than the instructor, but listening to others narrating was also a way of verification in cultivation.\nA Gu Master’s method of fighting is usually divided between melee and ranged. The moonblade attack is a type of ranged attack, but when strictly speaking, it is considered medium range due to its effective distance only being ten meters.\nWhen it came to close combat Gu Masters, the martial arts instructor was the best example. Melee battle GuMasters would usually choose Gu that amplified their own body strengths and cultivate. These Gu would give them superhuman strength, agility, responsiveness, endurance etc.\nJust like this martial arts instructor, his whole body was covered in bronze skin. This was of course not his own skin colour, but it was a type of copper skin Gu’s effect. The copper skin Gu would increase the Gu Master’s skin toughness and defence by a lot, letting the Gu Master be able to endure more damage.\n“A single moonblade would consume 10% of primeval essence. How many times can a Gu Master throw a moonblade during battle? The number is few, especially for beginners who have difficulty forming effective blows. It can only be used as a type of trump card, the terrorizing factor is greater than its lethality. To a Rank one Gu Master, the truly useful skill would be martial arts kung fu. This is because the martial art offence is more durable and reliable. It’s a pity that this fact is something that they will not understand unless they face it with their own experience.”\nFang Yuan lightly glanced around at his peers, a faint sneer somehow forming on his lips.\nThe basic martial arts class was finally over. After a short rest, the student’s eyes were filled with anticipation; the academy elder was late. He waved his big hand, pointing at the row of grass puppets in front of the bamboo wall. He went straight to the subject and said, “Alright, today is the day to check the results. I want five people in a group coming up in proper sequence, using the moonblade to attack three times.”\nSwoosh.\nThe first group of students went up, and the moonblade danced in the air. After three rounds, only nine moonblades hit on the grass puppets.\nThe academy elder shook his head a little, feeling slightly displeased. This hit rate was too low, the key being that among these five only two managed to successfully throw out two moonblades.\n“You all better practice properly after this, especially you, and you.” The elder reprimanded in a short sentence, then he waved his big hand and said, “Next group.”\nThe two that were reprimanded dropped their heads and left the field in dismay. One of them was a girl, her eyes a little red and her heart grieving. She was only a C grade talent, yet she could not bear to use primeval stones to quickly recover her primeval essence. Thus in these three days she practiced very little, resulting in her unskilled throwing of the moonblade.\nA Gu Master needed money to refine Gu, raise Gu; even practicing to use Gu needed cash. But where was she able to get so much money? Even though her two parents were supporting her from behind, but every family had their own problems. To be short of funds was often the dilemma that a Gu Master faced.\n“Anyway I don’t have the slightest chance of getting number one. I might as well give up and save on primeval stones, that is better for me.” As she thought of this, her heart became calm once more.\nThere were actually quite a number of people who thought the same way as this young girl. Because of the lack of practice, many of the students performed poorly. The academy elder’s brow deepened more and more.\nFang Yuan watched, secretly shaking his head. “These people are really pitiful and sad. Just for a small amount of primeval stones, they gave up their own chance to make progress. Primeval stones are meant to be used; if you want to become a miser and accumulate primeval stones, then what did you become a Gu Master for?”\nIn other words, those who are shortsighted would often haggle over every penny and chase after less important things. As for those with lofty aspirations, they usually showed a tolerant and generous attitude, and had the strength to give up and let go of things.\n“It’s finally my turn.” At this moment, Gu Yue Mo Bei’s horse face lit up in a confident smile all over, and he walked up to the field. His stature was stout and gave out a fierce and strong aura. After standing still he raised his hand and threw three moonblades – all three of them hit. Among the blades, two of them hit on the puppet’s chest, while the other blade hit the puppet’s left arm, shaving away a few green grass.\nThis result naturally caused the young teens to burst with admiration.\n“Well done.” The elder’s brow slightly smoothed out.\nThe next group came up, Gu Yue Chi Cheng standing among them. He had a small and short body, his face full of pockmarks, his expression bringing a slight nervousness.\nHe sent out three moonblades continuously and all three hit on the puppet’s chest, cutting out three intertwined scars. The scars went from deep to shallow and restored back to its original appearance after a few breaths, due to the puppet’s self-healing ability.\nHowever this outcome was already tied to Gu Yue Mo Bei’s result, and also received the elder’s praise. Chi Cheng held his head high as he walked out of the field, looking at Mo Bei defiantly in the eye on the way.\n“Hmph!” Below the field, Gu Yue Mo Bei gave a cold snort, but he did not return Chi Cheng’s glare. Instead, he continued looking at Gu Yue Fang Zheng who had not gone up yet.\nHis heart clearly knew that the real threats were only Gu Yue Chi Cheng and Gu Yue Fang Zheng. The previous was the same like him – a B grade talent while also having the constant supply of primeval stones. The latter was an A grade talent; while Fang Zheng did not have as many primeval stones as them, but just by relying on his own natural recovery speed thanks to his grade talent, he would also be able to practice a lot in a short amount of time.\nRight now Gu Yue Chi Cheng’s results have appeared, showing a tie to Mo Bei, and only Gu Yue Fang Zheng was left.\nIn the last few groups, Gu Yue Fang Zheng finally came up to the stage.\n(1) 拳脚 – Chinese boxing but I translate it as martial arts, because firstly I’m not sure Chinese is the proper word here. This land isn’t really China and their language isn’t really Chinese, also writing Chinese boxing feels out of place here.",

      "content": "Chapter 25: The light of spring is enchanting\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\n“Is he Fang Yuan or Fang Zheng?” Some of the students were muttering; there were still people who could not differentiate between Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng, the two twin brothers.\n“It’s Fang Zheng. Fang Yuan is always wearing a cold expression, he would never appear tense,” someone answered.\n“Oh, then there will be a spectacle. Fang Zheng is the only A grade talent from our village in three years, after all.” The crowd casted their eyes over to the field.\nFang Zheng could feel the pressure among the gazes shot at him, and this made him feel even more nervous. Standing on the stage, his fingers were trembling slightly.\nHe threw out his first moonblade, originally intending to aim at the grass puppet’s chest. But because he was tense, he missed – in the end the moonblade imprinted onto the grass puppet’s neck area.\nThe young teens instantly let out a sound of slight surprise.\nThey thought that Fang Zheng deliberately did it. Instead of aiming for the easiest spot which was the chest of the puppet, he went for the neck instead – this was a showcase of huge self-confidence towards his own attacking skill.\nThey could not help but look forward to Fang Zheng’s next move. Gu Yue Mo Bei and Gu Yue Chi Cheng however had their complexions cast down.\nOnly those among the field who could see Fang Zheng’s error were the academy elder and Fang Yuan.\n“How dangerous!” Looking at the moonblade, Fang Zheng exclaimed in his heart while secretly feeling lucky. He took in a few deep breaths, trying his best to calm down. Then he threw out two blades. This time he did not make any mistakes, and the two blades hit accurately on the grass puppet’s chest.\nThis result made the academy elder nod his head, and Mo Bei and Chi Cheng calmed down as well. Fang Zheng’s result was different from theirs, so it would all come down to how the academy elder decided to grade them.\nThe other students let out sounds of sighing. Fang Zheng’s later performance was not interesting, making them feel slightly disappointed.\nThe next few groups were not interesting either. No one was able to perform better than Mo Bei, Chi Cheng and Fang Zheng. The youngsters started to whisper around.\n“At this rate, the top scorer in today’s assessment should be among the three of them.”\n“All three of them managed to hit the grass puppet, I wonder who the academy elder will deem better.”\n“Hold on, it’s the last group. Fang Yuan’s going up.”\n“Oh, that C grade talent ‘cold genius’? Heh heh.”\nRight when it was the last group, Fang Yuan finally went up stage.\n“It’s that Fang Yuan....” Gu Yue Mo Bei lifted his head and looked at Fang Yuan for a moment, then he lowered his eyes uncaringly.\n“Last time you got really lucky, choosing a weak-willed Moonlight Gu by accident and getting number one. Let’s see how you perform this time!” Gu Yue Chi Cheng hugged his arms, waiting to see Fang Yuan make a fool of himself.\n“Big brother... This time will not be like the last. I have practiced so hard for so long, I can definitely surpass you.” Among the crowd, Gu Yue Fang Zheng pursed his lips, subconsciously clenching his fists tightly.\nPreviously in the assessment to refine the vital Gu, he as someone with an A grade talent actually got second position. Naturally he was not happy with this. Especially after he understood that Fang Yuan was able to win and get number one because of sheer luck, this made him even more unsatisfied. To Gu Yue Fang Zheng, being victorious over his own older brother Fang Yuan had a special and great significance.\nMany gazes were gathered on Fang Yuan, and the academy elder’s sight was fixed on him as well. Fang Yuan made no emotion; his expression was cold and detached.\nHe stood still, primeval essence pouring into the Moonlight Gu in the heart of his palm. With a cut in the air, he struck out the first moonblade.\nThis moonblade flew very high. It not only went over the grass puppet’s head, but flew over the bamboo wall as well. It went on for almost fifteen meters before the light turned dim and vanished into thin air.\n“Pfffft...” Someone couldn’t help but laugh out.\n“This is way too outrageous, isn’t it.” Someone sneered.\n“He’s indeed a genius. No wonder he managed to get number one in refining the Gu.” Another spoke sarcastically.\nIn the earlier years when Fang Yuan created poetry and showed early wisdom, it had already caused discontented emotions among these people. Later on when he relied on ‘luck’ and got number one in refining his vital Gu, this made them feel a layer of jealousy among their dissatisfaction.\nMany of them were waiting to see a ‘good show’. They waited to see the ‘genius’ Fang Yuan reveal an embarrassing action, and this moonblade of his did not let them down.\nWaves of laughter swept across the crowd.\nThe academy elder shook his head slightly, secretly laughing at himself. Why did he have to be so concerned with Fang Yuan for no reason? He was just a C grade and merely a boy who got number one in refining Gu because of sheer luck.\nIn his heart he had already made up his mind. Although Mo Bei, Chi Cheng and Fang Zheng’s results were the same, he would still pick Fang Zheng as number one.\nThe war between Gu Yue Mo Bei and Gu Yue Chi Cheng was the epitome of the political struggle between the two most powerful elders in the clan. The academy elder had always remained in the center and had no intention to enter the middle of the political vortex.\nThe academy elder was more inclined towards the clan head Gu Yue Bo, and Fang Zheng was a set with the clan leader. Add in the fact that he had A grade talent, choosing him as number one would mean showing biased care for him, and it was something the clan’s upper authorities could accept.\nA warm spring breeze blew over, the smell of flowers drifting into the training grounds. The sunlight shone down on Fang Yuan’s body, sending a lonely black shadow onto the ground.\nHis expression was still cold as he quietly gazed at the grass puppet ten meters away. The moonblade in his palm was giving out a faint blue light.\nOf course, he had deliberately thrown the first moonblade off course. Right now he only had two chances left to act. Taking into account the academy elder’s position, to acquire number one he would have to create an outcome that exceeded everyone’s expectations in the next two attacks.\n“With only two chances left to attack, it’s impossible. Big brother, I have finally won over you.” Gu Yue Fang Zheng’s eyes did not flicker as he stared at Fang Yuan. From young till old, the life shadow that his older brother had brought onto him finally faded away slowly at this moment.\nFang Zheng could feel victory so nearby. His two fists were subconsciously clenched tight, his entire body so full of excitement that he trembled slightly.\n“Big brother, my victory this time is just a beginning. Next, I will keep on winning over you again and again until I banish away all the shadows in my heart. I will prove to the clan, the excellence of an A grade talent genius!” Fang Zheng told himself in his heart.\nBut just at this moment, Fang Yuan acted. His right palm was like a knife, splitting the void.\nWith a sharp tearing sound, the watery blue light shrouded in his palm was thrown out. It flew in the air, turning into a curved blue moonblade, shooting towards the grass puppet.\nIn just the next second Fang Yuan’s right palm lit up again in a coat of blue light. He turned his palm and shot out the third moonblade. These two attacks connected smoothly like flowing water; it was a seamless combination.\nThe two moonblades flew out in quick succession, the distance between the two blades less than half a meter apart in the air. Under the stunned gazes of the crowd, the two moonblades accurately hit onto the grass puppet’s neck.\n“This...” Fang Zheng’s pupils shrank, a bad feeling emerging from his heart. In the next moment, the students slowly opened their mouths wide as they wore astonished expressions.\nThey saw that the grass puppet’s head slowly tilted to one side, then it fell off the neck and dropped onto the ground. With a bounce, it rolled two to three meters away.\nFang Yuan had beheaded the puppet!\nThis outcome had gone beyond the expectations of everyone on field.\n“Is this luck or skill?” The academy elder frowned. This doubt hovered in the hearts of the rest of the students. For a time, the entire training ground lapsed into silence.\n“How could this be...” Fang Zheng murmured. He stared at Fang Yuan blankly, the surged emotions in his heart dropping instantly, falling deep into the lowest point.\nFang Yuan narrowed his eyes, acting as if he was oblivious to the gazes that fell onto him from the crowd.\nCluck, cluck...\nUnder the blue skies and white clouds, a group of peacock parrots suddenly flapped their wings and flew in mid-air. They dragged their magnificent, long and slender peacock tails, clucking in the air as they flew about playfully.\nFang Yuan stood in the center of the training field, looking up. Under the bright sunlight, the multi-coloured feathers of the birds dazzled even greater and gorgeous. His expression was indifferent, as if the person who just cut off the grass puppet’s head was not him.\n“Ah, the light of spring is really enchanting..” He sighed in his heart.",

      "content": "Chapter 26: The nature of all organizations\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nAs it neared nightfall, the sun on the edge of the horizon looked like blood. The afterglow rays poured into the school where around fifty students sat upright. On the stage above, the academy elder was reading out names one by one, distributing allowance to them.\nThis was the academy’s weekly subsidy where every seven days allowance would be distributed. One could say it was financial aid for these young teens. After all with their capabilities, to feed and raise their own Gu was a lot of financial pressure.\n“Gu Yue Fang Yuan.” The elder read aloud.\nFang Yuan got up from the seat by the window at the last row. He walked up the stage, receiving two moneybags. In one bag was three primeval stones – the clan’s allowance. The other bag held the reward of ten primeval stones.\n“Work hard,” the elder said. He gave Fang Yuan a deep look. Fang Yuan had continuously achieved number one, and this had let those elders who were originally disappointed in him start paying slight attention.\nFang Yuan nodded his head and took the purse into his arms, returning to his seat.\n“Damn it, he actually got number one again...” Gu Yue Mo Bei fixed his gaze onto Fang Yuan firmly, his heart rather furious.\n“Those two moonblades consecutively hit the neck of the puppet. Is this because of sheer luck or real skill?” Gu Yue Chi Cheng narrowed his eyes. Since the end of the assessment until now, this question had been hovering in his mind.\nIt was not just him – many students unconsciously drifted their sights towards Fang Yuan. This question haunted them. Although they had lost, their hearts were unsatisfied and they wanted to question what actually had happened.\nWhen the day was about to end, the academy elder announced a matter. “You all have been in the academy for an amount of time now, and you are familiar with how to use your vital Gu as well. In the next few days I will teach you all how to warm and nourish your aperture, advancing a Gu Master’s cultivation realm. The higher the realm of a Gu Master, the more concise your primeval essence becomes. A Rank one Gu Master has green copper primeval essence; a Rank two Gu Master has red iron primeval essence and a Rank three Gu Master possesses white silver primeval essence. A portion of red iron primeval essence is comparable to ten portions of green copper primeval essence. Similarly a portion of white silver primeval essence equals ten portions of red iron primeval essence!”\n“You must all remember, the Gu are just tools that we use. Cultivation is the foundation of us Gu Masters. The higher your rank, the stronger the Gu you are able to use. In the next three months, whoever can take the lead and promote to Rank one middle stage will receive a reward of thirty primeval stones. At the same time he will be able to choose the second Gu first. After three months, we will elect a class monitor and two vice-class monitors based on the results. The class monitor will enjoy a subsidy of ten primeval stones while the vice-class monitor will have an allowance of five pieces! Alright, that’s all for today. You can all leave.”\nThe elder’s words made the academy burst with noise.\n“Time to elect the class monitor and vice-class monitor!” Someone clenched his fist in excitement.\n“The class monitor receives ten primeval stones every seven days, and the vice-class monitor gets five pieces? If I am able to be the first to reach Rank one middle stage, I will definitely be able to become the class monitor.” Another had lights in his eyes.\n“The primeval stones are not the important focus. What matters here is the position of class monitor and vice-class monitor – it represents glory and places one’s identity over others. When normal students sees the class monitor they must all bow and greet him.” Gu Yue Mo Bei and Chi Cheng did not lack primeval stones, but they deemed the glory of the position very important.\n“To become the class monitor, without mistake it is the first person who promotes to Rank one middle stage first! That means when big brother see me in future, he would have to bow and automatically greet me. Hold up, where is big brother?” Gu Yue Fang Zheng subconsciously looked back, but Fang Yuan’s seat was empty.\nThe students walked out of the academy.\n“Where’s Gu Yue Fang Yuan?” Gu Yue Mo Bei wanted to look for Fang Yuan and ask him face to face. However Fang Yuan was one step ahead and had long left.\n“Hmph, he sure ran away fast. Is he afraid? Looks like he got lucky again in today’s test.” Gu Yue Chi Cheng sneered.\n“Whatever, it’s just ten primeval stones. I don’t need to care about this small matter, right now what’s important is to advance to middle stage and get that class monitor position.” Gu Yue Mo Bei narrowed his eyes, looking at his side where Gu Yue Chi Cheng and Gu Yue Fang Zheng were.\nThese two figures were his real enemy, while Fang Yuan was just a small C grade talent; he was not on par.\n“In the first two times, Fang Yuan got lucky and got number one. However this time it is a cultivation test, and the focus is on the talent of cultivation. When the talent is higher by a grade, the advantage becomes much greater,” Gu Yue Chi Cheng thought, depressed in his heart. His real grade talent was only a C grade; it was only because of cheating that let him gain the illusion of having B grade.\n“Just a mere class monitor and two vice-class monitor positions got them itching their fists. How hot-blooded and naïve they are at this age,” Fang Yuan sneered as he leaned against the gateway of the academy.\nThe so-called glory was just a valuable tool the upper levels used to motivate those below them. In the end, it was just a layer of illusionary glory, it was useless!\nHis five hundred years of experience had long allowed Fang Yuan to understand some of the secrets of life.\n“Whether it comes to a clan, sect or demonic group, whether it is this world or earth, all organizations are like this. The high and low positions are established, making the law of promotion clear, letting those in the organization climb up non-stop from the bottom. Because chasing after profit is the nature of humans, and positions of authority often make people have superiority, creating the illusion that oneself is living a more valuable life than others.”\n“Power is like the carrot dangling in front of a donkey. The desires of humans are stimulated by it, and each of them secure their personal gains with someone with authority for it. After climbing up one level, there will be a higher level. While they are busy currying favour for personal gain, their hard work is squeezed out from them and their value is exploited by the upper position.”\n“In every organization, as long as there is a chain of command, it is to give serve to those at the upper ranks. The so-called class monitor and vice-class monitor position is like the smallest carrot, luring everyone else into the structure of the clan. And to stop those below from realizing the truth, those at the higher positions integrate shared values, clear-cutting the idea of glory, meritorious deeds etc. The establishment of high and low positions are made along with unequal benefits. Sometimes the use of religion is done to dominate people’s hearts.”\n“This is the real truth, yet it is a pity that too many people in the world do not understand; they foolishly work hard for others. And for every organization in the world, the most fundamental of its essence is just one thing, and that is – The redistribution of resources, where the higher the position the more resources they can enjoy.”\nIn his previous life Fang Yuan had founded the Bloodwing Demon Sect in the Middle Kingdom, where he taught up to tens of thousands of people. He erected the positions of demon soldiers, demon generals, demon sages etc. Each position gave their corresponding benefits, letting countless people flock over like ducks, letting Fang Yuan order them around. This kind of experience allowed Fang Yuan to understand clearly the way of thinking in this principle.\n“Thus any organization is just a representation, while the real basis is just one word – resources. Without food resources, one will die of starvation. Without water resources, one will die of thirst. Without cultivation resources, one will become weak and sooner or later, be bullied to death.”\n“And for a Gu Master, primeval stones are the most important resource!” Fang Yuan’s two orbs were deep like an ancient pond, and as his mind reached this point the corners of his lips curled up slightly, creating the outline of a sneer.\nHe had long left the academy, and right now he stood at the gate entrance of the school. He saw the first batch of students coming out, gradually walking closer towards him.\n“It’s Fang Yuan.”\n“What’s he doing at the middle of the gate entrance?”\n“Hmph, every time I see his dead dysfunctional state, I feel so pissed off.”\n“Don’t worry about him, he’s probably waiting for someone.”\nThe young teens paid no attention to him. Just as they were about to walk over, Fang Yuan strode across and blocked them. “I’m plundering. Everyone must surrender a piece of primeval stone before they can leave.”",

      "content": "Chapter 27: Outright extortion\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe young teens were instantly shocked and angry.\n“What, I didn’t hear wrongly, did I?”\n“Fang Yuan, your head must have overheated and gone confused. You would actually stand at the gates of the academy and blackmail us?!”\n“Have you gone mad? Who gave you the guts to put your ideas on us?”\n“Scram, you’re just a petty C grade, how dare you block my way. If you don’t scram, I will send you flying with my...Urghh!”\nFang Yuan suddenly lashed out.\nHis right palm furiously cut forward. His movement was quick and precise, his slice of his palm hitting the left side of someone’s neck.\nThis unlucky teenager was totally not expecting Fang Yuan to suddenly attack him. While he was still cursing at Fang Yuan, he suddenly suffered a heavy blow. His two eyes instantly rolled up and he fainted on the spot.\n“Fuck! You actually dared to strike?!” The crowd jumped, and the young teens subconsciously retreated backwards.\n“Gu Yue Bei Ju fainted, what do we do?” Some of them were terrified and scared, shouting around in horror.\n“What else can be done?! There’s so many of us, and Fang Yuan is alone. We should all rush at him together and beat him up.” Some people were shouting, their rage erupting.\n“That’s right, he sure doesn’t know his place! How he dares to provoke us by himself. He’s definitely digging his own grave with his over-ambitiousness! Everyone get on him together!!”\nYet before they could do anything, Fang Yuan had already struck. He strode a few steps forward, rushing into the group of teenagers.\nHe slashed his palm and the edge of his hand cut onto a youth’s neck. The young man rolled his eyes upward and fell.\n“Ahh —!” Another teen yelled loudly, swinging his fist at Fang Yuan, sweeping through the air. Fang Yuan lowered his body and dodged, then he lifted his leg and kicked the boy’s crotch area.\nAHH OWWwwww—!\nThe youngster’s loud roar was originally sonorous and indignant, but after he took the blow his voice instantly rose higher and became sharp and shrill, filled with a kind of misery and pain.\nThump.\nHe covered his crotch with his two hands, his knees giving way as he dropped to the ground. He rolled around on the floor screaming loudly, the pain so great his entire body was covered in cold sweat.\nFang Yuan swung his two fists around like a tiger that had entered a flock of sheep!\nHe had five hundred years of battle experience, and these youngsters were just a bunch of soft green kids; they had only just started cultivating not long ago, how could they possibly be his opponents?\nIn the blink of an eye, Fang Yuan put down the entire group of young students. If they had not fainted, then they would be lying on the ground, the pain making them drained and their bodies hurting all over.\n“What’s going on here?!” Gu Yue Mo Bei arrived and exclaimed. He saw that Fang Yuan stood at the entrance of the academy gates, and there were five to six students on the floor around him.\n“This Fang Yuan, h-he wants to extort our primeval stones!” One of them lying on the floor shouted angrily while clutching his belly.\n“Wow, still full of energy huh.” Fang Yuan’s expression was flat as he kicked fiercely at the abdomen of the boy who just yelled.\nOww!\nThe youngster immediately cried out in pain, his body curling up like a shrimp. Fear emerged from his face, his tears streaming down as he dared not to speak again.\nAs they saw this scene, the students that came over all felt Fang Yuan’s fierce savageness and cruelty, their hearts throbbing.\n“Alright, all of you be good and hand out a piece of primeval stone. Then I’ll let you go, or else, these people on the ground here will be your fate.” Fang Yuan made a big step forward, his tone callous.\n“In your mother’s face! You petty little C grade would even dare to win me, a B grade?” Gu Yue Mo Bei flew into a rage, swinging his fists as he rushed toward Fang Yuan before they knew it.\nWith a slight turn of his ankle, Fang Yuan swerved gently sideways and let Mo Bei’s fist fly past. Then he stretched out his left hand, lifting the index and middle finger toward the center of Mo Bei’s clavicle, accurately jabbing at the area below the throat.\nMo Bei immediately blacked out, falling onto the ground with a thump, fainting on the spot.\nHiss...\nAs they saw what just happened, the young students that planned to rush forward quickly stopped, each of them releasing a mouthful of cold air.\nIn the eyes of these youngsters, Fang Yuan’s attacks were suddenly too profound to be understood. They did not pay attention to basic martial arts, but in reality it was vaguely mentioned during class. The human body had many vulnerable parts, and several parts that Fang Yuan had struck were one of those vulnerable places. When these parts were struck, it would easily make a person faint on the spot, and a heavy blow would induce a life-threatening crisis.\nHowever Fang Yuan had proper restraint when he attacked.\nThose that he had tackled down were either knocked out or suffering in immense pain, losing the ability for combat in a short amount of time. There was no one who was really seriously injured.\nThis was the terror of five hundred years’ worth of combat experience!\n“Are you going to give me your stones or not?” Fang Yuan did a step forward, forcing the other youths. They looked at each other for a moment, then half of them gritted their teeth while the other half roared angrily, all of them swarming towards Fang Yuan.\nFang Yuan dodged about while striking at the same time. His cultivation base was lowly, but his realm was still there; his heart was cool as ice, his movements quick and precise.\nThump, thump...\nAfter a few breaths, bodies fell down onto the ground again.\n“It’s too vicious! Too terrible!”\n“They’re not going to die, are they?”\nThere were still a few young girls left behind; they did not rush forward. Their eyes were open wide, and after seeing what had happened so far their bodies trembled more and more.\nFang Yuan swept his gaze to them, and their faces turned pale as they quickly waved their hands and retreated. “No, don’t come over. We’ll surrender, we’ll surrender the stones!”\nAfter Fang Yuan received a few pieces of primeval stones, he let them go. They stumbled out of the academy gateway, while in succession several students came over.\nTo leave the academy, this gateway was the only route. With Fang Yuan blocking this path, he would be able to block out all the students.\n“Damn, what’s going on?!” The new wave of students stared in amazement.\n“Isn’t that Gu Yue Mo Bei?” Gu Yue Chi Cheng stared at the unconscious Mo Bei on the floor, his eyes wide and his mouth agape.\nWhen Fang Yuan opened his mouth and spoke, the youngsters were instantly angered and they attacked him, then they fell.\n“Sir elder, we’re just going to keep watching all of this and not stop them? What if someone loses their life, how are we going to salvage the matter?” The guards were worried.\nSome of the guards were indignant, saying, “This Fang Yuan has too much guts. He would actually dare to extort his classmates at the academy school gates under our eyelids. This is acting with utter disregard of the law and discipline! As long as sir gives the command, we subordinates will take away this kid.”\nThe violent matter of Fang Yuan blocking the gateway and openly extorting his classmates had long attracted attention since the beginning. But mortal guards had no right to punish the students, so they could only go first to the academy elder and report.\nWhen the academy elder heard the news, he did not immediately command for them to stop it. Instead he went up the pavilion and observed from afar.\n“Looks like this child has fighting talent.” The longer the academy elder watched the more interested he felt.\nFang Yuan’s use of the moonblade today had already caused some uncertainty in the elder. Right now he watched as Fang Yuan with his strength alone, making an enemy out of the entire batch of students, bearing a sort of unstoppable fighting style of graceful demeanor. With this the doubts in his heart were cleared.\nIn this world, there were those who were particularly keen and sharp towards battles; these were hidden gifts. They were good at fighting, and they loved battles. In the battles they were often inspired, and always created surprising and even unbelievable accomplishments.\n“Ah, he’s a natural battle Gu Master. Pity, his talent is only C grade; in the end he just lacks one step of a grade.” The academy elder heaved a sigh.\n“Sir, are you not going to stop this farce? Letting him go on with this nonsense, I’m afraid the consequences wouldn’t be too good.” The guards beside him had worried expressions on their faces.",

      "content": "Chapter 28: Capital free business\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\n“Why stop it?” The academy elder lifted his eyebrows and laughed. He lifted a finger and pointed it at Fang Yuan who was far away and said, “This young man has taken control of the entire situation, and his attacks are fully restrained. Look at the way he cuts at the neck, he only acts on the left or right side, but never cutting at the nape. This is because he knows that striking the neck sides can make a person faint on the spot. Meanwhile attacking the area at the back of the head and neck could cause death, so he automatically abandoned that way of attacking.”\n“Look at all those youths on the ground, which one of them is actually heavily injured? None! Even if they were badly hurt, so what? Are you saying that our academy’s treatment Gu Masters won’t be able to cure this sort of traumatic wound?”\n“But sir elder, that child is just too arrogant. He blocked the entrance; this is obviously not acknowledging our existence as guards! Being ignored isn’t the main problem though, the important matter is how the clan will think of our academy. To actually allow a small petty C grade student make a fuss in the academy and not stop it. If word goes out, we’re afraid this might affect your reputation, sir elder.” The guard squinted as he said this.\n“Hmph, in reality is that because you all were disregarded by the boy, so your own dignity feels challenged?” The academy elder was not too happy. He sneered and shot a gaze as sharp as a sword edge at the guards. They all lowered their heads, all of them disagreeing.\n“What’s wrong with fighting? As long as lives are not lost, it will stir up the competitive side of the students and temper their will to fight. To stop this kind of fight is to stifle the student’s fighting passion! Was there no fighting in the past batches? Every batch had their own battles, and it happened very often. The only difference was that it usually happened in the latter half of the year when the students had already mastered some means of fighting. With strength they itched to fight, and at the same time it is an aggressive age. Why didn’t you stop those people back then?” The academy elder questioned in a cold voice.\n“Maybe it was because the fights in the previous years were all single battles, there were rarely huge scale fighting like this one. But this Fang Yuan is really good at creating a disturbance!” The chief of the guards replied.\n“No, no, no.” The academy elder shook his head, “That was because you all did not dare to stop it. Because after half a year, a Gu Master will have the ability to fight beyond a mortal’s strength, and with your petty mortal bodies, how are you supposed to stop it? Right now you all want to stop Fang Yuan, perhaps it is because he just started cultivating, so he doesn’t have enough power. It’s also because you feel that he ignored your existence and offended your dignity. But you must all remember, these students all bear the surname of Gu Yue! They are my Gu Yue clan’s clan members, your masters! Even if they are still of young age, no matter how weak, they are still your masters!”\nThe elder’s tone had turned sharply.\n“Your surnames are not Gu Yue, what is your worth? Because of your loyalty, you were all given the position of guards, rewarding you with some sweet benefits. But in reality, you are still slaves. Just slaves! A slave dare give preposterous opinions of their masters, caring about the matters of their masters?” The elder’s face was dark like water.\n“This was not your subordinates idea, not my meaning!”\n“I wouldn’t dare! I wouldn’t dare!”\nThe guards were ashen-faced as they kneeled down to the ground, spouting nonstop. The academy elder gave a cold snort and pointed at the chief guard who had just called Fang Yuan a person good at creating disturbances. “You gave an outrageous comment on your master. You are relieved of your position.”\nAfter a while, the elder said to the others, “After half a month, there will be a re-examination to determine the new chief.”\nThe other guards immediately had eyes that shone, their hearts pumping with enthusiasm.\n“The position of chief of the guard! Every month I’ll be able to receive half a primeval stone more!”\n“To be able to become the chief is to become a man above men. Aside from the masters, I dare to see who else would show displeasure at me?”\n“If I became the chief, how cool that would be...”\n“Alright, what are you all pestling here for? Get downstairs and wait for the battle to end, then sweep the field!” The elder roared.\n“Yes, yes, yes.”\n“Your subordinate takes his leave!”\nThe guards left in reverence and awe as they went down. One of the guards on the stairs lost his footing and fell down. Immediately there was a series of sounds implicating a chain of people falling and knocking down.\nHowever under the academy elder’s power and influence, the guards reddened their faces and endured in suffering, not letting out a single noise.\n“Hmph! Those minions are just like dogs. Every once in a while they’d get this itch to misbehave; you’d have to smack them so that they know fear and respect. Then just throw some small victories and bones to them, letting them fight amongst themselves like dogs, letting them compete amongst themselves to serve my clan with their life. To hold a stick in one hand and a carrot in another – This is the unique way of the upper echelons.” As the academy elder heard the quiet movements below, he sneered in his heart and turned his head, looking through the window and at the school gates.\nA fresh group of ten or so students were on the ground at the entrance. Fang Yuan stood proudly, and there were three young girls back-to-back, huddling at a side opposite him.\n“You, you-you better not come over!”\n“If you come over, we’ll shoot you with the moonblade!!”\nIn their hands were a layer of blue radiance. It seemed like they were compelled to the point they would actually mobilize their primeval essence and use the Moonlight Gu.\nFang Yuan’s body was still that of a normal fifteen-year-old boy, and if they attacked him with the moonblade it would not do him any good. Yet he was not afraid – instead he sneered at them and walked step by step towards the girls. “You girls have pretty big guts huh, have you forgotten the rules of the school? Inside the academy fighting using Gu is forbidden, or else the penalty will be expulsion. If you girls want to be expelled, then just do it.”\n“This...”The young girls hesitated.\n“Indeed there is such a rule.” The blue light in their hands faded away.\nFang Yuan’s eyes flashed as he caught this opening and dashed forward, his palms waving in the air, cutting down two of them without a shadow of doubt.\nBeing the last one, her morale dropped and her knees turned weak. She collapsed to the ground crying heavily, begging fang Yuan, “Don’t you come over Fang Yuan, please let me go.”\nFang Yuan stared down at the young girl with a condescending look, his cold voice sounding in her ears. “A piece of primeval stone.”\nThe girl’s body fluttered and she quickly opened her money pouch, realization taking hold of her. She took out three to four pieces of primeval stones and held them in her palm, stretching out her hand to Fang Yuan, “Don’t hit me, I’ll give them all to you, I’ll give all my stones to you!”\nFang Yuan was expressionless as he slowly reached out with his right hand. He lifted his forefinger and thumb, gently pinching at a piece of primeval stone from the girl’s hand.\nThe young maiden could not stop trembling. Fang Yuan’s hand had a youth’s pale and slender form, but in her eyes his hand was horrifying like a ferocious claw of terror.\n“I’ve said it earlier, I will only take one piece of primeval stone.” Fang Yuan paused for a moment, then he said plainly, “You may leave.”\nThe girl stared at Fang Yuan for a good while, then she finally got up. But her limbs were still weak and she could not properly stand. Her heart was already full of fear towards Fang Yuan, and she was afraid to the point that she could not muster a single breath of energy.\nWhen the academy elder saw this, he could not help but shake his head. One of his reasons to remain an observer was to borrow the chance to see each of the student’s respective fighting talents.\nThis girl who collapsed on the ground was only a C grade talent, but with this kind of mentality she could only become a logistics Gu Master. She would be able to be productive in the clan, but there was no expectation for her to be on the battlefield.\n“As for this Fang Yuan...” The academy elder rubbed his chin, his eyes squinting with a flash of light. He felt that Fang Yuan was very interesting. Not only did Fang Yuan possess fighting talent, he even had a sense of propriety. To just extort for a piece of primeval stone was not beyond the bounds in the elder’s heart. But if fang Yuan wanted to blackmail for two pieces, that would be too much and he would need to intervene.\nThe academy’s allowance was originally three pieces. To have a piece taken away would still be considered harmless. But if he extorted away two stones, then what is the point of giving out subsidy? He might as well just give everything to Fang Yuan.\nVery quickly the last group of students arrived. There were only five people, and among them was Fang Yuan’s twin younger brother.\n“Big brother, how could you be like this?! You are too bold, to actually beat up your classmates at the gates and take away their primeval stones!” Gu Yue Fang Zheng was wide-eyed as he looked at the scene. He could not believe what he was seeing before him, “I advice you to quickly go to the academy elder and take the initiative to admit your mistake, or else with you making such a huge matter, it’s not a joke, you might actually get expelled!”\nFang Yuan laughed and said, “You’re right.”\nFang Zheng heaved a relieved sigh. Seeing that his older brother hadn’t gone insane and could still be persuaded, that was good.\nBut very quickly he heard Fang Yuan say again, “Every one of you, a piece of primeval stone.”\n“What?” Fang Zheng opened his mouth wide with surprise, “Even I need to pay up?”\n“My dearest little brother, of course you can choose not to.” Fang Yuan’s tone was very gentle. “But you will end up just like them,” he said and pointed at those fallen on the ground. Some of them had fainted, and some of them were moaning in pain.\n“Even his own younger brother isn’t spared!”\n“This Fang Yuan is crazy, he’s too vicious...”\n“We cannot defeat him, a wise man does not fight when the odds are against him. We better hand it over and overcome the trouble.”\n“That’s right, we’ll just pass up the primeval stone first. It’s just one piece anyway, when we go back and report to the teachers, he’ll be getting it!”\nWith the lesson drawn from their classmate’s mistakes, the remaining youngsters obediently accepted Fang Yuan’s blackmail with gazes of defiance.\n“Hold up.” Just as they were about to leave, Fang Yuan shouted at them to halt.\n“Fang Yuan, are you actually going to go back on your word?” The youths started to become nervous.\nFang Yuan faced the teenagers on the ground, gently sighing. “Do you guys really think that I would squat down and search through their bodies one by one?”\nThe youths stared blankly, then they were hit by realization one by one. Each of them turned red in the face and stood at the spot hesitatingly.\nFang Yuan stared at them, narrowing his eyes. There was a flash of cold light in his gaze; immediately the five youngsters felt their heart beating fast, their scalps going numb at the same time.\n“Alright, Fang Yuan. We understand your meaning.”\n“We’ll just help you this once.”\nUnder Fang Yuan’s despotic aura, they could only lower their heads and search through each of the young teen’s money pouches on the ground, taking out a piece of primeval stone from each bag. Then they brought it together and passed it to Fang Yuan.\nThe entire class had a total of fifty-seven people. By extorting a piece of primeval stone from every single one of them, Fang Yuan held fifty-six pieces.\nHe originally had twenty pieces, but he spent ten to buy a few jars of green bamboo wine. Adding the number of primeval stones from his own allowance and reward, the total number of primeval stones he had in his possession amounted up to seventy-nine pieces.\n“This sort of capital free business that consists of extortion and plundering is really the most profitable business.” Fang Yuan pocketed his money pouch that had suddenly expanded greatly into his bosom and strutted away, leaving behind a floor full of teenagers, lying like corpses on the ground.\nAnd a few teenagers, Fang Zheng among them, blankly stared after Fang Yuan’s gradually disappearing shadow.\n“Get out there fast.”\n“All of you, faster! Arrange the little masters properly.”\n“The treatment Gu Master, where is he, ask him to come over fast!”\nThe guards were yelling as they all rushed forward, falling over each other in their eagerness to present themselves. They willingly gave their all for the small position of being the chief guard.",

      "content": "Chapter 29: Unscrupulous\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\n\"Put all the wine jars under the bed.\" Fang Yuan pointed and directed four workers from the inn. In each man’s hands were jars of green bamboo wine. Right after Fang Yuan successfully extorted his peers, he went to the inn and bought twenty jars in one go.\nEach jar cost two pieces of primeval stones, and Fang Yuan pumped in forty primeval stones for the sake of the Liquor worm.\nThe money pouch that had bulged out not long ago deflated by half in an instant, leaving thirty-nine pieces of primeval stones behind. However it was worth the money – these wine would be able to support the Liquor worm for a long time.\n\"Alright,\" the workers immediately replied. They would not dare to show any hint of disrespect to a Gu Master. Add on to the fact that Fang Yuan had bought so much wine, he could be said as the inn’s big customer. With just a casual word before the innkeeper, the workers were able to easily put down their current activities and workload.\nAfter the inn servants left, Fang Yuan closed the dormitory door and sat cross-legged on his bed.\nIt was already nighttime. The stars and moon in the sky were bright, and the night breeze flowed with a hint of scented fragrance.\nThere was no light in the room. Fang Yuan calmed his state of mind, letting his focus slip into the primeval sea.\nThe waves of the primeval sea rose and fell, the seawater giving out green copper coloured light. Every drop of seawater was the green copper primeval essence that a Rank one Gu Master specially had. The primeval sea took up 44% of the entire aperture; this was Fang Yuan’s C grade talent’s limitation.\nThe four walls of the aperture were a thin layer of white light, supporting and encasing the aperture. In the sky above the primeval sea there was nothing. The Spring Autumn Cicada had already hidden itself away under Fang Yuan’s command, restoring itself under a deep sleep.\nFloating on the primeval sea was a cute and chubby white Liquor worm. It frisked about with its heart’s content on the seawater, sometimes diving into the sea, other times shaking its head and tail, splashing and splattering water droplets around.\nFang Yuan sent a thought through his mind, and the Liquor worm immediately responded. It stopped playing and curled up into the shape of a rice dumpling, leisurely floating into the air. It rose up to the middle of the aperture and out of the green copper sea.\n\"Go.\" Fang Yuan mobilized a tenth of his primeval essence, transforming it into a narrow flow, thrusting it all into the Liquor worm. The Liquor worm had already been refined by him, so this time it did not resist. It took in the entire jet of primeval essence and absorbed everything into its body.\nImmediately the sea surface dropped by a small cut. The curled up Liquor worm turned the primeval essence into a driving force and began to radiate out white light. Inside the soft light, an enshrouding mist of wine fumes were gradually produced, finally converging into a pale white wine mist.\nThe wine mist was marvelous. It did not drift apart, instead enveloping around the Liquor worm.\n\"Rise.\" Fang Yuan gave a thought, transferring another 10% of his primeval essence. The green copper seawater dived into the wine mist; as the wine mist melted into the seawater, it gradually lessened, and eventually there was no trace of it left. As for that 10% of green copper primeval essence, it also lost its general volume and was left with 5%.\nHowever this 5% of primeval essence was even more condensed than before. The original primeval essence was a jade green, giving out a copper luster. Right now although this new primeval essence had the same copper luster, the green was a darker shade – it was pale green.\nPale green coloured primeval essence was the primeval essence that only a Rank one middle stage Gu Master would have. The Liquor worm’s use was to condense the primeval essence and increase it by a small realm rank!\nA Gu Master had 9 great realms, from the bottom – Rank one, Rank two, all the way to Rank nine. Every great realm was split into four smaller realms, which were initial stage, middle stage, upper stage and peak stage.\nFang Yuan was only a Rank one initial stage Gu Master right now, but with the Liquor worm’s help he had 5% of a Rank one middle stage Gu Master’s primeval essence!\n\"If I want to condense out 5% of middle stage primeval essence I would need to use 20% of initial stage primeval essence. I want to convert all the 44% of my primeval sea into middle stage primeval essence, so I’d need to use around 180% of initial stage primeval essence. To reach this target as soon as possible, I’d need to borrow the help of primeval stones.\"\nAs he thought of this, Fang Yuan opened his eyes and took out a complete primeval stone the size of a duck egg from his bag. The primeval stone was a sort of ellipsoidal shaped, translucent grey stone. As the natural essence inside it is consumed, its size would continue shrinking.\nHis right hand slowly closed, the primeval stone tightly clenched in his palm. He absorbed the natural primeval essence inside the stone, continuously replenishing his own aperture. The level of the sea surface that had fallen in his aperture slowly began to rise.\nThe primeval stone was meant to be used. Fang Yuan was not stingy by one bit, and he would not save it up.\n\"I do not have someone to back me up, and I do not have support from friends and family, thus I can only rely on extortion and plundering. Today was just the first time, but after this, every seven days when the academy gives out the school allowance, I will continue blocking the academy gates.\"\nHow could robbing and blackmailing once satisfy Fang Yuan’s appetite? In a Gu Master’s cultivation, the primeval stone was the most scarce thing. As for the consequences of his plundering actions, Fang Yuan was not the least worried.\nThis world was not the same as Earth.\nOn Earth, schools would always prohibit fights to mainly stabilize harmony. But in this world, fighting was the main theme.\nNo matter a Gu Master or common mortal, they would fight for survival. Sometimes it would be a fight with a scary wild beast. Sometimes it would be a battle against the raging weather, and other times if could be a fight against other Gu Masters over resources.\nAs a result, moderate fighting was instead encouraged and advocated by people.\nFrom young to old, from simple brawls to battles determining life and death, this was the portrayal of most of the human lives here.\nThis surface of this world was boundless. Just the Southern Border alone that Fang Yuan stayed in now, it was bigger than seven to eight times the entire surface of Earth itself. The living environment here was hostile and cruel, so humans would often construct mountain villages in the form of clans, holing up together.\nEvery now and then there would be waves of beasts, or perhaps extremely bad weather assaulting a village. The Gu Master would become the core force of a village’s protection, and every year the situation of attrition would become more serious.\nSurviving requires men with strong fighting will. A clan needs battle Gu Masters, there is never too much. Moreover, Fang Yuan’s attacks were within the proper limit.\nHe never attacked the lower jaw, as this would easily cause the skull to fracture and cause the loss of a human life. He also never struck the back of the head. When fighting he did not use his fists or elbow, or even jabbing with his fingers, but he used his palm. The number of kicks he used could also be numbered.\nThe students that fell were not heavily injured; at most they were lightly wounded.\nFang Yuan was not bloodthirsty, he just treated killing as a type of means.\nEvery time he acted, he would have a clear goal. Whatever the type of method, whichever would let him reach his goal the fastest, he would use it. In other words, he was unscrupulous in doing things.\n...\nThe clouds floated over, covering the moonlight. A shadow enveloped over the Gu Yue village.\nThe watchman banged on his clappers, prompting people to know that it was already deep in the night – Be careful of fires, be on guard of beast assaults, as well as the possibility of foreign Gu Masters sneaking into the village.\nThere were still a lot of lights in the village.\nIn the Chi family branch home, Gu Yue Chi Lian stayed in his study, the lights radiantly bright. This high authority old man spoke with a gentle tone, expressing sympathy as he asked his own grandson Gu Yue Chi Cheng, \"I heard you were beaten up by that Fang Yuan today?\"\nGu Yue Chi Cheng had a black right eye, and he angrily said, \"Yes, grandpa. That Fang Yuan was just a petty C grade, yet he dared to act so arrogant. He blocked us all at the entrance, not caring about the friendly sentiments of his classmates, and he robbed us of our primeval stones. What’s more, the academy just opened one eye and closed one eye over the incident. It was only when Fang Yuan strode away that the guards hurried over. Grandpa, this time you have to help me expel this angry resentment of mine!\"\nInstead Gu Yue Chi Lian shook his head. \"This is between you and your juniors. You were blackmailed to lose a piece of primeval stone, and you did not suffer heavy injuries – Grandpa cannot act without any justifiable excuse. Even if you were heavily wounded, I will not stand up for you, do you understand why?\"\nGu Yue Chi Cheng was stunned. He struggled to think, and after a long while he hesitatingly said, \"Grandpa, I think I understand your meaning. You are hoping that I will rely on my own strength to find my way, right?\"\n\"You only understood one aspect.\" Gu Yue Chi Lian nodded his head and added, \"You must remember, you are not just an individual representative, but you are the image on behalf of our Chi family branch. For many years we have confronted the Mo family branch, and your every move will represent the hope of the future of the Chi family branch. Grandpa may help you in the shadows, but you must stand up and erect a self-reliant and strong image. Otherwise the elders who are supporting our family will not see the hope for our future, and they will abandon the Chi family.\"\nAs he said this, Gu Yue Chi Lian heaved a sigh. \"This is also why grandpa helped you to cheat and let you impersonate a B grade talent. Our Chi family needs a strong successor to hold on to those who are supporting us.\"\nGu Yue Chi Cheng was then enlightened. \"Grandpa, I understand now.\"\nGu Yue Chi Lian shook his head. \"Just understanding won’t do any good. You must work hard. Fang Yuan is just small trouble; next up you must study hard and train diligently on your basic martial arts and get your dignity back. At the same time do not forget to work hard on cultivating, promoting to middle stage as soon as possible. The best you can do is to win the position of class monitor, this will be great honor and a kind of help to our Chi family.\"\n\"Alright, grandpa!\" Gu Yue Chi Cheng replied loudly.\n\"Heh heh heh, this spirit is how the heir to our Chi branch should be like. Grandson, you must work hard, I will do my best to help you.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 30: Fang Yuan, You’re Robbing Again?\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nAlmost at the same moment, in another place.\n“Honorary father and mother, that was pretty much how things went.” Fang Zheng stood straight, his tone respectful and cautious.\nIn the hall, Fang Yuan’s uncle Gu Yue Dong Tu as well as his aunt sat in their wide-back huge chairs frowning. Aunt gnawed her teeth. While feeling injustice for Fang Zheng and at the same time gloating over the matter, she said, “Fang Yuan that bastard son, him extorting others is one thing, but to think he would not even spare his own younger brother. How heartless and unfeeling! However this time with such a huge crime, I expect he will be expelled from the academy soon after this.”\n“That’s enough, you should talk less.” Uncle heaved in a deep sigh and told Fang Zheng, “You only lost a piece of primeval stone, don’t worry. Go to the treasury and pick up a stone, there is no business for you here now. You must go and work hard in cultivating. With your A grade talent, becoming the first Middle stage Gu Master is a huge possibility. Do not waste the talent that heaven blessed you with, for your mother and I look forward to seeing you become number one.”\n“Yes, father and mother. Your son takes his leave.” Fang Zheng left with a heart full of trepidation.\nHe secretly thought, “Big brother robbed all the students when he blocked the academy gates today. He created such a terrible aftermath, I’m afraid he might really be expelled. If that happens, should I plead on his case for him?”\nTwo voices appeared in his head.\nA voice said, “No need to plead for him, he even robbed your primeval stone away although you were his own young brother. Even if he was expelled, that was his own fault. If Heaven commits a sin, it can be forgiven, but if one commits a sin himself, he deserves to die!”\nAnother voice said, “But he is your very own older brother, he shares a similar face, his blood thicker than water. Alright, even if you do not acknowledge him, you still must plead his case. If you do not do so, how will the outsiders look at you? I’m afraid they might think of you as a heartless and ungrateful person.”\nSeeing Fang Zheng leave the hall, Aunt could not help but exclaim happily, “Husband, we cut off Fang Yuan’s living expenses. This little bastard finally couldn’t stand it and went off committing a huge error! To actually dare to block the academy gates and fight in public, not to mention extortion, this is the equivalent of provoking the academy elder. I daresay the time for him getting expelled is very near.”\nHowever Uncle shook his head. “You think too simply of things. Fang Yuan will not be expelled, in fact there may not be any punishment.”\n“Why?” Aunt was puzzled.\nUncle snorted. “Brawls and fights are encouraged as long as there are no heavy consequences. Did any students die in this fight? No.”\nAunt refused to comply. “Husband, how would you know there weren’t any casualties? There are always accidents happening from fighting.”\nUncle closed his eyes, leaning against the back of his chair. “Woman, you are really naïve. Do you really think the academy elder is just for show? When did the guards start acting? They came out at the last moment, this means that the entire scene was under control. If someone was heavily injured, they would have rushed over a long time ago, not at the last moments.”\n“You are not a Gu Master, so you won’t understand. The academy does not forbid brawls among the students, but in fact they maintain an encouraging attitude towards it. The more brawls there are, the more helpful it would be for battles. Some students can even create strong bonds through fighting. The elders will not pursue this. It is already a routine. If anyone wants to take action on behalf of their offspring, it would break the rules.”\nAunt was dumbfounded as she heard this, and she replied in an unsatisfied manner, “Then nothing’s going to happen to Fang Yuan who robbed away such a huge amount of primeval stones? He’s just going to be let go like that? With such a big number of primeval stones, it will bring a lot of help to his cultivation.”\nUncle opened his eyes, his face cloudy. “What else can we do? Are you expecting me to go over by myself and snatch away all his primeval stones? However this matter is not something that we cannot exploit. For Fang Yuan to rob and extort even his own brother Fang Zheng, this is the key to his fall. Fang Zheng is an A grade talent, he will definitely be stronger than Fang Yuan one day. We will use this matter to divide and sow discord in Fang Zheng. We’ll lead Fang Zheng away from Fang Yuan for our own use!”\nAnd with that, three days passed.\nThe disturbance that Fang Yuan caused from his robbery and extortion did not spread nor grow bigger, but instead it gradually died down.\nNo elders broke the rules and came to find trouble for Fang Yuan, and the academy elder naturally closed one eye and opened one eye, acting like nothing happened. Although in this period of time, there were two to three youngsters who refused to accept the truth of having their primeval stones taken, and they challenged Fang Yuan. But after Fang Yuan knocked them down easily, everyone became aware that if they did not train hard in martial arts, they would never beat Fang Yuan.\nAmong these teenagers, a burst of mass fervor towards training hard in martial arts erupted.\nThe martial arts instructor was overjoyed, he had never seen a batch of students so enthusiastic and dedicated towards martial arts. Before this when he was teaching, the students were all lacking in interest, yawning all day. But right now they would constantly seek advice with eyes brimming with radiating vigour.\nThe academy elder specially came over to inquire about his situation.\nThe martial arts instructor had an excited tone as he reported, “The students have been showing unexpected enthusiasm, and this change is too great. Only one student among them called Fang Yuan remains as lazy as ever.”\nThe academy elder laughed and patted his shoulders. He said, “This student that you speak of is the cause of the other student’s transformation.”\nThe martial arts instructor was puzzled. But of course the changes were more than this.\nAfter the incident, Fang Yuan had undoubtedly become the public enemy of the entire student batch. Everyone was hostile towards him and he was isolated. No longer did anyone speak to him, and no one greeted him.\nThe youths exerted full force, training their basic techniques privately. With their parents’ and elders’ encouragement and inspirations, they had decided that they must reclaim their honor by their own hands.\nUnder the calm surface, the undercurrent was surging.\nAnother four days passed.\nThe academy elder passed out the primeval stone allowance once more, and the time for Fang Yuan to act came again.\n“Fang Yuan, once wasn’t enough for you, you still want to rob away our primeval stones again?!” The students were shocked and angry as Fang Yuan blocked them at the gates once more.\nFang Yuan stood in the middle of the entrance, his hands behind his back, his expression cold and tone flat. “A piece of primeval stone per person and you’ll be spared of physical pain.”\n“Fang Yuan, your bullying is excessive. I want to challenge you!” Gu Yue Mo Bei roared angrily, coming out first.\n“Oh?” Fang Yuan raised his eyebrows slightly.\nMo Bei raised his fists and rushed forward. After a few rounds, he fainted onto the ground.\n“Mo Bei, you’re too useless! Watch me!” Gu Yue Chi Cheng yelled loudly and dashed towards Fang Yuan. After a transition of attack and defence, he joined after Mo Bei’s footsteps.\nFang Yuan’s battle experience was ten thousand times more than theirs; although he only started cultivating, every force inflicted was used properly. Meanwhile, this bunch of students had only started their journey. If they came at him together, they might still be able to bring him a little trouble. But with them coming up to challenge him one by one, it was more relaxing than the first time of extortion.\nAfter fifteen minutes, Fang Yuan leisurely walked away with a bulging money bag, leaving behind a floor full of youths. Some of them were lying motionless, and some were holding their bellies or clutching their crotch as they moaned and howled.\n“Brothers, time to come up and sweep the field fast!” The guards shouted and all rushed over.",

      "content": "Chapter 31: Fang Yuan! You’re in huge trouble!\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\n“I’ve trained hard in basic martial arts for seven consecutive days, but to think I only managed to endure 2 strikes from Fang Yuan and lost consciousness afterwards. Shame, unforgivable shame!” Gu Yue Mo Bei exclaimed, full of anguish and regret.\nIn the family garden, he faced the wooden puppet, unleashing punches and kicks that were resulting in resounding echoes.\nSuddenly, he heard a laughing voice. “Little brother, do you have deep hatred for the puppet? Why the great resentment?”\nUpon hearing this familiar voice, Gu Yue Mo Bei relaxed and stopped his attacks. He turned his head. “Sister, you’re back!”\n“Uh-huh, the family council sent me out for an investigation mission which lasted more than ten days...” Gu Yue Mo Yan laughingly replied. She was Mo Bei’s blood-related sister, a Rank two middle stage Gu Master.\nBut soon, her face turned grim, her eyes sharply gazing at Mo Bei. “Brother, what’s the matter with those bruises on your face? Who bullied you?”\n“Ah, it’s nothing. I accidentally tripped and fell.” A hint of panic flashed across Mo Bei’s face as he came up with an excuse. He did not wish for his sister to know of such an embarrassing event. The truth of the Mo family’s future heir and the family head, Gu Yue Mo Chen’s beloved grandson, consecutively knocked out twice in combat. But the fortunate thing was that he wasn’t the only unlucky one. The others had suffered as well.\n“Oh, you have to be more careful in that case. As for your combat training, this won’t do. You do not have a Guthat enhances your defense right now, so use thick towels to cover yourself. This will protect your limbs from getting hurt.” Gu Yue Mo Yan instructed before leaving.\n“Hello, young Miss!”\n“Good morning, young Miss!”\n“Young Miss is back! Your servant greets you, Miss!”\nGu Yue Mo Yan hastily walked with a cold demeanor, and the servants she met on the way bowed and paid respects to her without fail.\nShe walked to the study room. Without any warning, Mo Yan pushed the door and entered through. Inside the room, Gu Yue Mo Chen was practicing his calligraphy art with his back facing her.\n“You’re back?” Gu Yue Mo Chen asked directly without turning his body. “After investigating for half a month, what is the situation with the wolves’ den?”\n“How did you know it’s me, grandfather?” Mo Yan gasped, slightly taken aback.\n“Hmph, in the entire family, you’re the only person that dares to enter my room without even knocking the door once. Who else can it be besides you, my beloved granddaughter,” Gu Yue Mo Chen reprimanded, although his face showed traces of concern and warmth, and he looked at Mo Yan with a smile.\nMo Yan pouted. “When it comes to doting, you actually adore little brother more. However since he’s the future family head, you are more strict on him so others cannot sense your concern for him.”\nAfter a while, she asked: “Grandfather, little brother was beaten up! I asked him and he lied about the situation, so I had no choice but to ask you.”\nGu Yue Mo Chen’s face turned serious. “You have not answered my question.” He put down his brush and sat down.\nMo Yan reluctantly reported, “The wolves’ den is almost full, so according to the current rate of breeding speed, although there won’t be an outbreak this year, there will definitely be a wolf tide next year at our mountain village.”\nGu Yue Mo Chen enquired again, “Generally there’s an outbreak every 3 years, so this is no surprise. However, within that hoard, how many Thunder Crown Wolves are there?”\n“Around three.”\nGu Yue Mo Chen nodded, feeling assured. The Thunder Crown Wolves were the head of the pack, and were the most troublesome to deal with during an outbreak.\nThree wasn’t a large number since Qing Mao Mountain had three clan villages. Each village could handle one wolf, and the pressure of the outbreak would be greatly reduced.\n“Grandfather, you have not told me about my little brother’s matter yet!” Mo Yan pursued again.\n“I suppose there’s no matter telling you, but he was beaten up. The first time was seven days ago, and the second time happened today. It happened in front of the school gates, and he was beaten until he sprawled on the ground and fainted on both occasions.” Gu Yue Mo Chen laughingly replied.\n“Who has the guts to knock out my little brother?” Mo Yan stared, wide-eyed.\n“He’s a classmate of Mo Bei called Fang Yuan. He fights really well...” Gu Yue Mo Chen sniggered.\nGu Yue Mo Yan’s eyes grew larger, and she was perplexed as she replied, “Grandfather, what are you saying? He is your own blood-related grandson!”\nGu Yue Mo Chen stared deeply at his granddaughter and spoke meaningfully, “Mo Yan my dear, you are a girl so you may not understand. Defeat and humiliation only serve as fuel for improvement. Without failure one can never develop and grow into a true, mature man.”\n“Mo Bei was defeated, and that is his own failure. Once he wakes up, he will ask fighting techniques from the teachers. This is a sort of improvement, and this improvement comes from Fang Yuan, who beat him into realization. As his sister, if you really care and want to protect your brother, you should not interfere with his growth. Fang Yuan is just a boy with C grade talent while Mo Bei has B grade talent. With us supporting him, he will step over Fang Yuan and drive him into the ground eventually.”\n“Leave this opponent to Mo Bei. In a woman’s life, she needs a family and a lover. But for a man, a family is not a necessity, yet what he cannot lack is a rival. Do not find trouble with Fang Yuan, do you hear me? This is a matter between the youths. If you get involved, this will be perceived as bullying. Breaking the rules like that will cause our Mo family to be looked down upon.”\nMo Yan gasped wordlessly, but under Gu Yue Mo Chen’s gaze, she finally lowered her head. “Yes grandfather, your granddaughter understands.”\nShe staggered out of the study room, but even Gu Yue Mo Chen did not notice – her eyes shined ominously.\n“Grandfather, this is your way of loving your grandson. And I, Mo Yan, have my own methods.” Mo Yan’s heart already had different plans.\n......\nIn the inn’s dining room, several tables were occupied and people were having dinner, thus the environment was rather lively. One or two waiters served dishes rapidly, traversing between tables.\nFang Yuan sat at the table near the windows. He ordered a few dishes and ate while gazing out of the window.\nLooking out, the sunset looked like fire, slowly burning away.\nHalf of the sun had already set; it longingly gazed at the lands, its afterglow being the sun’s reluctance.\nFar up the mountains, it was already veiled by the seeping nightfall. The streets nearby were gathered full of people who were going home. Some of them were barefooted, some muddy farmers, some of them herb pickers, some hunters holding mountain pheasants, wild boars and other animals, and some were Gu masters. They wore a blue uniform, looking clean and spirited, a headband and a waist belt completing their appearance.\nThe belt had a specific function, for Rank one Gu Masters it was a blue belt. There was a bronze plate at the front, and the number “1” could be seen. For Rank two Gu Masters, their belt was red, and the steel plate in the middle showed the number “2”.\nSitting at the side of the window, Fang Yuan observed that there were six to seven Rank one Gu Masters, and they were mostly young men. There was also a Rank two Gu Master, a middle aged man.\nAs for Rank three Gu Masters, they were the family elders. And fourth rank would be the clan head, the lord of a village.\nRank five Gu Masters were hardly seen, and in the entire history of the Gu Yue clan, there were only the first generation clan head and the fourth generation clan head who had reached this level.\n“Actually, finding out a clan’s strength is very simple. Just find a spot in the village, settle down and observe the people for a few hours, see how many Rank one and Rank two Gu Masters there are and you’ll be able to see the clan’s strength and wealth.” Fang Yuan came to a conclusion with his accumulated knowledge of 500 years.\nUsing the Gu Yue village as an example, there were around twenty people walking on the streets, and six were Gu Masters. In these six, there was a 50% chance of having one Rank two Gu Master.\nWith this strength and capital, the Gu Yue Clan managed to monopolize one of the best resource locations in Qing Mao Mountain. But the mountain was just a small corner in the entire area of the Southern Border. The Gu Yue clan could only be considered as a middle-low tier clan.\n“I have only started my cultivation, and with Rank one initial stage, I do not even have the qualification to roam the Southern Border. I need at least Rank three cultivation to be able to further roam the world,” Fang Yuan sighed as he consumed his dinner.\nQing Mao Mountain was too small; it could not contain his ambitions, and he was determined to leave.\n“Haha, Gu Yue Fang Yuan, I have finally found you!” At this moment, a middle-aged man laughed deviously as he approached.\n“Hmm?” Fang Yuan turned slightly to see a man with a yellowish skin tone and hanging brows, but he had a huge body size and developed muscles. He strode several steps to Fang Yuan with his arms folded and proudly stared at the youth who was still consuming his dinner, with a hint of hostility.\n“Fang Yuan, you’ve gotten yourself into huge trouble, do you know that? Heh heh heh, you have dared to hit our young master of the Mo family, and now our young Miss is here to settle the score with you.” The middle-aged man snickered continuously. He constantly stared and sized up Fang Yuan, faintly emitting a threatening aura.",

      "content": "Chapter 32: Making Fun\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nIf a normal person was stared at by this middle-aged man, they would have probably developed fear in their hearts already.\nHowever, Fang Yuan lost interest after looking at him for a second and continued focusing on his meal, treating this man as if he were invisible.\n“Who’s that guy? He wears the clothing of a family servant, and he is not a Gu Master. Why would he dare to question young master Fang Yuan?” An employee wondered as he hid at the corner of the inn, sensing that the situation may turn ugly.\n“Hmph, he’s like a fox assuming a tiger’s ferocity! By using the Mo family as his backing, this servant man dares to clamor at a Gu Master. If it were any other mortal man, they wouldn’t have the guts to do this,” someone beside the employee replied in disdain.\n“Even so, as a mere mortal he has the guts to cause a ruckus towards a Gu Master. Tsk tsk, this kind of experience must feel really great.”\n“Tch, you shouldn’t think that a Gu Master is always high and mighty. Young Master Fang Yuan is merely a Rank one initial stage Gu Master, and he has just managed to refine his vital Gu. If they were to fight now, he may not be the opponent of this muscular and strong mortal.”\n“Sigh, let’s just hope that when they fight later, they will spare our inn and the furniture.”\nThe employees chattered back and forth, but none dared to take a step forward, only staring from a distance.\n“Eh, you still have the mood to continue eating?” Seeing as how he did not manage to intimidate or scare Fang Yuan, the muscular middle-aged man had a hint of doubt in his eyes. “Do you think I’m lying to you? There are already people reporting to young Miss and she will be here shortly. Do not attempt to run away young lad, because you won’t be able to get away. My job here is to make sure you stay put. There will be much suffering for you later.”\nFang Yuan paid no heed to the man and continued eating his meal.\nThe middle-aged servant frowned as he did not see a hint of panic or shock from Fang Yuan. This made him feel ignored and his pride was severely offended.\nHe had been a servant in the Mo family for over a decade, and he had acquired the trust of his master. Over a long period, he would naturally come to learn about the details of Gu Masters.\nRank one Gu Masters mostly relied on their physical combat skills. In battle, a Gu worm’s worth was attributed more to its deterrence factor than as a fighting force.\nHe knew especially that for a young Gu Master like Fang Yuan who had just started cultivating, his physical strength was far inferior when compared to a grown man. If it came down to close combat, he who had trained for many years would gain the upper advantage.\nAt the same time, Fang Yuan had supposedly only refined the Moonlight Gu, so at the max, he would only be able to shoot out several moonblades.\nThe middle-aged man was used as a sparring partner from a long time ago, so he knew deeply that if a Rank one initial stage Gu Master were to use his primeval essence to unleash the moonblade, the most it could do was cut several palm-sized wounds and cause limited damage if it managed to hit the human body.\nAdditionally, the man had the backing of the Mo family, so when he confronted Fang Yuan he had no fear, and was wholeheartedly trying to show off his worth to his masters so that he could be rewarded and deemed more useful to the family.\n“Young lad, you sure are courageous huh?” The middle-aged man’s tone was turning unfriendly as he folded up his sleeves, revealing his well-toned and muscular forearms. His two arms were large and full of scars. The forearms had thick protruding veins and were even thicker than Fang Yuan’s legs.\nThe inn employees watched in fear and several customers were already getting up, paying the bills and leaving this land of conflict.\n“Fang Yuan has been found?” Suddenly, the door emitted a proud, loud female voice.\nMo Yan strode forward in big steps and entered the inn. Behind her were numerous family servants.\nHer body figure was decent, slightly tall and had the proper curves. But a long face like a horse’s, an inherited gene from the Mo bloodline, caused her looks to be greatly affected, and thus she was only a middle-upper tier beauty.\nHowever, she wore a dark blue uniform, and a red belt, affixed with a square steel plate, tied around her waistline. The steel plate was engraved with a “2”.\nAdditionally, she had just returned from after a clan mission, so there was still lingering traces of the hardship that she had just gone through.\nThese added up to create a field of pressure and threat that was emitted to her surroundings. Thus, once she stepped into the inn, the entire place went silent under her aura.\n“Your servant greets you, young Miss!” The middle-aged man changed his attitude completely upon seeing Mo Yan. He tried to smile charmingly and he bent his body as he walked a few steps and knelt on the floor, greeting Mo Yan.\nUpon seeing this change in behavior, the workers in the inn could only stare in shock with their mouths wide-open.\nThe tall and muscular figure, as opposed to his humble groveling attitude, was a great mismatch, and was seemingly amusing. But the employees of the inn did not laugh as his behaviour only greatly showed off Mo Yan’s imposing pressure and status.\nSome of the inn workers could not help but worry for Fang Yuan as he was their major customer. If something were to happen to him and made him unable to patronize the inn any further, it would be a huge loss.\nMore of them were secretly praying for Fang Yuan to surrender. If a fight really broke out and destroyed the inn’s property, that would be worse.\nMo Yan did not even take a look at the groveling Gao Wan; her eyes were fixed on Fang Yuan. She took a few steps forward and demanded in a fierce tone, “So you are Fang Yuan? You seem to be having a good meal. Hehehe, have you ever had a knuckle sandwich? I’ll give you a taste of it, it might be even more delicious.”\nEven though she said that, Mo Yan did not make a move.\nFang Yuan’s actions were too calm. It was strange. Did he have any secret backers that were protecting him?\n“But it shouldn’t be so, I’ve checked before coming. This Fang Yuan only has an uncle and aunt that dislike him, while both his parents are deceased, and he even got chased out of the house by his uncle and aunt. In addition, he only has C ranked talent, so how could such a weak young man have any sort of background?” Mo Yan thought in her mind.\nRegardless of this, the situation was still too peculiar. She had to test and probe further. Fang Yuan laughed and squinted at Mo Yan, saying, “Who told you I was Gu Yue Fang Yuan?”\nMo Yan was momentarily stunned, then she took a look at Gao Wan.\nHe had just stood up, but upon seeing this he immediately knelt back down with sweat pouring out of his forehead. He stammered and could not give a coherent reply, “Master, your servant, your servant....”\nThey had a drawing of Fang Yuan, but they did not know that Fang Yuan and Fang Zheng were twins that looked almost identical.\n“No wonder this young man looked like he had no fear. He is actually Fang Zheng and not Fang Yuan.” Mo Yan’s servants guessed in their minds.\n“Fang Yuan cannot be compared to Fang Zheng. The former is merely a C ranked loner with no background. The latter however has A ranked talent and was pulled into the clan head’s faction at the Awakening Ceremony, and as long as he grows smoothly, he has a bright future ahead!” Mo Yan did not get proper a reply from Gao Wan, causing her to be even more hesitant.\nAt this point, the only ones who knew Fang Yuan’s identity were the inn employees. However, they could not afford to offend either parties so they only kept their mouths shut.\nFang Yuan was satiated from his meal. He stood up and glanced lightly at Mo Yan, “You want to find Fang Yuan? Come with me, I’ll bring you to the school hostel to look for him.”\n“If the person in front of me is Fang Zheng, I would not want to offend him. However, even if he is really Fang Yuan, I will follow him closely on this trip so I have no fear of him impersonating Fang Zheng.” In an instant, Mo Yan made up her mind.\n“Alright, I will go together with you to the school hostel. After you!” Mo Yan turned her body to make space for Fang Yuan, stretching out her arm and indicating for Fang Yuan to take the lead.\nFang Yuan laughed nonchalantly and strode forth. Mo Yan followed closely behind with her servants trailing at the back.\n“So close!”\n“They’re finally gone!”\n“Even if they start fighting, it is none of our inn’s business anymore.”\nThe employees that were left behind all sighed in relief as they patted their chests.\nA group of people approached the school hostel.\n“Halt!”\n“Stop right there, the school hostel only allows our clan’s Gu Masters to enter and leave.” The two guards at the door stopped Fang Yuan, Mo Yan and her gang.\n“Insolent! Do you not recognize who I am? How dare you stop me!” Mo Yan stared at the two and screamed.\n“We dare not,” the two guards hurriedly gestured.\n“Young Miss Mo Yan, this guard holds you in high regards. However the clan rules are absolute, so how about this. You can bring one servant in. This is the most we can do for you.” An elderly guard politely responded.\nMo Yan clicked her tongue. Her heart was full of dissatisfaction, yet in the presence of the clan rules, she did not dare to break them.\nThe Mo family was prosperous, and thus they had many enemies. Do not forget that aside from the Mo family branch, there was also the Chi family to contend with. Apart from the Chi family, the clan head’s faction also wanted to get a hold on the Mo family.\n“All of you stay behind. Gao Wan will follow me.” Thinking about it, Mo Yan gave her orders.\nGao Wan immediately held his chest up high with a look of joy on his face: “Thank you, young Miss for the opportunity!”\n“Let’s go, junior.” Mo Yan smiled at Fang Yuan with a questioning look.\nFang Yuan remained unfazed as he led them in. He reached the dormitory door, opened the lock and pushed the door open.\nHe then took a step into the room and stopped.\nWithin the room, there was nothing extra. It was all simple furniture, and there was no one else.\nMo Yan stood at the doorstep, took a look inside and her face turned grim. “Junior, you better explain yourself well, there is no one in the room!”\nFang Yuan smiled faintly: “Aren’t I someone?”\nMo Yan stared at Fang Yuan, a glint flashing in her eyes as she suddenly seemed to have understood. “I am looking for Gu – Yue – Fang – Yuan!”\nFang Yuan snickered, “You know, I never said that I wasn’t Gu Yue Fang Yuan.”",

      "content": "Chapter 33: Go ahead and scold away\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\n“Hmm?” Mo Yan frowned, then her rage burst forth almost instantly as she suddenly understood that she had been fooled by Fang Yuan.\n“You are tremendously brave to even consider lying to me!” While speaking, she stretched out her right hand to grab hold of Fang Yuan.\nFang Yuan stood firmly on the spot. He raised his head and laughed, “Mo Yan, you better think this through!”\nMo Yan stopped her actions. While she still stood right outside the door, her outstretched hand paused in midair and her face showed a sign of hesitation and resentment.\nWithin the family, there were relevant rules. Students in the dormitories were protected, and any other person would not be allowed to intrude upon the hostel to capture the students. Mo Yan only wished to teach Fang Yuan a lesson and let him bear a taste of suffering. She definitely did not want to risk getting punished for breaking the rules.\n“If it’s only me who broke the rules, that would still be fine. However, if this would affect the family and even grandfather’s honour...” Thinking of this, Mo Yan reluctantly withdrew her arm. She looked at Fang Yuan who was inside the house with her bloodshot eyes. If her death-stare could be converted into fire, it would burn Fang Yuan to ashes in a second.\n“I never lied to you. I said I would bring you to Fang Yuan, and now you have already found him here. It seems you have something to say to me.” Fang Yuan smiled faintly with his arms behind his back, ignoring the pressure of a Rank two Gu Master, fearlessly making eye contact with Mo Yan’s furious gaze.\nHe was just a step apart from Mo Yan. One stood within the house, and one stayed outside. But this same distance had also become as far as the east was from the west.\n“Hehehe, oh Fang Yuan, you sure have studied the clan rules well and thoroughly.” Mo Yan, suppressing her anger, said with a sinister smile. She added, “Unfortunately for you, even while relying on the rules, all it will do for you is to stall for time. There is no way you are staying in the dormitories forever. I’ll see how long you can stand hiding in there.”\nFang Yuan laughed refreshingly and looked at Mo Yan with disdain. “Then all the more I want to see how long you can disturb me. Ah, it is already late. I have a bed to sleep in, but what about you? If I do not show up for class tomorrow and the elders come to investigate, what do you think I will say?”\n“You!” Mo Yan flew into a rage, her fingers pointing at Fang Yuan, barely restraining herself, “Do you really think I wouldn’t dare come in and take you down?”\nSqueak.\nFang Yuan opened the doors of the hostel wide open, his lips breaking into a grin, his eyes dark like the abyss and his tone full of confidence as if the situation was within his grasp. He challenged Mo Yan, ”Then show me.”\n“Hehehe...” Mo Yan calmed down instead upon seeing this. Her eyes squinted as she looked at Fang Yuan and she said, “Do you think I’d fall for your goading?”\nFang Yuan shrugged. He had already seen through Mo Yan’s personality.\nIf he had closed the door, or even half shut it, Mo Yan had at least a 50% probability of breaking into the house. But when he purposely opened it fully, it had instead made her more wary and calm as a result. Thus there was barely any chance of her forcing her way in anymore.\nFive hundred years of experience had already made him fully aware of the human nature and their weaknesses.\nHe grandly turned around, exposing his back fully to Mo Yan. If Mo Yan struck now, she would definitely be able to capture him in one swift action. However, Mo Yan stayed still outside the door as if there was an invisible mountain blocking her way.\nEven after Fang Yuan sat in his bed, Mo Yan only stared at him in anger, gritting her teeth. But regardless of this, she did not make a move.\n“This is the pathetic side of humans.” Fang Yuan sat up and stared at Mo Yan who was outside looking like a fool, thinking to himself, ”At times, the things preventing people from taking action is not physical difficulty, but instead it is the restrictions they have placed on themselves subconsciously.”\nWhen comparing cultivation levels, Fang Yuan was definitely not her match at this point in time. But even with her Rank two cultivation level, she could only stare at Fang Yuan and had no courage to make a move. Her distance from him was only a few steps away, and the door was wide open with no hindrance. The only thing that was truly restricting her was none other than herself.\n“Humanity sought for knowledge relentlessly to understand the world and to comprehend the rules, and ultimately to use them. If one is constantly bound by the rules, thus being restricted by the very knowledge they sought, that is the ultimate tragedy.” Fang Yuan took a final look at Mo Yan before closing his eyes and letting his consciousness sink into the primeval sea.\n“This Fang Yuan dares to cultivate right in front of me! He is simply doing so as he pleases!” Looking at this sight, Mo Yan felt a sense of frustration erupting from her chest, making her almost wanting to vomit blood.\nShe badly wanted to go ahead and give him a few punches!\nBut she knew she couldn’t.\nMo Yan suddenly felt a hint of regret. Standing outside the door, she felt the awkwardness of not being able to back down.\nShe was indignant to give up now, but she would be devastatingly humiliated. She mobilised her servants with the intention to come and teach Fang Yuan a lesson, yet in the end she was the one who ended up becoming the laughing stock.\nEspecially when there was a servant looking at her now.\n“Damn it! Fang Yuan is way too uncooperative! He’s too sly!” Mo Yan furiously thought and started to provoke him with all sorts of insults, hoping to force him out of the room.\n“Fang Yuan you brat, come out if you’re a man!”\n“Fang Yuan, as a man you must own up to your own doings. Now you’re being a coward hiding in that room, do you not feel ashamed of yourself?”\n“Stop pretending to ignore me, get out if you know what’s good for you!”\n“You cowardly, spineless trash!”\nFang Yuan shut his ears and did not give a single response.\nAfter scolding for a while, instead of venting all her anger, she felt even more irritated. She was starting to feel like a clown or a shrew; blocking the door was just way too embarrassing.\n“AHHHHH, this is getting to the death of me!” Mo Yan was about to go crazy, and she finally gave up on provoking Fang Yuan.\n“Fang Yuan, you can hide now, but you can’t hide from me forever!” She furiously stomped the ground and left indignantly. Before leaving she gave a final order, “Gao Wan, stand there and watch him! I do not believe he will not leave the house.”\n“Yes, Master!” The muscular servant, Gao Wan rapidly replied and sent Mo Yan off. Within his heart he was feeling bitter – the mountain was chilly and breezy at night. He would have to stand guard the entire time, catching a cold easily like this. It was not an easy task.\nSwish swoosh......\nWithin the primeval sea, ebb and flow of the tides raged on.\nThe green copper primeval essence gathered like water, forcing a tidal wave rolling about. Under Fang Yuan’s mental guidance, the waves endlessly crashed towards the surrounding aperture walls.\nA Rank one initial stage Gu Master’s aperture walls resembled a white barrier. At this time, with the green copper primeval essence crashing towards them, it produced shadows of light, creating an indescribable feeling.\nTime passed gradually and the level of the green copper primeval sea slowly declined.\nFrom the original 44%, it dropped to 12%.\n“If a Gu Master wants to raise their cultivation level, they would have to expend their primeval essence to nurture the aperture. Initial stage Gu Masters have light barriers as their aperture walls, while middle stage GuMasters have water barriers as their aperture walls and for upper stage, they have stone barriers. For me to cultivate from initial stage to middle stage, I will have to nurture the light barrier into water barrier aperture walls.”\nFrom his five hundred years of memories, Fang Yuan had complete familiarity with the current stages of cultivation, and the methods were as clear as day to him.\nHe slowly opened his eyes, only to see that it was already late into the night.\nThe crescent moon hung high in the night sky, the moonlight shining pure as water.\nThe door was wide open and the moonlight shone in, letting Fang Yuan think of a famous poem from Earth – On a quiet night I saw the moonlight before my couch, and wondered if it were not the frost on the ground(1).\nThe night winds blew with a hint of chilliness.\nFang Yuan did not have any warmth-type Gu, and with just the body of a fifteen year old, he could not help but shiver slightly.\nThe night in the mountain was very cold.\n“Scoundrel, you finally opened your eyes. How long are you planning to be cultivating there?! Get out, you’ll be punished regardless. You beat up our young master Mo Bei, so it was only a matter of time before young Miss teaches you a lesson.” Seeing that Fang Yuan had woken up, Gao Wan who was standing at the door got his spirits up.\nFang Yuan squinted; it seemed that the Rank two female Gu Master had left?\n“Scoundrel, did you hear me? Hurry and come out here! You have a room to stay in and a bed to sleep, but I had to stand here all night. If you don’t come out any time soon, don’t you believe I might just barge in?!” Seeing no reaction from Fang Yuan, Gao Wan threatened.\nFang Yuan remained unfazed.\n“Scumbag, come out and surrender yourself. You’ve offended the Mo family, you will not have any good days from now on. Hurry and apologise to young Miss and maybe she might just forgive you.” Gao Wan continued to chide.\nFang Yuan did not listen to a single word. He took out a primeval stone from his storage bag and held it in his hands, finally closing his eyes again.\nSeeing that he was going to continue cultivating, Gao Wan was anxious and broke into a fit. “You mere C ranked talent, the most you can achieve in life is a Rank two Gu Master! What is there to cultivate? You are no match for the entire Mo family by yourself! Kid, are you deaf? Did you listen to a single word I said?!”\n(1) A famous poem from Li Bai, a Chinese poet.",

      "content": "Chapter 34: Suppressive Beating!\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nFang Yuan paid no heed to the man and started to multitask. He simultaneously absorbed the natural essence from the primeval stone and observed his aperture.\nThe primeval sea level which had originally fell drastically within the aperture, with help from the constant stream of natural essence, began to slowly rise up again. This form of recovery speed was inevitably slow, but Fang Yuan was in no hurry.\nCultivation was meant to be accumulative; it could not be rushed.\nThe urgent matter at hand was in fact the middle-aged servant outside the house.\nAfter half an hour, Fang Yuan’s green copper primeval sea reached 44%, the maximum capacity it could hold. But this was not the end.\nAt this point the primeval sea showed a jade-green colour, this was only a Rank one initial stage green copper primeval essence. The primeval essence that Fang Yuan had previously used to nurture the aperture wall was no longer initial stage primeval essence. It had been turned into middle stage primeval essence, refined by the Liquor worm.\n“Liquor worm.” With a thought from Fang Yuan, the Liquor worm within the primeval sea instantly flew out and hovered in mid-air, its body curling into a ball form, resembling a white rice ball.\nSwoosh.\n10% of his initial stage primeval essence was deployed and sent into the Liquor Worm’s body, and soon the essence was fully absorbed by it. Soon after, a surge of liquor mist emerged from the Liquor worm’s body and congregated into a lump.\nOnce more, Fang Yuan deployed 10% of his primeval essence and invested it into this liquor mist. Once the mist had been fully expended, the original 10% of initial stage primeval essence shrunk by half physically, and at the same time the colour changed from jade-green to pale-green.\nThis is middle-stage primeval essence.\n“In order to advance in their cultivation, ordinary students all use initial stage primeval essence. However, I’ll be using middle stage primeval essence, and the efficiency is at least twice of theirs. Similarly, when using middle stage primeval essence to activate the Moonlight Gu and throw a moonblade, it will be far stronger than activating it using initial stage primeval essence.”\nOnly when all the primeval essence in the primeval sea had been converted to middle stage primeval essence did Fang Yuan open his eyes.\nTime passes in the blink of an eye when cultivating, and at this point it was already midnight. The sky was no longer a pure black, but it had turned a deep dark-blue colour. The moon was no longer visible, and only a few lingering stars remained.\nThe door was open almost throughout the entire night, and a corner of the wooden door was already wet, showing a dark colour as the water tainted it.\nThe school hostel had this disadvantage, it was not as comfortable as an ordinary wooden lodge that was built above the ground (1), but it was directly built on the ground and thus it had high humidity.\nComing back to reality, Fang Yuan felt a chill down his spine. After sitting cross-legged for such a long time, both his legs felt numb. He opened his clenched right fist and scattered a handful of white stone powder.\nThis was the primeval stone after its essence had been fully absorbed, and what remained was only the leftover powder.\n“After a night of cultivation, I had expended three primeval stones.” Fang Yuan calculated in his mind.\nHe had C ranked talent, but in order to pursue faster cultivation speed, he used primeval stones to replenish his primeval essence. What was more crucial was the Liquor worm, as it had been used to refine his middle stage primeval essence.\nThis had greatly increased the expenditure of his primeval stones.\n“Although I plundered another sum of primeval stones yesterday, a night of cultivation cost me three stones. In this case, although it might seem that I have a lot of resources, it is unable to sustain me for a long time with my current cultivation speed, but this is the price I have to pay for pursuing cultivation speed and efficiency.”\nFang Yuan looked outside the room again, only to see Gao Wan, the muscular servant, squatting at a corner with his body curled up, seemingly fallen asleep.\n“Looks like that Rank two female Gu Master had left long ago, leaving this Gao Wan here to keep a watch on me. Hehe.” Fang Yuan revealed a cold smile as he got off the bed and began to exercise his limbs.\nOnce his body had warmed up, he left the hostel.\n“Lad, you finally decided to come out. So how about it? Obediently surrender and leave with me to kowtow and apologise to our young Miss.” Gao Wan’s ears caught Fang Yuan’s footsteps and he stood up immediately.\nHis muscular body was almost twice the size of Fang Yuan. The muscles in his body tightened and his brows knitted together, a pair of cruel eyes shining with evil light, resembling a starving hyena.\nFang Yuan expressionlessly walked towards him.\n“Lad, you should have came out earlier. By coming out now, do you know how much The Great Me had to suffer by watching over you?” He snickered while approaching Fang Yuan, evidently planning something sinister.\nAt this moment, Fang Yuan lightly cried out, and with a ferocious leap he aimed both fists towards Gao Wan.\n“Bastard, you’re courting death!!” Gao Wan’s face distorted with rising anger within him, raised his brick-sized fist and he punched towards Fang Yuan.\nThe fist was extremely powerful, slicing through air and the swooshing sound of the wind could be heard.\nFang Yuan’s eyes shone clear as crystal. Seeing that the fist was approaching close, he side-stepped and turned towards Gao Wan’s rear. Stretching out a finger, he struck towards Gao Wan’s waist.\nGao Wan blocked with his retracted arm – Fang Yuan did not get a clear hit, and ended up hitting onto Gao Wan’s left forearm.\nFang Yuan’s finger felt like it had hit a steel plate, painful and numb.\n“This Gao Wan has already approached the limits of a mortal’s physical prowess. Right now I can only use the Moonlight Gu to fight, and without any other Gu worms to assist me, I am not his match at basic close combat!” Fang Yuan’s eyes shone and he decided quickly to give up on attacking. Instead, he retracted a few steps and pulled some distance away from Gao Wan.\nIn the Gu Yue village, only the Gu Yue clansmen had the rights to cultivate as a Gu Master. The outsiders, regardless of whether they had cultivation talent or not, had no rights to attend the Awakening Ceremony.\nBut these mortals could train in physical combat.\nJust like the Gao Wan here, although he was not a Gu Master, he had trained vigorously in his punches and kicks and his basic skill was steadfast. Additionally he was a middle-aged man, and this meant being at the physical prime in a mortal’s lifetime.\nFang Yuan, other than having the Moonlight Gu to fight, had only the body of a 15 year old teenager. Be it strength, agility or endurance, he was not Gao Wan’s match.\nMartial artists like Gao Wan were sufficient enough to kill a Rank one initial stage Gu Master. Even towards a Rank one middle stage Gu Master, they still posed a certain threat.\n“This lad is too sneaky!” Seeing that Fang Yuan had drawn some distance between them, Gao Wan felt anxiety within his heart.\nThe waist was a vital point of the body, and if it was damaged by someone through brute force, the harm was not negligible. If the force was exerted beyond a point, it could also be deadly.\nGao Wan had waited outside the hostel for the entire night, and thus his body was enshrouded by the moist atmosphere, causing his reaction speed to be slightly slower. Hence the strike earlier had almost succeeded. Fortunately, although he was a bootlicker, he had trained hard in his physical ability. So at the crucial moment his body’s reflex instinctively reacted and allowed him to narrowly block Fang Yuan’s attack.\n“I can’t be careless anymore! This lad behaves like a wolf, striking harsh and deviously, getting his way whenever I am even but a little careless. No wonder young master was knocked out by him twice.” Gao Wan wiped the sweat off his forehead and swept away all hints of contempt. He started to take his opponent seriously.\n“If I can capture this lad, it’d be a great accomplishment. Young Miss is sure to reward me! A Rank one initial stage’s moonblade is at max only like a small dagger, so as long as it does not hit my vital points it’ll merely be a light external injury.”\nThinking of this, Gao Wan’s heart started to beat faster. Stretching out his shovel-like hands, he grabbed at Fang Yuan.\nBoom boom boom!\nFang Yuan showed no fear and approached Gao Wan to engage in close combat. Exchanging punches and kicks, taking turns attacking and defending, loud impact sounds echoed through the area.\nWhen plundering the students, he had only used his palm with his objective being to control the crowd. But now when engaging with Gao Wan, Fang Yuan had gone all out.\nAt times he used his fingers to jab at the eyes, sometimes strangling the throat, hitting the jaw with the base of his palm, chopping at the back of his opponent’s head, using the knee to strike the pelvic area, or using his hands to grab at the waist.\nGao Wan’s sweat poured out like a river.\nFang Yuan’s moves were all aiming at the vital points, each strike devious and deadly as if he wanted to end Gao Wan’s life right there!\nGao Wan was a mere mortal, and unlike the Gu Masters, although he trained well in his physical combat, his vital points remained vital. Mortals were unable to train their eyelids to become steel-like. This was the limits of the mortal martial arts.\nIn addition, Gao Wan did not dare to unleash any deadly moves on Fang Yuan.\nFang Yuan was a Gu Yue clansman, so killing him would incur public rage and he would be immediately executed. In fact, the Mo family will be the first to carry out his punishment. Thus his only thought was to capture Fang Yuan alive, and it would be good if he could make Fang Yuan suffer in the process of capture.\nOne side has apprehension while the other side had killing intent. The situation thus became Fang Yuan suppressing Gao Wan in the fight!\n(1) 吊脚竹楼 – ordinary wooden lodge that was built above the ground.",

      "content": "Chapter 35: Go Ahead and Scream!\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nFang Yuan had the upper hand for now, but it could not sustain him for much longer.\nExchanging blows back and forth, he was already panting in exhaustion. In contrast, Gao Wan’s breathing was still smooth and in-sync, reflecting the huge difference in stamina between the two. At the same time, as Gao Wan exercised his limbs, his body gradually heated up while his punching speed became faster and faster. The effect of the cold that caused him to be slow and numb had worn off, displaying the true skills honed by his training for decades.\n“Lad, you are unable to beat me! There are clan rules stating that within the school hostel, you are forbidden from using the Moonlight Gu. You are dead meat, doomed to be my captive!” Gao Wan laughed maniacally; his fighting experience was rich, so he attempted to use words to cause Fang Yuan’s fighting spirit to waver.\n“In the end, I’m only just a teenager and my body that hasn’t fully developed cannot be compared to this servant.” Fang Yuan’s state of mind was calm as ice. Having sharpened his will for five hundred years, there was no way his fighting spirit would waver.\n“Moonlight Gu!” He called out in his mind, activating his primeval essence and at the same time leaping backwards to pull away from Gao Wan.\nGao Wan wanted to chase after him, but he suddenly saw a watery-blue light emitting from Fang Yuan’s palm. His face darkened and he shouted, “Lad, you are using the Gu worm to fight in the school hostel, this is against the clan rules!”\n“So what if I break the rules?” Fang Yuan sneered. He learnt the clan rules and memorised it to heart, but it was not for the sake of obeying it. Immediately, his palm slashed an arc towards Gao Wan. With a ‘ching’ sound, the blue moonblade flew towards Gao Wan’s face.\nGao Wan gritted his teeth as he raised both arms to cover his face, forming a protective shield. At the same time, he rushed towards Fang Yuan without pause, planning to endure the attack while ending the battle as quickly as he could.\nThe moonblade struck his arm. With a popping sound, his flesh and blood poured out under the moonlight, a wave of extreme pain hitting Gao Wan’s nerves. The unguarded man nearly fainted from the pain.\n“How can this be?!” His rush towards Fang Yuan stopped, and he frightfully found out that both his limbs had been cut open with a deep wound. Fresh blood oozed out from the wound and from the side, while bloody muscles could be observed hanging around his flesh. Even the broken white bones of the forearm could be seen.\nGao Wan was shocked beyond words. “This is impossible! A Rank one initial stage moonblade, the most it could do is to lightly injure my flesh. How could it cut through my bones? Only a Rank one middle stage can do this!!”\nHe had no idea. While Fang Yuan was a Rank one initial stage Gu Master, due to the Liquor worm’s refining, he possessed Rank one middle stage primeval essence.\nThe Moonlight Gu, activated using middle stage primeval essence, emitted a moonblade far superior to the initial stage that he originally predicted.\n“This is bad, this boy is weird!!” Gao Wan who was caught off-guard had already suffered a grave injury. His fighting spirit was gone and he decisively decided to retreat.\n“Are you able to escape?” Fang Yuan smiled coldly as he started to give chase, the moonblades in his hands shooting out consecutively.\n“Save me!!!” Gao Wan shouted out in horror as he fled, his voice travelling far out beyond the school hostel.\n“What is going on? Someone is asking for help!” The voice alerted the school hostel guards who were nearby.\n“It’s the Mo Family’s young Miss, Mo Yan’s servant.” The guards who arrived stopped in their tracks upon seeing the chasing scene.\n“This is only a servant, there is no need for us to risk protecting him!”\n“Letting him stay here was already a favour towards the Mo Family.”\n“We still have to be careful, just in case he hurts Fang Yuan in desperation.”\nThe anxious guards all gathered around, but no one lent a hand to Gao Wan; they only observed from the sidelines.\nThis servant Gao Wan, even if he died, it had nothing to do with them. However if Fang Yuan died or got hurt, it would be their responsibility.\nSeeing such a sight, Gao Wan despaired, he tragically screamed, ”We are all outsiders! You cannot leave me to die!”\nHis blood loss was getting more severe, and his speed decreased.\nFang Yuan caught up to him, his voice cold as ice, announcing Gao Wan’s death sentence, ”Go ahead and scream! It doesn’t matter how loud you do so.”\nWhile saying that, the blade in his arm rotated, and he fired two moonblades towards Gao Wan.\nSwoosh, swoosh!\nThe moon blades flew towards Gao Wan’s neck. The servant lost all hope, seemingly one step away into the abyss.\nThe next moment, he felt that his world was spinning; he actually saw his own feet, chest, back... and that severed neck.\nAfterwards, total darkness awaited him.\nGao Wan had died.\nBeheaded by two moonblades, his head flew away from the impact, his body pushed back 10 meters before falling. The neck area spewed out a fountain of fresh blood, dyeing the surrounding grass a blood red.\n“Murder!!!”\n“Fang Yuan killed someone!”\nThe guards could not help but scream out. They had witnessed the entire process, and they felt a sense of extreme trepidation and terror rushing all over their body.\nFang Yuan was just a weak 15 year old teenager, but he expressionlessly murdered a strong adult. This was the power of a Gu Master!\nThe victory had been set. Fang Yuan slowed in his footsteps and gradually moved towards the corpse.\nHis face was calm, as if he had done nothing out of the ordinary. This expression further sent a shiver down the guards’ spines.\nGao Wan’s head lay on the ground, both his eyes wide open, turning in his grave.\nFang Yuan stared coldly. He raised his leg and sent the head flying.\nThe guards’ eyelids twitched.\nFang Yuan approached the corpse and found that it was still vibrating. The blood spread through the ground, forming a small bloody puddle. He looked at Gao Wan’s injuries with a grim expression. These injuries were deep enough to expose the secret to the fact that he had middle stage primeval essence.\nOnce this was exposed, it’ll be quickly deduced that he had a Liquor worm, and with that the family would naturally think of the Flower Wine Monk.\nThus, Fang Yuan had to keep this secret hidden.\n“But there are too many onlookers.” Fang Yuan’s gaze swept through the nearby guards; there was more than ten of them. He had less than 10% primeval essence left, so there was no way to kill them all.\nAfter pondering for a while, Fang Yuan bent down and raised Gao Wan’s ankle, dragging the corpse away.\n“Young master Fang Yuan, you can leave this to us.” The guards controlled their fear and approached Fang Yuan, politely speaking.\nThe respect and politeness held a tint of obvious fear.\nFang Yuan silently looked at the guards, and they all held their breaths, looking down.\n“Give me the sabre,” he stretched out his hand and lightly said.\nWith authority in his speech, he emitted undeniable pressure.\nThe guard closest to him uncontrollably handed him the sabre on his waist.\nFang Yuan took the sabre over and continued walking, leaving behind a dozen stunned guards staring after his back.\nThe sun rose from the east, and the first ray of light shone over the mountain peak, lighting up the school hostel.\n15 year old Fang Yuan, with the scrawny body of a teenager, a pale look upon his skin.\nUnder the sunrise, he casually walked.\nIn his left hand was a shiny sabre.\nIn his right hand, a headless corpse.\nHis path left behind a trail of bright red blood traces dragged out on the road.\nThe guards were flabbergasted, their bodies stiff due to the frightening scene.\nEven as the sunlight shone on them, they could not feel a sense of warmth and light.\nGulp.\nSomeone among them swallowed their saliva loudly.",

      "content": "Chapter 36: Gifting a disseminated corpse!\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\n\"Did you guys hear? Fang Yuan killed someone!\" A student whispered to his classmate beside him.\n\"I heard it too, he really killed somebody.\" The classmate clenched his chest with a pale face.\n\"There were many guards who saw him do it. Fang Yuan was chasing after that man. That guy tried to beg for mercy but Fang Yuan paid him no heed and decapitated him immediately!\"\n\"That’s not all. After killing him, Fang Yuan didn’t even spare his headless corpse. He dragged it back to the hostel and chopped it into a meat paste.\"\n\"Are you for real?\"\n\"I’m serious beyond belief. I came early this morning and I could still see the bloodstains left between the cracks of the green rock.\"\n\"Oh man, why would I lie to you? Earlier, the Academy Elder called Fang Yuan over for this matter.\"\nThe youths in the Academy did not pay attention to class as they held their little conversations.\nTo this group of 15 year olds, the concept of killing was too foreign and too scary.\nThey had been under the protection of the clan since a young age and had at most experienced organized sparring or simply killing chickens and dogs.\nAs for killing a person, it was still beyond them.\n\"Who did Fang Yuan kill?\"\n\"I heard it was a family servant of the Mo branch family.\"\n\"Yup, I’m the clearest about this matter. Yesterday, I personally saw the Mo Family’s Mo Yan bring a bunch of family servants to find trouble with Fang Yuan.\"\n\"The Mo family, that’s not good. Mo Bei is in trouble now.\"\nA number of the youths turned to look at Gu Yue Mo Bei.\nMo Bei sat on his seat with a pale face - he had only heard about the news of Fang Yuan killing someone this morning. Additionally, it was the Gao Wan that Mo Bei was familiar with. As one of the more energetic family servants, Gao Wan was good at boot licking and had also put effort into his fighting skills. He was an able lackey.\nA long while ago, Gao Wan had even sparred with Mo Bei for a bit. To think that he was simply killed by Fang Yuan!\nIt was precisely because of this that Mo Bei felt astonished. He was full of disbelief and felt twice the shock compared to the others. However, compared to his shock, he felt a greater sense of worry and fear.\nFacing a murderer like Fang Yuan, it would be a lie if Mo Bei said that he was not afraid. Actually, it was not just him - the other youngsters were afraid too. When Fang Yuan had robbed them twice previously, all of them had gotten physical with him.\n\"I actually fought with such a ruthless murderer? To think that I’m actually still alive.\" Many of them patted their chest, feeling a lingering fear.\nFang Yuan killing someone was still somewhat acceptable but the crux was that he even dissected the corpse and chopped the body into meat paste.\nThat was way too cruel!\nThe truth of such a horrifying crime had a strong impact on all of the youths’ pure and innocent minds.\n-----------------------\nWithin the room, there was only the Academy Elder and Fang Yuan.\nThe Academy Elder sat while Fang Yuan stood. Neither of them spoke a word, causing the atmosphere to be extremely tense.\nThe Academy Elder silently looked at Fang Yuan and a hint of complication flashed in his eyes.\nIn the morning, the guards had reported to him about Fang Yuan’s murder incident. This news had made him feel both shocked and suspicious.\nHe was a Rank three Gu Master and was in charge of the Academy. He obviously knew the fighting strength of a Rank one initial stage Gu Master.\nFang Yuan being able to kill Gao Wan was like the weak defeating the strong.\nIn truth, some guards had already reported to him that Mo Yan had trapped Fang Yuan within the Academy by barging in the previous night.\nBack then, he had not paid attention to the matter and had not stopped them.\nHe was the Academy Elder - his objective was to nurture future Gu Masters, not to protect them. As long as there were no deaths among the students, he encouraged hidden conflicts.\nMo Yan coming to find trouble with Fang Yuan was something that he was happy to see. For one, he knew that regardless of whether the fight was won or lost, it would be beneficial to Fang Yuan’s growth. Secondly, he wanted to suppress Fang Yuan’s influence.\nFang Yuan had consecutively blocked the Academy’s gates and robbed the other students. His influence was too great; it had to be suppressed.\nHowever, he hadn’t expected that Mo Yan would return fruitlessly and that the family servant that she had left behind would be unable to beat Fang Yuan. Gao Wan even got killed by him!\nIn this world, strength was above all else. Killing someone was not something peculiar. Especially to a Gu Master, it was something very common.\nBut it was not so simple when it was a 15 year old’s first kill.\nThe Academy Elder vividly remembered his first killing scene. Back then, he was already a Rank two Gu Master. At the age of 19, he had killed a Gu Master from the Bai clan’s village in a conflict.\nAfter killing the person, he vomited profusely and panicked in his heart. For a few days, he had no mood to eat and had no appetite. He could not even find peace in his sleep. The moment he shut his eyes, he would see the dead person staring angrily at him.\nBut looking at Fang Yuan now, his face was calm as ice. Where was the fluster? Not to mention that he had no uneasy feelings. It was almost like he had slept perfectly well last night, as if the person who killed a man was not him at all!\nEspecially when the Academy Elder heard more about the matter. After Fang Yuan had killed the servant, he did not spare the corpse and had even dragged it back to the dormitory to chop it into meat paste in his rage. Such vicious methods, even hearing about it was a kind of terror!\nThus, at this point, the Academy Elder looked at Fang Yuan with complicated emotions.\nOn one hand, he was amazed at Fang Yuan’s indifference towards life, his attitude was as steady and as cold as ice. On the other hand, he was appreciative of the fact that Fang Yuan was a born battle-freak. After familiarizing himself with the Moonlight Gu for a few days, he had managed to kill someone with it. An ordinary teenager—even those A grade talents—may not be able to achieve this. This was a talent for battle! If he was well-nurtured and fought for the clan, it would be all of their enemies’ nightmare.\nLastly, he felt worry and distressed.\nWorry because after this incident, Fang Yuan’s reputation was sure to rise and it would be impossible to suppress him. Fang Yuan was way too daring; not only did he disobey the clan rules by using his Gu in the Academy, he even killed someone with it. There was a need to suppress his influence. Otherwise, how would the Elder be able to manage this Academy anymore?\nDistress was because he did not know how to perfectly resolve this issue. After all, it involved the Mo family’s side.\n\"Fang Yuan, do you know why I called you here to meet me?\" The Academy Elder used a solemn and deep voice to break the silence in the room.\n\"I know.\" Fang Yuan nodded and replied, \"I used the Moonlight Gu in the Academy, breaking the clan rules. According to the rules, as it is my first offense, I should compensate thirty pieces of primeval stones as punishment.\"\nHe evaded the crucial point and did not mention Gao Wan’s death.\nThe Academy Elder was stunned for a second, he had not expected that Fang Yuan would answer like this.\nHis expression darkened as he coldly snapped, \"Don’t try to blur things in front of me! I’ll ask you, what was the matter with Gao Wan’s death?\"\nFang Yuan squinted his eyes and said, \"Hmph, this Gao Wan went against his superiors, his intentions were vicious. Last night, not only did he block my room door, he even tried to kill me. In self-defense, I was forced to use the Moonlight Gu. Fortunately, I managed to kill this traitor. I suspect that there is a high possibility of him being a spy of the other mountain villages, I implore the elders to investigate this thoroughly!\"\nUpon hearing this, the Academy Elder frowned and became at a lost for words.\nNow that Gao Wan was dead, Fang Yuan could say whatever he wanted. After all, Gao Wan was just an outsider, not a member of the clan. Even if he was dead, it would not matter to the Academy Elder. However, he was worried about the Mo family’s reaction. Gao Wan was their servant and he had died within the academy. The Academy Elder was in charge of the academy and had to give the Mo family an explanation.\nThinking for a bit, the Academy Elder stared at Fang Yuan and questioned, \"Then let me ask you. Gao Wan’s corpse, how did you deal with it?\"\nFang Yuan’s lips curled, revealing a cruel smile. \"I diced Gao Wan’s corpse and put it inside a wooden box. When morning came, I put it at the Mo family’s back door.\"\n\"What?!\" The Academy Elder was stunned beyond words as he almost jumped from his seat.\nNot only did Fang Yuan kill their family servant, he had even chopped up the corpse and placed it at the Mo family’s back door. This was blatant provocation!\nTo the Academy Elder who was trying to resolve this peacefully, it was a true nightmare.\nFang Yuan was just a small Rank one Gu Master, how would the large Mo family react?\nThinking of this, the Academy Elder felt a headache as the matter had already developed out of his control. This Fang Yuan was a true troublemaker.\n\"Sigh, since it has already happened, there’s no point in saying anymore. Leave first, the punishment will come within these few days, you should get mentally prepared.\" The Academy Elder was terribly upset. He waved his hand and signaled for Fang Yuan to leave; he needed to think through this calmly to come up with a solution.",

      "content": "Chapter 37: Both a compromise and a threat\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nMeanwhile, at the Mo family.\n\"What were my instructions to you? See what you did!\" In the study room, Gu Yue Mo Chen slammed the table, exploding with a rage.\nMo Yan stood opposite this old man, her head lowered. Her eyes were full of shock and rage. She had also just gotten the news that Gao Wan had been killed by Fang Yuan!\nThat 15 year old teenager, to think he had such methods and determination. Gao Wan was the proud servant of her Mo family and Fang Yuan’s act of killing him was a blatant showing of disrespect towards them!\n\"Grandpa, you don’t have to be so angry. This Gao Wan was only a servant, his death is of no concern. He isn’t a Gu Yue clan member anyways. But that Fang Yuan, he is too daring, you have to ‘look at the owner before you beat the dog’. Not only did he beat our dog but he even beat it to death!\" Mo Yan said indignantly.\nGu Yue Mo Chen furiously scowled, \"You still have the cheeks to say that! Have your wings grown so tough now that you don’t even put my words to heart, hmm? What I told you before, you have forgotten all about it!\"\n\"Your granddaughter dares not!\" Mo Yan jumped in shock. She knew now that her grandfather was really angry and quickly kneeled down.\nGu Yue Mo Chen pointed his finger out the window and scolded, \"Hmph, so what if that servant died. But now you are still showing hostility towards Fang Yuan, this is really a matter of you being short sighted and unclear of the implications! Do you know the significance of your actions? The fight among juniors is their own business. As elders, we should not interfere. These are the rules! Now that you went to find trouble with Fang Yuan, it means you are breaking the rules. I can’t tell how many people are out there now, looking at this disgrace of our Mo family!\"\n\"Grandpa, please calm down, anger will harm your body. It’s Mo Yan fault, I burdened the Mo family. Whatever Grandpa tells Mo Yan to do, Mo Yan will do it! But your granddaughter really cannot take this lying down, that Fang Yuan is too despicable, too shameless. First, he lied to me and entered the academy. Next, he hid in the dormitory and no matter how much I scolded him, he would not come out. Once I left, he went ahead and killed Gao Wan. He is extremely sinister and despicable!\" Mo Yan reported.\n\"Oh, is that so?\" Gu Yue Mo Chen frowned. This was the first time he had heard this information and a bright light shone across his eyes.\nHe took in a deep breath, suppressing his rage and he stroked his beard while saying, \"I’ve heard stories about this Fang Yuan. In his early years, he was able to make poems and songs, showing early intelligence. But to think that he only had C grade talent. It was difficult for him to have a good future and thus I gave up on recruiting him. But now it seems that it’s slightly interesting.\"\nPausing for a second, Gu Yue Mo Chen knocked on the table and ordered, \"Someone, bring that box over here.\"\nThe servant outside the door quickly obeyed. Soon, he brought in a box. The box was neither too big nor too small but it was slightly heavy. The servant used both hands to carry it and stood beside the study table.\n\"Grandpa, what is this?\" Mo Yan stared at the wooden box and asked doubtfully.\n\"Why don’t you open it and take a look?\" Gu Yue Mo Chen squinted his eyes and said in a complicated tone.\nMo Yan stood up, flipped over the wooden lid and looked inside.\nImmediately, her facial expression changed and her pupils shrunk to a needle-like size. She could not help but take a step back and let loose an unsuppressed scream. The wooden lid in her hand also fell to the ground.\nWithout the wooden lid, the thing kept within the wooden box was shown to everyone present.\nIt was actually a pile of flesh and blood!\nThe bloody flesh was obviously sliced off piece by piece and placed into the box. Bright scarlet blood had accumulated inside. There was some pale skin and flesh, while some were long strands of intestines, mixed in with a few pieces of bones, either leg bones or the ribs. In the pool of blood at a corner, there were also two fingers and half a toe floating in it.\nBlech...\nMo Yan beautiful face changed color as she took another step backwards, her stomach turning as she almost vomited on the spot.\nShe was Rank two Gu Master and had gone out to gain experience before. Despite that, this was the first time that she had seen such a disgusting and twisted scene even though she had killed people before.\nThe flesh and blood in this box were obviously the corpse of a person after being minced into pieces and stuffed in.\nThe scent of blood burst into the air and rapidly permeated the air immediately, filling the entire study room.\nBoth of the family servant’s hands shook as he carried the box, his complexion pale. Although he had seen the box earlier and vomited before, he could still feel waves of palpitation and disgust as he held it now.\nAmong the three people in the study room, only the family elder Gu Yue Mo Chen was unfazed. He lightly looked at the contents of the box for a moment and said to Mo Yan slowly: \"This box was what Fang Yuan had placed at our family’s back door this morning.\"\n\"What, it’s really him?!\" Mo Yan was extremely shocked as images of Fang Yuan showed up in her mind.\nThe first time she saw Fang Yuan, it was at the inn.\nAt that time, Fang Yuan sat near the window, quietly eating his meal. His facial features were bland and both of his eyes were dark and gloomy. His body was thin and his skin had the special paleness of a teenager.\nHe looked like such a normal and quiet youth. To think that he had done such a twisted and insane act!\nAfter her initial shock came a furious rage. Mo Yan yelled, \"This Fang Yuan is too outrageous, who gave him the guts to do so! To dare to do such a thing, this is a provocation towards our Mo family! I will go ahead now and bring him here to question him for his crimes!\" After she said this, she headed towards the exit.\n\"You scoundrel, stop right there!\" Gu Yue Mo Chen was angrier than she was as he grabbed an ink slab on his study desk and threw it over.\nThe hard and heavy ink slab hit Mo Yan’s shoulder and with a ‘bang’ it fell to the ground.\n\"Grandpa!\" Mo Yan held her shoulder as she called out in alarm.\nGu Yue Mo Chen stood up, his finger pointing at his granddaughter as he spoke with an extremely agitated tone, \"It seems like all these years of training were in vain. You have disappointed me greatly! Against a small Rank one initial stage Gu Master, not to mention you involving so many people, but even getting led by the nose by the other party. Now that you’ve let your rage get the better of you, at this point, do you still not understand the meaning behind Fang Yuan’s actions?\"\n\"What meaning?\" Mo Yan was puzzled.\nGu Yue Mo Chen snorted, \"If Fang Yuan wanted to provoke us, he would have blown up this matter, so why did he place this box at the secluded back door instead of placing it at the front door where there are many people walking around?\"\n\"Maybe he wants to reconcile with us? No, if he wanted to reconcile, wouldn’t it be better to apologise face to face? Why must he send us this box of minced corpse, this is definitely a provocation!\" Mo Yan said.\nGu Yue Mo Chen shook his head, then nodded. \"He wants to reconcile, but at the same time, he is also provoking us. Placing the wooden box at the back door is his intention to reconcile. Placing the corpse inside the box, that is a provocation.\"\n\"You see,\" The old man pointed at the box, and spoke, \"This wooden box is not big, and it cannot hold a complete corpse. Therefore there can only be a portion of the corpse inside. He is trying to tell us that he does not wish to blow up this matter and wants to settle this amicably. But if our Mo Family wants to pursue this matter, he will place the remainder of the corpse at our main entrance, thoroughly blowing up the issue. By that time, it would be a losing situation for both sides. The entire clan knows that our Mo family broke the rules first, and to our Mo Family’s future head, this would be seen as him being so weak since he actually required his elder’s doting and protection.\"\nUpon hearing these words, Mo Yan was momentarily dumbfounded. She had never expected that Fang Yuan’s actions would have such profound meaning.\n\"His method is really wise,\" Gu Yue Mo Chen said with admiration, \"With just one action, he exercised both toughness and softness, capable of advancing and retreating safely. This is just a simple wooden box but it not only expresses Fang Yuan’s intention to compromise but also his ability to pose a threat to our Mo family. And it so happens that he does hold onto the weakness of our Mo family. If the Mo family’s reputation is tarnished, what follows after will be the Chi family’s attack as well as the assault from the clan leader’s side.\"\nMo Yan found it unbelievable. \"Grandpa, aren’t you thinking too highly of him? Are you sure that he’s capable of this? He is only 15 years old.\"\n\"Too highly?\" Mo Chen looked at his granddaughter unhappily. \"Looks like you’ve had too smooth a life in these past few years. Fostering your arrogant attitude, you are unable to clearly see the reality. This Fang Yuan was unfazed towards danger and deceived you to enter the school. Next, he used his wisdom in the face of danger and hid within the dormitory to avoid trouble. No matter what insult you threw at him he did not respond, this is his ability to calmly endure. After you left, he killed Gao Wan immediately, this is his bravery and courage. Now he sent this box, clearly showing his wisdom and planning ability. Can you still say that I thought of him too highly?\"\nMo Yan listened with wide eyes as she had not expected her grandfather to praise Fang Yuan so highly. Immediately she said indignantly, \"Grandpa, he only has a C grade talent.\"\nGu Yue Mo Chen sighed deeply, \"Yes, he is only a C grade. Having such wisdom and yet only C grade talent, it really is a pity. As long as his talent was higher, even if it was just a B grade, he would certainly become an influential member of our Gu Yue clan. What a pity, he is only a C grade.\"\nThe old man’s sigh was full of emotion. His sigh held both regret and at the same time rejoice.\nMo Yan was silent and in her mind, Fang Yuan’s image appeared once again. Under her psychological influence, Fang Yuan’s frail expression was shrouded by a layer of mysterious and vicious shadow.\n\"This problem was created by you single-handedly. How are you going to settle it?\" Gu Yue Mo Chen broke the silence as he started to test Mo Yan.\nMo Yan pondered for a while before she replied in a cold and aloof tone, \"Gao Wan was just a servant, so there are no implications even if he dies. Fang Yuan is just a C grade, so he is also a small matter. What’s important is maintaining my Mo family’s reputation. To appease this matter, we might as well kill Gao Wan’s entire family to show the entire clan our attitude to protect the rules and regulations.\"\n\"Mmm, you’re able to think of the big picture. Setting aside your personal emotions to defend the interests of family, this is very good. However, your method is still flawed.\" Gu Yue Mo Chen analyzed her response.\n\"Please enlighten me, Grandpa,\" Mo Yan implored.\nGu Yue Mo Chen said solemnly, \"This matter was instigated by you, so I shall punish you with seven days of confinement. From now on, do not find trouble with Fang Yuan again. Gao Wan defied his superiors - a servant who dares to offend his master deserves death, so he should have been executed for his crimes! Because he is a servant of the Mo family, we are responsible for our inability to educate our subordinate and thus we shall compensate that Fang Yuan with thirty primeval stones. As for Gao Wan’s family members, give them fifty primeval stones as compensation and expel them from the clan.\"\nAfter a short pause, he continued, \"For the next seven days, rest well at home, do not go out. At the same time, think about the profound meaning of why Grandpa chose to handle the matter this way.\"\n\"Yes, Grandpa.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 38: Demon walking in the light\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nFrom the layers of dark clouds in the sky, the spring rain fell.\nThe raindrops were thin like hair. As they fell, they enveloped Qing Mao Mountain in a layer of fine mist.\nThe dining hall on the first floor of the inn was rather empty. There were only four tables of guests.\nFang Yuan sat at a seat by the window. A gust of wind blew, bringing with it a poetic atmosphere and the scent of flowers.\n\"The light rain from the sky is sleek and crisp, the color of grass is seen from afar but disappears when close.\" Fang Yuan looked outside through a window and quoted a poem lightly before he turned his sights back to the inn.\nBefore him was a table filled with good wine and dishes. The color, smell and taste were all top notch. Especially the green bamboo wine which oozed with the fragrance of alcohol along with a hint of freshness. The dark green colored liquor sat quietly in the bamboo cup. From his angle, it shone with an amber-like luster.\nA grandfather and his grandson were sitting at the table nearest to him. Being mortal humans, they wore modest clothes.\nThe grandfather sipped his rice wine while looking enviously at Fang Yuan. He was evidently attracted to the green bamboo wine but could not afford it.\nThe grandson ate his braised beans, a crunching sound emitting from his mouth as he chewed. At the same time, he pestered his grandfather, shaking his arm. \"Grandpa, grandpa, tell me about the story of Ren Zu. If you don’t tell me, I’ll report to grandma that you secretly came out to drink!\"\n\"Sigh, I can’t even drink in peace.\" The grandfather sighed but his face showed a doting expression towards the child. With his twig-like arm, he patted the boy’s head, \"Then let me tell you the story of Ren Zu who gave his heart to the Hope Gu, escaping his predicament of being captured...\"\nRen Zu’s story was the most popular and widespread tale in this world, as well as the most ancient legend.\nThe old man’s story was something like this.\nThe story mentioned that Ren Zu was able to escape his predicament because of hope. But eventually he grew old and without Strength and Wisdom, he could no longer continue to hunt. Even his teeth fell off, making him unable to chew many wild fruits and vegetables.\nRen Zu felt death slowly approaching.\nAt this time, the Hope Gu said to him, \"Human, you must not die. If you die, your heart will be lost and I will lose my only place of residence.\"\nRen Zu was helpless. \"Who wishes to die? But if the heavens and earth want me dead, I have no choice.\"\nThe Hope Gu said, \"There’s always hope in everything. As long as you can catch a Longevity Gu, you will be able to increase your lifespan.\"\nRen Zu had heard of the existence of the Longevity Gu long ago but he waved his hand helplessly. \"When the Longevity Gu stays still, nobody can detect it and when it flies, it is faster than light. How can I possibly catch it? It’s too hard!\"\nThe Hope Gu then told Ren Zu a secret, \"Human, don’t give up hope no matter what. Let me tell you, on the northwest corner of this continent, there is a huge mountain. On the mountain, there is a cave and in that cave, there is a pair of round and square Gu worms. As long as you can subdue them, there is no Gu in this world that you cannot catch, including the Longevity Gu!\"\nRen Zu had no choice, this was his last remaining hope.\nHe braved all difficulties and finally found the mountain. He then risked his life and ventured through countless dangers to ascend the mountain. On the mountain top, near the cave entrance, he used his last remaining strength to slowly make his way in.\nThe inside of the cave was completely dark and one would not be able to even see their own fingers. Ren Zu walked in the darkness. Sometimes, he would bump into things not knowing what they were. This caused himself to get injured and wounded all over. At times, he felt that this dark cave was huge beyond words as if this was a world of its own. He felt as if he was the only person in the area.\nHe spent a lot of time but he could not walk out of the darkness. Not to mention subduing the two Gu worms.\nJust when he was at a loss about what to do, two voices spoke to him from the darkness.\nOne voice said, \"Human, you’re here to catch us? Go back, for even if you had the Strength Gu, it would be impossible.\"\nThe other said, \"Human, go back, we will not take your life. Even if you had the Wisdom Gu to help you, you may not be able to find us.\nRen Zu laid exhausted on the ground, panting. \"The Strength and Wisdom Gu had left me long ago and I do not have much lifespan left so I’m at my wits end. But as long as there’s hope in my heart, I will not give up!\"\nHearing Ren Zu’s words, the two voices went silent.\nAfter a while, one of the Gu said, \"I understand, human, you have already given your heart to the Hope Gu. You will not give up no matter what.\"\nThe other continued, \"In that case, we shall give you a chance. As long as you can say our name, we will allow you to use us.\"\nRen Zu was stunned. To find their names among all the words in the world, it was akin to finding a needle in a haystack.\nFurthermore, he did not even know how many words were in their names.\nRen Zu quickly asked the Hope Gu, but it did not know either.\nRen Zu had no alternatives and had no choice but to randomly guess their names. He said many many names and wasted a lot of time but the darkness did not respond to him so evidently he was wrong.\nEventually, Ren Zu’s breath got weaker as he turned from an old man into a dying man. It was like the scene of the evening’s setting sun. The sun that would slowly descending had already been lowered halfway across the horizon, becoming a sunset.\nThe food he had brought was gradually reduced, his brain becoming slower and he barely had any energy to speak anymore.\nThe voice in the darkness urged, \"Human, you are almost dead, so we will let you go. Using your remaining time, you can climb out of the cave and take a final look at the world. But you have offended us, and as punishment, the Hope Gu shall stay here as our companion.\"\nRen Zu clenched his heart and rejected, \"Even if I die, I will not give up hope!\"\nThe Hope Gu was very touched and answered Ren Zu’s call enthusiastically, emitting a bright light. At Ren Zu’s chest area, a light began to shine. But this light was too weak, it could not illuminate the darkness. In fact, it could not even cover Ren Zu’s entire body, but only engulfed his chest area.\nYet Ren Zu could feel a renewed surge of energy gushing into his body from the Hope Gu.\nHe continued to speak, shouting out names. But he was already muddled. A lot of names had already been said but he could not remember that and repeated them, wasting a lot of effort in the process.\nAs time continued to flow, Ren Zu’s lifespan was almost over.\nFinally, when he was on his final day, he said out the word ‘Regulation’.\nA sigh came from the darkness as a voice spoke, \"Human, I admire your perseverance. You have said my name, so from today onwards, I will obey your commands. But only with my brother can I aid you in capturing all the Gu in the world. Otherwise, with my ability alone, it is impossible. Thus, you should give up. You’re almost dead, you might as well use this chance to take a final look at the world.\"\nRen Zu was determined and shook his head, he made use of all his time to continue saying out names as he tried to guess the other Gu worm’s name.\nSeconds and minutes went by and soon he only had one hour left.\nBut at this time, he unknowingly said the word ‘Rule’.\nImmediately, the darkness dissipated.\nThe two Gus appeared before him. As the Hope Gu had said, one was cubic, called ‘Regulations’. The other was spherical, called ‘Rules’. Together, they made up ‘Rules and Regulations’.\nThe two Gu said together, \"No matter who it is, as long as they know our names, we will listen to them. Human, since you know our names already, we will be at your service. But you must remember, it is important to not let others know of our names. The more people that know our names, the more people we have to obey them. Now that you are the first to subdue us, tell us your request.\"\nRen Zu was overjoyed. \"Then I order you both, go and catch me a Longevity Gu.\"\nThe Rules and Regulations Gu worked together and captured an eighty-year Longevity Gu.\nRen Zu was already a hundred years old but after consuming this Gu, the wrinkles on his face vanished and his frail limbs became muscular again. A vibrant aura of youth oozed from him.\nWith a belly flop, he jumped up onto his feet.\nHe ecstatically looked at his body, knowing that he had regained the body of a twenty year old!\n--------------------\n\"That’s all for today, let’s go home, grandson.\" The old man, having completed the story, finished his wine as well.\n\"Grandpa, continue telling me, what happens to Ren Zu after?\" The grandson was unyielding as he shook his grandfather’s arm.\n\"Let’s go, I’ll tell you when there’s another chance.\" The old man wore his straw hat and jacket, then gave his grandson another set that was a smaller size.\nThe two walked out of the inn, stepping into the rain and slowly vanishing from sight.\n\"Rules and Regulations...\" Fang Yuan’s gaze was dark as he twirled his wine cup, looking at the liquor in his cup. His heart was touched.\nRen Zu’s legend was widespread throughout this world and there were almost no people who did not know of him. Fang Yuan had naturally heard of him too.\nBut no matter if it was a legend or a story, it was dependant on the knowledge of the reader. The grandfather and grandson earlier merely treated it as a story, but Fang Yuan could understand the deeper meaning.\nJust like that Ren Zu.\nWhen he did not know the rules and regulations, he explored in the dark. Sometimes he bumped into things, knocking into others, causing himself to get injured and look like a mess. And at times within a wider area, he got lost and confused, moving without a sense of direction or purpose.\nThis darkness was not purely black or the absence of light. Strength, wisdom and hope could not oppose it.\nOnly when Ren Zu knew of the rules and regulations and said their names did the darkness dissipate and invite light into Ren Zu’s life.\nThe darkness was the darkness of the rules and regulations and the light was also the light of the rules and regulations.\nFang Yuan switched his gaze from his cup and looked outside through the window.\nHe saw that outside the window, the sky was still dark, the greenery abundant and the pelting rain flying by like mist. Close by, the bamboo tall-houses were lined up in a row, extending far out. On the road, several people walked, their feet stained with the mud from the rain. Some of them wore grayish green straw coats, while others carried yellow oiled cloth umbrellas.\nFang Yuan concluded, \"This world’s heaven and earth is like a huge chess board. All lifeforms are chess pieces, acting in accordance with their rules and regulations. The four seasons have their own rules and regulations, rotating between spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The flow of water has its own rules and regulations, flowing from high ground to low ground. Hot air has its own rules and regulations, floating upwards. Humans naturally also have their own rules and regulations.\"\n\"Everybody has their own standpoints, desires, and principles. For example, in the Gu Yu village, the servants lives are cheap while their master’s lives are noble. This is a part of rules and regulations. Because of this, Shen Cui who wants to get close to the rich and affluent is doing her best to try and escape her servant status. Gao Wan tried all means and methods to please his master, using their authorities for himself.\"\n\"As for Uncle and Aunt, they gave in to greed, wanting to hoard my parent’s inheritance. The Academy Elder wants to nurture Gu masters to maintain his position in the Academy.\"\n\"Everyone has their own rules and regulations, every profession has its own rules and regulations, and every society and group also have their own rules and regulations. Only by understanding the rules and regulations can we see the situation clearly from the side. Gone with the darkness and embrace the light, moving around the rules with much to spare.\"\nFang Yuan thought about his own situation, his heart already clear. \"To the Mo family’s head Gu Yue Mo Chen, it is to protect his family branch’s prosperity and benefits. Mo Yan found trouble with me and that would be considered spoiling the rules, so for the sake of his family honor, he will not do anything to me. In fact, he might even compensate me.\"\n\"Actually the Mo family has great influence, so if they risk their reputation and are bent on punishing me, there is nothing I can do to resist them. However, Gu Yue Mo Chen is afraid. He is not afraid of himself breaking the rules, but he is afraid that others will follow in his footsteps. In a junior’s scuffle, if the elders interfere, it would aggravate the situation. If it involved the higher ups, it’d pose a threat to the entire mountain village. Gu Yue Mo Chen’s fear lied here. What if in future conflicts, others laid their hands on his grandson Gu Yue Mo Bei? In his entire family line there’s only one male, so what would happen if he died? This kind of fear, maybe he doesn’t realize it himself. He is only subconsciously protecting the rules.\"\nFang Yuan’s eyes were clear as he had the perfect grasp and understanding of the matter from start till the end.\nGao Wan’s surname was not Gu Yue. Instead, he was an outsider, a servant.\nThe master executing a servant was nothing to be alarmed about. In this world, it was normal.\nIn the case of Fang Yuan killing Gao Wan, Gao Wan’s death was not crucial. The crucial part was his master, the Mo family behind him.\n\"However Gu Yue Mo Chen should be able to understand my intention of compromise and threat from the time I sent a box of a minced corpse to them. This is also what I want him to think. If I’m not wrong, the Mo family will not pursue Gao Wan’s death. Of course, if I had better talent and was at least a B grade, the Mo family would feel threatened. Even with the loss of their reputation, they would want to suppress a future threat such as myself,\" Fang Yuan snickered in his heart.\nStrength can be relied on but weakness can also be used as an advantage.\nAlthough Fang Yuan was in the game of chess as a pawn, he was clear of the rules and regulations, thus he already had the mentality of a player.\nAn ordinary character would at most be like Gu Yue Mo Chen or the Academy Elder, also knowing their own rules and regulations but unsure of their non-expertise. Being like Fang Yuan, who had a clear view of the big picture and was clear of rules and regulations was extremely difficult!\nTo understand rules and regulations, one has to be like Ren Zu, stumbling around in the dark and wandering about aimlessly.\nAt this point, strength, wisdom, and hope would be useless. One must spend a lot of time going through it themselves and gaining the experience.\nFor Ren Zu to be able to say out the names of the Rules and Regulations Gu, this was after spending time. Under the threat of death, he had tried countless of times.\nFang Yuan was an expert in rules and regulations due to his five hundred years of experience in from past life.\nAfter his rebirth, he believed that he could create a brilliant future. Not because of the Spring and Autumn Cicada, not because he knew many secret troves and treasures, not because he knew what the future held.\nBut because of the five hundred years of experience that he had gained as a person.\nJust like how Ren Zu controlled the Rules and Regulations Gu and was able to easily capture all the Gu in the world!\nAnd Fang Yuan was so familiar with rules and regulations, thus he was able to look down upon the world and see through its truths and lies. Being meticulous and precise, or getting right to the heart of the matter. I proudly laugh as I stand on top of the world, coldly looking at the people in the world who behaved like pawns, obeying their respective rules and regulations, living their lives in a straightforward manner.\nThe rules and regulations of the darkness is darkness, and the rules and regulations of the light is light.\nBut the reborn demon had stepped foot under the path of light.",

      "content": "Chapter 39: Toad Caravan Merchant\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe month of May was a transition between spring and summer.\nThe fragrance of flowers filled the air, the huge mountains evergreen and the sunlight began to gradually release its ardent side.\nUnder the clear azure skies, the white clouds drifted like cotton.\nOn Qing Mao Mountain, the bamboo forest was straight like spears as always, pointing towards the blue sky. Weeds grew wildly everywhere, and unknown varieties of wild flowers dotted the grass thicket. As the light breeze blew, the wild grass moved to and fro, the heavy fragrance of flower pollen and the smell of green grass assailing visitors.\nHalfway up the mountain was a huge number of terraced fields. Layer by layer, step by step, the soft green wheat sprouts were planted down. From afar, it looked like a verdant green sea.\nOn the terraced fields were numerous farmers busily working away. There were some farmers cleaning the canal for the channeling of water to irrigate the fields, while some farmers were rolling up their trousers, standing in the fields and planting sprouts.\nThese people were naturally all mortal outsiders as the Gu Yue clansmen would never have do these lowly jobs.\nRing, ring...\nThe sound of camel bells could be faintly heard in the spring breeze.\nThe farmers straightened their bodies as they headed down the mountain, only to see a caravan moving like a colorful worm from the mountain side, slowly showing its head.\n\"It’s the merchant caravan!\"\n\"Yes, it’s already May, it is about time for the caravan to come.\"\nThe adults caught on the situation at once, and the children stopped playing with the water and clay in their hands. Together, they energetically approached the caravan.\nThe Southern Borders had a hundred thousand mountains - Qing Mao Mountain was just one of them. On every mountain, there were villages after villages, which were maintained by everyone through their blood relationships and kinships.\nIn between the mountains, the forests were deep and ominous, the cliffs steep and full of the dangerous falling rocks. Additionally, in the complex surroundings of the forest dwelled a large number of ferocious beasts and peculiar Gu worms.\nMortals could not pass through at all. It was difficult to get past these obstacles alone, one had to at least be a Rank three Gu Master.\nBecause of the poor economy, trading was difficult. Thus, the most important form of trading was through the caravan merchants. Only by organizing a merchant group in such a large scale could Gu Masters come together with the power to help each other, conquering the difficulties in the traveling routes and traversing from one mountain to another.\nThe merchant caravan’s arrival was like a bowl of boiling water that poured into the peaceful and serene Qing Mao Mountain.\n\"All these past years they would come in April, but this year they only arrived in May. At least they’re here now.\" The owner of the inn let out a deep breath upon hearing the news. The inn’s business was poor in the other months, so only when the caravan came could he earn enough profit to last the year.\nAt the same time, there was some green bamboo wine within his storage that he could sell to the caravan merchants.\nBesides the inn, the business at the tavern would also boom as a result.\nThe caravan merchants entered the Gu Yue mountain village one by one, lead by a Treasure Brass Toad. This toad was two and a half meters tall, its entire body orange-yellow in color. The back of the toad was thick and full of warts and knots. It was like the lumps of bronze nails on ancient city gates.\nOn the Treasure Brass Toad’s back, thick ropes were tied around plenty of goods. At a glance, it seemed like the toad was carrying a giant backpack.\nA middle-aged man with a circular face full of pockmarks sat cross-legged atop the toad. He was fat and had a large belly. Both of his eyes formed into slits when smiling. He cupped his fists as he greeted the surrounding Gu Yue villagers.\nThis man’s name was Fu of the Jia clan. His cultivation was at Rank four and he was the leader of the merchant caravan this time.\nThe treasure toad hopped slightly as it moved forward but Jia Fu who was sitting on its head was stable and steady. When the toad hopped, his height would level with the windows on the second floor of a building. Even when he was back on the ground, he was at a height greater than the first level of the bamboo buildings.\nThe originally spacious streets were suddenly rather packed and narrow. The Treasure Brass Toad was like a beast that intruded into the midst of a great number of bamboo houses.\nAfter the treasure toad was a huge fat worm. It had two eyes that were similar to multi-colored glass windows, the colors bright and gorgeous. The worm was fifteen meters long, its body shape resembling a silkworm. However, the surface of the worm was covered in a thick layer of black porcelain-like leather armor. On the armor was another abundant pile of goods and merchandise, a hemp rope tied around it. In between the gaps and intervals of the goods, Gu Masters sat one by one, some old and some young.\nThere were also mortals who were robust and sturdy martial warriors, slowly moving forward on the ground following after a fat black beetle.\nAfter the fat beetle, there were ostriches with brightly colored feathers, hairy mountain spiders, winged snakes with two pairs of feathered wings and so on. However, these were in small numbers, most of the creatures were toads.\nThese toads were all similar to the Treasure Brass Toad, but they were smaller in size and had the build of cows and horses. The toads were carrying merchandise and people, their bellies bulging as they hopped forward.\nThe merchant caravan wound deep into the village.\nChildren on the road would look on curiously with wide eyes, calling out in joy or exclaiming in surprise.\nThe windows on the second stories opened one after another, the mountain villagers observing the merchants from a short distance. Some had eyes that flashed with fear and some others waved their hands to express a warm welcome.\n“Old brother Jia, you came a little late this year, you must have had a hard journey.” Approaching with the identity of a clan head, Gu Yue Bo came out himself to greet the leader of this year’s merchant caravan.\nAs Jia Fu had the status of a Rank four Gu Master, if a Rank three elder were to be in charge of receiving him, it would be undoubtedly be seen as a kind of negligence and scorn.\nJia Fu cupped his fists and sighed, “This year’s road was rather unfavorable. On the way we bumped into a group of Secluded Blood Bats and we lost quite a few good men. Then on Jue Bi Mountain we ran into a mountain fog, and we didn’t dare to continue traveling at all. So we were delayed for quite a lot of time, and caused Brother Gu Yue to wait for quite awhile.”\nAs they spoke, their tones were very polite.\nThe Gu Yue village needed the merchant caravans every year to come and trade, and the merchant caravan also needed business to make money.\n“Heh heh heh, it’s good enough that you are able to come. Please, the clan has prepared food and wine, let me host a welcoming dinner for you, old brother,” Gu Yue Bo stretched out his hand and said invitingly.\n“Clan head is polite, too polite.” Jia Fu was flattered.\nThe merchant caravan arrived at the boundaries of the Qing Mao Mountain in the early morning, and by afternoon they were stationed in the Gu Yue Village. When it was dusk, the surroundings of the village had formed into a widespread area of temporary shops and stores. All kinds of red, blue, yellow and green lofty tents were built and every inch between the tents was squeezed with numerous little street stalls.\nThe night was descending, yet it was still brightly lit in the area.\nAn endless stream of pedestrians spilled into the area from the village. There were mortals as well as Gu Masters. The little children hopped around in high spirits, and the adults showed an expression of joy akin to celebrating a festival.\nFang Yuan moved along with the crowd, walking alone.\nThe crowd was bustling with activity, groups of people either surrounding the stalls or endlessly pouring in and out of the entrance of the tents.\nThe surroundings were filled with the shouts of merchants hawking their wares.\n“Come, come, take a look. Top notch Blue Sea Cloud tea brick, drinking this tea makes one as cheerful as a fairy! Even if it’s not a person drinking, it can be used for feeding and raising tea Gu, it is a cheaply priced item for its value. One piece only costs five primeval stones!”\n“Brute Force Longhorn Beetle Gu, a Gu Master who uses this Gu will be able to burst out with the strength of a cow. You can walk away, but don’t regret it!”\n“Intimate Grass, high quality Intimate Grass. Everyone look at this quality, it’s as fresh as if a newly picked one. One catty for two pieces of primeval stones, very cheap price...”\nAs Fang Yuan heard this, his footsteps paused slightly, then he followed the sound and walked over.\nHe saw an ostrich pulling a handcart with two wheels. On the handcart was a heap of pastel green herbs. Every blade of grass was a meter in length, slender and long. Their average width was around that of a fingernail. On some of the pointed tips of the grass grew red heart-shaped flower buds.\nThe Intimate Grass was one of a Gu worm’s supplementary food type, its worth was stemmed from the fact that it could be used to pair up with a few other foods to feed a Gu worm.\nFor example, Fang Yuan needed to give two pieces of flower petals every meal to the Moonlight Gu when feeding it. If he mixed in a blade of Intimate Grass, the Moonlight Gu would be full just from eating one petal.\nThe Intimate Grass only costs two pieces of primeval stones per catty, while the moon orchid petal cost a primeval stone for every ten pieces. With a simple calculation, one would know that mixing the Intimate Grass in to feed the Gu would be more cost-effective.\n“Half a month ago, because I used the Moonlight Gu in the academy to kill Gao Wan, I was fined thirty primeval stones. However the Mo family paid me thirty primeval stones later as compensation, so I didn’t really take any losses. In recent days I have robbed twice, my total number of stones amounts to 118. However, recently I continuously spent essence to refine middle stage primeval essence and nurture the four walls of my aperture, and I would use up three pieces of stones every day. Adding on the costs of feeding Gu, my own daily expenses and successively buying green bamboo wine, I have ninety-eight pieces at hand right now.”\nEver since Fang Yuan killed a person, the cruel and callous image had deeply rooted itself into the hearts of the students and for a time no one dared to challenge him. This led to his plundering becoming much easier, as every time only a very small number would dare to resist.\nFang Yuan calculated in his heart, then he moved his line of sight and continued walking deeper into the heart of the setup of temporary stores.\nThe Intimate Grass stall was surrounded by a group of people. They were all either Gu Masters or students, holding primeval stones in their hands as they shouted and rushed to buy it.\nIt was not that Fang Yuan lacked the money to buy Intimate Grass, but he had no time.\n“If memory serves, that Mudskin Toad should be in that store. In my previous life there was a Gu Master who got it from gambling on the first night, hence he earned big time. I must hurry, I cannot lose a great deal through trying to save a little.”",

      "content": "Chapter 40: Toad Gu Slumbering Within the Purple Gold Rock\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe further one walked, the more flourishing and prosperous it was. Small street vendors lessened while large tents increased in number.\nThere were all sorts of large tents to be seen - red, blue, green, yellow, in different shapes and sizes, several being a cylindrical shape. Some erected two door pillars at the entrance of their tents, while others hung large red lanterns instead. Inside, some tents had vibrants lights, whereas others were dim and dark.\nFang Yuan observed his surroundings as he walked, finally stopping near a grey-coloured tent.\n\"It’s here,\" he evaluated while looking at the tent; it had two pillars at the entrance, and there were carvings on the pillars, two lines of antithetical couplet(1).\nThe left side wrote, “Small display of courage, obtain good fortune during the four seasons.”\nThe right side wrote, “ Large display of skills, obtain good prosperity in all four directions.”\nIn the middle there was still another line: “Luck changes with time.”\nThat’s right, this is a gambling den.\nThis gambling den took around one mu(2) of land; it was considered a large-sized tent.\nFang Yuan walked inside. Inside of the tent, there was three rows of counters on a side. On the counter were pieces of amber or fossils. Some were as big as a palm, others were as big as a face. There were also others which were even bigger; those were as tall as a person. It obviously could not fit on the counter, thus it was directly placed on the ground.\nDifferent from the other tent shops, it was silent in here.\nSeveral Gu masters stood before the counters, some meticulously observing rocks on the display counter while others took the fossils and rubbed it in their hand to get a feel of it. There were some that were discussing quietly with their companions, and some were discussing the price with their shop clerks.\nBut no matter what they discussed, they spoke softly, doing their best not to disturb others.\nThis was a rock gambling den.\nIn the Gu world, there were all types of Gu, coming with different shapes and sizes and all sorts of effects. Gu worms have their respective food to consume. Without food, they can only last a short amount of time before dying.\nBut nature, towards lifeforms, was both uncaring and benevolent.\nIf they lacked food, the Gu worms still have a chance of survival. That was to hibernate, undergoing self-sealing.\nFor example, if the Moonlight Gu did not have Moon Orchid petals to consume, it may undergo self-sealing. It will try to maximise the conservation of its strength, like winter hibernation, falling into a deep slumber. At this time, not only would the blue glow on its body dissipate, it would also turn from a transparent crystal state into a grey rock, covered in a layer of rock shell. Eventually, the rock crust will get thicker and turn into a boulder.\nOr for example the Liquor Worm, if it underwent self-sealing, it would form a white cocoon around it, curling its body and falling into a deep sleep within the cocoon.\nOf course this situation of sealing and hibernating may not happen to every Gu worm. It has a small chance of occurrence, and in most cases, the Gu worm will not fall into hibernation but instead starve to death. Only a small number of Gu worms may, under specific situations, undergo self-sealing.\nA few Gu Masters who accidentally obtain these sealed Gu worms’ rocks or cocoons would awaken the Gu worms that were slumbering within. Thus they would have a stroke of fortune. Some of the Gu masters became successful due to this, it being a turning point in their lives. These situations happen frequently in the Gu Master world, often being fake or real rumors, giving people hopes and dreams.\nThe source of the idea behind this rock gambling den originated from these rumours. Of course, these rocks all looked alike on the outside. Only after opening them can one determine if there really is a Gu worm hidden inside.\n\"In a small-sized rock gambling den like this, nine out of ten rocks are solid core, having no Gu worms inside. Even if there are Gu worms inside the rock, they may not be living worms, most of them are dead Gu. But once someone hits the jackpot of a live Gu, under most situations, one would be able to earn a huge fortune. If the Gu worm is a rare species, they either become a successful person in life or get murdered and robbed of their fortune.\"\nFang Yuan was clear about this in his heart, being very familiar with the situation beyond these doors.\nIn his past life, he had participated in a merchant caravan before, being a clerk in the rock gambling den. Some time later, he even operated his own rock gambling den, even larger than this one; it was a medium-sized rock gambling den. He managed to con some gamblers, and also misjudged at times, allowing other gamblers to win a precious Gu worm.\nFang Yuan stood at the door for a while, taking a glance around him before slowly walking to the counter on the left side.\nBehind the counter, there was a shop assistant every few metres, both males and females. On their waist hung a green coloured belt, showing that they were not ordinary people but Rank one Gu masters. Most were initial stages, while a selected few were middle stages.\nSeeing Fang Yuan before a counter, a female Gu Master who was nearest by walked towards him and smiled, softly saying, \"Young master, what Gu worm do you need? Every rock on this counter is sold at ten primeval stones each. If this is your first try, just for the sake of it, why don’t you go to the right counter, the rocks there are sold at only five primeval stones. If you are seeking thrills, you can go to the high-end counter at the middle, the rocks sold there are at twenty primeval stones each.”\nThis was an experienced female Gu Master, having worked at the rock gambling den for quite some time already.\nShe looked at Fang Yuan who entered, and determined that he was a student from his appearance, age and height etc.\nThose that came to gamble were all Gu Masters. Students were only considered second-rate Gu Masters, just starting their cultivation. Because they’re often tight on finance due to feeding their Gu worms, where would they find the money to come and gamble rocks?\nStudents like this, normally they just came to take a look and to get an eye-opening experience, satisfying their curiosity. Most were only window shoppers, though if some had well to do families, they might attempt to buy one to try. But most only bought the cheapest fossil.\nThus, the female Gu Master had no expectations towards how many rocks Fang Yuan could buy.\n\"Let me look around first.\" Fang Yuan nodded at her expressionlessly, then started to look seriously into the pile.\nIn his memory, it should be at this counter in this particular rock gambling den.\nBut it had been 500 years, it’s been too long. Many things were vague to him already, especially when 500 years of memory was a huge capacity, so to be honest Fang Yuan could not remember distinctly.\nHe could only vaguely recall, that during this year on the first night the caravan arrived, a lucky bird spent ten primeval stones to buy a fossil with purple gold lustre.\nAfter he opened it on the spot, he obtained a Mudskin Toad. Afterwards this toad Gu was bought by another person, thus causing him to earn a small fortune of primeval stones.\nFang Yuan frowned after observing for a while.\nOn this counter, fossils with a purple gold glow numbered up to twenty. In which rock was there a hidden Mudskin Toad?\nEvery rock here was sold at ten primeval stones each. Right now Fang Yuan had ninety-eight primeval stones with him, and he could buy up to a maximum of nine pieces.\nBut realistically, he could not count like this.\nIn any sort of risk and gamble, one had to consider the consequences.\nFang Yuan was no longer a greenhorn, like those gamblers who thought they were blessed by heaven. Those who thought they were blessed by fate were usually those who fell under the mischief of fate itself.\n\"I am alone, with no relatives or friends that can help me. I have to save some primeval stones to survive, as well as to buy food for my Gu worms.\" He counted and under the most basic reservation, he could buy at most seven pieces of fossils.\n\"This rock, the purple gold is dotted like the stars, but it’s flat as a pancake, there’s definitely no mudskin toad inside.\"\n\"This piece has striking purple gold colour, but it is only fist sized. if there really is a mudskin toad inside, the rock should be at least 30% larger.\"\n\"This purple gold fossil, well it’s big, but the surface is extremely smooth, while the mudskin toad’s skin is supposed to be rough and uneven, this is evidently not the one......\"\nFang Yuan continued to observe and evaluate, using the method of cancellation.\nWhen Gu worms hibernate after self sealing, they would form into a natural fossil, being undetectable from most of the world’s detection methods. The remaining detecting methods were too rough, and once used, it would instantly kill the Gu worm within that is barely alive.\nThus, when Gu Masters choose rocks, they could only rely on their guessing, experience and luck, sometimes relying on a little bit of instinct.\nOtherwise, this would not be called gambling.\nOf course, in this wide wide world, there are countless wonders, and one cannot exclude the fact that a detection method which is extremely gentle exists, allowing a Gu Master to know if the rock contains a Gu worm.\nFang Yuan had heard of such rumors in his past life, but after experimenting, found that it was all lies.\nFang Yuan assumed privately, “If such a method really exists, it has to be a hidden legacy, controlled in the hands of a small number of mysterious people, having no impact on the gambling business.”\nIt was still tame around the Qing Mao mountain region, but the more one moves east, the more prosperous gambling dens become. At the Bai Tou(3) mountain region, every family village had its own gambling den. In some large-sized forts, there were even large-sized gambling dens built. The three villages that were famous for their rock gambling were Pan Shi (4) Village, Gu Mu (5) Village and Cang Jing (6) Village, where there were even mega-sized gambling dens.\nThese three mega-sized gambling dens each had a thousand years of history. Currently, their business was still blooming, with an endless number of gamblers. There had never been a situation of clean sweep by anyone.\nCurrently, the tent that Fang Yuan was in can only be barely qualified as a small-sized gambling den.\nIf it was any other 15 year old who came, they would definitely be confused by all the different fossils, and even if they chose it, it would be by random guessing.\nBut Fang Yuan was different.\nFirstly, he already knew a portion of the answer from the start, thus his search range shrunk to less than thirty pieces.\nOf course, to find that one rock out of these twenty odd pieces was extremely difficult as well. But using his 500 years of experience as backing, with such a rich pool of information he picked out six pieces of purple gold fossils that best fit the criteria after observing for a while.\nHe had an 80% chance of confidence that the mudskin toad was hibernating within one of these six fossils!\n(1) Antithetical couplet: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antithetical_couplet\n(2) Mu (亩): 1 Mu is 666 ⅔ meters²\n(3) Bai Tou directly means White Head,(4)Pan Shi is Monolith, (5)Gu Mu means Ancient Grave and (6)Cang Jing is Pale Whale.",

      "content": "Chapter 41: Dissecting Rocks\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\n\"I want to purchase some rocks.\" Having picked his targets, Fang Yuan said to the female Gu Master.\n“Newbie!” The female Gu Master immediately thought.\nEven the shittiest gamblers would pay very close observation when they wanted to buy the rocks. First they would look carefully, then place the stones in their palms and rub to feel the surface and its weight. Even after such actions, if they find that the feeling is off, they would give up. No one would say ‘purchase’ at the start.\nAnd for such a type like Fang Yuan, who said ‘purchase’ upfront, he is undeniably a newbie who is having his first rock gambling experience.\nAlthough the female Gu Master thought this, she did not show any difference in her expression, but continued to smile like a flower, saying softly to Fang Yuan, \"Then which piece are you choosing?\"\nFang Yuan pointed and said, \"This piece.\"\nShe immediately retrieved it.\nFang Yuan pointed again and said, \"This piece.\"\nShe felt perplexed, not expecting this youngster to buy two pieces.\n“It seems like this youngster is the type to gamble heavily,” she evaluated mentally.\nBut next, Fang Yuan pointed yet again, \"And this piece, that piece, I’m buying them all.\"\nThe female Gu Master was stunned, feeling extremely surprised, she could not help but assess Fang Yuan again.\n“It seems like this ordinary looking youngster has a really good family background. Otherwise, how would any ordinary Gu Master have the spare cash to spend like this?” Thinking of it, the female Gu Master’s smile became more gentle and friendly. To think that the youngster in front of her was a real customer.\nThis was an unexpected joy!\nHowever, Fang Yuan surprised her once again as he pointed to the furthest purple gold rock, \"Oh yeah, and those two pieces as well.\"\nThe female Gu Master could not help but feel shocked internally, “Which young master is this from the Gu Yue Village? It looks like he’s the main family branch’s inheritor. If I can hook up with him, I may not need to stay here and slog as a shop clerk anymore.”\nWith this thought, the female Gu Master’s smile became even more gentle and she even looked towards Fang Yuan seductively.\nSix rocks were placed in front of Fang Yuan.\nFang Yuan took out sixty primeval stones and passed it to the female Gu Master.\nHis act of payment attracted the attention of all the other Gu Masters in the tent.\n\"Oh? Someone is going to rock gamble.\"\n\"We’ve been watching for over an hour, but we haven’t acted yet. Now that someone is giving it a try, we might as well watch.\"\n\"It’s a student, he actually took out sixty primeval rocks at once, his family must be affluent. He looks like a greenhorn, hmph, gambling rocks isn’t so easy. He’s gonna get hurt real bad.\"\nThe Gu Masters stood on the spot, discussing softly, all directing their gaze towards Fang Yuan.\n\"Young master, do you want to open the rocks on the spot? Our gambling den provides free service to open the rocks.\" The female Gu Master gently advised, sending seductive glances with her eyes.\nFang Yuan used the corner of his eye to take a look at the crowd, his lips curling into a mysterious smile. He waved his hand, rejecting the female Gu Master. \"Purple gold is my lucky color, and this is my first time betting, it is very meaningful. I’ll open the rocks myself!\"\nThe female Gu Master’s eyes shone brighter, thinking, this heroic demeanour, as expected of a rich young master.\nNever in her dreams would she be able to imagine that Fang Yuan could be said to be kinless in Gu Yue village, a drifter with no backing, having to rely on himself for everything.\n\"Tsk, so what if you have money.\"\n\"I wonder which rich kid this is, coming here to waste his parent’s hard earned money!\"\n\"Ignorant young lad, how can one choose the rocks based on lucky color, sigh, this act is simply akin to throw primeval stones into the water, and waiting to see the ripples for fun.\"\nThe Gu Masters in the tent lost their excitement at once. After thinking that Fang Yuan was a prodigal son, their already low expectations vanished into thin air.\nSome Gu Masters even retracted their gaze and turn around to continue inspecting the fossils on the counter.\nThe changes to his surroundings did not affect Fang Yuan’s state of mind at all. He expressionlessly activated the primeval essence within his primeval sea, pouring it into the Moonlight Gu.\nThe next moment, the crescent mark on his right palm emitted a faint water-like blue light.\nFang Yuan used this right hand to grab a purple gold rock, holding it in his palm. Next he closed his fingers and slowly rubbed against the surface of the fossil.\nThe blue light continued to shine, the waves of light rippling like water as the purple gold rock shrunk in size, large amounts of powder from rock shavings falling out from the gaps of Fang Yuan’s fingers, landing on the carpet of the tent.\n\"Young master has good handiwork!\" The female Gu Master took the chance and immediately praised.\n\"This youngster, he isn’t a good-for-nothing. What great skills.\" Seeing this sight, the Gu Masters’ eyes shone across with a complicated glint. They had started to see Fang Yuan in a new light.\nFang Yuan used the blue light to rub against the surface of the rock; this was a form of meticulous usage of the Moonlight Gu. Normally, one would have to use the Moonlight Gu for two to three years to be able to reach this level.\nWith Fang Yuan’s age and student identity, being able to do this is really remarkable.\n\"See, he’s using our Gu Yue clan’s specialty, the Moonlight Gu.\" Some of the Gu Masters found this and instantly felt proud, gaining affection for Fang Yuan.\n\"But opening the rocks with this method, it’s still too rough.\" Some of the older and more experienced Gu Masters shook their heads.\nThe purple gold rock got smaller and smaller, from being slightly larger than a palm into the size of a fist, being gripped tightly by Fang Yuan’s fingers.\nThe blue light intensified as the fossil became pearl-sized. Until finally, what was left was a pile of rock powder, falling on the carpet to form a small hill.\nThis was a solid rock, there was no Gu worm inside.\n\"As expected, he’s unreliable.\" The Gu Masters shook their heads.\n\"Young master, there’s still five pieces left,\" the female Gu Master encouraged.\nFang Yuan’s expression was calm, being completely unaffected. He grabbed the second piece of purple gold rock and continued to grind. But the result of this piece was still a solid rock; there was no Gu worm inside.\nThe third piece was still the same.\nThe Gu Masters grew impatient. \"Stop looking. By relying on color to pick the rocks, there’s no point in this gamble.\"\n\"If he can get a good Gu from this, I’ll eat the pile of rock powder on the floor!\" Someone laughed insultingly.\n\"Don’t lose heart young master, isn’t there 3 pieces left, you’re only halfway through,\" the female Gu Master continued to edge Fang Yuan on.\nFang Yuan grabbed the fourth piece, and when he got it to palm size, he suddenly stopped all action.\n\"Oh? There’s something!\"\n\"The rock composition changed, it’s not purple gold sediments, but a kind of ink-black colour.\"\n\"Don’t tell me he really got super lucky from blinding guessing?\"\nThe surrounding Gu Masters exclaimed lightly.\n\"Young master, you have to be careful from here onwards. Don’t make sudden movements, hibernating Gu worms are very fragile. If you use too much strength, you’ll kill the Gu worm inside.\" The female Gu Master did not expect such a situation to occur. After getting stunned for a moment, she immediately advised carefully.\nFang Yuan’s movements slowed, his fingers slowly rubbing as small powder slowly fell. Continuously repeating the action with many intervals, he was no longer as fluid as earlier.\nThe black coloured rock powder slowly fell off, and as the rock got smaller, Fang Yuan’s movements became slower and gentler.\nOn the carpet, the rock powder continued to gather as Fang Yuan’s black colored rock was finally scrapped clean.\n\"Sigh, what a pity, it’s a rock in a rock.\"\n\"What a waste of my emotions, I really thought there was a Gu worm inside.\"\n\"You are all too easy to fool, is rock betting so easy? Nine out of ten are all empty, how else is the shop going to make money?\"\n\"Young master, your luck is already not bad. Getting a rock in rock the first time, normal people cannot do it.\" The female Gu Master tried another way to console Fang Yuan, similarly it was to pave way for the result that awaited him.\nGetting nothing out of gambling rocks was very common, a nine out of ten occurrence. In her opinion, Fang Yuan was choosing at random, the chance of getting a Gu fossil was close to zero.\nFang Yuan smiled but did not reply, and he continued to take out the fifth rock.\nHe carefully grinded, and in ten breath’s time, the surface of purple gold coloured rock were all rubbed away, revealing a rough-surfaced yellow mud ball.",

      "content": "Chapter 42: It really is a Gu?!\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\n\"Eh?\"\n\"Don’t tell me it’s another rock in the rock.\"\n\"By the looks of it, probably. But it’s a little strange, this mudball is enclosed by a purple gold rock surface. The mudball surface should be compressed smoothly, so why is the surface still uneven?\" The surrounding Gu Masters were perplexed.\nLooking at the mudball in his hands, Fang Yuan’s expression did not change, but in his heart he was slightly moved.\nHe continued to grind. Under the blue watery light, the powdery sand fell off. Among the powder, there were some soil crumbs mixed in it, falling onto the pile of rock powder beside his leg.\n“Don’t tell me there’s really something?!” Upon seeing this, some of the Gu Masters stared with their eyes wide-opened.\n“It’s hard to say,” someone spoke with an uncertain tone.\n“I feel like there is, there’s really something.” Another spoke softly.\nThe yellow mudball gradually decreased in size due to the friction, and when it was palm-sized, someone barged into the tent. “Young lad, hold up. I, Jia Jin Sheng, will be buying it!”\nFang Yuan’s movement came to a halt, at once , the Gu Masters in the tent all focused their attention on this person.\nHe looked young on the outside, his appearance around twenty to twenty-five years old. He wore a golden-coloured robe with a lace belt on his waist, and on the belt there was a square shaped jade piece. There was a word across the piece of jade, showing the letter “One”.\nEvidently, this was a Rank one Gu Master.\nTo still be a Rank one Gu Master at twenty years old, it seems that his talent isn’t good.\nBut the status of this person was rather unique. Seeing him, the Gu Masters in the tent all bowed and greeted him, saying together, “Your subordinate greets you, second young master.”\n“Second young master?”\n“He called himself Jia Jin Sheng earlier, is he the half-brother of the Merchant Caravan Leader, Jia Fu......”\n“This means to say, this rock gambling den is opened by him. But now that he appeared to interfere, it seems that he’s breaking the gambling den’s rules,” the Gu Masters softly conversed.\n\"That’s right, I am this shop’s shopkeeper. Little brother(1), coming out to gamble at such a young age, aren’t you afraid of your family’s scolding? I will offer forty primeval stones now to buy that mudball in your hand. What do you think? Forty primeval stones is a lot already and there may not be a Gu inside, but today I am in a good mood. Thus seeing that this is your first time gambling, I don’t want you to lose everything, so I’ll give you a portion of your capital back.\" Jia Jin Sheng quickly walked in front of Fang Yuan and said.\n“Forty primeval stones?” Fang Yuan raised his eyebrows slightly and took a look at Jia Jin Sheng with the corner of his eye, coldly laughing, “It seems you want to forcefully buy the mudball fossil in my possession? Forceful purchase is spoiling the gambling den’s rules. Furthermore you’re now on Qing Mao Mountain, you want to bully a Gu Yue clansman like me in front of everyone? “\n“Oh?” On hearing Fang Yuan’s last sentence, all the other Gu Masters could not take it and animosity grew uncontrollably in them as they looked towards Fang Yuan’s direction. Their expression towards Jia Jin Sheng also became unfriendly.\nJia Jin Sheng had thought a fifteen year old like Fang Yuan would be easy to deal with, easily persuaded with a few words. But to think this Fang Yuan had such capabilities, and with a single sentence, he caused Jia Jin Sheng to be in such a predicament.\nSeeing the Gu Masters getting ready to interfere, Jia Jin Sheng’s expression changed immediately as he changed his tone, quickly waving his hands, “Little brother, you’re mistaken! I am the shopkeeper of this gambling den, how could I ruin my own reputation by breaking my own rules? How would I be able to conduct business in the future? Hehehe. I just found your mudball a little interesting, thus I wanted to buy it. If you do not wish to sell it, that’s fine. But if there’s nothing inside later, don’t blame me for not reminding you.”\nFang Yuan paid no more attention to him. He turned around and continued to focus on grinding the mudball in his hands.\nHis movements were very slow and very meticulous. Often, there was only a hint of dry soil powder falling off after a moment or so. Following his movement, a hibernating Gu worm\ngradually appeared in front of everyone’s eyes.\n“My god, there really is a Gu worm!”\n“He really opened a Gu!”\n“What the hell, this sort of method of gambling can also work?”\n“This young man’s luck is off the charts, he actually managed to forcefully luck out on getting a Gu.”\nImmediately, the Gu Masters’ exasperation filled the tent.\nThe female Gu Master subconsciously covered her mouth, being unable to believe the scene before her.\nAs shop clerk, along the way she had been to many mountain villages, seen all sorts of people and all kinds of customers, but she had never seen such a comedic scene.\n“There is really a Gu!” Cold light flashed across Jia Jin Sheng’s eyes as he hated and regretted in his heart. The thing he hated most, was to be taken advantage of.\nThis gambling den that he opened, he had placed many surveillance methods. Once a customer was about to open a Gu, he’d receive the news and would normally forcefully buy it.\nBut now Fang Yuan was inside his gambling den, getting a Gu under his very eyes. Jia Jin Sheng could feel his heart bleeding.\nWhat he obtained, was a toad Gu.\nIts entire body was yellow from head to foot. The belly was light yellow, and its back was brownish yellow, covered with many pimply boils, full of nodules and warts which were a distinctive characteristic of the toad species. At one glance, it looked slightly horrifying.\nIt was not big, being only palm-sized. Holding it in the palm was akin to holding two to three eggs.\nFang Yuan’s expression was calm under all sorts of admiration, envy and exasperation, carefully deploying his primeval essence and injecting it into the toad’s body.\nAt this moment, the Gu was being refined by Fang Yuan.\nGu worms obtained from within fossils are normally extremely weak. Not only do they have little to no strength left, their consciousness is also lazy, leaving them defenseless and unable to resist. Thus, they can be easily refined by the Gu masters.\nUpon being awakened by Fang Yuan, the toad Gu opened its eyes slowly, and its belly slightly vibrated, softly calling out.\nCroak.\nIts voice was soft but it made everyone’s expression very interesting.\nThe difference in value between a Gu that was alive against one that was dead was huge.\n“It’s a live Gu, he really opened a live Gu!!” Someone rubbed his eyes, unable to believe this.\n“This is the Mudskin Toad, damn it, it really is the Mudskin Toad!” Someone recognised the toad Gu’s identity and screamed agitatedly.\n“This young man really has got luck, why don’t I have such luck on my side!” Someone sighed, filled with complicated emotions such as envy, jealousy and hatred.\n“Young master, congratulations! This, this, this is to date, my first time seeing such a precious Gu worm!” The female Gu Master was shocked beyond words, her eyes glistening with life.\n“It’s actually the Mudskin Toad! This is a rare Rank two Gu worm, its value worth five hundred primeval stones. Damn it, damn. Someone actually managed to open such a Gu worm in my shop. I’ve lost big time, big time!” Jia Jin Sheng’s face was pale as he stared daggers at the toad, his heart having a strong urge to just snatch the Gu away.\nBut he knew he couldn’t, for if he really did that, it would be asking for trouble.\nThis was not his family’s village, but the Gu Yue clan’s territory.\n“Maybe I should’ve paid a bit more primeval stones, maybe he might have given it to me. That’s right, he’s just a student. If I offered a hundred primeval stones, there’s no way he’d not be moved. Why didn’t I do that?” Jia Jin Sheng was full of regret.\n“No, maybe this young lad does not know his stuff. Even though he opened a Mudskin Toad, I should be able to suppress the price and buy it!” Jia Jin Sheng’s heart had renewed hope.\nBut at the next moment, this hint of hope was mercilessly smashed by Fang Yuan’s words.\nFang Yuan plainly looked at the Mudskin Toad in his hands, ignoring the surrounding people’s praises and shock.\nHe used an extremely calm tone and said to Jia Jin Sheng, “Mudskin Toad, Rank two Gu worm, requires five hundred grams of yellow soil every meal, the more fertile the soil the better. Its species is few in number and it is the necessary main Gu in refining the Treasure Brass Toad. The market price is five hundred primeval stones. Jia Jin Sheng, do you want to buy this?”\n“You, actually know so clearly......” Jia Jin Sheng mumbled. After such a shock, he could not say a word.\nFang Yuan laughed lightly and continued, “If you’re unwilling, that’s fine. I’ll sell it to someone else, I’m sure someone will be interested.”\n“Hold it, wait, I’ll buy it, I’ll buy it. But can’t this price be cheaper?” Jia Jin Sheng’s smile turned bitter.\nFang Yuan turned around and walked away.\nJia Jin Sheng hurriedly chased after him. “Don’t! Don’t go! I’ll buy, I’ll buy it!”\nFang Yuan had no plans to nurture this Mudskin Toad.\nIt was a Rank two Gu, but Fang Yuan was still a Rank one initial stage. Although it ate yellow soil, Qing Mao Mountain was full of green soil, hence finding food for it would be troublesome.\nMoreover, if he does not sell this Gu worm, Fang Yuan would have to feed three Gu worms himself. Putting aside the increased primeval stone expenditure, even the current amount of primeval stones in his possession would not be enough to feed them.\nThus, Fang Yuan’s plan was to immediately sell away the Mudskin Toad, get the five hundred primeval stones and earn a fortune.\nTo a Rank one initial stage like Fang Yuan, five hundred primeval stones was considered a large amount already.\nThe transaction was quickly completed and Fang Yuan transferred the Mudskin Toad to Jia Jin Sheng in front of the crowd, at the same time accepting five heavy money bags. Each bag had a hundred primeval stones.\nFang Yuan originally had ninety-eight primeval stones, and after spending sixty on gambling rocks, he had thirty-eight left. Now, his fortune multiplied many times, and he owned five hundred and thirty-eight primeval stones.\nUpon seeing this, many Gu masters turned green with envy.\nFang Yuan put the five bags in his bosom before taking the last piece of purple gold fossil and walked out of the tent.\n“Young master, you’re not opening that fossil?” The female Gu Master blinked rapidly and stared at Fang Yuan’s back, loudly reminding him.\nFang Yuan paid no heed and left the gambling den without turning back.\nHe left behind a gang of stunned Gu Masters, staring at each other silently.\nJin Jia Sheng calling Fang Yuan little brother is a way of greeting; they are not related in any way.",

      "content": "Chapter 43: The final sixth purple gold rock\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nThe green copper primeval sea had tides rising and falling, ebbing and flowing.\nAbove the sea level, the Liquor worm curled into a ball, emitting the wine vapour that gradually developed into white mist.\nA surge of primeval essence with a “swoosh”, rushed up against the tide and into the wine mist. When the tide receded, there was already half left, and the colour was even darker. From initial stage jade green(1), it had converted into middle stage pale green.\nMiddle stage primeval essence fell into the sea, but it did not mix with the initial stage primeval essence. As if it was denser, it sank to the bottom.\nThus, the situation became that the upper layer of the primeval sea was filled with initial stage primeval essence, while the lower half was middle stage primeval essence.\nAs time flowed, the wine mist circulated within the aperture. Under the refinement of the Liquor worm, eventually, the initial stage primeval essence continued to decrease, while the middle stage primeval essence gradually increased.\nIt could be seen with the naked eye where the lower layer middle stage primeval essence gradually rose, while the upper layer initial stage primeval essence continued to decrease, but also rose in sea level.\nAs Fang Yuan refined his primeval essence, he extracted the natural essence from the primeval stones at the same time, quickly replenishing the dwindling primeval essence in his aperture.\nFinally, the 45% primeval sea in his aperture was fully refined into middle stage primeval essence.\n“Much thanks to the middle stage primeval essence, or else I would not have been able to open the rocks five times in the gambling den.” Sitting in a lotus position on his bed, Fang Yuan gradually opened his eyes.\nIt was currently late at night.\nAfter he walked out of the gambling den, he did not tour around any of the other shops, but instead headed back to the academy.\nAlthough it was at the fringe of the Gu Yue Mountain Village, as a Rank one initial stage Gu master, owning five hundred and thirty eight primeval stones is still too much.\nThis is not only because the primeval stones were heavy and a hassle to bring around. It also attracts other people’s coveting; in another sense, it would endanger his life.\nIf there was a Rank one upper stage, or even a Rank two who coveted his assets, with Fang Yuan’s current ability he would not be able to contend.\n“Wealth comes and goes, but humans die because of wealth, it’s pathetic. What’s laughable is that many people in this world cannot comprehend that. The boat of benefits carries many people, but has also sunk many others.” Fang Yuan’s lips curled into a cold smirk as he looked at the grey white primeval stones in his hands.\nA complete primeval stone was around the size of a duck egg. But the stone in his hand, as it had been extracted of half of its essence, was an entire circle smaller.\nFang Yuan did not regret it.\nEverything has its gains and losses. Fang Yuan was only a C grade talent, yet he was using the Liquor Gu to refine his primeval essence, and his primeval stones expenditure was multiple times of the people of his age. Yet it was because of this that he was able to overcome the lack of his talent. If the real cultivation pace could be counted, he would be able to rank first three.\nFang Yuan put the primeval stones back into his money bag and took out that final purple gold fossil.\nHe bought a total of six fossils at the gambling den and opened five on the spot, bringing the last one back with him.\nHis eyes shone as he activated the Moonlight Gu, grinding with five fingers, slowly dissecting the rock.\nThe purple gold fossil gradually shrunk under the blue ripples, and finally was grinded to nothingness, leaving behind a pile of powder on the ground.\nFang Yuan was not surprised, because in rock gambling, you lose nine out of ten times.\nEven with his five hundred years of experience, he could only manage eight losses out of ten times. And in the remaining two times, it depended on whether it was a live Gu or a dead Gu.\nDead Gu had basically no value. As for live Gu, they might not be a rare type of Gu worm, and even if it was a tremendously precious Gu, one might attract a life-threatening crisis because of it.\nFang Yuan’s current cultivation level was still very low, it was at the bottom tier of the Gu Masters. The Mudskin Toad that he obtained earlier, if it weren’t for the fact that this was the Gu Yue Mountain Village, it might have been forcefully snatched away by that Jia Jin Sheng.\nGambling was never the way for developing family wealth, and in fact it was a bigger cause of bankruptcy and debt. This was not the development path that Fang Yuan wanted to take.\nAlthough the final purple gold fossil did not have a Gu worm, Fang Yuan was not disappointed. In fact he looked at the pile of rock powder and gradually broke into a smile.\nIndeed, his ultimate motive in entering the gambling den was all for this pile of rock powder. That Mudskin Toad was only something he had gotten out of convenience.\nHe privately opened the fossil, and other than him, nobody knew the truth of this result.\nFrom that day forth, he could claim that the Liquor worm was awakened and subdued from the purple gold fossil.\nThis idea was fabulous.\nFirstly, nobody could confirm what Gu worm really exists in the fossils. Who would dare say that the Liquor worm could not hibernate within the purple gold fossil? That’s completely possible!\nSecondly, he had several eyewitnesses. He opened the Mudskin Toad, which would’ve left a strong impression on the Gu Masters in the gambling den.\nThirdly, even if someone relentlessly questioned him, he could push everything onto his luck. Luck was something unfathomable. Even if someone suspected that this was the Flower Wine Monk’s Liquor worm, against an excuse like ‘luck’ they’d have no idea how to argue against Fang Yuan.\nWithin the dark room, Fang Yuan’s expression was ominous.\nOne-sided covering up was akin to covering fire with paper. There would be a day where he would be exposed.\nTo get rid of a hidden threat like the Liquor worm, he’d have to strike first. This is Fang Yuan’s style.\nMoreover, he had thought about it carefully, and in the cultivation process that was to follow, he would need to expose the Liquor worm.\n“For a Rank one Gu like the Liquor worm, it is extremely precious to Rank one Gu Masters. But for Rank two Gu Masters, it is no longer compatible for them. Thus even if this was exposed, all I would get is some attention, but it would not affect the overall situation, thus becoming nothing to be concerned over. It is not like the Spring and Autumn Cicada. If the Spring and Autumn Cicada is exposed, I might die a horrible death at the very next moment.”\nFive hundred years of experience in handling problems had already made Fang Yuan extremely familiar with human mentality, with their every thought clear as day to him.\n“The Flower Wine Traveler’s legacy and the Mudskin Toad, among my memories these are the only two treasures here, and now that they have been obtained by me, what I can do next is only gradual and steadfast cultivation.”\nFang Yuan sighed a deep breath and relaxed his body, feeling a strong sense of fatigue engulfing him.\nA Gu Master’s primeval sea cultivation could not replace sleep.\nFang Yuan pulled his blanket and lay down on his bed, his eyes still half open.\nAlthough there were five hundred primeval stones hidden under the bed, as well as many pots of Green Bamboo Wine, he still felt a sense of urgency and danger.\nThese five hundred over primeval stones were already a form of limit. From flourish to decline, Fang Yuan was clear that henceforth his primeval stone expenditure would only get bigger.\nBut his income was mostly from extorting his classmates.\nHe had been increasingly feeling the growth and improvement of his classmates. Especially in the recent few extortions, Gu Yue Mo Chen, Chi Chen, and his brother Gu Yue Fang Zheng, had greatly improved in their kicks and punches. Previously he only needed one or two strikes to take them down, but now he needed five or six.\n“Another three to four plunders, and their punches and kicks would’ve been polished fully. If they challenge me one by one, with my current stamina, I cannot endure that kind of round robin battle. Five hundred primeval stones might seem a lot, but with my current expenditure of four stones a day, it is actually not that much.”\n“Qing Mao Mountain already has no treasures left, but nearby on the Bai Gu(2) Mountain, there is a secretly built strength inheritance of a Rank four Gu Master of the righteous path.\n“Sigh, it still boils down to the Flower Wine Monk’s treasure being too little, only giving me a Liquor worm. Hmm... there is still that film image wall, maybe I can sell it to a certain merchant in the caravan...”\nFang Yuan thought as his eyelids grew heavier until he finally fell asleep.",

      "content": "Chapter 44: Monkey Wine, not yielding the opportunity of the Liquor worm\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nOn the second day in the afternoon during lunch break, Fang Yuan went to the shopping district outside the mountain village again.\nAs many of them had to work in the day, there was not many villagers at the tentage area.\nFang Yuan walked to the area where the vendor was selling Intimate Grass last night, according to his memory. He reached only to see an empty cart, still on the spot. An ostrich was dragging the cart along.\nIt stood on the spot proudly, its body size as large as an ostrich while having the appearance of a chicken, the back of the creature bulged into a curved angle. A pair of wide wings were collected on the side of its body, the feathers splendidly bright in seven colours. The chicken head was raised tall, its huge red cockscomb like an agate crown, flashing with the luster of a gem under the sunlight.\n“It seems I was still too late, the Intimate Grass was sold out. What a pity, if I were able to buy a few catty of Intimate Grass, I’d be able to save quite a bit of primeval stones.” Fang Yuan’s footsteps came to a halt as he walked away and continued to venture deeper into the area.\n“Come, have a taste of the delicious wine from all the different villages. There are more than a hundred types of wine here, like the Lantern Grass Wine, the Nine Tune Wine with a strong aftertaste, the light and elegant Ancient Dragon Well, the sweet and sour Flower Rock Tune, the mouth-watering Hundred Spring Old Cellar, the rich and heavy fragrant Intoxication of Three Autumns......” In front of a blue round bucket before the tent, a shop assistant was hawking with gusto.\nA light flashed through Fang Yuan’s gaze as he immediately grew interested. With a turn, he entered the wine shop.\nThe decor in the wine shop was very unique.\nAt the most inner part of the tent, there was a long counter. A Gu Master was stationed there, with tens of crystal ladybugs around the size of wicker-baskets behind him, sticking onto the tent’s cloth walls.\nOn the floor there was no carpet, but rather the uncovered mountain rocks and soil. Among the soil, vibrant coloured mushrooms grew.\nThese mushrooms had all sorts of colours, looking round and slightly cute. Some were as large as tables, while others were short like benches. They were often distributed where a large table mushroom was surrounded by a few shorter bench mushrooms.\n“This is the Innocent Mushroom, purposely grown by a Gu Master. It has the ability to absorb dust and particles in the air to purify it, and it’s a type of grass Gu.” Fang Yuan could recognise the mushroom’s origins immediately upon seeing them.\nHe chose one of the short mushrooms and sat down. The mushroom’s surface immediately sank down a little, making Fang Yuan feel like he was sitting on a sofa like those on Earth.\n“Young master, this is the wine catalogue, would you like to take a look?” A shop assistant walked over.\nFang Yuan glanced at the wine catalogue and realised that the wine here was more expensive than the green bamboo wine.\n“I’ll have a cup of monkey wine.” Fang Yuan put down the catalogue.\n“A cup of monkey wine!” The shop assistant turned around and shouted.\nAt the counter, the Rank one Gu Master heard and immediately bent down to take out a bamboo wine cup.\nNext he took the wine cup and turned around, facing the tentage. On the blue tent walls were the tens of crystal ladybugs, head facing downwards and tail facing upwards, quietly latched onto the walls as if they were merely decorations for the tent.\nThese crystal ladybugs were also a type of Gu. Its stomach was empty, as they were often used by Gu Masters to carry precious liquids.\nTheir bodies were transparent, as if they were made of crystals. From the outside, one could see that within the ladybug’s stomach, different kinds of liquor could be found.\nThe Gu Master quickly found the crystal ladybug that contained the monkey wine among them.\nHe placed the bamboo wine cup at the mouthpiece of the ladybug, and gently stroked the exoskeleton of the ladybug with his other hand.\nA small amount of primeval essence entered the crystal ladybug’s body, and afterwards it opened its mouth and a gush of liquor flowed into the bamboo wine cup.\nThe liquor splattered around in the cup until it was full.\nThe Gu Master placed the bamboo wine cup which was filled with monkey wine on the counter. The shop assistant who had already been waiting for a while quickly held up the cup meticulously and walked a few steps to deliver it to Fang Yuan.\nFang Yuan only took a tiny sip, the monkey wine was indeed a fruit liquor, being sweet and refreshing and delicate on the palate.\nHe stopped drinking, but instead with a thought, Fang Yuan summoned the Liquor worm.\nThe white and fat liquor worm turned into a flash of white light and curved an arc in the air. With a ‘plop’, it landed in the wine cup.\nThe wine splattered everywhere, sprinkling onto the mushroom table.\nThe Liquor worm joyfully beat about in the wine cup, and the monkey wine could be seen decreasing with the naked eye. In a few breaths time, the cup had dried out, with not a single drop left.\n“It’s the Liquor worm!” The Gu Master at the counter shouted, his eyes sparkling. He was a Rank one Gu Master with Grade D talent, only able to follow the merchant caravan and work in this wine shop. His objective was to sightsee while finding his chances.\nThe Liquor worm can refine primeval essence and raise it by an entire realm. To a Rank one Gu Master, it can be said to be an extremely precious Gu worm. Isn’t this the chance he’s been painstakingly searching for?\n“This young master, do you have any plans to sell this Liquor worm?” He excitedly approached, a look of sincerity in his eyes.\nFang Yuan shook his head, rejecting him with a determined attitude, getting up to leave after that.\nHis motive this time was to reveal the Liquor worm in his possession; he had never thought of selling it.\n“Young master, young master, please hold on. I am really sincere about this, maybe we can sit down and have a discussion.” The Gu master reluctantly followed Fang Yuan to the tentage entrance but Fang Yuan did not show any response to him.\nIn the end he could only stand on the spot, his expression extremely regretful as he watched Fang Yuan’s rear view turn around a corner and disappear into the midst of the horizon.\n......\nUnconsciously, the sun gradually set as the crescent moon took its place.\nIn the night, the moonlight shone brightly but was overpowered by the numerous street lights in the merchant shops.\nThe merchant shop tonight was swarming with business. Fang Yuan was squeezed left and right as he entered, hearing all sorts of conversations inadvertently.\n“The stores normally open for three days and three nights. Tonight is already the second night, by the morning of the day after, the merchant caravan would have left on their journey already. Thus, we have to hurry if we want to buy anything.”\n“I saw a Golden Bell Gu yesterday, sigh, too bad it was too expensive. After haggling with the shopkeeper for a long time, it did not get any cheaper. I’ll go and take a look tonight.”\n“Did you guys hear? Last night, a young man opened a Mudskin Toad and earned a profit of five hundred primeval stones!”\n......\nFang Yuan listened attentively, feeling disappointment in his heart as he did not hear anything about the Liquor worm.\n“The Liquor worm is only a Rank one Gu worm but it is extremely meaningful to a rank 1 Gu Master, yet it’s useless to a Rank two or Rank three Gu Master as they are unable to refine their primeval essence any further with it. Thus it is normal that no one paid attention to this. However taking the initiative to expose the matter of the Liquor worm cannot be rushed for a period of time. If I overdo it, it might end up letting the cat out of the bag.” As Fang Yuan walked, he pondered silently in his heart.\nAt this point, there was a hustle in front of him.\nNext, Fang Yuan heard someone shout, “Quickly come and see, there’s a dishonest merchant here selling fake Gu to our clansmen!”\nAnger stirred among the crowd.\n“Oh? There’s something like that happening.”\n“Go and see quickly, which shop dares to cheat our clansmen!”\nFang Yuan followed the crowd and moved towards the commotion as well.\nWhat met his eyes were a group of people surrounding the mouth of a large red tent, the massive crowd swarming it. Some were curiously watching while others stared coldly, but most of the people were enshrouded with a sense of anger.\nOutside the tent stood two people.\nOne of them was a young Rank two Gu Master, whose attire showed that he was obviously from the Gu Yue clan.\nThe other person had a familiar face - it was the owner of the gambling den, Jia Jin Sheng.\nThe young Gu Master held a black Gu worm in his hands, raising it up and shouting to the crowd, “My clansmen, this person in front of me sold me a fake Gu yesterday. Lying to me that it was a Black Boar Gu, and sold it to me for two hundred and fifty primeval stones. To think that when I got home to refine it, I realized that it was not a Black Boar Gu but simply an ordinary stinky fat worm!”\nJia Jin Sheng laughed coldly, “Don’t accuse me falsely. Since when did I tell you it was a Black Boar Gu? What proof do you have?”\nThe young Gu Master on seeing Jia Jin Sheng’s denial, fell into a rage and grabbed Jia Jin Sheng’s wrist, “You cunning merchant, you dare to deny it! You actually dare to lie to me of the Gu Yue clan on Qing Mao Mountain itself, are you trying to look for death?!”\n“Let go of me!” Jia Jin Sheng was also furious as he flicked his wrist, slapping away the young Gu Master’s hand, “If you want to find trouble and extort money, you should find a better target. I am not afraid of you! My brother is Jia Fu, a Rank four Gu Master, what can you do to me?”\n“You!” The young Gu Master stared with his eyes wide, but did not dare to take action. The name of a Rank four Gu Master was enough to intimidate him.\n“Bah!” Jia Jin Sheng spat on the ground, raising his head and looked at the young Gu Master, laughing in disdain, “It was you who wanted to take advantage of the cheap Gu. Didn’t you use your brain to think, why a Black Boar Gu which can raise a Gu master’s strength, being such a rare Gu worm, was sold even more cheaply than a Liquor worm? It is normally sold at six hundred primeval stones. Did you think that you could buy one for just two hundred and fifty primeval stones? Dream on!”\n“Bastard......” The young Gu Master gritted his teeth, his face flushing red as he trembled out of anger, his chest burning with the rage of humiliation.\nThere were chatters among the people as they got restless, discussing furiously. But no one dared to step up, for the Rank four Gu Master status of Jia Fu was like a giant hill in front of them, stabilizing the crowd.\n“This lad is too vicious, what a cunning merchant!”\n“No wonder he dared to be so arrogant on Qing Mao Mountain, he is actually Jia Fu’s little brother.”\n“I heard that they are just half-brothers, but even with that Rank one cultivation, he is able to use this relationship to act unrestrained in the caravan.”\n“What happened here exactly?” At this moment, a loud voice spoke out.\n“Jia Fu is here!”\n“The leader is here to settle the dispute, everyone give way.”\nThe discussion came to a halt as everyone separated and formed a narrow path between them.\nA middle-aged Gu Master having a muscular short body coupled with a giant belly, walked in. He wore a long-sleeved yellow robe, being the leader of the merchant caravan, Jia Fu.\n“Sir Jia Fu, my regards.” The young Gu Master was furious but did not dare to say anything. He forced himself to endure the anger and paid respects to Jia Fu.\nJia Jin Sheng was frozen on the spot, not expecting his brother to arrive, his face suddenly pale as anger flashed across his eyes.\nThis peculiar expression was captured by Fang Yuan who was observing from afar as he pondered about the situation.",

      "content": "Chapter 45: Clear of the schemes, unknowingly trapped in the urn\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\n“Hello, young Gu Master, what is the problem here?” Jia Fu walked to the middle of the crowd and asked amicably.\nThe young Gu Master was flattered and he cupped his fists again. Looking at the surrounding clansmen, he bucked up his courage and explained the entire situation.\n“So that’s what happened!” Jia Fu nodded while listening. Next, he asked Jia Jin Sheng, “Little brother, is this true?”\nJia Jin Sheng turned his head away and snorted coldly, not looking at his brother.\nJia Fu pondered solemnly.\nThe surrounding people were silent, not daring to interrupt his thoughts. All awaited in anticipation of his verdict.\nThis matter was in fact, due to Jia Jin Sheng’s scam, but the young Gu Master was also at fault for being greedy and not being vigilant himself, otherwise he would not have gotten cheated.\nIf Jia Fu wanted to defend his brother, with his Rank four cultivation, even the Gu Yue clan leader could not do anything.\nJia Fu thought for a while before finally speaking. “I’ve understood the situation, my brother is at fault for this matter, causing this young man to suffer a loss and buy fake products, I am really sorry!” Saying so, he cupped his fists towards the young Gu Master.\n“Sir Jia Fu!” The young Gu Master was largely surprised, and quickly said modestly, “You are a Rank four Gu Master, I am merely a Rank two, this is too much for me, too much!”\nJia Fu waved his hand: “Hehe, this has nothing to do with cultivation levels, I act impartially regardless of ability. A wrong is a wrong, I apologise to you on behalf of the merchant caravan. As for compensation, how about this, you lost two hundred and fifty primeval stones, so I will compensate double that amount to you on behalf of the Jia family.”\nHe executed his promise immediately, as a follower took out five money bags and handed it to the young Gu Master in public.\nEvery money bag was filled to the brim, each containing a hundred primeval stones.\nThe young Gu Master took over the money bag, so overwhelmed that he could not say anything.\n“However, I have a word of advice to you.” Jia Fu continued and reminded, “A Black Boar Gu is very rare, for it is able to raise a Gu Master’s strength permanently. Although it is only Rank one, it is very hard to find on the market. Every time one appears in the market, it would be bought immediately. The pricing is around six hundred primeval stones. Trying to get one with two hundred and fifty primeval stones is impractical.”\n“Junior has learnt his lesson!” The young Gu Master bowed deeply to Jia Fu in gratitude.\nCheers erupted from the crowd.\n“Sir Jia Fu is brilliant!”\n“Magnificent, as expected of Sir Jia Fu!”\n“As a Rank four Gu Master, he did not make use of his status to bully the weaker party, Sir Jia Fu really is the role model of the righteous path.”\n“No, no.” Jia Fu smiled, cupping his fists towards the crowd, modestly saying, “Our Jia family business bases our principles on trust and honesty. Everyone, my brother is young and foolish, liking to play pranks on others. He is actually very kind, I hope everyone can be more bearing of him, don’t take it to heart.”\nThe crowd’s cheers became even louder.\n“Hmph!” Jia Jin Sheng’s expression was ugly as he stomped on the ground and walked into the tent. Next he walked out from the back of the tent.\nFang Yuan looked at this silently, thinking in his heart, “It seems that the image wall at the Flower Wine Monk’s place can be sold.”\nThe Flower Wine Monk had used a Photo-audio Gu to record the ugly acts of the 4th generation Gu Yue clan leader. Before he died, with indignance in his heart, used the Photo-audio Gu and slapped it on the wall, creating an image wall. The image wall’s images continued to loop, showing the truth to the people.\nWith the intention of maximizing his profits, Fang Yuan had wanted to sell this image wall long ago. He believed that the other two clan families on Qing Mao Mountain, the Bai family and Xiong family would be very interested in this image wall.\nBut to sell this personally would be very inappropriate. His cultivation was too weak and if he brought this image wall to the other villages, he could easily be silenced.\nEven if the transaction was successful and he managed to return safely, there was no secret that would stay a secret forever, and once it was revealed to the Gu Yue’s higher-ups, he would be kicked out of the clan family at best.\nIn accordance to Fang Yuan’s plans, he still needed to make use of the Gu Yue clan. Thus, the safest way was to sell it to a certain merchant in the caravan. All of them were outsiders, and were not involved in the disputes among the villages, thus it was the best choice for him.\nIn just one day, this caravan would leave the Gu Yue mountain village and lead towards either the Xiong family or the Bai family.\nFang Yuan could reduce his risks to the minimum by selling to them; it was the safest method.\n......\n“One more cup!”\n“Wine, where’s the wine?”\n“Quickly get me the wine, are you afraid that I’m unable to pay?”\nJia Jin Sheng slammed the mushroom table as he howled.\n“Young master Jia, here’s your wine!” The clerk quickly brought him his wine.\nJia Jin Sheng grabbed the bamboo cup and tilted his head and gulped the liquor.\n“Good wine!” He laughed loudly, sounding coarse and bleak.\nWith a bang, he placed the cup on the table and howled again. “Get me another glass, I want as many as you can supply!”\nThe clerks did not dare to offend him and could only do as he said.\nLuckily, this wine house was already full of people. Not only were the mushroom tables packed with people, even the surrounding streets were packed with people. Jia Jin Sheng’s drunkard temperament was not very peculiar in this bustling street.\nJia Jin Sheng drank cup by cup, wanting to drown his sorrows. With his back facing the crowd, no one observed that as he drank, two clear lines of tears flowed down his cheeks.\nWho would know of his pain, his sorrow?\nA hateful person has to have his pitiful side, conversely. Everybody had their own stories.\nAmongst his brothers, he was the youngest, being the most handsome and resembling his father the most, thus being the most doted by his father. But heaven made fun of him by giving him only D grade talent.\nAs he grew up, he lived under the pressure of his brothers. He was indignant and wanted to resist, but with that talent, there was nothing he could do.\nHis father felt death approaching and wanted to split his assets. Two people were to lead a merchant caravan. They pledged to break up the family property in accordance to the results.\nJia Jin Sheng wanted to rely on his own method to acquire the family assets and the recognition of his clan. But to think that he became his brother’s stepping stone once again.\nWhen Jia Fu appeared, he knew he fell into a trap. This was a scheme right from the beginning. But what could he do? Once he entered this caravan, he was doomed to be Jia Fu’s fodder. Rank four and Rank one was such a huge gap that he was powerless to fight again.\n“Jia Fu!” He forced this name out of his mouth, his eyes burning with the flames of hatred, he was unable to take it lying down!\n“Do you wish to deal with your brother? I can help you.” At this time, he heard a voice.\nJia Jin Sheng was stunned but when he turned around, he saw that for quite a while, there was someone sitting beside him.\nHe shook his head and blinked a few times, finally seeing who it was.\nWho else if not for Fang Yuan?\n“It’s you!” He stared at Fang Yuan, slightly angry, “I remember you! Lucky lad, getting a Mudskin Toad from my gambling den! You’re here to mock me?”\nFang Yuan looked at Jia Jin Sheng, his eyes cold as water. “I have a huge business, so if you wish to acquire better results and get more assets, why not listen to me?”\nJia Jin Sheng was suspicious. His back straightened and he sat up, “How do you know about the matter of the assets?”\nThis secret was not easily known to outsiders, but Fang Yuan was easily able to guess it.\n“The Jia family’s business is not top secret, how can it evade people who wish to know?” Fang Yuan laughed coldly and thought of a memory from his previous life.\nThe Jia family head was a legendary figure who started from scratch. He made his fortune through the merchant caravans and revived the Jia family’s village. He gradually got old, and when he could feel that his time was up, he got his children to form a caravan in twos and according to their results, split the assets. The better they did, the more family assets they get.\nBut his eldest son Jia Fu and second son Jia Gui were extremely talented. After competing for six to seven years, they still could not come to a conclusion, and even after the family head died, there was no clear victor.\nAfter the Jia family head died, there was an enormous amount of assets. While competing for the assets, the two brothers’ conflict escalated and both called in external help, causing a large scale Gu competition. Finally, the both of them died. The Jia family that had prospered quickly also failed quickly, causing people to talk about it in amazement.\nJia Jin Sheng squinted his eyes, for Fang Yuan’s explanation was irrefutable. He thought, from the time his father declared the asset distribution, it had already been two years. There are no impenetrable walls in the world, so even if someone found out about it, it’s nothing strange.\nHis real worry was whether this was another trap by Jia Fu. But no matter what, there was no harm listening.\nFang Yuan did not speak immediately. He surveyed the surroundings. This was the same wine cellar he came into in the afternoon. The shopkeeper operated independently, and at night, the shop was bustling with business.\nDiscussing here was a far safer place than a quiet environment, as it could avoid the eavesdropping of certain Gu worms.\nHe hooked his fingers at Jia Jin Sheng. “Lend me your ear.”\nJia Jin Sheng unhappily snorted, but still slanted his head forward.\nAfter hearing Fang Yuan’s description, he frowned and looked at Fang Yuan coldly. “This business involves the three families on Qing Mao Mountain, and we merchants detest getting involved in other people’s disputes. Hmph, you were sent here by Jia Fu to harm me right?”\nFang Yuan had long expected for him to be suspicious. He did not bother to explain, but got up and left. “Hehe, in that case, I’ll go talk to your brother.”\nJia Jin Sheng squinted his eyes, staring at Fang Yuan. Only until Fang Yuan had left the wine shop did he lose his patience. He chased out of the tent and caught up to Fang Yuan, “Don’t go, we can have a talk.”\nFang Yuan placed both hands behind his back, staring at him from the side, coldly saying, “I know you are suspicious of me, but now that your brother has you firmly caught, you’re almost close to finished. If you choose to believe in me, there’s still hope, if not you’re doomed. Are you daring enough to take this bet?”\nJia Jin Sheng’s expression changed as he corrected and said, “Jia Fu is but only a little older, I have never acknowledged him as my brother! But you’re right, I’m taking this bet.”\nFang Yuan said solemnly, “Two thousand primeval stones, no haggling.”\nJia Jin Sheng laughed bitterly, “Too expensive, this trade involves high risk.”\n“The greater the risk, the greater the rewards.” Fang Yuan shook his head, his attitude firm, “If you sell it to those two families, you will only earn much more.”\nJia Jin Sheng nodded, showing a hint of seriousness, “This I believe, for these years the Bai family has been growing fast, and an A grade talent called Bai Ning Bing has appeared recently, he has a great future ahead. Qing Mao Mountain’s situation is gradually changing. Your Gu Yue family’s dominance is wavering, and if I sell this to the Bai family, I can at least earn twice as much!”\nHearing Jia Jin Sheng’s understanding of the Qing Mao Mountain’s situation, Fang Yuan could not help but evaluate him again, thinking: ‘This Jia Jin Sheng, he is still a merchant family member after all, not those useless second generations.”\nJia Jin Sheng sighed, “Regardless of whether this is a trap, I’m jumping in. I promise you, two thousand primeval stones it is! However, I want to see the merchandise first.”\n“Of course, come with me.” Fang Yuan laughed as he led the way. Jia Jin Sheng was already trapped in the urn, and the situation was fully in Fang Yuan’s grasp.",

      "content": "Chapter 46: Don’t think too much when killing people\nTranslator: Sigma Editor: Sigma\nFollowing his memories, Fang Yuan brought Jia Jin Sheng to the cavern in the mountain.\nThe two entered the crack in the stone, and the path became more narrow as their vision was dyed in darkness. Jia Jin Sheng grew more vigilant as he was in an unfamiliar environment.\nFinally, he could not hold it in any further, “I have a question, Jia Fu always treats people with honesty and is amicable with a good reputation. On the other hand, I lied and cheated, forcing transactions through coercion. Why did you choose to deal with me and not him?”\nFang Yuan’s voice travelled through the stone crack. “Because his cultivation is too high, so if he sees the image wall, he can choose to deal with me, or abandon the deal and just give the image wall to the Gu Yue clan head. I do not like giving the decision-making to others, furthermore I do not believe in integrity. The so-called prestigious reputation is just because the profits are small and are unable to incur his greed.”\nMore importantly, it was because Jia Jin Sheng’s position was special, for his cultivation was weak and he was easy to manipulate. Fang Yuan was naturally not going to mention this, of course.\n“Hehe.” Jia Jin Sheng laughed dryly, his suspicions mostly gone immediately. “That last sentence really resonated within me.”\nThe two finally got into the secret cave.\nJia Jin Sheng saw the image wall at once, and could not help but laugh loudly, “Haha, I guessed right, you didn’t lie to me!”\nFang Yuan stood behind him, laughing lightly, not saying anything.\nJia Jin Sheng looked at the wall, seeing the changing images and the animosity between the Flower Wine Monk and the 4th generation clan leader.\nHe looked at it once and retracted his gaze, looking at Fang Yuan, mocking, “Your 4th generation ancestor doesn’t look that strong huh.”\nFang Yuan replied, “This is nothing. The Gu Yue clan needed a hero, thus the 4th generation became a hero. Not long after, the Bai family needs a despicable scum, so the 4th generation will become a degenerate. Hero, scum, all these are just people’s opinions.”\n“Well said!” Jia Jin Sheng laughed as he surveyed the cave.\nHis sight was set on the corpse of the Flower Wine Monk, and he stopped for a while before saying, “What a pity, a Rank five powerhouse. You’ve gotten much benefits from him huh?”\nA Rank five Gu Master’s inheritance was significant. Jia Jin Sheng’s heart beat faster upon thinking of this, and he could not help but ask.\nFang Yuan shook his head. “It’s been so long, most of the Gu are dead, I only got a Liquor worm.”\nJia Jin Sheng did not believe him. “Don’t lie to me brother, as long as this deal goes through, we are accomplices, I won’t reveal any information. Tell me honestly, what did you gain from this?”\nFang Yuan laughed coldly and did not bother replying him.\nJia Jin Sheng’s response was anticipated, and this was also why Fang Yuan chose him over Jia Fu.\nJia Jin Sheng continued to say: “At the very least, I know the Flower Wine Monk has a Thousand Li Earthwolf spider(1). That is a Rank five steed-type Gu, with a large body and is proficient in burrowing underground. The Flower Wine Monk was a demonic cultivator, and his ability to get about freely was mostly due to this Thousand Li Earthwolf spider, allowing him to escape from the righteous cultivators.”\n“Oh, there’s something like that?” Fang Yuan frowned. Regarding the Flower Wine Monk, he did not have much information.\nJia Jin Sheng smugly said, “I came to your village last year and heard this legend, and I found it interesting so I went home and researched about it. The Thousand Li Earthwolf spider and Flower Wine Monk were inseparable, and in my opinion, this cave should have been dug out by the spider. Otherwise, with the Qing Mao Mountain’s rich and heavy soil, how can a cave like this form? Brother, you don’t have to conceal it anymore. The Flower Wine Monk died here so there’s definitely his Thousand Li Earthwolf spider here!”\nFang Yuan frowned even more deeply, feeling a sense of discomfort, his gaze grim, “Yes, there are no other exits here. The Thousand Li Earthwolf spider is massive, he would not have been able to squeeze out from the crack we just walked through. However, there is a possibility that the Thousand Li Earthwolf was plotted against and killed by the 4th generation. Seeing that image wall, even when the Flower Wine Monk was fighting he did not summon the Thousand Li Earthwolf spider.”\n“That makes the situation even more peculiar. This cave is not formed naturally, thus it has to be created by the Flower Wine Monk. Without the Thousand Li Earthwolf spider, could there be any other methods?” Jia Jin Sheng looked at Fang Yuan suspiciously.\nFang Yuan’s frown swelled into a knot as he felt more and more uncertain. From Jia Jin Sheng’s information, he found out something: it appears as if there was a crucial point that he had missed out.\nHe could not help but fall into deep thoughts.\nJia Jin Sheng was thinking too, the image wall was no longer enough for him. Once he confirmed that the situation was real, he wanted to dig out the Flower Wine Monk’s inheritance from Fang Yuan.\nBut at this time, something unexpected to the two of them happened!\nThe image wall which was playing endlessly, suddenly changed its image.\nA gravely injured, pale bald Gu Master replaced the original video and appeared on the wall.\nHe weakly sprawled on the ground, his back facing the wall. His chest and limbs were deeply cut, but the strange thing was that his wounds did not bleed, as if his entire body’s blood had been drained out.\n“I am the Flower Wine Monk.” The bald Gu Master laughed, his expression distorted with madness, “Future person, no matter who you are, to endure this video and let it play for nearly one hundred days, it proves that you have no good will towards the Gu Yue family. Very well, you shall be my successor! My entire inheritance is yours, but I have a condition. You must exterminate the Gu Yue clan for me. Murder the entire clan and leave no one alive!”\nJia Jin Sheng was stunned on the spot, his face frozen with shock.\n“A Rank five powerhouse, the Flower Wine Monk’s inheritance!”\nHe was stunned, and for a moment his brains were churning and thinking.\n“My god! A Rank five powerhouse, what does that mean? Rank three is a family elder, Rank four is a village lord, and a Rank five is a mountain lord, able to rule over a mountain and do as he pleases! To think that in this tiny place, there is a Rank five Gu Master’s power inheritance.”\n“Wait, Flower Wine Monk is a demonic cultivator, so if I inherit his powers, is it inappropriate? No, strength has nothing to do with good or evil. The Flower Wine Monk wants his successor to destroy the Gu Yue clan, but do I really have to? He’s already dead, I just have to take his inheritance and ignore those issues.”\n“This is a godsend opportunity. Even with my D grade talent, if I inherit the Flower Wine Monk’s inheritance, I might be able to improve my talent. Those rare talent-raising Gu worms, they might be part of the inheritance. If I inherit this fortune and become a Rank four or five Gu Master, I’d be able to contest with Jia Fu!”\n“Wait! I almost forgot, there’s an outsider, what should I do?”\n“Should I split the inheritance with him? No, kill him! Only by killing him can I protect this secret. Yes, I should calm him down first, and lie that we’re going to split the treasure. Getting rid of his guard, then assaulting him and killing him here. This place is so hidden, it’s great. Even if I kill him, nobody would know.”\nAlthough he thought of all these, it was merely a moment in real life.\nHaving a plan, he squinted and revealed a fake smile.\nHe slowly turned around and faced Fang Yuan but just as he was about to speak, he saw two blue moonblades flying towards him.\nHis pupils dilated into the size of a pin; the distance was too small, he could not respond in time!\n“You......” His voice came to a halt.\nThe moonblade aimed accurately for his neck, and in an instant, his skull flew into the air, fresh blood pouring out like a fountain.\nAfter two seconds, his corpse plopped on the ground.\nThe scalding blood poured on the mountain walls, dyeing the withering vines red.\n“Don’t think so much when killing people.” Fang Yuan looked at the corpse plainly and then shifted his gaze towards the image wall.\n“To think there was such a twist here. How interesting,” He muttered as his eyes emitted an eerie glow.\n千里地狼蛛 - Thousand Li Earthwolf Spider, the Li here is chinese mile. A thousand li is 500 kilometers.",

      "content": "Chapter 47: Jia Jin Sheng, I actually did not want to kill you\nTranslator: Sigma Editor: Sigma\nThe rain crashed down heavily.\nGrey clouds covered the sky, and the continuous mountains far away blended into a mass of black ink.\nThe rain curtain interwove the heavens and earth together.\nCrack!\nThe sky flashed bright abruptly, and a bolt of lightning cut across the sky like a silver snake, then in an instant it was gone.\nSummer was approaching, and the end of spring’s heavy rain seemed to bring about a trace of the warmth of summer.\nOn Qing Mao Mountain, huge expanses of jade green spear bamboo stood tall and straight, resisting the winds and rain, the bodies of the bamboo straight like a spear as ever, the tips of the bamboo pointing towards the blue sky dome.\nIn the Gu Yue village, row upon row of innumerable tall-pillared houses endured against the great rain’s washing. Outside the village, the caravan had already set out on their journey once again.\n“The rain is heavy, take note of the pavement.”\n“Don’t fall behind, Gu Masters better pull your Gu properly, especially the fat beetle, don’t block the mountain road anymore!”\n“You bunch of mortal martial fighters, better open your eyes wide and pay careful attention. Lose a single thing and you’ll be paying for that!”\nThere was an endless stream of shouts rising and falling in succession from the merchant caravans.\nAfter stopping over at the Gu Yue village for three days, it was time for this merchant caravan to leave the place and follow the mountain path through Qing Mao Mountain and head for their next destination.\nThe heavy rain cleansed the heaven and earth, and the roads surrounding the village were paved with cobblestone, this was still alright. However after around five hundred meters the roads would turn into a muddy and narrow mountain path.\nThe head of the proud ostrich chicken was drooping, its colourful rainbow feathers soaking wet under the rain, sticking into clumps, becoming the example of a drenched and bedraggled chicken.\nThe fat beetle worm moved its fat huge body, walking extremely slow forward. The rainwater beat upon its black armor, forming streams of water flow, sliding down both sides of its body onto the earth.\nThe shaggy mountain spider was also drenched, and its green-black coloured fur were adhered together.\nOn the contrary, the toad Gu were happily calling out, carrying out the load and Gu Masters, hopping forward on the mountain. And the winged snake had already put away its wings, the thick snake’s body cheerfully travelling on the muddy water.\nTo protect the goods and prevent them from getting drenched wet by the rainwater, the Gu Masters were showing their magical abilities at the moment.\nOn a few enormous fat beetles stood Gu Masters in the middle. Their two hands were raised high, each of them having a One-stretch Golden Light Worm floating in midair one inch away from their palms.\nThe green copper primeval essence was like stream evaporating as it concentrated into the One-stretch Golden Light Worm’s bodies. The entire Gu flashed like a golden bean, acting as the heart, supporting a tremendous faint gold coloured bubble dome.\nThe hemisphere-shaped bubble dome had a rather huge scope. It was able to completely cover one fat beetle worm and still have some leftover space.\nAs the rain smashed upon the bubble dome, it would bounce away, just like hitting on an umbrella. However this sort of One-stretch Golden Light Worm continuously consumed primeval essence, and in the long run the Rank one Gu Masters would not be able to take it anymore.\nAs expected, after a while, a Gu Master shouted: “No more, my primeval essence is almost exhausted, who can take over?”\n“I can!” Almost simultaneously, a Gu Master rushed forward and replaced his position.\nA few Gu Masters pulling the carriages or riding the mountain spiders activated the Green Silk Gu in their bodies.\nUnder its influence, their hair started to grow furiously.\nA normal person’s hair had at least one hundred thousand strands. A hundred thousand strands of hair, each being five to six metres, intertwining and covering the Gu Master’s body along with the steed, formed an impenetrable hair raincoat.\nThe Green Silk Gu was a Rank one Gu worm, often used for defense. It uses 30% of green copper primeval essence to activate, and was not a continuous expenditure type like the One-stretch Golden Light Worm.\nThis Green Silk Gu can be combined with the Rank one Black Boar Gu to become the Rank two Black Mane Gu.\nThe Black Mane Gu when activated would not only involve hair on the head, but also hair on all the pores. Within a few seconds, the Gu Master’s body would gain a black mane protective armor.\nThe Black Mane Gu’s advancement path was the Rank three famous Gu, Steel Mane Gu.\nOther than the One-stretch Golden Light Worm and Green Silk Gu, many of the caravan Gu Masters also chose the Water Spider Gu. It can be seen that there was a thin layer of blue raincoat on their bodies.\nOn the raincoat’s surface, the water circulated randomly. As the raindrops hit onto the raincoat, it would immediately become part of the raincoat.\nSince the Gu Masters were continuously soaking under the rain, the raincoat on their bodies would grow thicker. Every now and then the Gu Masters would have to urge the Water Spider Gu and discharge away the excess water. At this moment the thick raincoats would be reduced to the original thin layer.\nAs for those mortal warriors, they were constantly on the move, watching over the goods on the muddy road. Most of them wore raincoats made of straw, but in their rush and confusion the straw raincoats had limited effect from avoiding the rain, so they were already drenched wet by the rainwater.\n“This accursed weather!” The warriors cursed in their hearts.\nIn the rainy weather, the mountain trail becomes even harder to walk on.\nUnder this weather, martial artists might be strong physically but they are still mortals. Once their bodies are drenched by rain and coupled with intensive labour, they would easily catch a cold. Getting a serious illness was the lightest consequence, perhaps they might catch repercussions, and if they catch a certain tough disease, it might cause them to get gravely ill and abandoned on the trip itself.\nIf they encounter slippery roads on the mountain trails, or encounter wild beasts and Gu worms’ attacks, they might lose their lives.\nThe caravan may be big, and have many Gu Masters. But every time they went on a journey, there would always be a great decrease in numbers. Mortal martial artists die the most, while Gu Masters also have injuries and casualties.\nIf the caravan was unlucky enough to encounter large-scale migrating beasts, they might even get wiped out completely.\nOther than natural disasters, there were also human-caused problems. Among the villages, there might be those who do not welcome the caravan. Some villages like to rob the outsiders.\n“We’re leaving, see you next year!” Some of the Gu Masters sat on the Gu worms and turned their bodies to bid farewell.\nAt the entrance of the village, many people gathered as they sent the caravan off with their gazes.\n“You must come again next year!” Reluctant to see them depart, the children shouted loudly.\nThe adults had more complicated expressions.\n“The road ahead is unforeseen. In these hard times, for those who are able to come to the village next year, how many would still be familiar faces?”\n“Be it at the merchant caravan or in the village, it is not easy to earn a living.”\nAs the caravan left further and further, as the crowd dispersed.\nThe cheerful and lighthearted market atmosphere had also subsequently disappeared. The original spot that had erected tents and shops was left now with a huge mess. The grass turf had been walked upon continuously by the crowd, grassroots and mud soil trampled out. The rainwater hit on its surface, immediately forming mud and numerous little pot-holes that collected muddy water. In addition to that, there was a lot of garbage left over.\nFang Yuan stood on a secluded hillside, watching the merchant caravan from far away alone. The merchant caravan was like a fat and colourful flower python, snaking through the narrow mountain road under the grey heavy rain, slowly entering the dense mountain forest.\n“Ah, the heavens are sending their blessings...” Fang Yuan sighed lightly.\nHe held a butter yellow paper umbrella, quietly standing in the rain.\nFang Yuan wore the most plain flax cloth garment, his body slim, his skin bringing about the pale whiteness of a fifteen year old teenager, a settled clump of clean and short black hair atop his head. The ends of his hair trembled slightly in the wind under his umbrella.\nWhile others curse the weather, he was lamenting the timely appearance of the rain.\nHe killed Jia Jin Sheng last night and cleaned up the scene, but because it happened so unexpectedly, there was bound to be areas of neglect. Especially with the bloody smell, because the cave is not ventilated, the smell could not disperse easily.\nWith this rain, it cleaned up the air and environment, greatly reducing the chances of getting exposed by smell tracking methods. The crack was bound to have a small cascade of water flowing down, and once the fresh water vapour diluted the air, he would not be exposed for the short time being.\nOf course, once time passes, the chance of getting exposed increases.\nIn this world there were all sorts of Gu worms, and investigative methods were abundant, even Fang Yuan only knew a portion of them.\nThe rain produced pitter patter sounds as it hit on the yellow umbrella. Then following the shape of the umbrella, streams of water flowed down onto the limestones beneath Fang Yuan’s feet, hitting and creating splashes.\nSeeing the caravan curve into a corner, completely disappearing into the forests, Fang Yuan did not show a sign of relief, but instead looked grim.\n“Although Jia Jin Sheng’s cultivation was weak and had little talent, he had a special status. The caravan’s people are all busy with business, thus no one found out that he’s missing. But once some time passes, it’d definitely be found out. By then, Jia Fu would return to investigate, and the real challenge would be then.”\n“The Jia family head intentionally arranged Jia Jin Sheng and Jia Fu to be on the same caravan, he had deep intentions. In terms of cultivation, they are worlds apart. In terms of cunningness, they’re also incomparable. Such an arrangement is to inflict a blow to Jia Jin Sheng and let him be clear of reality, and live life peacefully. At the same time he is testing Jia Fu’s nature, for if he is too overbearing on Jia Jin Sheng, how can he hand the position of clan head to him?”\n“Jia Jin Sheng never truly understood his father’s intentions. Although he had some intelligence, he only managed to scratch the surface of a merchant’s wits, what a pity. A pity of such a good pawn piece.”\nFang Yuan felt regrettable in his heart. With five hundred years of experience, he could easily see past the surface and understand the true nature of the situation.\nWhen he saw the dispute between the two that night, he could tell the complicated relationship between Jia Jin Sheng and Jia Fu, and thus he had a vague plan formed in his heart from then on.\nIn his plan, Jia Jin Sheng was a very suitable pawn. His cultivation was weak but he held a high position in the caravan, and although he had some wits, he had little experience, thus Fang Yuan could easily manipulate him.\nOnce controlled, this pawn would be extremely useful.\nFor one, he could build a strong network of smuggling through his relationship, preparing up for usurping treasures from future killings.\nSecondly, Fang Yuan could hide in the background and use the image wall to stir up conflict among the Qing Mao mountain’s three families, causing a civil war and enabling him to be able to reap the rewards.\nThirdly, Fang Yuan could rely on him to make his way into the Jia family interior. The future Jia family dispute caused a large scale Gu fighting competition, it will be a huge affair with lots of benefits to gain. Fang Yuan could make use of this to acquire the greatest reward for himself.\n“My cultivation is still too low, restraining me greatly in doing things. If there was a pawn for me to use, I can do some things that I cannot attempt myself, it is not only convenient but also lowers the risk of doing so. If I get exposed, I can simply discard the pawn and stay safe myself.”\n“The surrounding people know the situation well and are loyal to the family, thus they aren’t good to manipulate. Only an outsider like Jia Jin Sheng can be used more efficiently to execute my plans. Unfortunately, I did not expect the Flower Wine Monk to leave behind his power inheritance.”\nThe Flower Wine Monk is a Rank five Gu Master, his inheritance is definitely more valuable than this pawn.\nOf course, it’d be good if he could get the best of both worlds, but in face of such treasure, Jia Jin Sheng could not longer be controlled, thus he had to be discarded.\n“Nothing will go smoothly forever in this world.” Fang Yuan sighed and shook his head.\nThe Flower Wine Monk’s inheritance appeared and disrupted Fang Yuan’s original plans. In addition, after the changes to the image wall, the videos and images were all gone, only showing a line written in blood, telling Fang Yuan to destroy the image wall and reveal a cavern entrance. Following the trail, he would be able to get the inheritance.\nThe blood writing only appeared for a few breaths before vanishing, and the image wall also turned back into the most ordinary mountain wall.\nFang Yuan spent the entire night cleaning up the murder scene, and had no time to break the wall.\n“Killing Jia Jin Sheng in a hurry, this would leave many problems for me in the future, and I am but only temporarily safe. Although I succeeded in getting rid of the evidence, there is bound to be trouble coming for me in the future. In this case, I would have to change my way of exposing the Liquor worm. I cannot go to the secret cave behind the wall crack either. I have to stay in the mountain village for some time to anticipate investigation in the near future.”\nFang Yuan turned around and held his umbrella, walking in the rain towards the village.\n“But this is fine too. I can spend a large amount of primeval stones during this period to refine to middle stage primeval essence. Using it, I can nurture my aperture and break through into the middle stage. Once I reached the middle stage, my power will double, allowing me to get the inheritance more easily and with greater confidence.”\nA demonic cultivator’s inheritance was not as mild and gentle as a righteous cultivator’s, for there was often dangerous tests and tasks, and if one cannot get through, they’d have to pay the price with their life.\n“The world is hard to predict, but it is precisely this that makes it interesting.” Fang Yuan smiled coldly.\nThe green mountain beneath the heavy rain extended continuously and unending, its green mixed with grey, appearing stifling and heavy.\nA gust of wind blew, and the raindrops inclined a little, hitting onto Fang Yuan’s shoulder and attacking him with a burst of chilliness.\nHe thought about Jia Jin Sheng again.\nSighing in his heart, he thought, “Jia Jin Sheng, actually I... did not want to kill you.”\nWhat a waste of a good pawn.",

      "content": "Chapter 48: A little cute\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nIt rained for four days before stopping.\nThe sun rose high into the sky, tearing away the rain curtain, seemingly like it was unveiling summer itself.\nThe breath of summer had faintly started to come around.\nThe weather became increasingly sunny and cloudless, sweeping away the sentimental breath of spring, and the temperatures slowly rose.\nIn the night of spring, the lively Dragonpill crickets had retreated, cowering away into the deep ground to lay eggs. The green spear bamboo specially found on Qing Mao Mountain had started to grow wildly, and nearly everyday it would show an obvious increase in height.\nThe grass and the trees began to change from emerald green into a dark green colour. The neverending green mountains started to look even more verdant and lush.\nThe weather was clear for thousands of miles, blue like a crystal.\nBang, bang, bang.\nAt the training grounds in the academy, sounds of punches and kicks could be heard.\nAfter exchanging over ten blows, Gu Yue Mo Bei was kicked in the abdomen by Fang Yuan, taking five to six steps backwards, leaving the designated circle drawn in the arena.\nThe martial arts instructor stood before the stage and evaluated the situation. Seeing this, he immediately declared, \"Gu Yue Mo Bei has exited the stage, Gu Yue Fang Yuan wins for the 33rd consecutive time!\"\n\"Hmph, I lost to you again.\" Gu Yue Mo Bei gritted his teeth, his eyes staring right at Fang Yuan, \"But don’t be arrogant. One day, I will defeat you. I can already feel it, that day is nearing!\"\nFang Yuan looked at him expressionlessly, and then his eyelids drooped downwards. \"That kick earlier caused you to have internal bleeding. I’d advise you to treat that injury first.\"\n\"This small injury is nothing!\" Gu Yue Mo Bei was retorting halfway, when suddenly his expression changed and his throat gulped, vomiting a mouthful of blood.\nHis face was pale, this was the first time he suffered this level of injury! His eyes could not help but show signs of fear.\nThe martial arts instructor hurried over and pacified him. \"Don’t worry about this level of injury, you just need to rest for a few days. Just stop practising your punches and do not do vigorous exercises during this period.\"\nThe moment he finished saying so, two healing Gu Masters who were waiting outside rushed over and meticulously helped Gu Yue Mo Bei out.\nGu Yue Mo Bei did not dare to say anything else, but he looked at Fang Yuan deeply in his eyes, filled with anger, hatred, regret and indignance.\n\"Mo Bei has good martial techniques, but he couldn’t beat Fang Yuan.\"\n\"Fang Yuan is too good, basically no one can beat him!\"\n\"Mo Bei actually vomited blood, how scary. I don’t want to fight a guy like this.\"\n\"Sigh, but the instructor said today is practice combat, up on the arena! Each of us needs to go up and fight once.\"\nThe students stood outside the arena, some looking towards Fang Yuan in fear, some sighing non-stop, some were pale while others felt trepidation.\nAmong them, some were injured. A few held their bruised faces, some held their limbs, gasping for breath. Others laid on the ground, rubbing their thigh.\n\"Next!\" Seeing that there were no challengers coming up, the instructor yelled.\nHowever, no one answered. Usually those who were courageous to challenge Fang Yuan were only Gu Yue Mo Bei, Gu Yue Chi Chen and Gu Yue Fang Zheng. But these three were already beaten.\nSilence swept across the students as others even retracted their steps slightly. The instructor frowned on seeing their fearful expression.\nHe could not help but think of the academy elder’s words: \"These days, Fang Yuan has gotten too dominant, we have to suppress him. The other students cannot even raise their heads under his pressure, and if this goes on, the courage in their hearts will be simmered. Our academy nurtures courageous tigers and wolves to fight enemies, not fearful sheeps and lambs.\"\n\"What’s wrong with all of you? No matter how strong he is, Fang Yuan is only fifteen years old, he’s one of your peers! He has the same age as you, eats the same food as you and drinks the same water. He does not have three heads or six arms, he’s not a monster! Pluck up your courage and show me the pride of the Gu Yue clan within you!\" The instructor yelled, trying his best to motivate the students.\n\"But he is too strong, we cannot beat him.\"\n\"The classmates who fought him are in such a pitiful state. Mo Bei got beaten until he vomited blood.\"\n\"Fang Yuan is getting more ruthless with his strikes, instructor, we do not dare to fight him.\"\nThe students spoke softly, weakly retorting.\nThe instructor was stomping with anger. These ignorant youngsters!\nHe was clear as a bystander. Fang Yuan had gone through thirty-three consecutive fights without any rest in the middle. Although he was constantly adjusting his breathing, his stamina had already depleted.\nFang Yuan’s attacks getting merciless proves this fact even further: He could no longer take it easy like before, he is losing control of his strength and the situation.\nIf someone tries harder, his fatigue will be revealed. With just a few more people, he could be defeated on the stage!\nOnce Fang Yuan is beaten, his dominating presence will be reduced sharply, the students courage ignited and the motive to suppress Fang Yuan achieved.\nBut now, the students were deterred by Fang Yuan’s tough front.\nAt times, what defeats a person is not a strong enemy but one’s own heart.\nThe instructor was anxious in his thoughts, and continued to motivate them.\nBut he was not good with his words. In the beginning he said these same words to ignite the hot-bloodedness in the youngsters and stirred up some challengers. But now that he had said this so many times, the youngsters are all numb already.\nFang Yuan folded his arms and stared at this coldly. Although he was standing in the center of the stage, he was acting like a complete bystander.\nThe instructor encouraged for ages but the students were still looking at each others, not one had moved.\nThe martial instructor could not help but be angry and helpless. He turned to Fang Yuan, unhappily chiding, \"Fang Yuan, you’re also at fault. Your blows are getting more vicious among classmates, you should be more gentle and friendly, how can you deal such vicious blows? Be careful from now on and attack carefully. If you cause another classmate to vomit blood, I will declare your loss and evict you from the stage!\"\n\"Instructor, you are wrong.\"\nFang Yuan snorted, his gaze not showing any weakness, looking right at the instructor, \"Practising and fighting, we naturally have to give it our all, otherwise how can it achieve the aim of training? Don’t tell me that when we are in battle, we also have to request our enemies to be more gentle and friendly?\"\nThe instructor flew into a rage, \"Hmph, your attacks are vicious, you are harming your classmates and you dare to use twisted logic!\"\n\"Instructor, you’re wrong again.\"\nFang Yuan laughed coldly, \"You arranged this practice match and raised the winning prize to twenty primeval stones. Without your encouragement, would these people have gotten hurt?\"\n\"Bastard!\" The martial arts instructor was not good with words, and he pointed at Fang Yuan and scowled, \"Do you still want the prize or not? If you argue any further, even if you get first place, I will declare you a loser! You are so uncooperative and antisocial, and you dare to argue with your teachers, you have no rights to claim the twenty primeval stones as reward!\"\nFang Yuan laughed heartily. \"It is but a competition that merely gives twenty primeval stones, do you think I give a damn?\"\nSaying so, he turned around and left. Under the class’ distraught gaze, he walked out of the center of arena.\nAlthough he did not manage to sell the image wall, Fang Yuan still had several hundreds of primeval stones in his possession. Furthermore, his aim this time was not primeval stones.\n\"You!\" Seeing Fang Yuan really walking down the stage, the instructor was stunned without words, showing an expression of shock and confusion.\nA fifteen year old teenager, shouldn’t he be competitive and full of vigor?\nFang Yuan having such fighting talents, shouldn’t his character be even more so? How could he just back out of the competition like this?\nFurthermore, Fang Yuan has no background, he should be tight on primeval stones. Why was the twenty primeval stones unable to attract him?\nAt this point, the martial arts instructor stood on the spot, unsure of what to do.\nFang Yuan did not step into the trap, but left the stage immediately.\nThe instructor suddenly realized: There was nothing he could do to Fang Yuan. With his status, he could not find problems with Fang Yuan directly, and force him onto the stage right?\nThe surrounding students retreated, maintaining a distance away from Fang Yuan. Fang Yuan stood on the grounds, with no one around him. With him as the center, the radius of five steps around him became a vacuum.\nWhat a pity.\nIf they were beside Fang Yuan, they would hear Fang Yuan’s panting sound.\n\"My stamina is depleted,\" Fang Yuan sighed. Although he showed an energetic outward appearance, under his clothes, his body was slightly shivering.\nAfter all, he was only fifteen years old and had no relevant Gu worm as support. After thirty-three matches, he was close to his limits.\nAlthough he had his rich fighting experience from his past life, during this time, the other youngsters’ combat abilities had improved significantly. From them, Fang Yuan could already feel a strengthening sense of pressure.\nThis kind of pressure reflected in Fang Yuan’s attacks. His attacks got tougher as he gradually lost control of his strength. Compared to the past, when they were still too weak and he could defeat them easily, the youngsters would only end up in minor injuries. But now, his control over the arena was getting weaker, thus he had to strike harder to maintain his image.\n\"Experience is, after all, not omnipotent. Any thoughts or technique require a body with sufficient foundation before the value can be apparent.\" Fang Yuan narrowed his eyes. In actuality he had long seen through the martial instructor’s thoughts.\nFang Yuan was not surprised, as if he had expected this from the start, the academy elder’s pressure on him.\nAfter he killed Gao Wan, the people who dared to challenge him diminished. When he extorted them, even more people oppressed by Fang Yuan’s dominance did not dare resist, and they obediently handed over their primeval stones.\nAfter a long period, Fang Yuan’s unbeatable image would be formed. This would leave some psychological trauma in the youngsters and make them unconfident in their martial arts techniques. This was what the academy elder did not want to see. He needed Fang Yuan to motivate and force the students to improve, not to completely extinguish their passion for battle.\nHe wanted to see Fang Yuan’s defeat.\nOnce Fang Yuan was defeated, the image of invincibility that he had erected would be instantly destroyed.\nAt the same time, it would awaken the students’ fighting spirit. After some setbacks, it would mould their wills to be indomitable.\nBut to Fang Yuan, he needed this form of pressure so that he could extort primeval stones with greater ease.\nIf he was defeated, the youngsters would realize his weakness and attack together at once. Although Fang Yuan had ample of primeval stones in his hands, extortion was his main source of income. Without this source, he would be digging into his reserves.\nThus, Fang Yuan’s appearance in the arena and thirty-three consecutive victories was merely to maintain his deterrence towards the students, and not for the twenty primeval stones reward.\nIf he avoided combat from the start, it would show his weakness, and if it raged on, he would expose his weakness.\n\"What are you all waiting for, why is nobody getting up on the stage, go on! The first prize is twenty primeval stones, you all don’t want it anymore?\" The instructor yelled after snapping out of his thoughts.\nThe rest of the students began to get motivated.\nFang Yuan had already left the stage, and to them, it was a huge rock off their minds.\n\"I’ll go!\"\n\"I’ll come!\"\nTwo youngsters squeezed their way up the stage and began to spar.\n\"Sigh, if I had known this, I would have waited and not rushed up the stage. Then I would not have been throw off the stage by Fang Yuan.\"\n\"What a pity, to think Fang Yuan left.\"\n\"He’s really daring, see even the instructor is at a lost for what to do with him.\"\nHearing their whispers, the instructor felt his reputation crumbling. He was extremely agitated in his heart and wanted to punish Fang Yuan thoroughly. However, Fang Yuan had done nothing wrong, and leaving the stage on his own accord was allowed.\nThe instructor was both helpless and moody. Finally he looked at Fang Yuan and stared angrily at the latter.\nFang Yuan’s lips slightly curled up into an angle as he thought, \"Such boorish methods, this instructor is a little cute.\"",

      "content": "Chapter 49: Not afraid of Fang Yuan breaking out of their grasp\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nA pair of solemn eyes were staring at the faraway training grounds.\nThe academy elder stood at the window of the third storey, looking at everything that had transpired at the arena.\nHe frowned deeply.\nThe instant Fang Yuan left the stage, he felt a sense of peculiarity in his heart, not expecting Fang Yuan to do this.\n\"This lad, he is rather hard to catch. He is proficient in the academy’s rules, and normally will not commit any wrongdoings. Although he sleeps in class, once he is asked a question he can answer properly, leaving others with no flaws to pick on. Trying to get ahold of a weakness of his to suppress his dominance is going to be difficult.\"\nThe academy elder could not help but develop a faint sense of loathing towards Fang Yuan.\nAs a teacher, he naturally liked obedient and smart students, and hated those naughty students who did not obey the rules.\nBut being the academy elder for so many years, his experience was extremely rich, he had seen many different types of students. Among them he had seen extremely obedient ones who followed orders without question. There were also those who caused problems day and night, constantly breaking the rules.\nHis heart had already become still as water, impartial to all. At the same time, he carved the phrase \"as a teacher, one must treat all students fairly\" onto the right corner of his desk, treating it as his motto.\nHe had never felt such disgust for a student.\nFeeling that sense of detest in his heart, the academy elder was also slightly shocked.\nIn previous years, even towards the most naughty students, he was able to handle it with a big heart, tolerating their actions. But when it came to Fang Yuan, why did he lose this sense of impartialness?\nHe thought about it again and again, and finally realized the reason.\nThis lad called Fang Yuan, he had a form of arrogance in his blood!\nIt seemed from the fundamentals that Fang Yuan did not respect his teachers for their status. Towards the martial arts instructor earlier, he not only disobeyed him, but even rebuked him in public.\nActually, such cases of retorting against teachers were commonly seen in previous years. However, those kids always had an agitated state of mind. They were either rebellious, furious or stubborn, etc.\nThe academy elder was clear that the more agitated the youngsters were, the more it implied that they were fearful in their hearts.\nBut Fang Yuan was not.\nHe had no fear in his heart at all, as if he had seen through the tricks of the academy.\nHis expression was aloof, and even after he left the stage, his expression showed no signs of changing, as if he had done something insignificant.\nYes, he treated the matter of disobeying his teachers as a trivial matter that was insignificant!\nIn simple terms -------\nHe was not afraid.\nIt was just this point that caused the academy elder to already feel unhappy, developing a sense of disgust for him.\nThe academy elder could endure a student more rebellious than Fang Yuan, or a teenager ten times naughtier than him. That was because these students knew fear and were moving based on their agitated emotions.\nAs long as they were fearful, as long as they were impulsive, they would be easily manipulated and will not go out of control.\nBut Fang Yuan was not.\nHe was calm and uncaring, not treating his teachers with reverence.\nHe was not respectful!\nSomeone who has no reverence for the clan, even if they are nurtured, how can they be useful for the clan?\n\"Once they appear, this sort of person, they have to be suppressed, they must be suppressed! Otherwise, his existence will create a sense of irresistibility in the students. In the long run, it will affect the others, causing them to lose their reverence for their teachers, and as the academy, how else are we going to manage the students?\"\nThe academy elder squinted his eyes, making up the decision in his mind.\nBut then, his face showed a troubled expression very quickly.\nHow was he going to suppress Fang Yuan?\nFang Yuan had done nothing wrong, there was no weakness that he could exploit.\nFang Yuan’s cunning demeanour gave him a sense of helplessness. He had never met a student like this, one who was so familiar with the academy’s rules and regulations.\nAs the academy elder, he was always impartial to all students. He could not be like a slum gangster and purposely find trouble with a youngster like Fang Yuan.\nHe had placed his hopes on the martial arts instructor, but now he was deeply disappointed.\n\"It seems that to suppress Fang Yuan’s domination, we can only wait until all the other students advance to Rank one middle stage.\"\nA Gu Master’s advancement is mostly influenced by their talents.\nWith his rich experience as the academy elder, he had calculated before in his heart: the ones who had the greatest chance to advance first are Gu Yue Fang Zheng, Chi Chen and Mo Bei.\nThey were an A rank and two B grades respectively, and with their elders’ help behind them, they had no lack of primeval stones. No matter which one of the three, they were mostly likely to be the first to advance to Rank one middle stage cultivation.\n\"Gu Yue Fang Zheng, Chi Chen and Mo Bei, these three are our hopeful seeds this season.\" The academy elder looked at the arena and sighed.\nWith his experienced gaze, he could tell: in the arena, although the students seem to be standing casually, they had subtly already split into three factions.\nIn one circle was Gu Yue Chi Chen and a bunch of similarly-aged clansmen, all crowding around him.\nThe second circle’s core was Gu Yue Fang Zheng, and the clan leader’s faction’s younger generation were subtly supporting this A grade talent genius.\nThe third circle was led by Gu Yue Mo Bei. He had already been treated of his internal injury and stood on the arena with a pale face. The classmates beside him were asking him about his condition.\n\"This is the meaning of letting them compete with each other.\" Seeing the three factions, the academy elder was overjoyed and laughed.\nAllowing the students free reign to compete, this was not just to nurture their battle senses, but also to prematurely choose the leader-type characters.\nIn past seasons, they had to wait until the end of the year to have the capacity to develop their own circles. But in this year, because of Fang Yuan’s appearance, his extortion had brought forth the divergence much faster.\nAgainst Fang Yuan, the only ones who dared to compete against him were Fang Zheng, Mo Bei and Chi Chen.\nAfter a long time under imperceptible influence, the other youngsters would automatically regard these three as the leaders.\nAs long as there were no mishaps, these three social circles would be the layout of the future family’s higher-ups.\n\"But these factions are still not stable. Within them, there are still students moving around. Once the three take the lead and advance to the middle stage first, I will give them the positions of class chairman and vice chairman. With that differentiation, they would gain authority, and this will strengthen their social circles,\" the academy elder thought.\nOf course, there was someone not within either factions.\nJust one person, and that was Fang Yuan.\nGetting close to stronger people is human nature. In fact, although Fang Yuan extorted the students and acted against the students, there were a number of youngsters who wanted to attach themselves to him.\nHowever, they were rejected by Fang Yuan. To him, only those who were useful were pawns, and these youngsters had too little value.\nThis was also another reason the academy elder hated Fang Yuan. He was too antisocial, not willing to integrate into the team. To such people like him, the clan’s control over them was not as much as the other youngsters.\nThe academy elder’s gaze once again shot towards Fang Yuan in the arena.\nFang Yuan stood alone at one corner with his hands behind his back, his eyelids slightly closed, allowing the students to fight for their prize. Even with the heated competition, his expression did not change the slightest.\nHis surrounding was vacant, no youngster was willing to stand with him.\nVery evidently, he also did not wish for these people to be near him.\nFang Yuan stood there alone, enshrouded in loneliness.\nHe floated outside the factions.\n\"But I don’t have to be too worried. This Fang Yuan is still young and can be changed slowly.\" The academy elder’s gaze shone and he thought deeply.\n\"Next up will be the establishment of the class chairman and vice chairman. A year later, we will split into groups, creating team leaders and assistant leaders. Every academic year also has all sorts of honor and rewards, like the Small Redflower Award, Blue Neckcloth Prize and Five Outstanding Student Prize. He wants to cultivate so he needs resources, thus he has to compete for these positions and prizes. As time passes, with interaction among the students, he is bound to have kinship, friendship and love as his restraints. I don’t have to worry about him going beyond the clan’s control.\"\nThese years, the academy elder had gradually understood something.\nWhen a new clan member is born, they would be brainwashed by the clan.\nFirst, they would be taught the clan’s utmost value system. Next they would go into moral education and learn about the beauty and importance of kinship, friendship, love.\nAfter that, they would be taught honor, and in the process of growing up, many resources such as prizes would be used to attract them. Using the family’s assigned roles, they would choose and recruit the most loyal clansmen into their factions.\nDo not look down on the small roles like chairman or vice chairman, for once they become one of these roles, they would be part of the clan’s administration.\nUnder such a system with constant influence, on one hand it brings about the benefits of having authority and the sweetness of power, while on the other hand, it brings the problem of detaching from the system. A carrot in hand and a stick in the other, who can break away from this system?\nEven the wildest of people or the most lonesome ones would gradually become a part of the family. One without loyalty would also be nurtured into one with loyalty. Without kinship, friendship or love, they would still be developed.\nThis is the power of the system.\nThis is the power of rules.\nThis is the clan’s way of survival!",

      "content": "Chapter 50: Middle Stage!\nTranslator: Skyfarrow Editor: Skyfarrow\nNightfall arrived. The moon was like a silver plate, appearing among the clouds. The thinly spread stars decorated the surroundings.\nGu Yue Mo Bei stood in the courtyard, raising his head up, his eyes glistening under the reflection of the moon.\n\"Little brother, I heard you got injured today.\" Behind him, his sister Gu Yue Mo Yan’s voice resounded.\n\"Sister, you are worried that after being beaten till I vomited blood today, I would have long lasting trauma?\" Mo bei turned around and curled his lips.\nSeeing her brother laughing, Mo Yan’s heart felt at ease. Although she had truly worried, she said instead, \"No way, big sis here understands you best. Good brother, you have an indomitable will, the future head of our Mo family. How can you be frightened off by such a small injury?\"\n\"Hehehe, I knew sister doted on me the most,\" Mo Bei scratched the back of his head as he laughed sheepishly.\n\"You know what, sister?\" Under the glow of the moonlight, this fifteen year old teenager’s eyes radiated brightly. \"Although I failed this time, I heard Fang Yuan panting during the match. Back then he easily beaten me in two or three strikes with an calm and composed manner. But his gasping already revealed his weakness. He is definitely not as strong as everyone else thinks. One day, I will defeat him fair and square.\"\n\"Good, as expected of a good man from my Mo bloodline!\" Mo Yan laughed, patting her brother’s head, showing concern on her face, \"However, you suffered internal injuries, so please don’t practise your martial arts these few days.\"\n\"Don’t touch my head sister, I am already old enough.\" Mo Bei shrugged his head, using an unhappy tone, \"I understand what you are saying, I have a plan. These few days, I’m going to nurture my aperture walls. To completely breakthrough from initial stage to middle stage and obtain the position of class chairman, and suppress Fang Yuan’s dominance. I’ll let him know that, what truly matters to a Gu Master’s cultivation is still talent!\"\n\"I’m glad you can think this way. I was only a vice chairman last time. If you manage to become chairman, it will fulfill my regrets too.\"\n\"Don’t worry sister. The position of chairman, I certainly must obtain it!\"\nAt the same time, in the Chi family.\nInside the secret room, there was only one torch, attached to an opening in the limestone walls.\nThe flame burned on, illuminating this small room.\nOne of the two elders in power, Gu Yue Chi Lian, was sitting facing his grandson, Gu Yue Chi Cheng. The two sat on a praying mat with their shadows projected on the ground, wavering with the flickering of the flame.\nGu Yue Chi Lian stretched out his hand, using his palm to touch Chi Cheng’s abdomen area.\nGu Yue Chi Chen’s face was full of anxiety, his mind entering his aperture, suppressing the ripples in his primeval sea with all his concentration.\nIn this world, there are no two identical tree leaves. Similarly to Gu Masters, there is no identical primeval essence as well.\nOnce primeval essence from an external source enters the aperture, it will result in the natural resistance of the original primeval essence in the aperture.\nIf Gu Yue Chi Cheng does not suppress it, and instead allows the his primeval essence to resist, it will result in a clash between the essences. Such intensive reaction can cause great damage to the aperture.\nThe aperture’s primeval sea is the foundation and roots of a Gu Master’s cultivation, and is of utmost importance.\nOnce the aperture is damaged, at the very least one’s cultivation may lower, but if it is severe, their latent talent may be lowered as well. Once the aperture is completely shattered, the Gu Master would die immediately.\nAfter a while, Gu Yue Chi Lian gradually stopped transmitting his primeval essence, slowly taking back his hand.\nGu Yue Chi Cheng took a deep breath of relief, his tense body relaxing. \"Thank you Grandfather, for nurturing my aperture and transfusing primeval essence to me every three days. It has been hard on you!\"\nGu Yue Chi Lian’s forehead was full of sweat, and he sighed and said, \"This is inevitable. Your talent is only C grade, so if we rely on your ability alone to rise to middle stage, it’ll take a long time. The time will usually be twice of a B grade, and four times of an A grade. In such a situation, your talent will be exposed. Thus, even if this method is dangerous, we have to use it.\"\n\"Grandson understands grandfather’s intentions.\"\n\"As long as you understand.\" The old man sighed, \"This method also has another sequela. After your aperture has been nurtured by my silver primeval essence, although the silver primeval essence has a greater effect, it is still an external source of primeval essence to you. Henceforth, even if your aperture walls change from a light wall to a water wall, it would still be mixed with my energy. The more external energy there is, the more impure your aperture will be, and this will stifle your talent, limiting your development in the future.\"\nGu Yue Chi Cheng bit his lips, \"Grandfather, for the future of the Chi family, I am willing to sacrifice my future prospects!\"\nGu Yue Chi Lian was pleased, stroking his beard. \"It is good that you have such thoughts. But the heavens always leave a glimmer of hope for you, for you are not hopeless yet. If we can find the Cleansing Water Gu, it will be able to cleanse your aperture walls and flush out all the external energies in your aperture sea, removing this sequela.\"\n\"In addition, I have also used my relationships to search for a Liquor worm for you. This worm is able to help a Rank one Gu Master refine their primeval essence and raise it by one small realm. In this way the primeval essence that is refined will be your body’s own primeval essence and not an external one. Using this way to nurture your aperture leaves no repercussions and risks, it is a much better nurturing effect!\"\nGu Yue Chi Lian was overjoyed. \"Thank you grandfather!\"\n\"However, the Liquor worm is hard to find. Among the Rank one Gu worms, the Liquor worm, boar Gu, and Bookworm etc, are all extremely rare Gu. Once they appear in the market they would be snatched up immediately. Of course, there are also some Gu in this world that are rumored to change a Gu Master’s talent. But at this age, grandfather has never seen one, only hearing occasional rumors about them.\" The old man explained.\nThe night winds blew in gently from the windows and into the room.\nGu Yue Fang Zheng sat on his bed with his eyes shut, holding a primeval stone in both hands.\nThe green copper primeval sea was raging without any winds, the waves crashing towards the white aperture walls.\nHe has A grade rank talent, and his primeval essence occupied 80% of the aperture. His natural rate of recovery was twice of Fang Yuan!\nWith such godblessed advantage, he is already close to Rank one middle stage.\nPhew.\nA while later, Gu Yue Fang Zheng puffed out a breath of air and opened his eyes.\nThe moon was bright and stars sparse outside the window, the bluish green bamboo houses arranged in a line.\nA scene of peace and harmony.\n\"Time always flies when cultivating. In the blink of an eye, it is already late into the night,\" Fang Zheng muttered softly. He slowly opened his hands, and two piles of rock powder fell onto the floor in front of his bed.\nAfter a primeval stone’s essence had been fully retrieved, it would turn into a pile of powder.\nLooking at the powder pile, Fang Zheng frowned.\nHe took out his money bag; it was already close to empty.\nOpening it, he saw three primeval stones left inside.\nFang Zheng would retrieve three pieces every seven days from the academy as resources, but since Fang Yuan would snatch a piece from him, he only had two left every week.\nUncle and Aunt would also give him living expenses, but it was also three stones every seven days.\nJust with these primeval stones, how is it enough?\nFang Zheng was determined to surpass his brother Fang Yuan, thus he took the initiative to approach his uncle and aunt multiple times to beg for some primeval stones.\nAfter many times, his aunt would look for him to have a heart-to-heart chat, telling him about how poor the family was, and how they had cash flow difficulties, having no spare money left. Since then, Fang Zheng did not have the desire to continue asking.\n\"Father and mother are already doing all they can to support my cultivation. I cannot make things difficult for them and ask for more primeval stones. I only have three left. I can only be more thrifty. If I use one piece a day, I’ll have enough for three days.\"\n\"I have a feeling that in three or four days, I will definitely advance to middle stage! The only thing is, what is big brother’s progress now?\" Thinking so, Fang Zheng subconsciously looked towards to academy living quarters.\n\"I have A grade talent, while big brother only has C grade talent. His speed is definitely slower than me. Big brother is not my match this time! Big brother, I will let you know the true power of an A grade talent!\"\nThinking of this, Fang Zheng clenched his fists.\n......\nAcademy dormitory.\nFang Yuan’s door was shut tight.\nIn the darkness, he was not asleep, but sitting on his bed.\nA Gu Master’s cultivation cannot replace sleep. Normally at this time, Fang Yuan would already have fallen asleep.\nBut in cultivating earlier today, he already felt that he was just one step away from middle stage.\n\"I might as well not sleep tonight, I’ll rush straight for middle stage!\" His eyes shone with determination.\nSoon after, he shut his eyes and his mind went into the aperture.\n44% of green copper primeval sea. Just a moment ago, they were all refined into pale green coloured middle stage primeval essence by the liquor worm.\n\"Rise.\" With a thought, the peaceful green copper primeval sea began to stir.\nThe commotion got larger and larger, until waves were formed.\nSplash, splash, splash...\nThe tides raced against each other, rushing towards the surrounding aperture walls.\nLike crashing on a reef, most of the primeval essence would break into emerald ripples and fuse back into the sea.\nA small amount of primeval essence was expended, turning into a small hint of invisible energy, penetrating into the white coloured light aperture wall.\n\"Rise again,\" Fang Yuan thought as the emerald ripples became larger in scale. The waves earlier were like rabbits and dogs, but now they were like troops of horses, marching towards the aperture walls.\nA horse-like dragon, the waves like the heavens!\nThe primeval essence was expended quickly, and the water level fell sharply.\nSplash, splash, splash...\nThe waves struck relentlessly, finally resulting in a change. The white coloured wall shook suddenly, the originally mild white colour radiating an eye-piercing brilliance.\nSeeing this scene, Fang Yuan was overjoyed as he knew that the crucial part had arrived, and he quickly activated all of his primeval essence to rush at the walls.\nThe white light grew brighter, the light rays distorted and tangling together, giving people a feeling of thickness. After more than ten breaths, white strips of light bands appeared on the light wall, and the strips collided with each other like water flowing nonstop. In the process of collision, they continued to combine and merge, forming a white flowing light.\nFinally, the flowing light gathered into one piece and completely covered the light wall.\nThe white light dimmed, and the original white light wall of the aperture was gone, replaced by a layer of spherical shaped white water wall. The light wall’s surface was smooth with no impurities. The water wall however, was thicker than the light wall, the ripples of light flowing and flickering on it.\nThe primeval sea regained its peace, the aperture still having 20% primeval essence left.\n\"I advanced to middle stage!\" Fang Yuan laughed heartily, opening his eyes.\nThe bright sunlight creeped in through the openings in the curtains.\nUnknowingly, the night had passed, and it was already morning.",
